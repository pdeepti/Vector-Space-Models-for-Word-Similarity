program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 16.04.2007 optimism grows on outlook for german economy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : growth is looking stronger than it has in a long time the run of good news for the german economy , europe 's biggest , looks set to continue for some time , with bundesbank president axel weber arguing on monday that current growth marks only the beginning of a longer upturn . the bdi industry federation also upgraded its growth forecast for the current year to 2.5 percent from 2.0 percent previously , even if federation chief jürgen thumann warned the government not to become complacent . the prospect of faster growth in germany is likely to strengthen the european central bank 's arguments for further monetary tightening in the entire 13-country euro zone , analysts said . in an interview published in the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung on monday , bundesbank chief weber said the recent slew of favorable economic news coming from germany was only the beginning , hinting that the central bank might upgrade its growth forecast for the current year . " the entry into the first quarter was very favorable , so there is a possibility that we will upgrade our forecast , " said weber , who as head of the german central bank sits on the ecb 's policy-setting governing council . warnings about complacency bdi chief thumann told a news conference in hanover said the current robust growth would make itself felt on the labor market where unemployment could feasibly fall below 3.5 million . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : exports are the real economic driver but the government must not rest on its laurels , thumann said , urging the ruling left-right coalition to press ahead with decisive structural reforms . " with the global economy set to expand by 5.0 percent , 2.5 percent growth for germany is not much , " thumann said .
" a lot remains to be done . " later this week , germany 's leading economic institutes also look set to raise their own growth forecasts , too . faster growth coupled with accelerating inflation will provide additional ammunition for the ecb to raise euro-zone borrowing costs - already at a five-and-a-year high - again later this year to prevent the economy from overheating . ecb chief jean-claude trichet sent clear signals last week that , with the current upturn set to continue , the guardian of the euro will notch up its benchmark " refi " refinancing rate to 4.0 percent in june . only the beginning ? the government , too , is becoming increasingly optimistic , with economy minister michael glos suggesting recently that berlin might raise its 2007 growth forecast from 1.7 percent to at least 2.0 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european central bank will likely increase rates to stop possible overheating " there are some indications that germany is still only at the beginning of an upturn that looks set to continue in the coming years , " weber said . the euro zone 's biggest economy was in a traditional cyclical upturn , with the strong export performance of past years now feeding through to investment , the central bank chief said . " at the end of last year , companies said they were investing to increase capacity , " he said . and private consumption could similarly start contributing to growth from the middle of the year , as well , weber continued . vat effect that should be the case once the so-called vat effect had faded , he argued , referring to a three-percentage-point increase in value-added or sales tax -lrb- vat -rrb- , which came into effect at the start of this year and which persuaded consumers to bring forward big-ticket purchases to the end of 2006 . recent rises in oil prices had been almost wholly offset by the rise in the value of the euro against the dollar , limiting the negative economic effects , weber said .
and the economic slowdown in the united states would not harm german exports , too much , given the growing importance of dynamic economies such as china and arab states , he argued . in their widely watched spring report , to be published on thursday , the country 's leading economic research institutes are widely expected to raise their forecasts for german growth this year and next year . newspaper reports have said that five of the six think-tanks - ifo in munich , diw in berlin , hwwa in hamburg , ifw in kiel , iwh in halle and rwi in essen - were pencilling 2.5-percent growth for the german economy both in 2007 and 2008 .

" the entry into the first quarter was very favorable , so there is a possibility that we will upgrade our forecast , " said weber , who as head of the german central bank sits on the ecb 's policy-setting governing council . warnings about complacency bdi chief thumann told a news conference in hanover said the current robust growth would make itself felt on the labor market where unemployment could feasibly fall below 3.5 million . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : exports are the real economic driver but the government must not rest on its laurels , thumann said , urging the ruling left-right coalition to press ahead with decisive structural reforms .

" a lot remains to be done . " later this week , germany 's leading economic institutes also look set to raise their own growth forecasts , too . faster growth coupled with accelerating inflation will provide additional ammunition for the ecb to raise euro-zone borrowing costs - already at a five-and-a-year high - again later this year to prevent the economy from overheating . ecb chief jean-claude trichet sent clear signals last week that , with the current upturn set to continue , the guardian of the euro will notch up its benchmark " refi " refinancing rate to 4.0 percent in june . only the beginning ? the government , too , is becoming increasingly optimistic , with economy minister michael glos suggesting recently that berlin might raise its 2007 growth forecast from 1.7 percent to at least 2.0 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european central bank will likely increase rates to stop possible overheating " there are some indications that germany is still only at the beginning of an upturn that looks set to continue in the coming years , " weber said . the euro zone 's biggest economy was in a traditional cyclical upturn , with the strong export performance of past years now feeding through to investment , the central bank chief said . " at the end of last year , companies said they were investing to increase capacity , " he said . and private consumption could similarly start contributing to growth from the middle of the year , as well , weber continued . vat effect that should be the case once the so-called vat effect had faded , he argued , referring to a three-percentage-point increase in value-added or sales tax -lrb- vat -rrb- , which came into effect at the start of this year and which persuaded consumers to bring forward big-ticket purchases to the end of 2006 . recent rises in oil prices had been almost wholly offset by the rise in the value of the euro against the dollar , limiting the negative economic effects , weber said .
and the economic slowdown in the united states would not harm german exports , too much , given the growing importance of dynamic economies such as china and arab states , he argued . in their widely watched spring report , to be published on thursday , the country 's leading economic research institutes are widely expected to raise their forecasts for german growth this year and next year . newspaper reports have said that five of the six think-tanks - ifo in munich , diw in berlin , hwwa in hamburg , ifw in kiel , iwh in halle and rwi in essen - were pencilling 2.5-percent growth for the german economy both in 2007 and 2008 .

now the goethe institute is stepping up efforts to restore interest in learning the german language . the kids clap their hands as thomas diekhaus is abruptly interrupted while reading " max and moritz , " a famous 19th century poem about the antics of two naughty boys .
their caps pulled down low on their heads , two real life boys dressed as max and moritz have snuck up onto the stage .
diekhaus directs the language department of the goethe institute in riga , latvia , and wants to encourage the children to learn german .
there 's lots of work to be done , he said , because the number of german learners has dropped by 10 percent to 11 percent every year since 2000 .
800 years of common history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : humorit wilhelm busch published his max und moritz poem in 1865 latvia 's german connection is hundreds of years old .
in 1201 , bishop albert from bremen founded the city of riga , now the capital , where the daugava river flows into the baltic sea .
as a member of the hanseatic league , many german traders came to riga and the city flourished .
it also became an important center of trade with russia .
when world war ii broke out in 1939 , most of the germans living in latvia moved to germany .
even while under soviet rule after the war , latvia maintained strong connections with communist east germany , and german continued to be taught as a foreign language .
when the iron curtain collapsed and the soviet union dissolved , latvian students found a renewed interest in the german language - particularly when russian stopped being offered in schools in 1991 .
post-communist business boom today , some 16 years after the fall of communism in eastern europe , germany has become latvia ’ s biggest trading partner .
the newly opened baltic region became an attractive investment location for numerous western companies .
just outside of riga , the german company knauf produces plasterboard that is sold throughout the baltic region .
all of the management personnel have to speak german , said knauf manager peter rumer , since the riga branch has daily contact with co-workers in germany .
" in latvia it ’ s not at all hard to find german-speakers - and good ones at that , " added rumer .
shakespeare vs. goethe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the goethe institute is germany 's world-wide cultural ambassador according to the latvian ministry of education , however , the trend is heading in the opposite direction .
since english was introduced 12 years ago on the recommendation of the school authorities , the number of high school students taking the advanced german exam has dropped by 50 percent .
unlike the goethe institute , the ministry of education does n't see a need for action .
" the ministry of education values multilingualism , however the generally tendency in latvia toward english as a first foreign language can ’ t be avoided , " said gundega muceniece from the ministry .
meanwhile at the goethe institute , max is smoking on stage .
after the first cigarette he gets dizzy and ca n't get a single german word out of his mouth .
even without words , the children understand that max and moritz want to annoy widow bolte 's proud rooster - not an unusual pastime for the two pranksters .
catching up " what people missed at school they have to catch up on at the goethe institute , " said the institute 's director rudolf de baey .
" that 's good for business , but not for german-latvian relations . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de religion -pipe- 16.04.2007 economic boom , not pope , helps catholic church in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's taxes , not church collections , that make german dioceses the world 's richest the german catholic church has raked in more church tax for the first time since 2000 .
but it 's not german pope benedict xiv who is responsible for the tax boon - rather it 's the country 's pumping economy . the catholic church in germany had a bumper year in 2006 .
according to recent estimates , the 27 dioceses on average took in some eight percent more when compared to 2005 .
financial experts for the church expect that revenue for 2007 could amount to 4.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 6 billion -rrb- - 500 million euros more than two years ago . germany has a system of ecclesiastical financing unique to only a few european countries .
germany 's 28 million catholics - along with other members of state-recognized religions - are obligated to pay their churches a tax of between 8 percent and 9 percent , depending on where they live . the federal tax office automatically deducts this from people 's monthly pay packets every month , with the result that germany 's churches are among the richest in the world . catholics leaving in droves despite this comfortable tax arrangement , the last few years have n't been too kind to the catholic church . between 2000 and 2005 , more than 680,000 people officially registered to leave the church and free themselves from their tax obligations -lrb- and their right to receive the sacraments at the same time -rrb- .
in addition , germany 's sluggish economy with its high unemployment rates and lower wages meant there was even less money available to tax . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : apart from mass events like world youth day , more and more christians are becoming disenchanted with the church but now , things are looking up because the levy , the church 's biggest single source of income , is back up to levels not seen since 1998 . according to sebastian anneser , the financial director of the catholic archdiocese of munich and freising , a key reason for this " surprising " development is increasing business confidence and its positive effects on employment . in his march budget statement , though , anneser warned the increase " was n't expected to hold in the long-term " because a combination of low birthrates , aging population and waning interest were causing people to " turn their backs on the church . " however , the church has managed to stem the floodtide somewhat - the rate at which people are abandoning catholic pews has fallen sharply in the past few years . german in the vatican while there have been some suggestions that this is because a german now sits on the papal chair , the catholic church itself is hesitant to make this connection . " curiosity about the catholic church and religion has definitely increased because of -lrb- joseph -rrb- ratzinger becoming pope in 2005 as well as the death of pope john paul ii , " said adelheid utters-adam , a spokesperson for the munich archdiocese in ratzinger 's home state of bavaria . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benedict xvi is the first german pope in nearly 500 years " but there was a significant fall in the rate of people leaving in 2004 and that definitely does n't have anything to do with the current pope , " utters-adam said . in fact , according to some , having a german sitting in the papal chair could actually be a liability for germany 's catholic church . " every time -lrb- pope benedict -rrb- has visited bavaria , there has been a dramatic rise in the number of departures from the church , " said carsten frerk , a sociologist who researches religious institutions . the last papal visit cost 30 million euros . " that annoyed many people who thought the money could have otherwise been better spent on social projects instead of a media spectacle , " frerk said . back to the collection plate ? according to frerk , it 's not just the church which is becoming increasingly unpopular , it 's also the church tax system . " polls show that around 60 percent of people are against collecting the tax in this way - they would prefer to donate voluntarily , " frerk said .
interestingly though , only a third of those surveyed " knew exactly how much church tax they paid , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the governments of denmark , finland , austria and parts of switzerland also collect church tax " that 's the ingenious thing about the system - the tax is just deducted automatically , " he said . thirty five-year-old teacher marion corpus decided to cancel her church contributions four years ago .
she said it was n't until she got a new job that came with an easier to read pay slip that she realized for the first time how much cash she was giving the church . " it was about 80 euros a month , " corpus said .
" i thought i could do something better with the money because i did n't like what the church was doing .
instead , i 've now got a monthly membership to amnesty international plus i sponsor a child in malawi . " despite the system 's unpopularity , the right of recognized churches to tax its adherents is enshrined in the german constitution .
the government only collects the levy because churches contract it to do so .
but this arrangement is unlikely to change any time soon - after all , the state gets to keep three percent of the all money it amasses through the church tax . kate hairsine send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de as church loses appeal , protestants try rebranding religion 490 years after martin luther nailed his ninety-five theses to a door in wittenberg , the city is the staging post for a revival aimed at reversing the fortunes of the nation 's ailing protestant church .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 16.04.2007 economic boom , not pope , helps catholic church in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's taxes , not church collections , that make german dioceses the world 's richest the german catholic church has raked in more church tax for the first time since 2000 .
but it 's not german pope benedict xiv who is responsible for the tax boon - rather it 's the country 's pumping economy . the catholic church in germany had a bumper year in 2006 .
according to recent estimates , the 27 dioceses on average took in some eight percent more when compared to 2005 .
financial experts for the church expect that revenue for 2007 could amount to 4.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 6 billion -rrb- - 500 million euros more than two years ago . germany has a system of ecclesiastical financing unique to only a few european countries .
germany 's 28 million catholics - along with other members of state-recognized religions - are obligated to pay their churches a tax of between 8 percent and 9 percent , depending on where they live . the federal tax office automatically deducts this from people 's monthly pay packets every month , with the result that germany 's churches are among the richest in the world . catholics leaving in droves despite this comfortable tax arrangement , the last few years have n't been too kind to the catholic church . between 2000 and 2005 , more than 680,000 people officially registered to leave the church and free themselves from their tax obligations -lrb- and their right to receive the sacraments at the same time -rrb- .
in addition , germany 's sluggish economy with its high unemployment rates and lower wages meant there was even less money available to tax . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : apart from mass events like world youth day , more and more christians are becoming disenchanted with the church but now , things are looking up because the levy , the church 's biggest single source of income , is back up to levels not seen since 1998 . according to sebastian anneser , the financial director of the catholic archdiocese of munich and freising , a key reason for this " surprising " development is increasing business confidence and its positive effects on employment . in his march budget statement , though , anneser warned the increase " was n't expected to hold in the long-term " because a combination of low birthrates , aging population and waning interest were causing people to " turn their backs on the church . " however , the church has managed to stem the floodtide somewhat - the rate at which people are abandoning catholic pews has fallen sharply in the past few years . german in the vatican while there have been some suggestions that this is because a german now sits on the papal chair , the catholic church itself is hesitant to make this connection . " curiosity about the catholic church and religion has definitely increased because of -lrb- joseph -rrb- ratzinger becoming pope in 2005 as well as the death of pope john paul ii , " said adelheid utters-adam , a spokesperson for the munich archdiocese in ratzinger 's home state of bavaria . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benedict xvi is the first german pope in nearly 500 years " but there was a significant fall in the rate of people leaving in 2004 and that definitely does n't have anything to do with the current pope , " utters-adam said . in fact , according to some , having a german sitting in the papal chair could actually be a liability for germany 's catholic church . " every time -lrb- pope benedict -rrb- has visited bavaria , there has been a dramatic rise in the number of departures from the church , " said carsten frerk , a sociologist who researches religious institutions . the last papal visit cost 30 million euros . " that annoyed many people who thought the money could have otherwise been better spent on social projects instead of a media spectacle , " frerk said . back to the collection plate ? according to frerk , it 's not just the church which is becoming increasingly unpopular , it 's also the church tax system . " polls show that around 60 percent of people are against collecting the tax in this way - they would prefer to donate voluntarily , " frerk said .
interestingly though , only a third of those surveyed " knew exactly how much church tax they paid , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the governments of denmark , finland , austria and parts of switzerland also collect church tax " that 's the ingenious thing about the system - the tax is just deducted automatically , " he said . thirty five-year-old teacher marion corpus decided to cancel her church contributions four years ago .
she said it was n't until she got a new job that came with an easier to read pay slip that she realized for the first time how much cash she was giving the church . " it was about 80 euros a month , " corpus said .
" i thought i could do something better with the money because i did n't like what the church was doing .
instead , i 've now got a monthly membership to amnesty international plus i sponsor a child in malawi . " despite the system 's unpopularity , the right of recognized churches to tax its adherents is enshrined in the german constitution .
the government only collects the levy because churches contract it to do so .
but this arrangement is unlikely to change any time soon - after all , the state gets to keep three percent of the all money it amasses through the church tax . kate hairsine send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de as church loses appeal , protestants try rebranding religion 490 years after martin luther nailed his ninety-five theses to a door in wittenberg , the city is the staging post for a revival aimed at reversing the fortunes of the nation 's ailing protestant church .

" we are on a long , narrow road and we have to be patient .
but our two countries are friends . " erdogan , however , added that he felt the criticism he had voiced was " legitimate . " in the magazine interview , the turkish pm was quoted as saying : " seriously , i expected more from germany .
we would like a clear idea of a date , a roadmap and a calendar for negotiations .

it was a country where nearly 4 million people had died in the civil war since 1997 , a conflict that had raged until the warring sides called an armistice in 2002 . the unsteady peace made it possible for the first free elections in 40 years to take place in 2006 and the 780 soldiers of the eufor force , sent under a mandate from the european union , would be in the capital kinshasa to ensure stability during the voting . despite this ceasefire and these steps towards democracy , there were risks .
there was sporadic fighting across the country , political tensions which threatened to spill out onto the streets and the disturbing problem of child soldiers .
nevertheless , the eu mandate and the german deployment was approved and continued even when the situation in congo deteriorated further as the european soldiers arrived . the conditions for the soldiers on the ground in congo was given little consideration when the application for the german deployment was agreed on ; this seems to be the case in most foreign deployments these days with the soldiers considered little more than a buffer force between warring factions by the politicians making the decisions .
however , the armed forces were consulted about the situation and therefore it was assumed that all aspects of the mission had been discussed and made clear . unacceptable and volatile conditions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many german troops had no idea what to expect in congo the defense commissioner for the german lower house of parliament - the bundestag - even described the living conditions of european soldiers in the congo as " unacceptable " before the german application was made .
the troops lived together for months in the narrowest of tents which soon went moldy in the rainy season , where the air humidity was 90 percent and temperatures were as high as 40 degrees celsius -lrb- 104 degrees f -rrb- .
the monsoon caused floods and made the latrine pits overflow .
there were also defective showers and at times scarcely enough drinking water for the contingent . being separated from their loved ones also brought many problems for the troops .
the workload in kinshasa was more than expected with fighting breaking out between rival factions causing strain on those caught in the conflict and those waiting at home for news .
the uncertainty and worry put strain on marriages and families and brought many to the breaking point . experienced soldiers who had seen action in afghanistan and the balkans had been confronted with conditions like this before , but for the less experienced troops the reality of the misery , decay and the results of a long and brutal civil war made very deep impressions on them .
for many it was not an easy situation . a tinderbox threatening to ignite bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eufor troops soon saw how fragile the peace was far from just monitoring elections in the midst of a fragile ceasefire , the europeans found themselves dealing with riots and battles between drc troops and the forces of presidential candidate jean-pierre bemba . as the election neared , bemba 's bodyguards and armed fighters became increasingly nervous and when government soldiers attacked the candidate 's residence , there was a real chance that the civil war could reignite .
dozens died as a result , and european forces found themselves caught in the middle .
however , if they had not been there , it would have been a lot worse . the situation in kinshasa became like a tinderbox .
seemingly innocuous incidents could become inflammatory in seconds .
soldiers keeping the peace would regularly and suddenly find themselves facing a hostile crowd intent on rioting or criminal gangs moving through the capital . in these cases , the eufor troops had to make split-second decisions to avoid escalation .
was a stone thrown towards them the beginning of an attack or the action of a high-spirited youngster ?
an overreaction from just one soldier could have had catastrophic effects , but a show of weakness or passivity also could have led to severe consequences . to make the right decisions in such a volatile environment requires a high degree of professionalism and judgment .
the soldiers making these types of decisions were in their early twenties and often making them alone . eufor prevented a return to war bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eufor mission was widely seen as a success in the end , it was widely accepted that the decision to station united nations forces in kinshasa , the political center of the country , to provide stability was a successful one .
while the deployment was initially viewed with much skepticism , it eventually gained support and sympathy .
in general , the deployment of the eufor troops was seen as a success and that their presence , particularly during the august riots , was a decisive factor in the prevention of a return to civil war . every soldier at some point questions whether his or her deployment is worth the risk it may put on their life .
the mainly positive reaction of the congolese people by the end of the deployment convinced many that they had done a good and worthwhile job . however , by the end , it also became clear that the deployment of troops in congo could not solve the country 's problems .
a society that works with the government to create peace and stability is established only in parts .
old conflicts continue and they can only be solved by the congolese people themselves . simon wunder is a reserve officer in the bundeswehr and a doctoral candidate in aachen .

european newpapers have reacted to the beating and arrest of hundreds of russian protesters , including opposition politician garry kasparov . french newspaper le figaro expressed surprise at the events in russia in the light of putin 's domestic support . " the friends of kasparov will not gain any popularity because their demonstrations are suppressed .
the tough actions of the police will not trigger a wave of protest against those in power .
nevertheless , the kremlin is showing an astonishing weakness by reacting so rigorously to the smallest sign of protest , " muses the paper .
austrian newspaper die presse also wondered why the kremlin had acted so brutally : " you really ask yourself whether the people in power in moscow are completely crazy .
apparently , president putin continues to have the backing of 70 percent and more of the population .
what are he and his technocrats afraid of ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : riot police officers detain russian opposition leader garry kasparov it added later : " if this small heap of civil and human rights campaigners , liberals , national bolchevists and anarchists really frightens the putinists so much that they deploy a whole army of police against them , then their power base is n't looking rosy -lrb- … -rrb- in that case , this demonstration of power from the kremlin has actually revealed its weakness .

" from the point of view of the governing regime of president vladimir putin this makes perfect sense . -lrb- … -rrb- the kremlin has learnt its lesson from the peaceful revolutions in georgia and the ukraine where after blatant vote rigging , protest rallies quickly gained momentum and led to the toppling of the respective governments .
he wants to keep the protests as small as possible and incite fear among normal citizens . " but the paper also questioned whether this approach would really work .
" it may work in the short-term , " it wrote .
" but in the long-term this was rarely a healthy political strategy . " danish newspaper berlingske tidende was damning about russia 's political system .
" you have to be completely blind or excessively tolerant not to see that there is something wrong with russia .
just a year before the elections that mark the end of president putin 's time in office , he has this country so firmly in his grip that democracy is just a shell . " the paper calls upon the international community to do more .
" the eu and the us could happily exercise more pressure than is the case at the moment .
putin can carry out his actions largely unhindered " . finally , german newspaper die welt also urged the west not to beat about the bush .

european newpapers have reacted to the beating and arrest of hundreds of russian protesters , including opposition politician garry kasparov . french newspaper le figaro expressed surprise at the events in russia in the light of putin 's domestic support . " the friends of kasparov will not gain any popularity because their demonstrations are suppressed .
the tough actions of the police will not trigger a wave of protest against those in power .
nevertheless , the kremlin is showing an astonishing weakness by reacting so rigorously to the smallest sign of protest , " muses the paper .
austrian newspaper die presse also wondered why the kremlin had acted so brutally : " you really ask yourself whether the people in power in moscow are completely crazy .
apparently , president putin continues to have the backing of 70 percent and more of the population .
what are he and his technocrats afraid of ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : riot police officers detain russian opposition leader garry kasparov it added later : " if this small heap of civil and human rights campaigners , liberals , national bolchevists and anarchists really frightens the putinists so much that they deploy a whole army of police against them , then their power base is n't looking rosy -lrb- … -rrb- in that case , this demonstration of power from the kremlin has actually revealed its weakness . " bulgarian newspaper dnewnik described the beatings and arrests as par for the course .
" really no one should be surprised .
it is enough to remember that the russian president is a former kgb agent and that 90 percent of the leadership in today 's russia are a product of the former secret services . " swiss newspaper basler zeitung argued putin was attempting to deter what had happened in parts of the former soviet union .
" from the point of view of the governing regime of president vladimir putin this makes perfect sense . -lrb- … -rrb- the kremlin has learnt its lesson from the peaceful revolutions in georgia and the ukraine where after blatant vote rigging , protest rallies quickly gained momentum and led to the toppling of the respective governments .
he wants to keep the protests as small as possible and incite fear among normal citizens . " but the paper also questioned whether this approach would really work .
" it may work in the short-term , " it wrote .
" but in the long-term this was rarely a healthy political strategy . " danish newspaper berlingske tidende was damning about russia 's political system .
" you have to be completely blind or excessively tolerant not to see that there is something wrong with russia .
just a year before the elections that mark the end of president putin 's time in office , he has this country so firmly in his grip that democracy is just a shell . " the paper calls upon the international community to do more .
" the eu and the us could happily exercise more pressure than is the case at the moment .
putin can carry out his actions largely unhindered " . finally , german newspaper die welt also urged the west not to beat about the bush .
the paper says any misguided sense of respect or fear of having russia energy supplies cut should not stop the international community from taking action .

if you 're the parent of a tokio hotel fan , however , standing in line for hours just got a whole lot better . for the kids , standing for hours on end to get the chance to get a glimpse of their heroes on stage is just part of being infatuated with a pop group .
the dedicated fan thinks nothing of camping out for tickets overnight or queuing for a gig for days .
for most , this is not a problem .
teenagers are hardy sorts and - with parental permission - can quite easily withstand the rigors of serious fandom . but for fans of german teen sensations tokio hotel , it is an entirely different pot of eyeliner . while the fans themselves are more than willing to withstand the boredom of lining up with other like-minded souls for the chance to scream at bill , tom , gustav and georg , a large number of those are well below the age of parental consent .
this means that mum and dad have to queue as well .
and this is where the problem lies . a parent 's worst nightmare made bearable bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bill kaulitz takes his skunk / porcupine for a walk mummy and daddy may have only just gotten round to the idea that their offspring is having confusingly carnal thoughts about an androgynous teenage boy with what appears to be a humongous skunk-like porcupine stuck on his head .
now they have to stand in almost 40-degree heat for hours , if not days , to make sure said infatuated child is safely ticketed and ensconced in the secure atmosphere of the kindergarten / rock concert of their dreams . this was the case this weekend when tokio hotel were set to play to 8000 screamer pre-teens at the frankfurt festival hall .
in scorching sunshine , the parents of the eight to 15-year old crowd members soon found themselves wilting along with their crazed offspring .
luckily , they also soon found themselves to be the subject of a parental care experiment . local radio broadcaster hr3 , a sponsor of the tokio hotel show , provided parents with refreshments , music to dance to , formula one racing arcade games and other pastimes to help the hours fly by .
mothers queued to have airbrush tattoos painted on while competitive dads fought over the table soccer game .
for those who had been in line since the early hours of sunday morning , it was a god-send . pass the water , please bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tokio hotel : not as good as showering in a train station " when we found out from the police that there would be parental care , we were very glad , " said simone geppert from cologne who had been in the queue with her husband siggi and daughter selina since five in the morning .
" it is such a relief that there is somewhere to sit down and something to drink . " " i am more afraid about the kids queuing up alone than i do about them at the concert , " said claudia düsterbeck whose 11-year old daughter was busily making friends with other tokio hotel fans as she sipped from a bottle of cooling water provided by the parental carers .
" when they said this service was available , it eased those fears . " once the queuing was over and the kids rushed to be as close as possible to their idols , the parents relaxed further .

european newpapers have reacted to the beating and arrest of hundreds of russian protesters , including opposition politician garry kasparov . french newspaper le figaro expressed surprise at the events in russia in the light of putin 's domestic support . " the friends of kasparov will not gain any popularity because their demonstrations are suppressed .
the tough actions of the police will not trigger a wave of protest against those in power .
nevertheless , the kremlin is showing an astonishing weakness by reacting so rigorously to the smallest sign of protest , " muses the paper .
austrian newspaper die presse also wondered why the kremlin had acted so brutally : " you really ask yourself whether the people in power in moscow are completely crazy .
apparently , president putin continues to have the backing of 70 percent and more of the population .
what are he and his technocrats afraid of ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : riot police officers detain russian opposition leader garry kasparov it added later : " if this small heap of civil and human rights campaigners , liberals , national bolchevists and anarchists really frightens the putinists so much that they deploy a whole army of police against them , then their power base is n't looking rosy -lrb- … -rrb- in that case , this demonstration of power from the kremlin has actually revealed its weakness . " bulgarian newspaper dnewnik described the beatings and arrests as par for the course .
" really no one should be surprised .
it is enough to remember that the russian president is a former kgb agent and that 90 percent of the leadership in today 's russia are a product of the former secret services . " swiss newspaper basler zeitung argued putin was attempting to deter what had happened in parts of the former soviet union .
" from the point of view of the governing regime of president vladimir putin this makes perfect sense . -lrb- … -rrb- the kremlin has learnt its lesson from the peaceful revolutions in georgia and the ukraine where after blatant vote rigging , protest rallies quickly gained momentum and led to the toppling of the respective governments .
he wants to keep the protests as small as possible and incite fear among normal citizens . " but the paper also questioned whether this approach would really work .
" it may work in the short-term , " it wrote .
" but in the long-term this was rarely a healthy political strategy . " danish newspaper berlingske tidende was damning about russia 's political system .
" you have to be completely blind or excessively tolerant not to see that there is something wrong with russia .
just a year before the elections that mark the end of president putin 's time in office , he has this country so firmly in his grip that democracy is just a shell . " the paper calls upon the international community to do more .
" the eu and the us could happily exercise more pressure than is the case at the moment .
putin can carry out his actions largely unhindered " . finally , german newspaper die welt also urged the west not to beat about the bush .
the paper says any misguided sense of respect or fear of having russia energy supplies cut should not stop the international community from taking action .
" the west owes it to the dissidents in putin 's empire to speak openly .

european newpapers have reacted to the beating and arrest of hundreds of russian protesters , including opposition politician garry kasparov . french newspaper le figaro expressed surprise at the events in russia in the light of putin 's domestic support . " the friends of kasparov will not gain any popularity because their demonstrations are suppressed .

nevertheless , the kremlin is showing an astonishing weakness by reacting so rigorously to the smallest sign of protest , " muses the paper .
austrian newspaper die presse also wondered why the kremlin had acted so brutally : " you really ask yourself whether the people in power in moscow are completely crazy .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de peacekeeping -pipe- 16.04.2007 a soldier 's experiences in the kinshasa tinderbox großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundeswehr troops faced tough conditions and volatile situations in congo after the un extended the mandate for peacekeeping troops in the democratic republic of congo last week , political scientist simon wunder , a reservist with the eufor contingent deployed there , described his experiences . there were huge doubts about the german government 's decision at the beginning of last year to send a deployment of german troops to democratic republic of congo -lrb- drc -rrb- .
it was a country where nearly 4 million people had died in the civil war since 1997 , a conflict that had raged until the warring sides called an armistice in 2002 . the unsteady peace made it possible for the first free elections in 40 years to take place in 2006 and the 780 soldiers of the eufor force , sent under a mandate from the european union , would be in the capital kinshasa to ensure stability during the voting . despite this ceasefire and these steps towards democracy , there were risks .
there was sporadic fighting across the country , political tensions which threatened to spill out onto the streets and the disturbing problem of child soldiers .
nevertheless , the eu mandate and the german deployment was approved and continued even when the situation in congo deteriorated further as the european soldiers arrived . the conditions for the soldiers on the ground in congo was given little consideration when the application for the german deployment was agreed on ; this seems to be the case in most foreign deployments these days with the soldiers considered little more than a buffer force between warring factions by the politicians making the decisions .
however , the armed forces were consulted about the situation and therefore it was assumed that all aspects of the mission had been discussed and made clear . unacceptable and volatile conditions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many german troops had no idea what to expect in congo the defense commissioner for the german lower house of parliament - the bundestag - even described the living conditions of european soldiers in the congo as " unacceptable " before the german application was made .
the troops lived together for months in the narrowest of tents which soon went moldy in the rainy season , where the air humidity was 90 percent and temperatures were as high as 40 degrees celsius -lrb- 104 degrees f -rrb- .
the monsoon caused floods and made the latrine pits overflow .
there were also defective showers and at times scarcely enough drinking water for the contingent . being separated from their loved ones also brought many problems for the troops .
the workload in kinshasa was more than expected with fighting breaking out between rival factions causing strain on those caught in the conflict and those waiting at home for news .
the uncertainty and worry put strain on marriages and families and brought many to the breaking point . experienced soldiers who had seen action in afghanistan and the balkans had been confronted with conditions like this before , but for the less experienced troops the reality of the misery , decay and the results of a long and brutal civil war made very deep impressions on them .
for many it was not an easy situation . a tinderbox threatening to ignite bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eufor troops soon saw how fragile the peace was far from just monitoring elections in the midst of a fragile ceasefire , the europeans found themselves dealing with riots and battles between drc troops and the forces of presidential candidate jean-pierre bemba . as the election neared , bemba 's bodyguards and armed fighters became increasingly nervous and when government soldiers attacked the candidate 's residence , there was a real chance that the civil war could reignite .
dozens died as a result , and european forces found themselves caught in the middle .
however , if they had not been there , it would have been a lot worse . the situation in kinshasa became like a tinderbox .
seemingly innocuous incidents could become inflammatory in seconds .
soldiers keeping the peace would regularly and suddenly find themselves facing a hostile crowd intent on rioting or criminal gangs moving through the capital . in these cases , the eufor troops had to make split-second decisions to avoid escalation .
was a stone thrown towards them the beginning of an attack or the action of a high-spirited youngster ?
an overreaction from just one soldier could have had catastrophic effects , but a show of weakness or passivity also could have led to severe consequences . to make the right decisions in such a volatile environment requires a high degree of professionalism and judgment .
the soldiers making these types of decisions were in their early twenties and often making them alone . eufor prevented a return to war bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eufor mission was widely seen as a success in the end , it was widely accepted that the decision to station united nations forces in kinshasa , the political center of the country , to provide stability was a successful one .
while the deployment was initially viewed with much skepticism , it eventually gained support and sympathy .
in general , the deployment of the eufor troops was seen as a success and that their presence , particularly during the august riots , was a decisive factor in the prevention of a return to civil war . every soldier at some point questions whether his or her deployment is worth the risk it may put on their life .
the mainly positive reaction of the congolese people by the end of the deployment convinced many that they had done a good and worthwhile job . however , by the end , it also became clear that the deployment of troops in congo could not solve the country 's problems .
a society that works with the government to create peace and stability is established only in parts .
old conflicts continue and they can only be solved by the congolese people themselves . simon wunder is a reserve officer in the bundeswehr and a doctoral candidate in aachen .
he was deployed with the operative information regiment in kinshasa and presents his personal view in this article . -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de africa expert confident of un mission in dr congo serious fighting has erupted in the dr congo after surprisingly peaceful elections last year .

-lrb- 04.12.2006 -rrb- germany starts rethinking its foreign deployments german soldiers are engaged in eleven foreign missions .
but after a scandal with soldiers in afghanistan and fears that the military is overstretched , some want a reduction in the numbers of troops being sent abroad .

european newpapers have reacted to the beating and arrest of hundreds of russian protesters , including opposition politician garry kasparov . french newspaper le figaro expressed surprise at the events in russia in the light of putin 's domestic support . " the friends of kasparov will not gain any popularity because their demonstrations are suppressed .
the tough actions of the police will not trigger a wave of protest against those in power .
nevertheless , the kremlin is showing an astonishing weakness by reacting so rigorously to the smallest sign of protest , " muses the paper .
austrian newspaper die presse also wondered why the kremlin had acted so brutally : " you really ask yourself whether the people in power in moscow are completely crazy .
apparently , president putin continues to have the backing of 70 percent and more of the population .
what are he and his technocrats afraid of ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : riot police officers detain russian opposition leader garry kasparov it added later : " if this small heap of civil and human rights campaigners , liberals , national bolchevists and anarchists really frightens the putinists so much that they deploy a whole army of police against them , then their power base is n't looking rosy -lrb- … -rrb- in that case , this demonstration of power from the kremlin has actually revealed its weakness . " bulgarian newspaper dnewnik described the beatings and arrests as par for the course .
" really no one should be surprised .
it is enough to remember that the russian president is a former kgb agent and that 90 percent of the leadership in today 's russia are a product of the former secret services . " swiss newspaper basler zeitung argued putin was attempting to deter what had happened in parts of the former soviet union .

it was a country where nearly 4 million people had died in the civil war since 1997 , a conflict that had raged until the warring sides called an armistice in 2002 . the unsteady peace made it possible for the first free elections in 40 years to take place in 2006 and the 780 soldiers of the eufor force , sent under a mandate from the european union , would be in the capital kinshasa to ensure stability during the voting . despite this ceasefire and these steps towards democracy , there were risks .
there was sporadic fighting across the country , political tensions which threatened to spill out onto the streets and the disturbing problem of child soldiers .
nevertheless , the eu mandate and the german deployment was approved and continued even when the situation in congo deteriorated further as the european soldiers arrived . the conditions for the soldiers on the ground in congo was given little consideration when the application for the german deployment was agreed on ; this seems to be the case in most foreign deployments these days with the soldiers considered little more than a buffer force between warring factions by the politicians making the decisions .
however , the armed forces were consulted about the situation and therefore it was assumed that all aspects of the mission had been discussed and made clear . unacceptable and volatile conditions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many german troops had no idea what to expect in congo the defense commissioner for the german lower house of parliament - the bundestag - even described the living conditions of european soldiers in the congo as " unacceptable " before the german application was made .
the troops lived together for months in the narrowest of tents which soon went moldy in the rainy season , where the air humidity was 90 percent and temperatures were as high as 40 degrees celsius -lrb- 104 degrees f -rrb- .
the monsoon caused floods and made the latrine pits overflow .
there were also defective showers and at times scarcely enough drinking water for the contingent . being separated from their loved ones also brought many problems for the troops .
the workload in kinshasa was more than expected with fighting breaking out between rival factions causing strain on those caught in the conflict and those waiting at home for news .
the uncertainty and worry put strain on marriages and families and brought many to the breaking point . experienced soldiers who had seen action in afghanistan and the balkans had been confronted with conditions like this before , but for the less experienced troops the reality of the misery , decay and the results of a long and brutal civil war made very deep impressions on them .
for many it was not an easy situation . a tinderbox threatening to ignite bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eufor troops soon saw how fragile the peace was far from just monitoring elections in the midst of a fragile ceasefire , the europeans found themselves dealing with riots and battles between drc troops and the forces of presidential candidate jean-pierre bemba . as the election neared , bemba 's bodyguards and armed fighters became increasingly nervous and when government soldiers attacked the candidate 's residence , there was a real chance that the civil war could reignite .
dozens died as a result , and european forces found themselves caught in the middle .
however , if they had not been there , it would have been a lot worse . the situation in kinshasa became like a tinderbox .
seemingly innocuous incidents could become inflammatory in seconds .
soldiers keeping the peace would regularly and suddenly find themselves facing a hostile crowd intent on rioting or criminal gangs moving through the capital . in these cases , the eufor troops had to make split-second decisions to avoid escalation .
was a stone thrown towards them the beginning of an attack or the action of a high-spirited youngster ?
an overreaction from just one soldier could have had catastrophic effects , but a show of weakness or passivity also could have led to severe consequences . to make the right decisions in such a volatile environment requires a high degree of professionalism and judgment .
the soldiers making these types of decisions were in their early twenties and often making them alone . eufor prevented a return to war bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eufor mission was widely seen as a success in the end , it was widely accepted that the decision to station united nations forces in kinshasa , the political center of the country , to provide stability was a successful one .
while the deployment was initially viewed with much skepticism , it eventually gained support and sympathy .
in general , the deployment of the eufor troops was seen as a success and that their presence , particularly during the august riots , was a decisive factor in the prevention of a return to civil war . every soldier at some point questions whether his or her deployment is worth the risk it may put on their life .
the mainly positive reaction of the congolese people by the end of the deployment convinced many that they had done a good and worthwhile job . however , by the end , it also became clear that the deployment of troops in congo could not solve the country 's problems .
a society that works with the government to create peace and stability is established only in parts .
old conflicts continue and they can only be solved by the congolese people themselves . simon wunder is a reserve officer in the bundeswehr and a doctoral candidate in aachen .
he was deployed with the operative information regiment in kinshasa and presents his personal view in this article . -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de africa expert confident of un mission in dr congo serious fighting has erupted in the dr congo after surprisingly peaceful elections last year .

" the entry into the first quarter was very favorable , so there is a possibility that we will upgrade our forecast , " said weber , who as head of the german central bank sits on the ecb 's policy-setting governing council . warnings about complacency bdi chief thumann told a news conference in hanover said the current robust growth would make itself felt on the labor market where unemployment could feasibly fall below 3.5 million . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : exports are the real economic driver but the government must not rest on its laurels , thumann said , urging the ruling left-right coalition to press ahead with decisive structural reforms . " with the global economy set to expand by 5.0 percent , 2.5 percent growth for germany is not much , " thumann said .
" a lot remains to be done . " later this week , germany 's leading economic institutes also look set to raise their own growth forecasts , too . faster growth coupled with accelerating inflation will provide additional ammunition for the ecb to raise euro-zone borrowing costs - already at a five-and-a-year high - again later this year to prevent the economy from overheating . ecb chief jean-claude trichet sent clear signals last week that , with the current upturn set to continue , the guardian of the euro will notch up its benchmark " refi " refinancing rate to 4.0 percent in june . only the beginning ? the government , too , is becoming increasingly optimistic , with economy minister michael glos suggesting recently that berlin might raise its 2007 growth forecast from 1.7 percent to at least 2.0 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european central bank will likely increase rates to stop possible overheating " there are some indications that germany is still only at the beginning of an upturn that looks set to continue in the coming years , " weber said . the euro zone 's biggest economy was in a traditional cyclical upturn , with the strong export performance of past years now feeding through to investment , the central bank chief said . " at the end of last year , companies said they were investing to increase capacity , " he said . and private consumption could similarly start contributing to growth from the middle of the year , as well , weber continued . vat effect that should be the case once the so-called vat effect had faded , he argued , referring to a three-percentage-point increase in value-added or sales tax -lrb- vat -rrb- , which came into effect at the start of this year and which persuaded consumers to bring forward big-ticket purchases to the end of 2006 . recent rises in oil prices had been almost wholly offset by the rise in the value of the euro against the dollar , limiting the negative economic effects , weber said .
and the economic slowdown in the united states would not harm german exports , too much , given the growing importance of dynamic economies such as china and arab states , he argued . in their widely watched spring report , to be published on thursday , the country 's leading economic research institutes are widely expected to raise their forecasts for german growth this year and next year . newspaper reports have said that five of the six think-tanks - ifo in munich , diw in berlin , hwwa in hamburg , ifw in kiel , iwh in halle and rwi in essen - were pencilling 2.5-percent growth for the german economy both in 2007 and 2008 .

it was a country where nearly 4 million people had died in the civil war since 1997 , a conflict that had raged until the warring sides called an armistice in 2002 . the unsteady peace made it possible for the first free elections in 40 years to take place in 2006 and the 780 soldiers of the eufor force , sent under a mandate from the european union , would be in the capital kinshasa to ensure stability during the voting . despite this ceasefire and these steps towards democracy , there were risks .
there was sporadic fighting across the country , political tensions which threatened to spill out onto the streets and the disturbing problem of child soldiers .
nevertheless , the eu mandate and the german deployment was approved and continued even when the situation in congo deteriorated further as the european soldiers arrived . the conditions for the soldiers on the ground in congo was given little consideration when the application for the german deployment was agreed on ; this seems to be the case in most foreign deployments these days with the soldiers considered little more than a buffer force between warring factions by the politicians making the decisions .
however , the armed forces were consulted about the situation and therefore it was assumed that all aspects of the mission had been discussed and made clear . unacceptable and volatile conditions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many german troops had no idea what to expect in congo the defense commissioner for the german lower house of parliament - the bundestag - even described the living conditions of european soldiers in the congo as " unacceptable " before the german application was made .
the troops lived together for months in the narrowest of tents which soon went moldy in the rainy season , where the air humidity was 90 percent and temperatures were as high as 40 degrees celsius -lrb- 104 degrees f -rrb- .
the monsoon caused floods and made the latrine pits overflow .
there were also defective showers and at times scarcely enough drinking water for the contingent . being separated from their loved ones also brought many problems for the troops .
the workload in kinshasa was more than expected with fighting breaking out between rival factions causing strain on those caught in the conflict and those waiting at home for news .
the uncertainty and worry put strain on marriages and families and brought many to the breaking point . experienced soldiers who had seen action in afghanistan and the balkans had been confronted with conditions like this before , but for the less experienced troops the reality of the misery , decay and the results of a long and brutal civil war made very deep impressions on them .
for many it was not an easy situation . a tinderbox threatening to ignite bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eufor troops soon saw how fragile the peace was far from just monitoring elections in the midst of a fragile ceasefire , the europeans found themselves dealing with riots and battles between drc troops and the forces of presidential candidate jean-pierre bemba . as the election neared , bemba 's bodyguards and armed fighters became increasingly nervous and when government soldiers attacked the candidate 's residence , there was a real chance that the civil war could reignite .
dozens died as a result , and european forces found themselves caught in the middle .
however , if they had not been there , it would have been a lot worse . the situation in kinshasa became like a tinderbox .
seemingly innocuous incidents could become inflammatory in seconds .
soldiers keeping the peace would regularly and suddenly find themselves facing a hostile crowd intent on rioting or criminal gangs moving through the capital . in these cases , the eufor troops had to make split-second decisions to avoid escalation .
was a stone thrown towards them the beginning of an attack or the action of a high-spirited youngster ?
an overreaction from just one soldier could have had catastrophic effects , but a show of weakness or passivity also could have led to severe consequences . to make the right decisions in such a volatile environment requires a high degree of professionalism and judgment .
the soldiers making these types of decisions were in their early twenties and often making them alone . eufor prevented a return to war bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eufor mission was widely seen as a success in the end , it was widely accepted that the decision to station united nations forces in kinshasa , the political center of the country , to provide stability was a successful one .
while the deployment was initially viewed with much skepticism , it eventually gained support and sympathy .
in general , the deployment of the eufor troops was seen as a success and that their presence , particularly during the august riots , was a decisive factor in the prevention of a return to civil war . every soldier at some point questions whether his or her deployment is worth the risk it may put on their life .
the mainly positive reaction of the congolese people by the end of the deployment convinced many that they had done a good and worthwhile job . however , by the end , it also became clear that the deployment of troops in congo could not solve the country 's problems .
a society that works with the government to create peace and stability is established only in parts .
old conflicts continue and they can only be solved by the congolese people themselves . simon wunder is a reserve officer in the bundeswehr and a doctoral candidate in aachen .
he was deployed with the operative information regiment in kinshasa and presents his personal view in this article . -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de africa expert confident of un mission in dr congo serious fighting has erupted in the dr congo after surprisingly peaceful elections last year .

" the entry into the first quarter was very favorable , so there is a possibility that we will upgrade our forecast , " said weber , who as head of the german central bank sits on the ecb 's policy-setting governing council . warnings about complacency bdi chief thumann told a news conference in hanover said the current robust growth would make itself felt on the labor market where unemployment could feasibly fall below 3.5 million . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : exports are the real economic driver but the government must not rest on its laurels , thumann said , urging the ruling left-right coalition to press ahead with decisive structural reforms . " with the global economy set to expand by 5.0 percent , 2.5 percent growth for germany is not much , " thumann said .
" a lot remains to be done . " later this week , germany 's leading economic institutes also look set to raise their own growth forecasts , too . faster growth coupled with accelerating inflation will provide additional ammunition for the ecb to raise euro-zone borrowing costs - already at a five-and-a-year high - again later this year to prevent the economy from overheating . ecb chief jean-claude trichet sent clear signals last week that , with the current upturn set to continue , the guardian of the euro will notch up its benchmark " refi " refinancing rate to 4.0 percent in june . only the beginning ? the government , too , is becoming increasingly optimistic , with economy minister michael glos suggesting recently that berlin might raise its 2007 growth forecast from 1.7 percent to at least 2.0 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european central bank will likely increase rates to stop possible overheating " there are some indications that germany is still only at the beginning of an upturn that looks set to continue in the coming years , " weber said . the euro zone 's biggest economy was in a traditional cyclical upturn , with the strong export performance of past years now feeding through to investment , the central bank chief said . " at the end of last year , companies said they were investing to increase capacity , " he said . and private consumption could similarly start contributing to growth from the middle of the year , as well , weber continued . vat effect that should be the case once the so-called vat effect had faded , he argued , referring to a three-percentage-point increase in value-added or sales tax -lrb- vat -rrb- , which came into effect at the start of this year and which persuaded consumers to bring forward big-ticket purchases to the end of 2006 . recent rises in oil prices had been almost wholly offset by the rise in the value of the euro against the dollar , limiting the negative economic effects , weber said .
and the economic slowdown in the united states would not harm german exports , too much , given the growing importance of dynamic economies such as china and arab states , he argued . in their widely watched spring report , to be published on thursday , the country 's leading economic research institutes are widely expected to raise their forecasts for german growth this year and next year . newspaper reports have said that five of the six think-tanks - ifo in munich , diw in berlin , hwwa in hamburg , ifw in kiel , iwh in halle and rwi in essen - were pencilling 2.5-percent growth for the german economy both in 2007 and 2008 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 16.04.2007 west germans have hang-ups about going east großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dresden in germany 's east is a unesco world heritage site as they pick up pictures taken over the easter holidays , few western germans are flipping through photos of the country 's east , and experts say not many vacations in the former east germany are being planned . as the world 's undisputed traveling kings , checking out the ultimate holiday deal is virtually a national pastime here in germany .
in fact , if a german does n't have a massive pile of dog-eared guide books and glossy travel brochures about the world 's best beaches , mountains and museums in their lounge room , their friends will probably take his or her temperature and book an emergency appointment at a travel agency .
and although germans can be found swarming around tourist highlights all around the world , it seems the one place they do n't like to visit is the east of their own country .
according to a poll by the tns-emnid institute , nearly 90 percent of eastern germans had visited the west but just under half of all western germans -lrb- or wessies as they are called here -rrb- have never been to the former ddr .
it seems former communist east germany has a bad reputation despite its picture-postcard towns , wealth of art and culture and beautiful countryside .
hard to shake off communist past " the buildings are old and everything is run down , " said one cologne woman happy to share her opinions about her country 's east , although she 'd never been there .
" nothing is new there . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rise of the right in eastern germany has damaged its reputation some parts of eastern germany had some bad press because of far right attacks on foreigners and an increase in support for extreme right wing parties .
this does n't go down well with wessies who pride themselves on their tolerance .
" they are unemployed and have no motivation for the future so they are racist , " said another wessie .
though high unemployment does n't seem to stop germans visiting other countries such france or romania .
those that do take a look at eastern germany 17 years after the fall of the berlin wall are the elderly with the majority of german visitors to the region over 50 .
where do germans go ?
bildunterschrift : you just ca n't beat the beach for making germans happy within their own country , it seems germans are just suckers for one-liter beers steins , men in leather pants and mountain scenery - more than 20 percent of the 212 million domestic trips made last year were to bavaria .
otherwise , the preferred german holiday destination is spain , spain and spain .
after all , lazing on majorca 's beaches is more relaxing , cheaper , and warmer than wearing out your feet taking a tour of dresden ’ s royal palace . dw staff -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de poland : promoting rural tourism on polish farms for anyone wanting to escape the city , poland 's countryside offers peace of mind , good food and an outgoing friendliness that will put a smile on any city slicker 's face .
eu agricultural funds are making it happen .
-lrb- 21.03.2007 -rrb- happiness is … love and vacation valentine 's day is the day of love .

" we are on a long , narrow road and we have to be patient .
but our two countries are friends . " erdogan , however , added that he felt the criticism he had voiced was " legitimate . " in the magazine interview , the turkish pm was quoted as saying : " seriously , i expected more from germany .
we would like a clear idea of a date , a roadmap and a calendar for negotiations .
the europeans could thereby show our people that they are serious . " he also suggested 2014 or 2015 as a possible date for turkish accession , calling on the eu to decide whether it was a true " family of different cultures or a christian club . " turkish pm makes peace and case for membership but after discussions with the german chancellor , erdogan moderated his criticism , saying there had been a " boost " to the talks under the german presidency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands protested in turkey at the notion that erdogan run for the country 's presidency erdogan also reiterated his belief that turkey had enormous potential and that his country wanted to enter the eu not as a burden but to help carry the burden , noting that turkey had undergone considerable reforms . " every new country in the eu means new markets and new investment opportunities , " he said .
" the turkish economy has become more open and more liberal . " merkel seemed to understand erdogan 's frustrations , saying the european union could open two more chapters of membership talks with turkey by july but reiterated the eu 's stance with turkey over the cyprus dispute . merkel offers progress with cyprus caveat " under the german presidency of the eu , two more chapters could probably be opened if things go well , " said merkel .
" we are looking ahead but the outcome of this process remains open , " she said , adding that it is " important that turkey normalizes ties with cyprus . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel wants the cyprus dispute solved the european union relaunched membership talks with turkey at the end of march after a long hiatus caused by ankara 's refusal to respect its trade obligations to cyprus under a customs agreement with the eu . turkey has refused to open its ports and airports to greek cypriot traffic until the eu lives up to its pledge to end the isolation of the turkish cypriot state in the north of the mediterranean island , which is recognized only by ankara . merkel 's conservative christian democrats oppose turkish membership of the eu and would prefer instead that the secular islamic nation become a " privileged partner " of the 27-member bloc .
but she has agreed to support the eu 's ongoing accession negotiations with ankara as part of her government 's coalition agreement with the center-left social democrats . the social democrats are in favor of turkey joining the eu , a stance reiterated by statements made by foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier on sunday . " security and stability would be raised in europe if turkey is involved , " he said , adding that the reform process in turkey needed to continue and become better integrated if its bid for membership was to be successful . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkish premier criticizes germany ahead of visit turkey 's prime minister recep tayyip erdogan reproached germany for failing to do more to advance his country 's hopes of joining the european union , in an interview to be published on monday .

their caps pulled down low on their heads , two real life boys dressed as max and moritz have snuck up onto the stage .
diekhaus directs the language department of the goethe institute in riga , latvia , and wants to encourage the children to learn german .
there 's lots of work to be done , he said , because the number of german learners has dropped by 10 percent to 11 percent every year since 2000 .
800 years of common history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : humorit wilhelm busch published his max und moritz poem in 1865 latvia 's german connection is hundreds of years old .

when world war ii broke out in 1939 , most of the germans living in latvia moved to germany .
even while under soviet rule after the war , latvia maintained strong connections with communist east germany , and german continued to be taught as a foreign language .

now the goethe institute is stepping up efforts to restore interest in learning the german language . the kids clap their hands as thomas diekhaus is abruptly interrupted while reading " max and moritz , " a famous 19th century poem about the antics of two naughty boys .
their caps pulled down low on their heads , two real life boys dressed as max and moritz have snuck up onto the stage .
diekhaus directs the language department of the goethe institute in riga , latvia , and wants to encourage the children to learn german .
there 's lots of work to be done , he said , because the number of german learners has dropped by 10 percent to 11 percent every year since 2000 .
800 years of common history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : humorit wilhelm busch published his max und moritz poem in 1865 latvia 's german connection is hundreds of years old .
in 1201 , bishop albert from bremen founded the city of riga , now the capital , where the daugava river flows into the baltic sea .
as a member of the hanseatic league , many german traders came to riga and the city flourished .
it also became an important center of trade with russia .
when world war ii broke out in 1939 , most of the germans living in latvia moved to germany .
even while under soviet rule after the war , latvia maintained strong connections with communist east germany , and german continued to be taught as a foreign language .
when the iron curtain collapsed and the soviet union dissolved , latvian students found a renewed interest in the german language - particularly when russian stopped being offered in schools in 1991 .
post-communist business boom today , some 16 years after the fall of communism in eastern europe , germany has become latvia ’ s biggest trading partner .
the newly opened baltic region became an attractive investment location for numerous western companies .
just outside of riga , the german company knauf produces plasterboard that is sold throughout the baltic region .
all of the management personnel have to speak german , said knauf manager peter rumer , since the riga branch has daily contact with co-workers in germany .
" in latvia it ’ s not at all hard to find german-speakers - and good ones at that , " added rumer .
shakespeare vs. goethe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the goethe institute is germany 's world-wide cultural ambassador according to the latvian ministry of education , however , the trend is heading in the opposite direction .
since english was introduced 12 years ago on the recommendation of the school authorities , the number of high school students taking the advanced german exam has dropped by 50 percent .
unlike the goethe institute , the ministry of education does n't see a need for action .
" the ministry of education values multilingualism , however the generally tendency in latvia toward english as a first foreign language can ’ t be avoided , " said gundega muceniece from the ministry .
meanwhile at the goethe institute , max is smoking on stage .
after the first cigarette he gets dizzy and ca n't get a single german word out of his mouth .
even without words , the children understand that max and moritz want to annoy widow bolte 's proud rooster - not an unusual pastime for the two pranksters .

it was a country where nearly 4 million people had died in the civil war since 1997 , a conflict that had raged until the warring sides called an armistice in 2002 . the unsteady peace made it possible for the first free elections in 40 years to take place in 2006 and the 780 soldiers of the eufor force , sent under a mandate from the european union , would be in the capital kinshasa to ensure stability during the voting . despite this ceasefire and these steps towards democracy , there were risks .
there was sporadic fighting across the country , political tensions which threatened to spill out onto the streets and the disturbing problem of child soldiers .
nevertheless , the eu mandate and the german deployment was approved and continued even when the situation in congo deteriorated further as the european soldiers arrived . the conditions for the soldiers on the ground in congo was given little consideration when the application for the german deployment was agreed on ; this seems to be the case in most foreign deployments these days with the soldiers considered little more than a buffer force between warring factions by the politicians making the decisions .
however , the armed forces were consulted about the situation and therefore it was assumed that all aspects of the mission had been discussed and made clear . unacceptable and volatile conditions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many german troops had no idea what to expect in congo the defense commissioner for the german lower house of parliament - the bundestag - even described the living conditions of european soldiers in the congo as " unacceptable " before the german application was made .
the troops lived together for months in the narrowest of tents which soon went moldy in the rainy season , where the air humidity was 90 percent and temperatures were as high as 40 degrees celsius -lrb- 104 degrees f -rrb- .
the monsoon caused floods and made the latrine pits overflow .
there were also defective showers and at times scarcely enough drinking water for the contingent . being separated from their loved ones also brought many problems for the troops .
the workload in kinshasa was more than expected with fighting breaking out between rival factions causing strain on those caught in the conflict and those waiting at home for news .
the uncertainty and worry put strain on marriages and families and brought many to the breaking point . experienced soldiers who had seen action in afghanistan and the balkans had been confronted with conditions like this before , but for the less experienced troops the reality of the misery , decay and the results of a long and brutal civil war made very deep impressions on them .
for many it was not an easy situation . a tinderbox threatening to ignite bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eufor troops soon saw how fragile the peace was far from just monitoring elections in the midst of a fragile ceasefire , the europeans found themselves dealing with riots and battles between drc troops and the forces of presidential candidate jean-pierre bemba . as the election neared , bemba 's bodyguards and armed fighters became increasingly nervous and when government soldiers attacked the candidate 's residence , there was a real chance that the civil war could reignite .
dozens died as a result , and european forces found themselves caught in the middle .
however , if they had not been there , it would have been a lot worse . the situation in kinshasa became like a tinderbox .
seemingly innocuous incidents could become inflammatory in seconds .
soldiers keeping the peace would regularly and suddenly find themselves facing a hostile crowd intent on rioting or criminal gangs moving through the capital . in these cases , the eufor troops had to make split-second decisions to avoid escalation .
was a stone thrown towards them the beginning of an attack or the action of a high-spirited youngster ?
an overreaction from just one soldier could have had catastrophic effects , but a show of weakness or passivity also could have led to severe consequences . to make the right decisions in such a volatile environment requires a high degree of professionalism and judgment .
the soldiers making these types of decisions were in their early twenties and often making them alone . eufor prevented a return to war bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eufor mission was widely seen as a success in the end , it was widely accepted that the decision to station united nations forces in kinshasa , the political center of the country , to provide stability was a successful one .
while the deployment was initially viewed with much skepticism , it eventually gained support and sympathy .
in general , the deployment of the eufor troops was seen as a success and that their presence , particularly during the august riots , was a decisive factor in the prevention of a return to civil war . every soldier at some point questions whether his or her deployment is worth the risk it may put on their life .
the mainly positive reaction of the congolese people by the end of the deployment convinced many that they had done a good and worthwhile job . however , by the end , it also became clear that the deployment of troops in congo could not solve the country 's problems .
a society that works with the government to create peace and stability is established only in parts .
old conflicts continue and they can only be solved by the congolese people themselves . simon wunder is a reserve officer in the bundeswehr and a doctoral candidate in aachen .

" we are on a long , narrow road and we have to be patient .
but our two countries are friends . " erdogan , however , added that he felt the criticism he had voiced was " legitimate . " in the magazine interview , the turkish pm was quoted as saying : " seriously , i expected more from germany .
we would like a clear idea of a date , a roadmap and a calendar for negotiations .
the europeans could thereby show our people that they are serious . " he also suggested 2014 or 2015 as a possible date for turkish accession , calling on the eu to decide whether it was a true " family of different cultures or a christian club . " turkish pm makes peace and case for membership but after discussions with the german chancellor , erdogan moderated his criticism , saying there had been a " boost " to the talks under the german presidency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands protested in turkey at the notion that erdogan run for the country 's presidency erdogan also reiterated his belief that turkey had enormous potential and that his country wanted to enter the eu not as a burden but to help carry the burden , noting that turkey had undergone considerable reforms . " every new country in the eu means new markets and new investment opportunities , " he said .
" the turkish economy has become more open and more liberal . " merkel seemed to understand erdogan 's frustrations , saying the european union could open two more chapters of membership talks with turkey by july but reiterated the eu 's stance with turkey over the cyprus dispute . merkel offers progress with cyprus caveat " under the german presidency of the eu , two more chapters could probably be opened if things go well , " said merkel .

it was a country where nearly 4 million people had died in the civil war since 1997 , a conflict that had raged until the warring sides called an armistice in 2002 . the unsteady peace made it possible for the first free elections in 40 years to take place in 2006 and the 780 soldiers of the eufor force , sent under a mandate from the european union , would be in the capital kinshasa to ensure stability during the voting . despite this ceasefire and these steps towards democracy , there were risks .
there was sporadic fighting across the country , political tensions which threatened to spill out onto the streets and the disturbing problem of child soldiers .
nevertheless , the eu mandate and the german deployment was approved and continued even when the situation in congo deteriorated further as the european soldiers arrived . the conditions for the soldiers on the ground in congo was given little consideration when the application for the german deployment was agreed on ; this seems to be the case in most foreign deployments these days with the soldiers considered little more than a buffer force between warring factions by the politicians making the decisions .
however , the armed forces were consulted about the situation and therefore it was assumed that all aspects of the mission had been discussed and made clear . unacceptable and volatile conditions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many german troops had no idea what to expect in congo the defense commissioner for the german lower house of parliament - the bundestag - even described the living conditions of european soldiers in the congo as " unacceptable " before the german application was made .
the troops lived together for months in the narrowest of tents which soon went moldy in the rainy season , where the air humidity was 90 percent and temperatures were as high as 40 degrees celsius -lrb- 104 degrees f -rrb- .
the monsoon caused floods and made the latrine pits overflow .
there were also defective showers and at times scarcely enough drinking water for the contingent . being separated from their loved ones also brought many problems for the troops .
the workload in kinshasa was more than expected with fighting breaking out between rival factions causing strain on those caught in the conflict and those waiting at home for news .
the uncertainty and worry put strain on marriages and families and brought many to the breaking point . experienced soldiers who had seen action in afghanistan and the balkans had been confronted with conditions like this before , but for the less experienced troops the reality of the misery , decay and the results of a long and brutal civil war made very deep impressions on them .
for many it was not an easy situation . a tinderbox threatening to ignite bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eufor troops soon saw how fragile the peace was far from just monitoring elections in the midst of a fragile ceasefire , the europeans found themselves dealing with riots and battles between drc troops and the forces of presidential candidate jean-pierre bemba . as the election neared , bemba 's bodyguards and armed fighters became increasingly nervous and when government soldiers attacked the candidate 's residence , there was a real chance that the civil war could reignite .
dozens died as a result , and european forces found themselves caught in the middle .
however , if they had not been there , it would have been a lot worse . the situation in kinshasa became like a tinderbox .
seemingly innocuous incidents could become inflammatory in seconds .
soldiers keeping the peace would regularly and suddenly find themselves facing a hostile crowd intent on rioting or criminal gangs moving through the capital . in these cases , the eufor troops had to make split-second decisions to avoid escalation .
was a stone thrown towards them the beginning of an attack or the action of a high-spirited youngster ?
an overreaction from just one soldier could have had catastrophic effects , but a show of weakness or passivity also could have led to severe consequences . to make the right decisions in such a volatile environment requires a high degree of professionalism and judgment .
the soldiers making these types of decisions were in their early twenties and often making them alone . eufor prevented a return to war bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eufor mission was widely seen as a success in the end , it was widely accepted that the decision to station united nations forces in kinshasa , the political center of the country , to provide stability was a successful one .
while the deployment was initially viewed with much skepticism , it eventually gained support and sympathy .
in general , the deployment of the eufor troops was seen as a success and that their presence , particularly during the august riots , was a decisive factor in the prevention of a return to civil war . every soldier at some point questions whether his or her deployment is worth the risk it may put on their life .
the mainly positive reaction of the congolese people by the end of the deployment convinced many that they had done a good and worthwhile job . however , by the end , it also became clear that the deployment of troops in congo could not solve the country 's problems .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 16.04.2007 west germans have hang-ups about going east großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dresden in germany 's east is a unesco world heritage site as they pick up pictures taken over the easter holidays , few western germans are flipping through photos of the country 's east , and experts say not many vacations in the former east germany are being planned . as the world 's undisputed traveling kings , checking out the ultimate holiday deal is virtually a national pastime here in germany .
in fact , if a german does n't have a massive pile of dog-eared guide books and glossy travel brochures about the world 's best beaches , mountains and museums in their lounge room , their friends will probably take his or her temperature and book an emergency appointment at a travel agency .
and although germans can be found swarming around tourist highlights all around the world , it seems the one place they do n't like to visit is the east of their own country .
according to a poll by the tns-emnid institute , nearly 90 percent of eastern germans had visited the west but just under half of all western germans -lrb- or wessies as they are called here -rrb- have never been to the former ddr .
it seems former communist east germany has a bad reputation despite its picture-postcard towns , wealth of art and culture and beautiful countryside .
hard to shake off communist past " the buildings are old and everything is run down , " said one cologne woman happy to share her opinions about her country 's east , although she 'd never been there .
" nothing is new there . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rise of the right in eastern germany has damaged its reputation some parts of eastern germany had some bad press because of far right attacks on foreigners and an increase in support for extreme right wing parties .
this does n't go down well with wessies who pride themselves on their tolerance .
" they are unemployed and have no motivation for the future so they are racist , " said another wessie .
though high unemployment does n't seem to stop germans visiting other countries such france or romania .
those that do take a look at eastern germany 17 years after the fall of the berlin wall are the elderly with the majority of german visitors to the region over 50 .
where do germans go ?

european newpapers have reacted to the beating and arrest of hundreds of russian protesters , including opposition politician garry kasparov . french newspaper le figaro expressed surprise at the events in russia in the light of putin 's domestic support . " the friends of kasparov will not gain any popularity because their demonstrations are suppressed .
the tough actions of the police will not trigger a wave of protest against those in power .
nevertheless , the kremlin is showing an astonishing weakness by reacting so rigorously to the smallest sign of protest , " muses the paper .
austrian newspaper die presse also wondered why the kremlin had acted so brutally : " you really ask yourself whether the people in power in moscow are completely crazy .
apparently , president putin continues to have the backing of 70 percent and more of the population .
what are he and his technocrats afraid of ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : riot police officers detain russian opposition leader garry kasparov it added later : " if this small heap of civil and human rights campaigners , liberals , national bolchevists and anarchists really frightens the putinists so much that they deploy a whole army of police against them , then their power base is n't looking rosy -lrb- … -rrb- in that case , this demonstration of power from the kremlin has actually revealed its weakness . " bulgarian newspaper dnewnik described the beatings and arrests as par for the course .
" really no one should be surprised .
it is enough to remember that the russian president is a former kgb agent and that 90 percent of the leadership in today 's russia are a product of the former secret services . " swiss newspaper basler zeitung argued putin was attempting to deter what had happened in parts of the former soviet union .
" from the point of view of the governing regime of president vladimir putin this makes perfect sense . -lrb- … -rrb- the kremlin has learnt its lesson from the peaceful revolutions in georgia and the ukraine where after blatant vote rigging , protest rallies quickly gained momentum and led to the toppling of the respective governments .
he wants to keep the protests as small as possible and incite fear among normal citizens . " but the paper also questioned whether this approach would really work .
" it may work in the short-term , " it wrote .
" but in the long-term this was rarely a healthy political strategy . " danish newspaper berlingske tidende was damning about russia 's political system .
" you have to be completely blind or excessively tolerant not to see that there is something wrong with russia .
just a year before the elections that mark the end of president putin 's time in office , he has this country so firmly in his grip that democracy is just a shell . " the paper calls upon the international community to do more .
" the eu and the us could happily exercise more pressure than is the case at the moment .
putin can carry out his actions largely unhindered " . finally , german newspaper die welt also urged the west not to beat about the bush .

if you 're the parent of a tokio hotel fan , however , standing in line for hours just got a whole lot better . for the kids , standing for hours on end to get the chance to get a glimpse of their heroes on stage is just part of being infatuated with a pop group .

now they have to stand in almost 40-degree heat for hours , if not days , to make sure said infatuated child is safely ticketed and ensconced in the secure atmosphere of the kindergarten / rock concert of their dreams . this was the case this weekend when tokio hotel were set to play to 8000 screamer pre-teens at the frankfurt festival hall .
in scorching sunshine , the parents of the eight to 15-year old crowd members soon found themselves wilting along with their crazed offspring .
luckily , they also soon found themselves to be the subject of a parental care experiment . local radio broadcaster hr3 , a sponsor of the tokio hotel show , provided parents with refreshments , music to dance to , formula one racing arcade games and other pastimes to help the hours fly by .
mothers queued to have airbrush tattoos painted on while competitive dads fought over the table soccer game .

" it is such a relief that there is somewhere to sit down and something to drink . " " i am more afraid about the kids queuing up alone than i do about them at the concert , " said claudia düsterbeck whose 11-year old daughter was busily making friends with other tokio hotel fans as she sipped from a bottle of cooling water provided by the parental carers .
" when they said this service was available , it eased those fears . " once the queuing was over and the kids rushed to be as close as possible to their idols , the parents relaxed further .
taking advantage of showers set up in the nearby train station and continuing their own fun at the various arcade machines set up around the venue , the adults were well occupied until they could pick up their kids safely again at the concert 's end at nine o 'clock that evening . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic feedback would you take advantage of parental care at a child 's concert ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 16.04.2007 optimism grows on outlook for german economy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : growth is looking stronger than it has in a long time the run of good news for the german economy , europe 's biggest , looks set to continue for some time , with bundesbank president axel weber arguing on monday that current growth marks only the beginning of a longer upturn . the bdi industry federation also upgraded its growth forecast for the current year to 2.5 percent from 2.0 percent previously , even if federation chief jürgen thumann warned the government not to become complacent . the prospect of faster growth in germany is likely to strengthen the european central bank 's arguments for further monetary tightening in the entire 13-country euro zone , analysts said . in an interview published in the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung on monday , bundesbank chief weber said the recent slew of favorable economic news coming from germany was only the beginning , hinting that the central bank might upgrade its growth forecast for the current year . " the entry into the first quarter was very favorable , so there is a possibility that we will upgrade our forecast , " said weber , who as head of the german central bank sits on the ecb 's policy-setting governing council . warnings about complacency bdi chief thumann told a news conference in hanover said the current robust growth would make itself felt on the labor market where unemployment could feasibly fall below 3.5 million . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : exports are the real economic driver but the government must not rest on its laurels , thumann said , urging the ruling left-right coalition to press ahead with decisive structural reforms . " with the global economy set to expand by 5.0 percent , 2.5 percent growth for germany is not much , " thumann said .
" a lot remains to be done . " later this week , germany 's leading economic institutes also look set to raise their own growth forecasts , too . faster growth coupled with accelerating inflation will provide additional ammunition for the ecb to raise euro-zone borrowing costs - already at a five-and-a-year high - again later this year to prevent the economy from overheating . ecb chief jean-claude trichet sent clear signals last week that , with the current upturn set to continue , the guardian of the euro will notch up its benchmark " refi " refinancing rate to 4.0 percent in june . only the beginning ? the government , too , is becoming increasingly optimistic , with economy minister michael glos suggesting recently that berlin might raise its 2007 growth forecast from 1.7 percent to at least 2.0 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european central bank will likely increase rates to stop possible overheating " there are some indications that germany is still only at the beginning of an upturn that looks set to continue in the coming years , " weber said . the euro zone 's biggest economy was in a traditional cyclical upturn , with the strong export performance of past years now feeding through to investment , the central bank chief said . " at the end of last year , companies said they were investing to increase capacity , " he said . and private consumption could similarly start contributing to growth from the middle of the year , as well , weber continued . vat effect that should be the case once the so-called vat effect had faded , he argued , referring to a three-percentage-point increase in value-added or sales tax -lrb- vat -rrb- , which came into effect at the start of this year and which persuaded consumers to bring forward big-ticket purchases to the end of 2006 . recent rises in oil prices had been almost wholly offset by the rise in the value of the euro against the dollar , limiting the negative economic effects , weber said .
and the economic slowdown in the united states would not harm german exports , too much , given the growing importance of dynamic economies such as china and arab states , he argued . in their widely watched spring report , to be published on thursday , the country 's leading economic research institutes are widely expected to raise their forecasts for german growth this year and next year . newspaper reports have said that five of the six think-tanks - ifo in munich , diw in berlin , hwwa in hamburg , ifw in kiel , iwh in halle and rwi in essen - were pencilling 2.5-percent growth for the german economy both in 2007 and 2008 .
in their report last autumn , the institutes had forecast growth of 1.4 percent for 2007 . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany upbeat about economy despite tax hike the expected global economic slowdown and a sharp rise in sales tax will have only a limited impact on the german economy this year when unemployment is expected to fall to a record low , the government said wednesday .

" the entry into the first quarter was very favorable , so there is a possibility that we will upgrade our forecast , " said weber , who as head of the german central bank sits on the ecb 's policy-setting governing council . warnings about complacency bdi chief thumann told a news conference in hanover said the current robust growth would make itself felt on the labor market where unemployment could feasibly fall below 3.5 million . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : exports are the real economic driver but the government must not rest on its laurels , thumann said , urging the ruling left-right coalition to press ahead with decisive structural reforms .

and the economic slowdown in the united states would not harm german exports , too much , given the growing importance of dynamic economies such as china and arab states , he argued . in their widely watched spring report , to be published on thursday , the country 's leading economic research institutes are widely expected to raise their forecasts for german growth this year and next year . newspaper reports have said that five of the six think-tanks - ifo in munich , diw in berlin , hwwa in hamburg , ifw in kiel , iwh in halle and rwi in essen - were pencilling 2.5-percent growth for the german economy both in 2007 and 2008 .

" at the end of last year , companies said they were investing to increase capacity , " he said . and private consumption could similarly start contributing to growth from the middle of the year , as well , weber continued . vat effect that should be the case once the so-called vat effect had faded , he argued , referring to a three-percentage-point increase in value-added or sales tax -lrb- vat -rrb- , which came into effect at the start of this year and which persuaded consumers to bring forward big-ticket purchases to the end of 2006 . recent rises in oil prices had been almost wholly offset by the rise in the value of the euro against the dollar , limiting the negative economic effects , weber said .
and the economic slowdown in the united states would not harm german exports , too much , given the growing importance of dynamic economies such as china and arab states , he argued . in their widely watched spring report , to be published on thursday , the country 's leading economic research institutes are widely expected to raise their forecasts for german growth this year and next year . newspaper reports have said that five of the six think-tanks - ifo in munich , diw in berlin , hwwa in hamburg , ifw in kiel , iwh in halle and rwi in essen - were pencilling 2.5-percent growth for the german economy both in 2007 and 2008 .
in their report last autumn , the institutes had forecast growth of 1.4 percent for 2007 . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany upbeat about economy despite tax hike the expected global economic slowdown and a sharp rise in sales tax will have only a limited impact on the german economy this year when unemployment is expected to fall to a record low , the government said wednesday .

if you 're the parent of a tokio hotel fan , however , standing in line for hours just got a whole lot better . for the kids , standing for hours on end to get the chance to get a glimpse of their heroes on stage is just part of being infatuated with a pop group .
the dedicated fan thinks nothing of camping out for tickets overnight or queuing for a gig for days .
for most , this is not a problem .
teenagers are hardy sorts and - with parental permission - can quite easily withstand the rigors of serious fandom . but for fans of german teen sensations tokio hotel , it is an entirely different pot of eyeliner . while the fans themselves are more than willing to withstand the boredom of lining up with other like-minded souls for the chance to scream at bill , tom , gustav and georg , a large number of those are well below the age of parental consent .
this means that mum and dad have to queue as well .
and this is where the problem lies . a parent 's worst nightmare made bearable bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bill kaulitz takes his skunk / porcupine for a walk mummy and daddy may have only just gotten round to the idea that their offspring is having confusingly carnal thoughts about an androgynous teenage boy with what appears to be a humongous skunk-like porcupine stuck on his head .
now they have to stand in almost 40-degree heat for hours , if not days , to make sure said infatuated child is safely ticketed and ensconced in the secure atmosphere of the kindergarten / rock concert of their dreams . this was the case this weekend when tokio hotel were set to play to 8000 screamer pre-teens at the frankfurt festival hall .
in scorching sunshine , the parents of the eight to 15-year old crowd members soon found themselves wilting along with their crazed offspring .
luckily , they also soon found themselves to be the subject of a parental care experiment . local radio broadcaster hr3 , a sponsor of the tokio hotel show , provided parents with refreshments , music to dance to , formula one racing arcade games and other pastimes to help the hours fly by .
mothers queued to have airbrush tattoos painted on while competitive dads fought over the table soccer game .
for those who had been in line since the early hours of sunday morning , it was a god-send . pass the water , please bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tokio hotel : not as good as showering in a train station " when we found out from the police that there would be parental care , we were very glad , " said simone geppert from cologne who had been in the queue with her husband siggi and daughter selina since five in the morning .
" it is such a relief that there is somewhere to sit down and something to drink . " " i am more afraid about the kids queuing up alone than i do about them at the concert , " said claudia düsterbeck whose 11-year old daughter was busily making friends with other tokio hotel fans as she sipped from a bottle of cooling water provided by the parental carers .
" when they said this service was available , it eased those fears . " once the queuing was over and the kids rushed to be as close as possible to their idols , the parents relaxed further .
taking advantage of showers set up in the nearby train station and continuing their own fun at the various arcade machines set up around the venue , the adults were well occupied until they could pick up their kids safely again at the concert 's end at nine o 'clock that evening . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic feedback would you take advantage of parental care at a child 's concert ?

european newpapers have reacted to the beating and arrest of hundreds of russian protesters , including opposition politician garry kasparov . french newspaper le figaro expressed surprise at the events in russia in the light of putin 's domestic support . " the friends of kasparov will not gain any popularity because their demonstrations are suppressed .
the tough actions of the police will not trigger a wave of protest against those in power .
nevertheless , the kremlin is showing an astonishing weakness by reacting so rigorously to the smallest sign of protest , " muses the paper .
austrian newspaper die presse also wondered why the kremlin had acted so brutally : " you really ask yourself whether the people in power in moscow are completely crazy .
apparently , president putin continues to have the backing of 70 percent and more of the population .
what are he and his technocrats afraid of ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : riot police officers detain russian opposition leader garry kasparov it added later : " if this small heap of civil and human rights campaigners , liberals , national bolchevists and anarchists really frightens the putinists so much that they deploy a whole army of police against them , then their power base is n't looking rosy -lrb- … -rrb- in that case , this demonstration of power from the kremlin has actually revealed its weakness . " bulgarian newspaper dnewnik described the beatings and arrests as par for the course .
" really no one should be surprised .
it is enough to remember that the russian president is a former kgb agent and that 90 percent of the leadership in today 's russia are a product of the former secret services . " swiss newspaper basler zeitung argued putin was attempting to deter what had happened in parts of the former soviet union .
" from the point of view of the governing regime of president vladimir putin this makes perfect sense . -lrb- … -rrb- the kremlin has learnt its lesson from the peaceful revolutions in georgia and the ukraine where after blatant vote rigging , protest rallies quickly gained momentum and led to the toppling of the respective governments .
he wants to keep the protests as small as possible and incite fear among normal citizens . " but the paper also questioned whether this approach would really work .
" it may work in the short-term , " it wrote .
" but in the long-term this was rarely a healthy political strategy . " danish newspaper berlingske tidende was damning about russia 's political system .
" you have to be completely blind or excessively tolerant not to see that there is something wrong with russia .
just a year before the elections that mark the end of president putin 's time in office , he has this country so firmly in his grip that democracy is just a shell . " the paper calls upon the international community to do more .
" the eu and the us could happily exercise more pressure than is the case at the moment .
putin can carry out his actions largely unhindered " . finally , german newspaper die welt also urged the west not to beat about the bush .
the paper says any misguided sense of respect or fear of having russia energy supplies cut should not stop the international community from taking action .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 16.04.2007 optimism grows on outlook for german economy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : growth is looking stronger than it has in a long time the run of good news for the german economy , europe 's biggest , looks set to continue for some time , with bundesbank president axel weber arguing on monday that current growth marks only the beginning of a longer upturn . the bdi industry federation also upgraded its growth forecast for the current year to 2.5 percent from 2.0 percent previously , even if federation chief jürgen thumann warned the government not to become complacent . the prospect of faster growth in germany is likely to strengthen the european central bank 's arguments for further monetary tightening in the entire 13-country euro zone , analysts said . in an interview published in the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung on monday , bundesbank chief weber said the recent slew of favorable economic news coming from germany was only the beginning , hinting that the central bank might upgrade its growth forecast for the current year . " the entry into the first quarter was very favorable , so there is a possibility that we will upgrade our forecast , " said weber , who as head of the german central bank sits on the ecb 's policy-setting governing council . warnings about complacency bdi chief thumann told a news conference in hanover said the current robust growth would make itself felt on the labor market where unemployment could feasibly fall below 3.5 million . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : exports are the real economic driver but the government must not rest on its laurels , thumann said , urging the ruling left-right coalition to press ahead with decisive structural reforms . " with the global economy set to expand by 5.0 percent , 2.5 percent growth for germany is not much , " thumann said .
" a lot remains to be done . " later this week , germany 's leading economic institutes also look set to raise their own growth forecasts , too . faster growth coupled with accelerating inflation will provide additional ammunition for the ecb to raise euro-zone borrowing costs - already at a five-and-a-year high - again later this year to prevent the economy from overheating . ecb chief jean-claude trichet sent clear signals last week that , with the current upturn set to continue , the guardian of the euro will notch up its benchmark " refi " refinancing rate to 4.0 percent in june . only the beginning ? the government , too , is becoming increasingly optimistic , with economy minister michael glos suggesting recently that berlin might raise its 2007 growth forecast from 1.7 percent to at least 2.0 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european central bank will likely increase rates to stop possible overheating " there are some indications that germany is still only at the beginning of an upturn that looks set to continue in the coming years , " weber said . the euro zone 's biggest economy was in a traditional cyclical upturn , with the strong export performance of past years now feeding through to investment , the central bank chief said . " at the end of last year , companies said they were investing to increase capacity , " he said . and private consumption could similarly start contributing to growth from the middle of the year , as well , weber continued . vat effect that should be the case once the so-called vat effect had faded , he argued , referring to a three-percentage-point increase in value-added or sales tax -lrb- vat -rrb- , which came into effect at the start of this year and which persuaded consumers to bring forward big-ticket purchases to the end of 2006 . recent rises in oil prices had been almost wholly offset by the rise in the value of the euro against the dollar , limiting the negative economic effects , weber said .
and the economic slowdown in the united states would not harm german exports , too much , given the growing importance of dynamic economies such as china and arab states , he argued . in their widely watched spring report , to be published on thursday , the country 's leading economic research institutes are widely expected to raise their forecasts for german growth this year and next year . newspaper reports have said that five of the six think-tanks - ifo in munich , diw in berlin , hwwa in hamburg , ifw in kiel , iwh in halle and rwi in essen - were pencilling 2.5-percent growth for the german economy both in 2007 and 2008 .

" the entry into the first quarter was very favorable , so there is a possibility that we will upgrade our forecast , " said weber , who as head of the german central bank sits on the ecb 's policy-setting governing council . warnings about complacency bdi chief thumann told a news conference in hanover said the current robust growth would make itself felt on the labor market where unemployment could feasibly fall below 3.5 million . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : exports are the real economic driver but the government must not rest on its laurels , thumann said , urging the ruling left-right coalition to press ahead with decisive structural reforms .

" a lot remains to be done .

" at the end of last year , companies said they were investing to increase capacity , " he said . and private consumption could similarly start contributing to growth from the middle of the year , as well , weber continued . vat effect that should be the case once the so-called vat effect had faded , he argued , referring to a three-percentage-point increase in value-added or sales tax -lrb- vat -rrb- , which came into effect at the start of this year and which persuaded consumers to bring forward big-ticket purchases to the end of 2006 . recent rises in oil prices had been almost wholly offset by the rise in the value of the euro against the dollar , limiting the negative economic effects , weber said .
and the economic slowdown in the united states would not harm german exports , too much , given the growing importance of dynamic economies such as china and arab states , he argued . in their widely watched spring report , to be published on thursday , the country 's leading economic research institutes are widely expected to raise their forecasts for german growth this year and next year . newspaper reports have said that five of the six think-tanks - ifo in munich , diw in berlin , hwwa in hamburg , ifw in kiel , iwh in halle and rwi in essen - were pencilling 2.5-percent growth for the german economy both in 2007 and 2008 .

european newpapers have reacted to the beating and arrest of hundreds of russian protesters , including opposition politician garry kasparov . french newspaper le figaro expressed surprise at the events in russia in the light of putin 's domestic support . " the friends of kasparov will not gain any popularity because their demonstrations are suppressed .
the tough actions of the police will not trigger a wave of protest against those in power .
nevertheless , the kremlin is showing an astonishing weakness by reacting so rigorously to the smallest sign of protest , " muses the paper .
austrian newspaper die presse also wondered why the kremlin had acted so brutally : " you really ask yourself whether the people in power in moscow are completely crazy .
apparently , president putin continues to have the backing of 70 percent and more of the population .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : riot police officers detain russian opposition leader garry kasparov it added later : " if this small heap of civil and human rights campaigners , liberals , national bolchevists and anarchists really frightens the putinists so much that they deploy a whole army of police against them , then their power base is n't looking rosy -lrb- … -rrb- in that case , this demonstration of power from the kremlin has actually revealed its weakness .

" from the point of view of the governing regime of president vladimir putin this makes perfect sense . -lrb- … -rrb- the kremlin has learnt its lesson from the peaceful revolutions in georgia and the ukraine where after blatant vote rigging , protest rallies quickly gained momentum and led to the toppling of the respective governments .
he wants to keep the protests as small as possible and incite fear among normal citizens . " but the paper also questioned whether this approach would really work .
" it may work in the short-term , " it wrote .

" you have to be completely blind or excessively tolerant not to see that there is something wrong with russia .

if you 're the parent of a tokio hotel fan , however , standing in line for hours just got a whole lot better . for the kids , standing for hours on end to get the chance to get a glimpse of their heroes on stage is just part of being infatuated with a pop group .
the dedicated fan thinks nothing of camping out for tickets overnight or queuing for a gig for days .
for most , this is not a problem .
teenagers are hardy sorts and - with parental permission - can quite easily withstand the rigors of serious fandom . but for fans of german teen sensations tokio hotel , it is an entirely different pot of eyeliner . while the fans themselves are more than willing to withstand the boredom of lining up with other like-minded souls for the chance to scream at bill , tom , gustav and georg , a large number of those are well below the age of parental consent .
this means that mum and dad have to queue as well .
and this is where the problem lies . a parent 's worst nightmare made bearable bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bill kaulitz takes his skunk / porcupine for a walk mummy and daddy may have only just gotten round to the idea that their offspring is having confusingly carnal thoughts about an androgynous teenage boy with what appears to be a humongous skunk-like porcupine stuck on his head .
now they have to stand in almost 40-degree heat for hours , if not days , to make sure said infatuated child is safely ticketed and ensconced in the secure atmosphere of the kindergarten / rock concert of their dreams . this was the case this weekend when tokio hotel were set to play to 8000 screamer pre-teens at the frankfurt festival hall .
in scorching sunshine , the parents of the eight to 15-year old crowd members soon found themselves wilting along with their crazed offspring .
luckily , they also soon found themselves to be the subject of a parental care experiment . local radio broadcaster hr3 , a sponsor of the tokio hotel show , provided parents with refreshments , music to dance to , formula one racing arcade games and other pastimes to help the hours fly by .
mothers queued to have airbrush tattoos painted on while competitive dads fought over the table soccer game .
for those who had been in line since the early hours of sunday morning , it was a god-send . pass the water , please bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tokio hotel : not as good as showering in a train station " when we found out from the police that there would be parental care , we were very glad , " said simone geppert from cologne who had been in the queue with her husband siggi and daughter selina since five in the morning .
" it is such a relief that there is somewhere to sit down and something to drink . " " i am more afraid about the kids queuing up alone than i do about them at the concert , " said claudia düsterbeck whose 11-year old daughter was busily making friends with other tokio hotel fans as she sipped from a bottle of cooling water provided by the parental carers .
" when they said this service was available , it eased those fears . " once the queuing was over and the kids rushed to be as close as possible to their idols , the parents relaxed further .
taking advantage of showers set up in the nearby train station and continuing their own fun at the various arcade machines set up around the venue , the adults were well occupied until they could pick up their kids safely again at the concert 's end at nine o 'clock that evening . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic feedback would you take advantage of parental care at a child 's concert ?

if you 're the parent of a tokio hotel fan , however , standing in line for hours just got a whole lot better . for the kids , standing for hours on end to get the chance to get a glimpse of their heroes on stage is just part of being infatuated with a pop group .
the dedicated fan thinks nothing of camping out for tickets overnight or queuing for a gig for days .
for most , this is not a problem .
teenagers are hardy sorts and - with parental permission - can quite easily withstand the rigors of serious fandom . but for fans of german teen sensations tokio hotel , it is an entirely different pot of eyeliner . while the fans themselves are more than willing to withstand the boredom of lining up with other like-minded souls for the chance to scream at bill , tom , gustav and georg , a large number of those are well below the age of parental consent .
this means that mum and dad have to queue as well .
and this is where the problem lies . a parent 's worst nightmare made bearable bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bill kaulitz takes his skunk / porcupine for a walk mummy and daddy may have only just gotten round to the idea that their offspring is having confusingly carnal thoughts about an androgynous teenage boy with what appears to be a humongous skunk-like porcupine stuck on his head .
now they have to stand in almost 40-degree heat for hours , if not days , to make sure said infatuated child is safely ticketed and ensconced in the secure atmosphere of the kindergarten / rock concert of their dreams . this was the case this weekend when tokio hotel were set to play to 8000 screamer pre-teens at the frankfurt festival hall .
in scorching sunshine , the parents of the eight to 15-year old crowd members soon found themselves wilting along with their crazed offspring .
luckily , they also soon found themselves to be the subject of a parental care experiment . local radio broadcaster hr3 , a sponsor of the tokio hotel show , provided parents with refreshments , music to dance to , formula one racing arcade games and other pastimes to help the hours fly by .
mothers queued to have airbrush tattoos painted on while competitive dads fought over the table soccer game .
for those who had been in line since the early hours of sunday morning , it was a god-send . pass the water , please bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tokio hotel : not as good as showering in a train station " when we found out from the police that there would be parental care , we were very glad , " said simone geppert from cologne who had been in the queue with her husband siggi and daughter selina since five in the morning .
" it is such a relief that there is somewhere to sit down and something to drink . " " i am more afraid about the kids queuing up alone than i do about them at the concert , " said claudia düsterbeck whose 11-year old daughter was busily making friends with other tokio hotel fans as she sipped from a bottle of cooling water provided by the parental carers .
" when they said this service was available , it eased those fears . " once the queuing was over and the kids rushed to be as close as possible to their idols , the parents relaxed further .
taking advantage of showers set up in the nearby train station and continuing their own fun at the various arcade machines set up around the venue , the adults were well occupied until they could pick up their kids safely again at the concert 's end at nine o 'clock that evening . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

european newpapers have reacted to the beating and arrest of hundreds of russian protesters , including opposition politician garry kasparov . french newspaper le figaro expressed surprise at the events in russia in the light of putin 's domestic support . " the friends of kasparov will not gain any popularity because their demonstrations are suppressed .
the tough actions of the police will not trigger a wave of protest against those in power .
nevertheless , the kremlin is showing an astonishing weakness by reacting so rigorously to the smallest sign of protest , " muses the paper .
austrian newspaper die presse also wondered why the kremlin had acted so brutally : " you really ask yourself whether the people in power in moscow are completely crazy .
apparently , president putin continues to have the backing of 70 percent and more of the population .
what are he and his technocrats afraid of ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : riot police officers detain russian opposition leader garry kasparov it added later : " if this small heap of civil and human rights campaigners , liberals , national bolchevists and anarchists really frightens the putinists so much that they deploy a whole army of police against them , then their power base is n't looking rosy -lrb- … -rrb- in that case , this demonstration of power from the kremlin has actually revealed its weakness . " bulgarian newspaper dnewnik described the beatings and arrests as par for the course .
" really no one should be surprised .
it is enough to remember that the russian president is a former kgb agent and that 90 percent of the leadership in today 's russia are a product of the former secret services . " swiss newspaper basler zeitung argued putin was attempting to deter what had happened in parts of the former soviet union .
" from the point of view of the governing regime of president vladimir putin this makes perfect sense . -lrb- … -rrb- the kremlin has learnt its lesson from the peaceful revolutions in georgia and the ukraine where after blatant vote rigging , protest rallies quickly gained momentum and led to the toppling of the respective governments .
he wants to keep the protests as small as possible and incite fear among normal citizens . " but the paper also questioned whether this approach would really work .
" it may work in the short-term , " it wrote .
" but in the long-term this was rarely a healthy political strategy . " danish newspaper berlingske tidende was damning about russia 's political system .
" you have to be completely blind or excessively tolerant not to see that there is something wrong with russia .
just a year before the elections that mark the end of president putin 's time in office , he has this country so firmly in his grip that democracy is just a shell . " the paper calls upon the international community to do more .
" the eu and the us could happily exercise more pressure than is the case at the moment .
putin can carry out his actions largely unhindered " . finally , german newspaper die welt also urged the west not to beat about the bush .
the paper says any misguided sense of respect or fear of having russia energy supplies cut should not stop the international community from taking action .

european newpapers have reacted to the beating and arrest of hundreds of russian protesters , including opposition politician garry kasparov . french newspaper le figaro expressed surprise at the events in russia in the light of putin 's domestic support . " the friends of kasparov will not gain any popularity because their demonstrations are suppressed .
the tough actions of the police will not trigger a wave of protest against those in power .
nevertheless , the kremlin is showing an astonishing weakness by reacting so rigorously to the smallest sign of protest , " muses the paper .
austrian newspaper die presse also wondered why the kremlin had acted so brutally : " you really ask yourself whether the people in power in moscow are completely crazy .
apparently , president putin continues to have the backing of 70 percent and more of the population .
what are he and his technocrats afraid of ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : riot police officers detain russian opposition leader garry kasparov it added later : " if this small heap of civil and human rights campaigners , liberals , national bolchevists and anarchists really frightens the putinists so much that they deploy a whole army of police against them , then their power base is n't looking rosy -lrb- … -rrb- in that case , this demonstration of power from the kremlin has actually revealed its weakness . " bulgarian newspaper dnewnik described the beatings and arrests as par for the course .
" really no one should be surprised .
it is enough to remember that the russian president is a former kgb agent and that 90 percent of the leadership in today 's russia are a product of the former secret services . " swiss newspaper basler zeitung argued putin was attempting to deter what had happened in parts of the former soviet union .
" from the point of view of the governing regime of president vladimir putin this makes perfect sense . -lrb- … -rrb- the kremlin has learnt its lesson from the peaceful revolutions in georgia and the ukraine where after blatant vote rigging , protest rallies quickly gained momentum and led to the toppling of the respective governments .
he wants to keep the protests as small as possible and incite fear among normal citizens . " but the paper also questioned whether this approach would really work .
" it may work in the short-term , " it wrote .
" but in the long-term this was rarely a healthy political strategy . " danish newspaper berlingske tidende was damning about russia 's political system .
" you have to be completely blind or excessively tolerant not to see that there is something wrong with russia .
just a year before the elections that mark the end of president putin 's time in office , he has this country so firmly in his grip that democracy is just a shell . " the paper calls upon the international community to do more .
" the eu and the us could happily exercise more pressure than is the case at the moment .
putin can carry out his actions largely unhindered " . finally , german newspaper die welt also urged the west not to beat about the bush .
the paper says any misguided sense of respect or fear of having russia energy supplies cut should not stop the international community from taking action .

" the entry into the first quarter was very favorable , so there is a possibility that we will upgrade our forecast , " said weber , who as head of the german central bank sits on the ecb 's policy-setting governing council . warnings about complacency bdi chief thumann told a news conference in hanover said the current robust growth would make itself felt on the labor market where unemployment could feasibly fall below 3.5 million . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : exports are the real economic driver but the government must not rest on its laurels , thumann said , urging the ruling left-right coalition to press ahead with decisive structural reforms . " with the global economy set to expand by 5.0 percent , 2.5 percent growth for germany is not much , " thumann said .
" a lot remains to be done . " later this week , germany 's leading economic institutes also look set to raise their own growth forecasts , too . faster growth coupled with accelerating inflation will provide additional ammunition for the ecb to raise euro-zone borrowing costs - already at a five-and-a-year high - again later this year to prevent the economy from overheating . ecb chief jean-claude trichet sent clear signals last week that , with the current upturn set to continue , the guardian of the euro will notch up its benchmark " refi " refinancing rate to 4.0 percent in june . only the beginning ? the government , too , is becoming increasingly optimistic , with economy minister michael glos suggesting recently that berlin might raise its 2007 growth forecast from 1.7 percent to at least 2.0 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european central bank will likely increase rates to stop possible overheating " there are some indications that germany is still only at the beginning of an upturn that looks set to continue in the coming years , " weber said . the euro zone 's biggest economy was in a traditional cyclical upturn , with the strong export performance of past years now feeding through to investment , the central bank chief said . " at the end of last year , companies said they were investing to increase capacity , " he said . and private consumption could similarly start contributing to growth from the middle of the year , as well , weber continued . vat effect that should be the case once the so-called vat effect had faded , he argued , referring to a three-percentage-point increase in value-added or sales tax -lrb- vat -rrb- , which came into effect at the start of this year and which persuaded consumers to bring forward big-ticket purchases to the end of 2006 . recent rises in oil prices had been almost wholly offset by the rise in the value of the euro against the dollar , limiting the negative economic effects , weber said .
and the economic slowdown in the united states would not harm german exports , too much , given the growing importance of dynamic economies such as china and arab states , he argued . in their widely watched spring report , to be published on thursday , the country 's leading economic research institutes are widely expected to raise their forecasts for german growth this year and next year . newspaper reports have said that five of the six think-tanks - ifo in munich , diw in berlin , hwwa in hamburg , ifw in kiel , iwh in halle and rwi in essen - were pencilling 2.5-percent growth for the german economy both in 2007 and 2008 .
in their report last autumn , the institutes had forecast growth of 1.4 percent for 2007 . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany upbeat about economy despite tax hike the expected global economic slowdown and a sharp rise in sales tax will have only a limited impact on the german economy this year when unemployment is expected to fall to a record low , the government said wednesday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 16.04.2007 optimism grows on outlook for german economy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : growth is looking stronger than it has in a long time the run of good news for the german economy , europe 's biggest , looks set to continue for some time , with bundesbank president axel weber arguing on monday that current growth marks only the beginning of a longer upturn . the bdi industry federation also upgraded its growth forecast for the current year to 2.5 percent from 2.0 percent previously , even if federation chief jürgen thumann warned the government not to become complacent . the prospect of faster growth in germany is likely to strengthen the european central bank 's arguments for further monetary tightening in the entire 13-country euro zone , analysts said . in an interview published in the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung on monday , bundesbank chief weber said the recent slew of favorable economic news coming from germany was only the beginning , hinting that the central bank might upgrade its growth forecast for the current year . " the entry into the first quarter was very favorable , so there is a possibility that we will upgrade our forecast , " said weber , who as head of the german central bank sits on the ecb 's policy-setting governing council . warnings about complacency bdi chief thumann told a news conference in hanover said the current robust growth would make itself felt on the labor market where unemployment could feasibly fall below 3.5 million . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : exports are the real economic driver but the government must not rest on its laurels , thumann said , urging the ruling left-right coalition to press ahead with decisive structural reforms . " with the global economy set to expand by 5.0 percent , 2.5 percent growth for germany is not much , " thumann said .
" a lot remains to be done . " later this week , germany 's leading economic institutes also look set to raise their own growth forecasts , too . faster growth coupled with accelerating inflation will provide additional ammunition for the ecb to raise euro-zone borrowing costs - already at a five-and-a-year high - again later this year to prevent the economy from overheating . ecb chief jean-claude trichet sent clear signals last week that , with the current upturn set to continue , the guardian of the euro will notch up its benchmark " refi " refinancing rate to 4.0 percent in june . only the beginning ? the government , too , is becoming increasingly optimistic , with economy minister michael glos suggesting recently that berlin might raise its 2007 growth forecast from 1.7 percent to at least 2.0 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european central bank will likely increase rates to stop possible overheating " there are some indications that germany is still only at the beginning of an upturn that looks set to continue in the coming years , " weber said . the euro zone 's biggest economy was in a traditional cyclical upturn , with the strong export performance of past years now feeding through to investment , the central bank chief said . " at the end of last year , companies said they were investing to increase capacity , " he said . and private consumption could similarly start contributing to growth from the middle of the year , as well , weber continued . vat effect that should be the case once the so-called vat effect had faded , he argued , referring to a three-percentage-point increase in value-added or sales tax -lrb- vat -rrb- , which came into effect at the start of this year and which persuaded consumers to bring forward big-ticket purchases to the end of 2006 . recent rises in oil prices had been almost wholly offset by the rise in the value of the euro against the dollar , limiting the negative economic effects , weber said .
and the economic slowdown in the united states would not harm german exports , too much , given the growing importance of dynamic economies such as china and arab states , he argued . in their widely watched spring report , to be published on thursday , the country 's leading economic research institutes are widely expected to raise their forecasts for german growth this year and next year . newspaper reports have said that five of the six think-tanks - ifo in munich , diw in berlin , hwwa in hamburg , ifw in kiel , iwh in halle and rwi in essen - were pencilling 2.5-percent growth for the german economy both in 2007 and 2008 .
in their report last autumn , the institutes had forecast growth of 1.4 percent for 2007 . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany upbeat about economy despite tax hike the expected global economic slowdown and a sharp rise in sales tax will have only a limited impact on the german economy this year when unemployment is expected to fall to a record low , the government said wednesday .

but it 's not german pope benedict xiv who is responsible for the tax boon - rather it 's the country 's pumping economy . the catholic church in germany had a bumper year in 2006 .
according to recent estimates , the 27 dioceses on average took in some eight percent more when compared to 2005 .
financial experts for the church expect that revenue for 2007 could amount to 4.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 6 billion -rrb- - 500 million euros more than two years ago . germany has a system of ecclesiastical financing unique to only a few european countries .
germany 's 28 million catholics - along with other members of state-recognized religions - are obligated to pay their churches a tax of between 8 percent and 9 percent , depending on where they live . the federal tax office automatically deducts this from people 's monthly pay packets every month , with the result that germany 's churches are among the richest in the world . catholics leaving in droves despite this comfortable tax arrangement , the last few years have n't been too kind to the catholic church . between 2000 and 2005 , more than 680,000 people officially registered to leave the church and free themselves from their tax obligations -lrb- and their right to receive the sacraments at the same time -rrb- .
in addition , germany 's sluggish economy with its high unemployment rates and lower wages meant there was even less money available to tax . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : apart from mass events like world youth day , more and more christians are becoming disenchanted with the church but now , things are looking up because the levy , the church 's biggest single source of income , is back up to levels not seen since 1998 . according to sebastian anneser , the financial director of the catholic archdiocese of munich and freising , a key reason for this " surprising " development is increasing business confidence and its positive effects on employment . in his march budget statement , though , anneser warned the increase " was n't expected to hold in the long-term " because a combination of low birthrates , aging population and waning interest were causing people to " turn their backs on the church . " however , the church has managed to stem the floodtide somewhat - the rate at which people are abandoning catholic pews has fallen sharply in the past few years . german in the vatican while there have been some suggestions that this is because a german now sits on the papal chair , the catholic church itself is hesitant to make this connection . " curiosity about the catholic church and religion has definitely increased because of -lrb- joseph -rrb- ratzinger becoming pope in 2005 as well as the death of pope john paul ii , " said adelheid utters-adam , a spokesperson for the munich archdiocese in ratzinger 's home state of bavaria . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benedict xvi is the first german pope in nearly 500 years " but there was a significant fall in the rate of people leaving in 2004 and that definitely does n't have anything to do with the current pope , " utters-adam said . in fact , according to some , having a german sitting in the papal chair could actually be a liability for germany 's catholic church . " every time -lrb- pope benedict -rrb- has visited bavaria , there has been a dramatic rise in the number of departures from the church , " said carsten frerk , a sociologist who researches religious institutions . the last papal visit cost 30 million euros . " that annoyed many people who thought the money could have otherwise been better spent on social projects instead of a media spectacle , " frerk said . back to the collection plate ? according to frerk , it 's not just the church which is becoming increasingly unpopular , it 's also the church tax system . " polls show that around 60 percent of people are against collecting the tax in this way - they would prefer to donate voluntarily , " frerk said .
interestingly though , only a third of those surveyed " knew exactly how much church tax they paid , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the governments of denmark , finland , austria and parts of switzerland also collect church tax " that 's the ingenious thing about the system - the tax is just deducted automatically , " he said . thirty five-year-old teacher marion corpus decided to cancel her church contributions four years ago .
she said it was n't until she got a new job that came with an easier to read pay slip that she realized for the first time how much cash she was giving the church . " it was about 80 euros a month , " corpus said .
" i thought i could do something better with the money because i did n't like what the church was doing .
instead , i 've now got a monthly membership to amnesty international plus i sponsor a child in malawi . " despite the system 's unpopularity , the right of recognized churches to tax its adherents is enshrined in the german constitution .
the government only collects the levy because churches contract it to do so .
but this arrangement is unlikely to change any time soon - after all , the state gets to keep three percent of the all money it amasses through the church tax . kate hairsine send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de as church loses appeal , protestants try rebranding religion 490 years after martin luther nailed his ninety-five theses to a door in wittenberg , the city is the staging post for a revival aimed at reversing the fortunes of the nation 's ailing protestant church .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 16.04.2007 economic boom , not pope , helps catholic church in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's taxes , not church collections , that make german dioceses the world 's richest the german catholic church has raked in more church tax for the first time since 2000 .
but it 's not german pope benedict xiv who is responsible for the tax boon - rather it 's the country 's pumping economy . the catholic church in germany had a bumper year in 2006 .
according to recent estimates , the 27 dioceses on average took in some eight percent more when compared to 2005 .
financial experts for the church expect that revenue for 2007 could amount to 4.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 6 billion -rrb- - 500 million euros more than two years ago . germany has a system of ecclesiastical financing unique to only a few european countries .
germany 's 28 million catholics - along with other members of state-recognized religions - are obligated to pay their churches a tax of between 8 percent and 9 percent , depending on where they live . the federal tax office automatically deducts this from people 's monthly pay packets every month , with the result that germany 's churches are among the richest in the world . catholics leaving in droves despite this comfortable tax arrangement , the last few years have n't been too kind to the catholic church . between 2000 and 2005 , more than 680,000 people officially registered to leave the church and free themselves from their tax obligations -lrb- and their right to receive the sacraments at the same time -rrb- .
in addition , germany 's sluggish economy with its high unemployment rates and lower wages meant there was even less money available to tax . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : apart from mass events like world youth day , more and more christians are becoming disenchanted with the church but now , things are looking up because the levy , the church 's biggest single source of income , is back up to levels not seen since 1998 . according to sebastian anneser , the financial director of the catholic archdiocese of munich and freising , a key reason for this " surprising " development is increasing business confidence and its positive effects on employment . in his march budget statement , though , anneser warned the increase " was n't expected to hold in the long-term " because a combination of low birthrates , aging population and waning interest were causing people to " turn their backs on the church . " however , the church has managed to stem the floodtide somewhat - the rate at which people are abandoning catholic pews has fallen sharply in the past few years . german in the vatican while there have been some suggestions that this is because a german now sits on the papal chair , the catholic church itself is hesitant to make this connection . " curiosity about the catholic church and religion has definitely increased because of -lrb- joseph -rrb- ratzinger becoming pope in 2005 as well as the death of pope john paul ii , " said adelheid utters-adam , a spokesperson for the munich archdiocese in ratzinger 's home state of bavaria . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benedict xvi is the first german pope in nearly 500 years " but there was a significant fall in the rate of people leaving in 2004 and that definitely does n't have anything to do with the current pope , " utters-adam said . in fact , according to some , having a german sitting in the papal chair could actually be a liability for germany 's catholic church . " every time -lrb- pope benedict -rrb- has visited bavaria , there has been a dramatic rise in the number of departures from the church , " said carsten frerk , a sociologist who researches religious institutions . the last papal visit cost 30 million euros . " that annoyed many people who thought the money could have otherwise been better spent on social projects instead of a media spectacle , " frerk said . back to the collection plate ? according to frerk , it 's not just the church which is becoming increasingly unpopular , it 's also the church tax system .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 16.04.2007 goethe institute picks up long german tradition in latvia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : riga , latvia 's capital , had contact to germany as a member of the hanseatic league latvia has traditionally had close ties to germany , ever since its capital city riga was founded by a german in 1201 .
now the goethe institute is stepping up efforts to restore interest in learning the german language . the kids clap their hands as thomas diekhaus is abruptly interrupted while reading " max and moritz , " a famous 19th century poem about the antics of two naughty boys .
their caps pulled down low on their heads , two real life boys dressed as max and moritz have snuck up onto the stage .
diekhaus directs the language department of the goethe institute in riga , latvia , and wants to encourage the children to learn german .
there 's lots of work to be done , he said , because the number of german learners has dropped by 10 percent to 11 percent every year since 2000 .
800 years of common history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : humorit wilhelm busch published his max und moritz poem in 1865 latvia 's german connection is hundreds of years old .
in 1201 , bishop albert from bremen founded the city of riga , now the capital , where the daugava river flows into the baltic sea .
as a member of the hanseatic league , many german traders came to riga and the city flourished .
it also became an important center of trade with russia .
when world war ii broke out in 1939 , most of the germans living in latvia moved to germany .
even while under soviet rule after the war , latvia maintained strong connections with communist east germany , and german continued to be taught as a foreign language .
when the iron curtain collapsed and the soviet union dissolved , latvian students found a renewed interest in the german language - particularly when russian stopped being offered in schools in 1991 .
post-communist business boom today , some 16 years after the fall of communism in eastern europe , germany has become latvia ’ s biggest trading partner .
the newly opened baltic region became an attractive investment location for numerous western companies .
just outside of riga , the german company knauf produces plasterboard that is sold throughout the baltic region .
all of the management personnel have to speak german , said knauf manager peter rumer , since the riga branch has daily contact with co-workers in germany .
" in latvia it ’ s not at all hard to find german-speakers - and good ones at that , " added rumer .
shakespeare vs. goethe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the goethe institute is germany 's world-wide cultural ambassador according to the latvian ministry of education , however , the trend is heading in the opposite direction .
since english was introduced 12 years ago on the recommendation of the school authorities , the number of high school students taking the advanced german exam has dropped by 50 percent .
unlike the goethe institute , the ministry of education does n't see a need for action .
" the ministry of education values multilingualism , however the generally tendency in latvia toward english as a first foreign language can ’ t be avoided , " said gundega muceniece from the ministry .
meanwhile at the goethe institute , max is smoking on stage .
after the first cigarette he gets dizzy and ca n't get a single german word out of his mouth .
even without words , the children understand that max and moritz want to annoy widow bolte 's proud rooster - not an unusual pastime for the two pranksters .
catching up " what people missed at school they have to catch up on at the goethe institute , " said the institute 's director rudolf de baey .
" that 's good for business , but not for german-latvian relations . "
max has just promised his friend moritz that he wants to start learning a few german vocabulary words .
after all , both of them want to travel as soon as possible to all of the german-speaking countries in europe . aya bach -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de danes worry english onslaught could undermine the language danish linguists have warned the government that the increasing use of english in the country , especially in education , could wear away at the very foundation of danish .

now the goethe institute is stepping up efforts to restore interest in learning the german language . the kids clap their hands as thomas diekhaus is abruptly interrupted while reading " max and moritz , " a famous 19th century poem about the antics of two naughty boys .
their caps pulled down low on their heads , two real life boys dressed as max and moritz have snuck up onto the stage .
diekhaus directs the language department of the goethe institute in riga , latvia , and wants to encourage the children to learn german .
there 's lots of work to be done , he said , because the number of german learners has dropped by 10 percent to 11 percent every year since 2000 .
800 years of common history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : humorit wilhelm busch published his max und moritz poem in 1865 latvia 's german connection is hundreds of years old .
in 1201 , bishop albert from bremen founded the city of riga , now the capital , where the daugava river flows into the baltic sea .
as a member of the hanseatic league , many german traders came to riga and the city flourished .
it also became an important center of trade with russia .
when world war ii broke out in 1939 , most of the germans living in latvia moved to germany .
even while under soviet rule after the war , latvia maintained strong connections with communist east germany , and german continued to be taught as a foreign language .
when the iron curtain collapsed and the soviet union dissolved , latvian students found a renewed interest in the german language - particularly when russian stopped being offered in schools in 1991 .
post-communist business boom today , some 16 years after the fall of communism in eastern europe , germany has become latvia ’ s biggest trading partner .
the newly opened baltic region became an attractive investment location for numerous western companies .
just outside of riga , the german company knauf produces plasterboard that is sold throughout the baltic region .
all of the management personnel have to speak german , said knauf manager peter rumer , since the riga branch has daily contact with co-workers in germany .
" in latvia it ’ s not at all hard to find german-speakers - and good ones at that , " added rumer .
shakespeare vs. goethe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the goethe institute is germany 's world-wide cultural ambassador according to the latvian ministry of education , however , the trend is heading in the opposite direction .
since english was introduced 12 years ago on the recommendation of the school authorities , the number of high school students taking the advanced german exam has dropped by 50 percent .
unlike the goethe institute , the ministry of education does n't see a need for action .
" the ministry of education values multilingualism , however the generally tendency in latvia toward english as a first foreign language can ’ t be avoided , " said gundega muceniece from the ministry .
meanwhile at the goethe institute , max is smoking on stage .
after the first cigarette he gets dizzy and ca n't get a single german word out of his mouth .
even without words , the children understand that max and moritz want to annoy widow bolte 's proud rooster - not an unusual pastime for the two pranksters .
catching up " what people missed at school they have to catch up on at the goethe institute , " said the institute 's director rudolf de baey .
" that 's good for business , but not for german-latvian relations . "

now the goethe institute is stepping up efforts to restore interest in learning the german language . the kids clap their hands as thomas diekhaus is abruptly interrupted while reading " max and moritz , " a famous 19th century poem about the antics of two naughty boys .
their caps pulled down low on their heads , two real life boys dressed as max and moritz have snuck up onto the stage .
diekhaus directs the language department of the goethe institute in riga , latvia , and wants to encourage the children to learn german .
there 's lots of work to be done , he said , because the number of german learners has dropped by 10 percent to 11 percent every year since 2000 .
800 years of common history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : humorit wilhelm busch published his max und moritz poem in 1865 latvia 's german connection is hundreds of years old .
in 1201 , bishop albert from bremen founded the city of riga , now the capital , where the daugava river flows into the baltic sea .
as a member of the hanseatic league , many german traders came to riga and the city flourished .
it also became an important center of trade with russia .
when world war ii broke out in 1939 , most of the germans living in latvia moved to germany .
even while under soviet rule after the war , latvia maintained strong connections with communist east germany , and german continued to be taught as a foreign language .

it was a country where nearly 4 million people had died in the civil war since 1997 , a conflict that had raged until the warring sides called an armistice in 2002 . the unsteady peace made it possible for the first free elections in 40 years to take place in 2006 and the 780 soldiers of the eufor force , sent under a mandate from the european union , would be in the capital kinshasa to ensure stability during the voting . despite this ceasefire and these steps towards democracy , there were risks .
there was sporadic fighting across the country , political tensions which threatened to spill out onto the streets and the disturbing problem of child soldiers .
nevertheless , the eu mandate and the german deployment was approved and continued even when the situation in congo deteriorated further as the european soldiers arrived . the conditions for the soldiers on the ground in congo was given little consideration when the application for the german deployment was agreed on ; this seems to be the case in most foreign deployments these days with the soldiers considered little more than a buffer force between warring factions by the politicians making the decisions .
however , the armed forces were consulted about the situation and therefore it was assumed that all aspects of the mission had been discussed and made clear . unacceptable and volatile conditions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many german troops had no idea what to expect in congo the defense commissioner for the german lower house of parliament - the bundestag - even described the living conditions of european soldiers in the congo as " unacceptable " before the german application was made .
the troops lived together for months in the narrowest of tents which soon went moldy in the rainy season , where the air humidity was 90 percent and temperatures were as high as 40 degrees celsius -lrb- 104 degrees f -rrb- .
the monsoon caused floods and made the latrine pits overflow .
there were also defective showers and at times scarcely enough drinking water for the contingent . being separated from their loved ones also brought many problems for the troops .
the workload in kinshasa was more than expected with fighting breaking out between rival factions causing strain on those caught in the conflict and those waiting at home for news .
the uncertainty and worry put strain on marriages and families and brought many to the breaking point . experienced soldiers who had seen action in afghanistan and the balkans had been confronted with conditions like this before , but for the less experienced troops the reality of the misery , decay and the results of a long and brutal civil war made very deep impressions on them .
for many it was not an easy situation . a tinderbox threatening to ignite bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eufor troops soon saw how fragile the peace was far from just monitoring elections in the midst of a fragile ceasefire , the europeans found themselves dealing with riots and battles between drc troops and the forces of presidential candidate jean-pierre bemba . as the election neared , bemba 's bodyguards and armed fighters became increasingly nervous and when government soldiers attacked the candidate 's residence , there was a real chance that the civil war could reignite .
dozens died as a result , and european forces found themselves caught in the middle .
however , if they had not been there , it would have been a lot worse . the situation in kinshasa became like a tinderbox .
seemingly innocuous incidents could become inflammatory in seconds .
soldiers keeping the peace would regularly and suddenly find themselves facing a hostile crowd intent on rioting or criminal gangs moving through the capital . in these cases , the eufor troops had to make split-second decisions to avoid escalation .
was a stone thrown towards them the beginning of an attack or the action of a high-spirited youngster ?
an overreaction from just one soldier could have had catastrophic effects , but a show of weakness or passivity also could have led to severe consequences . to make the right decisions in such a volatile environment requires a high degree of professionalism and judgment .
the soldiers making these types of decisions were in their early twenties and often making them alone . eufor prevented a return to war bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eufor mission was widely seen as a success in the end , it was widely accepted that the decision to station united nations forces in kinshasa , the political center of the country , to provide stability was a successful one .

in general , the deployment of the eufor troops was seen as a success and that their presence , particularly during the august riots , was a decisive factor in the prevention of a return to civil war . every soldier at some point questions whether his or her deployment is worth the risk it may put on their life .

european newpapers have reacted to the beating and arrest of hundreds of russian protesters , including opposition politician garry kasparov . french newspaper le figaro expressed surprise at the events in russia in the light of putin 's domestic support . " the friends of kasparov will not gain any popularity because their demonstrations are suppressed .
the tough actions of the police will not trigger a wave of protest against those in power .
nevertheless , the kremlin is showing an astonishing weakness by reacting so rigorously to the smallest sign of protest , " muses the paper .
austrian newspaper die presse also wondered why the kremlin had acted so brutally : " you really ask yourself whether the people in power in moscow are completely crazy .
apparently , president putin continues to have the backing of 70 percent and more of the population .
what are he and his technocrats afraid of ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : riot police officers detain russian opposition leader garry kasparov it added later : " if this small heap of civil and human rights campaigners , liberals , national bolchevists and anarchists really frightens the putinists so much that they deploy a whole army of police against them , then their power base is n't looking rosy -lrb- … -rrb- in that case , this demonstration of power from the kremlin has actually revealed its weakness . " bulgarian newspaper dnewnik described the beatings and arrests as par for the course .
" really no one should be surprised .
it is enough to remember that the russian president is a former kgb agent and that 90 percent of the leadership in today 's russia are a product of the former secret services . " swiss newspaper basler zeitung argued putin was attempting to deter what had happened in parts of the former soviet union .
" from the point of view of the governing regime of president vladimir putin this makes perfect sense . -lrb- … -rrb- the kremlin has learnt its lesson from the peaceful revolutions in georgia and the ukraine where after blatant vote rigging , protest rallies quickly gained momentum and led to the toppling of the respective governments .
he wants to keep the protests as small as possible and incite fear among normal citizens . " but the paper also questioned whether this approach would really work .
" it may work in the short-term , " it wrote .
" but in the long-term this was rarely a healthy political strategy . " danish newspaper berlingske tidende was damning about russia 's political system .
" you have to be completely blind or excessively tolerant not to see that there is something wrong with russia .
just a year before the elections that mark the end of president putin 's time in office , he has this country so firmly in his grip that democracy is just a shell . " the paper calls upon the international community to do more .
" the eu and the us could happily exercise more pressure than is the case at the moment .
putin can carry out his actions largely unhindered " . finally , german newspaper die welt also urged the west not to beat about the bush .
the paper says any misguided sense of respect or fear of having russia energy supplies cut should not stop the international community from taking action .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 16.04.2007 a soldier 's experiences in the kinshasa tinderbox großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundeswehr troops faced tough conditions and volatile situations in congo after the un extended the mandate for peacekeeping troops in the democratic republic of congo last week , political scientist simon wunder , a reservist with the eufor contingent deployed there , described his experiences . there were huge doubts about the german government 's decision at the beginning of last year to send a deployment of german troops to democratic republic of congo -lrb- drc -rrb- .
it was a country where nearly 4 million people had died in the civil war since 1997 , a conflict that had raged until the warring sides called an armistice in 2002 . the unsteady peace made it possible for the first free elections in 40 years to take place in 2006 and the 780 soldiers of the eufor force , sent under a mandate from the european union , would be in the capital kinshasa to ensure stability during the voting . despite this ceasefire and these steps towards democracy , there were risks .
there was sporadic fighting across the country , political tensions which threatened to spill out onto the streets and the disturbing problem of child soldiers .
nevertheless , the eu mandate and the german deployment was approved and continued even when the situation in congo deteriorated further as the european soldiers arrived . the conditions for the soldiers on the ground in congo was given little consideration when the application for the german deployment was agreed on ; this seems to be the case in most foreign deployments these days with the soldiers considered little more than a buffer force between warring factions by the politicians making the decisions .
however , the armed forces were consulted about the situation and therefore it was assumed that all aspects of the mission had been discussed and made clear . unacceptable and volatile conditions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many german troops had no idea what to expect in congo the defense commissioner for the german lower house of parliament - the bundestag - even described the living conditions of european soldiers in the congo as " unacceptable " before the german application was made .
the troops lived together for months in the narrowest of tents which soon went moldy in the rainy season , where the air humidity was 90 percent and temperatures were as high as 40 degrees celsius -lrb- 104 degrees f -rrb- .
the monsoon caused floods and made the latrine pits overflow .
there were also defective showers and at times scarcely enough drinking water for the contingent . being separated from their loved ones also brought many problems for the troops .
the workload in kinshasa was more than expected with fighting breaking out between rival factions causing strain on those caught in the conflict and those waiting at home for news .
the uncertainty and worry put strain on marriages and families and brought many to the breaking point . experienced soldiers who had seen action in afghanistan and the balkans had been confronted with conditions like this before , but for the less experienced troops the reality of the misery , decay and the results of a long and brutal civil war made very deep impressions on them .
for many it was not an easy situation . a tinderbox threatening to ignite bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eufor troops soon saw how fragile the peace was far from just monitoring elections in the midst of a fragile ceasefire , the europeans found themselves dealing with riots and battles between drc troops and the forces of presidential candidate jean-pierre bemba . as the election neared , bemba 's bodyguards and armed fighters became increasingly nervous and when government soldiers attacked the candidate 's residence , there was a real chance that the civil war could reignite .
dozens died as a result , and european forces found themselves caught in the middle .
however , if they had not been there , it would have been a lot worse . the situation in kinshasa became like a tinderbox .
seemingly innocuous incidents could become inflammatory in seconds .
soldiers keeping the peace would regularly and suddenly find themselves facing a hostile crowd intent on rioting or criminal gangs moving through the capital . in these cases , the eufor troops had to make split-second decisions to avoid escalation .
was a stone thrown towards them the beginning of an attack or the action of a high-spirited youngster ?
an overreaction from just one soldier could have had catastrophic effects , but a show of weakness or passivity also could have led to severe consequences . to make the right decisions in such a volatile environment requires a high degree of professionalism and judgment .
the soldiers making these types of decisions were in their early twenties and often making them alone . eufor prevented a return to war bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eufor mission was widely seen as a success in the end , it was widely accepted that the decision to station united nations forces in kinshasa , the political center of the country , to provide stability was a successful one .
while the deployment was initially viewed with much skepticism , it eventually gained support and sympathy .
in general , the deployment of the eufor troops was seen as a success and that their presence , particularly during the august riots , was a decisive factor in the prevention of a return to civil war . every soldier at some point questions whether his or her deployment is worth the risk it may put on their life .
the mainly positive reaction of the congolese people by the end of the deployment convinced many that they had done a good and worthwhile job . however , by the end , it also became clear that the deployment of troops in congo could not solve the country 's problems .
a society that works with the government to create peace and stability is established only in parts .
old conflicts continue and they can only be solved by the congolese people themselves . simon wunder is a reserve officer in the bundeswehr and a doctoral candidate in aachen .
he was deployed with the operative information regiment in kinshasa and presents his personal view in this article . -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de africa expert confident of un mission in dr congo serious fighting has erupted in the dr congo after surprisingly peaceful elections last year .

european newpapers have reacted to the beating and arrest of hundreds of russian protesters , including opposition politician garry kasparov . french newspaper le figaro expressed surprise at the events in russia in the light of putin 's domestic support . " the friends of kasparov will not gain any popularity because their demonstrations are suppressed .
the tough actions of the police will not trigger a wave of protest against those in power .
nevertheless , the kremlin is showing an astonishing weakness by reacting so rigorously to the smallest sign of protest , " muses the paper .
austrian newspaper die presse also wondered why the kremlin had acted so brutally : " you really ask yourself whether the people in power in moscow are completely crazy .
apparently , president putin continues to have the backing of 70 percent and more of the population .
what are he and his technocrats afraid of ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : riot police officers detain russian opposition leader garry kasparov it added later : " if this small heap of civil and human rights campaigners , liberals , national bolchevists and anarchists really frightens the putinists so much that they deploy a whole army of police against them , then their power base is n't looking rosy -lrb- … -rrb- in that case , this demonstration of power from the kremlin has actually revealed its weakness . " bulgarian newspaper dnewnik described the beatings and arrests as par for the course .
" really no one should be surprised .
it is enough to remember that the russian president is a former kgb agent and that 90 percent of the leadership in today 's russia are a product of the former secret services . " swiss newspaper basler zeitung argued putin was attempting to deter what had happened in parts of the former soviet union .
" from the point of view of the governing regime of president vladimir putin this makes perfect sense . -lrb- … -rrb- the kremlin has learnt its lesson from the peaceful revolutions in georgia and the ukraine where after blatant vote rigging , protest rallies quickly gained momentum and led to the toppling of the respective governments .
he wants to keep the protests as small as possible and incite fear among normal citizens . " but the paper also questioned whether this approach would really work .
" it may work in the short-term , " it wrote .
" but in the long-term this was rarely a healthy political strategy . " danish newspaper berlingske tidende was damning about russia 's political system .
" you have to be completely blind or excessively tolerant not to see that there is something wrong with russia .
just a year before the elections that mark the end of president putin 's time in office , he has this country so firmly in his grip that democracy is just a shell . " the paper calls upon the international community to do more .
" the eu and the us could happily exercise more pressure than is the case at the moment .
putin can carry out his actions largely unhindered " . finally , german newspaper die welt also urged the west not to beat about the bush .
the paper says any misguided sense of respect or fear of having russia energy supplies cut should not stop the international community from taking action .
" the west owes it to the dissidents in putin 's empire to speak openly .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de language -pipe- 16.04.2007 goethe institute picks up long german tradition in latvia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : riga , latvia 's capital , had contact to germany as a member of the hanseatic league latvia has traditionally had close ties to germany , ever since its capital city riga was founded by a german in 1201 .
now the goethe institute is stepping up efforts to restore interest in learning the german language . the kids clap their hands as thomas diekhaus is abruptly interrupted while reading " max and moritz , " a famous 19th century poem about the antics of two naughty boys .
their caps pulled down low on their heads , two real life boys dressed as max and moritz have snuck up onto the stage .
diekhaus directs the language department of the goethe institute in riga , latvia , and wants to encourage the children to learn german .
there 's lots of work to be done , he said , because the number of german learners has dropped by 10 percent to 11 percent every year since 2000 .
800 years of common history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : humorit wilhelm busch published his max und moritz poem in 1865 latvia 's german connection is hundreds of years old .
in 1201 , bishop albert from bremen founded the city of riga , now the capital , where the daugava river flows into the baltic sea .
as a member of the hanseatic league , many german traders came to riga and the city flourished .
it also became an important center of trade with russia .
when world war ii broke out in 1939 , most of the germans living in latvia moved to germany .
even while under soviet rule after the war , latvia maintained strong connections with communist east germany , and german continued to be taught as a foreign language .
when the iron curtain collapsed and the soviet union dissolved , latvian students found a renewed interest in the german language - particularly when russian stopped being offered in schools in 1991 .
post-communist business boom today , some 16 years after the fall of communism in eastern europe , germany has become latvia ’ s biggest trading partner .
the newly opened baltic region became an attractive investment location for numerous western companies .
just outside of riga , the german company knauf produces plasterboard that is sold throughout the baltic region .
all of the management personnel have to speak german , said knauf manager peter rumer , since the riga branch has daily contact with co-workers in germany .
" in latvia it ’ s not at all hard to find german-speakers - and good ones at that , " added rumer .
shakespeare vs. goethe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the goethe institute is germany 's world-wide cultural ambassador according to the latvian ministry of education , however , the trend is heading in the opposite direction .
since english was introduced 12 years ago on the recommendation of the school authorities , the number of high school students taking the advanced german exam has dropped by 50 percent .
unlike the goethe institute , the ministry of education does n't see a need for action .
" the ministry of education values multilingualism , however the generally tendency in latvia toward english as a first foreign language can ’ t be avoided , " said gundega muceniece from the ministry .
meanwhile at the goethe institute , max is smoking on stage .
after the first cigarette he gets dizzy and ca n't get a single german word out of his mouth .
even without words , the children understand that max and moritz want to annoy widow bolte 's proud rooster - not an unusual pastime for the two pranksters .
catching up " what people missed at school they have to catch up on at the goethe institute , " said the institute 's director rudolf de baey .
" that 's good for business , but not for german-latvian relations . "
max has just promised his friend moritz that he wants to start learning a few german vocabulary words .
after all , both of them want to travel as soon as possible to all of the german-speaking countries in europe . aya bach -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de danes worry english onslaught could undermine the language danish linguists have warned the government that the increasing use of english in the country , especially in education , could wear away at the very foundation of danish .

now the goethe institute is stepping up efforts to restore interest in learning the german language . the kids clap their hands as thomas diekhaus is abruptly interrupted while reading " max and moritz , " a famous 19th century poem about the antics of two naughty boys .
their caps pulled down low on their heads , two real life boys dressed as max and moritz have snuck up onto the stage .
diekhaus directs the language department of the goethe institute in riga , latvia , and wants to encourage the children to learn german .
there 's lots of work to be done , he said , because the number of german learners has dropped by 10 percent to 11 percent every year since 2000 .
800 years of common history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : humorit wilhelm busch published his max und moritz poem in 1865 latvia 's german connection is hundreds of years old .
in 1201 , bishop albert from bremen founded the city of riga , now the capital , where the daugava river flows into the baltic sea .
as a member of the hanseatic league , many german traders came to riga and the city flourished .
it also became an important center of trade with russia .
when world war ii broke out in 1939 , most of the germans living in latvia moved to germany .
even while under soviet rule after the war , latvia maintained strong connections with communist east germany , and german continued to be taught as a foreign language .
when the iron curtain collapsed and the soviet union dissolved , latvian students found a renewed interest in the german language - particularly when russian stopped being offered in schools in 1991 .

unlike the goethe institute , the ministry of education does n't see a need for action .
" the ministry of education values multilingualism , however the generally tendency in latvia toward english as a first foreign language can ’ t be avoided , " said gundega muceniece from the ministry .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 16.04.2007 economic boom , not pope , helps catholic church in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's taxes , not church collections , that make german dioceses the world 's richest the german catholic church has raked in more church tax for the first time since 2000 .
but it 's not german pope benedict xiv who is responsible for the tax boon - rather it 's the country 's pumping economy . the catholic church in germany had a bumper year in 2006 .
according to recent estimates , the 27 dioceses on average took in some eight percent more when compared to 2005 .
financial experts for the church expect that revenue for 2007 could amount to 4.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 6 billion -rrb- - 500 million euros more than two years ago . germany has a system of ecclesiastical financing unique to only a few european countries .
germany 's 28 million catholics - along with other members of state-recognized religions - are obligated to pay their churches a tax of between 8 percent and 9 percent , depending on where they live . the federal tax office automatically deducts this from people 's monthly pay packets every month , with the result that germany 's churches are among the richest in the world . catholics leaving in droves despite this comfortable tax arrangement , the last few years have n't been too kind to the catholic church . between 2000 and 2005 , more than 680,000 people officially registered to leave the church and free themselves from their tax obligations -lrb- and their right to receive the sacraments at the same time -rrb- .
in addition , germany 's sluggish economy with its high unemployment rates and lower wages meant there was even less money available to tax . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : apart from mass events like world youth day , more and more christians are becoming disenchanted with the church but now , things are looking up because the levy , the church 's biggest single source of income , is back up to levels not seen since 1998 . according to sebastian anneser , the financial director of the catholic archdiocese of munich and freising , a key reason for this " surprising " development is increasing business confidence and its positive effects on employment . in his march budget statement , though , anneser warned the increase " was n't expected to hold in the long-term " because a combination of low birthrates , aging population and waning interest were causing people to " turn their backs on the church . " however , the church has managed to stem the floodtide somewhat - the rate at which people are abandoning catholic pews has fallen sharply in the past few years . german in the vatican while there have been some suggestions that this is because a german now sits on the papal chair , the catholic church itself is hesitant to make this connection . " curiosity about the catholic church and religion has definitely increased because of -lrb- joseph -rrb- ratzinger becoming pope in 2005 as well as the death of pope john paul ii , " said adelheid utters-adam , a spokesperson for the munich archdiocese in ratzinger 's home state of bavaria . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benedict xvi is the first german pope in nearly 500 years " but there was a significant fall in the rate of people leaving in 2004 and that definitely does n't have anything to do with the current pope , " utters-adam said . in fact , according to some , having a german sitting in the papal chair could actually be a liability for germany 's catholic church . " every time -lrb- pope benedict -rrb- has visited bavaria , there has been a dramatic rise in the number of departures from the church , " said carsten frerk , a sociologist who researches religious institutions . the last papal visit cost 30 million euros . " that annoyed many people who thought the money could have otherwise been better spent on social projects instead of a media spectacle , " frerk said . back to the collection plate ? according to frerk , it 's not just the church which is becoming increasingly unpopular , it 's also the church tax system . " polls show that around 60 percent of people are against collecting the tax in this way - they would prefer to donate voluntarily , " frerk said .
interestingly though , only a third of those surveyed " knew exactly how much church tax they paid , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the governments of denmark , finland , austria and parts of switzerland also collect church tax " that 's the ingenious thing about the system - the tax is just deducted automatically , " he said . thirty five-year-old teacher marion corpus decided to cancel her church contributions four years ago .
she said it was n't until she got a new job that came with an easier to read pay slip that she realized for the first time how much cash she was giving the church . " it was about 80 euros a month , " corpus said .
" i thought i could do something better with the money because i did n't like what the church was doing .
instead , i 've now got a monthly membership to amnesty international plus i sponsor a child in malawi . " despite the system 's unpopularity , the right of recognized churches to tax its adherents is enshrined in the german constitution .
the government only collects the levy because churches contract it to do so .
but this arrangement is unlikely to change any time soon - after all , the state gets to keep three percent of the all money it amasses through the church tax . kate hairsine send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de as church loses appeal , protestants try rebranding religion 490 years after martin luther nailed his ninety-five theses to a door in wittenberg , the city is the staging post for a revival aimed at reversing the fortunes of the nation 's ailing protestant church .

" we are on a long , narrow road and we have to be patient .
but our two countries are friends . " erdogan , however , added that he felt the criticism he had voiced was " legitimate . " in the magazine interview , the turkish pm was quoted as saying : " seriously , i expected more from germany .
we would like a clear idea of a date , a roadmap and a calendar for negotiations .
the europeans could thereby show our people that they are serious . " he also suggested 2014 or 2015 as a possible date for turkish accession , calling on the eu to decide whether it was a true " family of different cultures or a christian club . " turkish pm makes peace and case for membership but after discussions with the german chancellor , erdogan moderated his criticism , saying there had been a " boost " to the talks under the german presidency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands protested in turkey at the notion that erdogan run for the country 's presidency erdogan also reiterated his belief that turkey had enormous potential and that his country wanted to enter the eu not as a burden but to help carry the burden , noting that turkey had undergone considerable reforms . " every new country in the eu means new markets and new investment opportunities , " he said .
" the turkish economy has become more open and more liberal . " merkel seemed to understand erdogan 's frustrations , saying the european union could open two more chapters of membership talks with turkey by july but reiterated the eu 's stance with turkey over the cyprus dispute . merkel offers progress with cyprus caveat " under the german presidency of the eu , two more chapters could probably be opened if things go well , " said merkel .
" we are looking ahead but the outcome of this process remains open , " she said , adding that it is " important that turkey normalizes ties with cyprus . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel wants the cyprus dispute solved the european union relaunched membership talks with turkey at the end of march after a long hiatus caused by ankara 's refusal to respect its trade obligations to cyprus under a customs agreement with the eu . turkey has refused to open its ports and airports to greek cypriot traffic until the eu lives up to its pledge to end the isolation of the turkish cypriot state in the north of the mediterranean island , which is recognized only by ankara . merkel 's conservative christian democrats oppose turkish membership of the eu and would prefer instead that the secular islamic nation become a " privileged partner " of the 27-member bloc .
but she has agreed to support the eu 's ongoing accession negotiations with ankara as part of her government 's coalition agreement with the center-left social democrats . the social democrats are in favor of turkey joining the eu , a stance reiterated by statements made by foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier on sunday . " security and stability would be raised in europe if turkey is involved , " he said , adding that the reform process in turkey needed to continue and become better integrated if its bid for membership was to be successful . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkish premier criticizes germany ahead of visit turkey 's prime minister recep tayyip erdogan reproached germany for failing to do more to advance his country 's hopes of joining the european union , in an interview to be published on monday .

european newpapers have reacted to the beating and arrest of hundreds of russian protesters , including opposition politician garry kasparov . french newspaper le figaro expressed surprise at the events in russia in the light of putin 's domestic support . " the friends of kasparov will not gain any popularity because their demonstrations are suppressed .
the tough actions of the police will not trigger a wave of protest against those in power .
nevertheless , the kremlin is showing an astonishing weakness by reacting so rigorously to the smallest sign of protest , " muses the paper .
austrian newspaper die presse also wondered why the kremlin had acted so brutally : " you really ask yourself whether the people in power in moscow are completely crazy .
apparently , president putin continues to have the backing of 70 percent and more of the population .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : riot police officers detain russian opposition leader garry kasparov it added later : " if this small heap of civil and human rights campaigners , liberals , national bolchevists and anarchists really frightens the putinists so much that they deploy a whole army of police against them , then their power base is n't looking rosy -lrb- … -rrb- in that case , this demonstration of power from the kremlin has actually revealed its weakness . " bulgarian newspaper dnewnik described the beatings and arrests as par for the course .

" from the point of view of the governing regime of president vladimir putin this makes perfect sense . -lrb- … -rrb- the kremlin has learnt its lesson from the peaceful revolutions in georgia and the ukraine where after blatant vote rigging , protest rallies quickly gained momentum and led to the toppling of the respective governments .

if you 're the parent of a tokio hotel fan , however , standing in line for hours just got a whole lot better . for the kids , standing for hours on end to get the chance to get a glimpse of their heroes on stage is just part of being infatuated with a pop group .
the dedicated fan thinks nothing of camping out for tickets overnight or queuing for a gig for days .
for most , this is not a problem .
teenagers are hardy sorts and - with parental permission - can quite easily withstand the rigors of serious fandom . but for fans of german teen sensations tokio hotel , it is an entirely different pot of eyeliner . while the fans themselves are more than willing to withstand the boredom of lining up with other like-minded souls for the chance to scream at bill , tom , gustav and georg , a large number of those are well below the age of parental consent .
this means that mum and dad have to queue as well .
and this is where the problem lies . a parent 's worst nightmare made bearable bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bill kaulitz takes his skunk / porcupine for a walk mummy and daddy may have only just gotten round to the idea that their offspring is having confusingly carnal thoughts about an androgynous teenage boy with what appears to be a humongous skunk-like porcupine stuck on his head .
now they have to stand in almost 40-degree heat for hours , if not days , to make sure said infatuated child is safely ticketed and ensconced in the secure atmosphere of the kindergarten / rock concert of their dreams . this was the case this weekend when tokio hotel were set to play to 8000 screamer pre-teens at the frankfurt festival hall .
in scorching sunshine , the parents of the eight to 15-year old crowd members soon found themselves wilting along with their crazed offspring .
luckily , they also soon found themselves to be the subject of a parental care experiment . local radio broadcaster hr3 , a sponsor of the tokio hotel show , provided parents with refreshments , music to dance to , formula one racing arcade games and other pastimes to help the hours fly by .
mothers queued to have airbrush tattoos painted on while competitive dads fought over the table soccer game .
for those who had been in line since the early hours of sunday morning , it was a god-send . pass the water , please bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tokio hotel : not as good as showering in a train station " when we found out from the police that there would be parental care , we were very glad , " said simone geppert from cologne who had been in the queue with her husband siggi and daughter selina since five in the morning .
" it is such a relief that there is somewhere to sit down and something to drink . " " i am more afraid about the kids queuing up alone than i do about them at the concert , " said claudia düsterbeck whose 11-year old daughter was busily making friends with other tokio hotel fans as she sipped from a bottle of cooling water provided by the parental carers .
" when they said this service was available , it eased those fears . " once the queuing was over and the kids rushed to be as close as possible to their idols , the parents relaxed further .

if you 're the parent of a tokio hotel fan , however , standing in line for hours just got a whole lot better . for the kids , standing for hours on end to get the chance to get a glimpse of their heroes on stage is just part of being infatuated with a pop group .
the dedicated fan thinks nothing of camping out for tickets overnight or queuing for a gig for days .
for most , this is not a problem .
teenagers are hardy sorts and - with parental permission - can quite easily withstand the rigors of serious fandom . but for fans of german teen sensations tokio hotel , it is an entirely different pot of eyeliner . while the fans themselves are more than willing to withstand the boredom of lining up with other like-minded souls for the chance to scream at bill , tom , gustav and georg , a large number of those are well below the age of parental consent .
this means that mum and dad have to queue as well .
and this is where the problem lies . a parent 's worst nightmare made bearable bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bill kaulitz takes his skunk / porcupine for a walk mummy and daddy may have only just gotten round to the idea that their offspring is having confusingly carnal thoughts about an androgynous teenage boy with what appears to be a humongous skunk-like porcupine stuck on his head .
now they have to stand in almost 40-degree heat for hours , if not days , to make sure said infatuated child is safely ticketed and ensconced in the secure atmosphere of the kindergarten / rock concert of their dreams . this was the case this weekend when tokio hotel were set to play to 8000 screamer pre-teens at the frankfurt festival hall .
in scorching sunshine , the parents of the eight to 15-year old crowd members soon found themselves wilting along with their crazed offspring .
luckily , they also soon found themselves to be the subject of a parental care experiment . local radio broadcaster hr3 , a sponsor of the tokio hotel show , provided parents with refreshments , music to dance to , formula one racing arcade games and other pastimes to help the hours fly by .
mothers queued to have airbrush tattoos painted on while competitive dads fought over the table soccer game .
for those who had been in line since the early hours of sunday morning , it was a god-send . pass the water , please bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tokio hotel : not as good as showering in a train station " when we found out from the police that there would be parental care , we were very glad , " said simone geppert from cologne who had been in the queue with her husband siggi and daughter selina since five in the morning .
" it is such a relief that there is somewhere to sit down and something to drink . " " i am more afraid about the kids queuing up alone than i do about them at the concert , " said claudia düsterbeck whose 11-year old daughter was busily making friends with other tokio hotel fans as she sipped from a bottle of cooling water provided by the parental carers .
" when they said this service was available , it eased those fears . " once the queuing was over and the kids rushed to be as close as possible to their idols , the parents relaxed further .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de religion -pipe- 16.04.2007 economic boom , not pope , helps catholic church in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's taxes , not church collections , that make german dioceses the world 's richest the german catholic church has raked in more church tax for the first time since 2000 .
but it 's not german pope benedict xiv who is responsible for the tax boon - rather it 's the country 's pumping economy . the catholic church in germany had a bumper year in 2006 .
according to recent estimates , the 27 dioceses on average took in some eight percent more when compared to 2005 .
financial experts for the church expect that revenue for 2007 could amount to 4.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 6 billion -rrb- - 500 million euros more than two years ago . germany has a system of ecclesiastical financing unique to only a few european countries .
germany 's 28 million catholics - along with other members of state-recognized religions - are obligated to pay their churches a tax of between 8 percent and 9 percent , depending on where they live . the federal tax office automatically deducts this from people 's monthly pay packets every month , with the result that germany 's churches are among the richest in the world . catholics leaving in droves despite this comfortable tax arrangement , the last few years have n't been too kind to the catholic church . between 2000 and 2005 , more than 680,000 people officially registered to leave the church and free themselves from their tax obligations -lrb- and their right to receive the sacraments at the same time -rrb- .
in addition , germany 's sluggish economy with its high unemployment rates and lower wages meant there was even less money available to tax . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : apart from mass events like world youth day , more and more christians are becoming disenchanted with the church but now , things are looking up because the levy , the church 's biggest single source of income , is back up to levels not seen since 1998 . according to sebastian anneser , the financial director of the catholic archdiocese of munich and freising , a key reason for this " surprising " development is increasing business confidence and its positive effects on employment . in his march budget statement , though , anneser warned the increase " was n't expected to hold in the long-term " because a combination of low birthrates , aging population and waning interest were causing people to " turn their backs on the church . " however , the church has managed to stem the floodtide somewhat - the rate at which people are abandoning catholic pews has fallen sharply in the past few years . german in the vatican while there have been some suggestions that this is because a german now sits on the papal chair , the catholic church itself is hesitant to make this connection . " curiosity about the catholic church and religion has definitely increased because of -lrb- joseph -rrb- ratzinger becoming pope in 2005 as well as the death of pope john paul ii , " said adelheid utters-adam , a spokesperson for the munich archdiocese in ratzinger 's home state of bavaria . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benedict xvi is the first german pope in nearly 500 years " but there was a significant fall in the rate of people leaving in 2004 and that definitely does n't have anything to do with the current pope , " utters-adam said . in fact , according to some , having a german sitting in the papal chair could actually be a liability for germany 's catholic church . " every time -lrb- pope benedict -rrb- has visited bavaria , there has been a dramatic rise in the number of departures from the church , " said carsten frerk , a sociologist who researches religious institutions . the last papal visit cost 30 million euros . " that annoyed many people who thought the money could have otherwise been better spent on social projects instead of a media spectacle , " frerk said . back to the collection plate ? according to frerk , it 's not just the church which is becoming increasingly unpopular , it 's also the church tax system . " polls show that around 60 percent of people are against collecting the tax in this way - they would prefer to donate voluntarily , " frerk said .
interestingly though , only a third of those surveyed " knew exactly how much church tax they paid , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the governments of denmark , finland , austria and parts of switzerland also collect church tax " that 's the ingenious thing about the system - the tax is just deducted automatically , " he said . thirty five-year-old teacher marion corpus decided to cancel her church contributions four years ago .
she said it was n't until she got a new job that came with an easier to read pay slip that she realized for the first time how much cash she was giving the church . " it was about 80 euros a month , " corpus said .

" we are on a long , narrow road and we have to be patient .
but our two countries are friends . " erdogan , however , added that he felt the criticism he had voiced was " legitimate . " in the magazine interview , the turkish pm was quoted as saying : " seriously , i expected more from germany .
we would like a clear idea of a date , a roadmap and a calendar for negotiations .
the europeans could thereby show our people that they are serious . " he also suggested 2014 or 2015 as a possible date for turkish accession , calling on the eu to decide whether it was a true " family of different cultures or a christian club . " turkish pm makes peace and case for membership but after discussions with the german chancellor , erdogan moderated his criticism , saying there had been a " boost " to the talks under the german presidency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands protested in turkey at the notion that erdogan run for the country 's presidency erdogan also reiterated his belief that turkey had enormous potential and that his country wanted to enter the eu not as a burden but to help carry the burden , noting that turkey had undergone considerable reforms . " every new country in the eu means new markets and new investment opportunities , " he said .
" the turkish economy has become more open and more liberal . " merkel seemed to understand erdogan 's frustrations , saying the european union could open two more chapters of membership talks with turkey by july but reiterated the eu 's stance with turkey over the cyprus dispute . merkel offers progress with cyprus caveat " under the german presidency of the eu , two more chapters could probably be opened if things go well , " said merkel .
" we are looking ahead but the outcome of this process remains open , " she said , adding that it is " important that turkey normalizes ties with cyprus . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel wants the cyprus dispute solved the european union relaunched membership talks with turkey at the end of march after a long hiatus caused by ankara 's refusal to respect its trade obligations to cyprus under a customs agreement with the eu . turkey has refused to open its ports and airports to greek cypriot traffic until the eu lives up to its pledge to end the isolation of the turkish cypriot state in the north of the mediterranean island , which is recognized only by ankara . merkel 's conservative christian democrats oppose turkish membership of the eu and would prefer instead that the secular islamic nation become a " privileged partner " of the 27-member bloc .
but she has agreed to support the eu 's ongoing accession negotiations with ankara as part of her government 's coalition agreement with the center-left social democrats . the social democrats are in favor of turkey joining the eu , a stance reiterated by statements made by foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier on sunday .

in particular , steg said that action against members of the media had been " unacceptable " with the german embassy in moscow protesting about the detention of accredited journalists . a total of 350 demonstrators , including a representative of germany 's public tv , were briefly arrested in the protests which took place in moscow on saturday and the nation 's second biggest city , st. petersburg on sunday . riot police beat and chased anti-kremlin protesters through the heart of the city . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : riot police cordoned off the opposition rally before the beatings began the german government expects a " comprehensive statement " from the russian side explaining the circumstances surrounding the protests and the arrests , steg said . " the excessive use of force that we saw over the weekend is worrying and assaults on the media ... are unacceptable , " government spokesman steg told reporters at a regular news conference .
" the german government expects and demands a thorough clarification of the events in moscow and st. petersburg , particularly the actions which prevented journalists from doing their jobs . " german chancellor angela merkel was expected to raise the russian police action with putin at a russian-european union summit set for may 18 in the russian city of samara .
germany currently holds the eu presidency . " an open , peaceful , dynamic civil society are cornerstones of democratic society , " ministry spokesman jens plötner said .
" these themes are , were and remain issues for discussion when we talk with the russian side . " respect for basic rights europe 's top human rights watchdog monday also condemned the recent police crackdown on opposition demonstrators and called on moscow to respect fundamental rights . " we condemn this disproportionate use of force , " said council of europe president rene van der linden , adding that freedom of expression and freedom of assembly constituted fundamental rights in democratic countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : green politician volker beck was attacked at a demo in moscow last year - the police did not intervene russia joined the 46-member council in 1996 .
last year , it held the rotating six-month chairmanship of europe 's top human rights body which is independent from the european union . a spokeswoman for the eu commission said that " freedom of expression and freedom of assembly are very important values " to which russia had signed up as a member of international organizations such as the united nations and the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- . the commission was " very concerned " about the violent police attacks in st petersburg and moscow , she told reporters . the 27-member eu would raise the recent events when holding talks with russian officials at the margins of an eu foreign ministers meeting next week in luxembourg , the spokeswoman said . respect for freedom of expression and freedom of assembly " are very important in the pre-election phase in russia , " she added .
the opposition accuses russian president vladimir putin of increasingly restricting human rights ahead of parliamentary elections in december 2007 and the presidential election next march . nervous government the crackdown suggests that the kremlin is increasingly nervous about next year 's presidential hand-over , critics of the russian government said on monday . the kremlin on monday defended the police 's tough action against weekend opposition rallies , saying they had to stop " ultra-radicals " from violating law and order . " the participants of these rallies did not always stick to the parameters which were set for them when they were given permission -lrb- to hold the rallies -rrb- .
that was the reason for those measures that were taken by the police , " kremlin deputy spokesman dmitry peskov told reuters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : analysts say the kremlin is nervous for many in the liberal opposition , the clampdown betrayed a fear of the kind of popular uprising seen in ukraine in 2004 , which helped cement democratic values and became known as the orange revolution . president vladimir putin is due to stand down at an election in march of next year , under a constitutional rule banning an individual from holding the post for more than two terms in a row . in kremlin political circles " they are terrified of the example of ukraine , " said analyst yury korgunyuk of the indem think tank .

but it 's not german pope benedict xiv who is responsible for the tax boon - rather it 's the country 's pumping economy . the catholic church in germany had a bumper year in 2006 .
according to recent estimates , the 27 dioceses on average took in some eight percent more when compared to 2005 .
financial experts for the church expect that revenue for 2007 could amount to 4.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 6 billion -rrb- - 500 million euros more than two years ago . germany has a system of ecclesiastical financing unique to only a few european countries .
germany 's 28 million catholics - along with other members of state-recognized religions - are obligated to pay their churches a tax of between 8 percent and 9 percent , depending on where they live . the federal tax office automatically deducts this from people 's monthly pay packets every month , with the result that germany 's churches are among the richest in the world . catholics leaving in droves despite this comfortable tax arrangement , the last few years have n't been too kind to the catholic church . between 2000 and 2005 , more than 680,000 people officially registered to leave the church and free themselves from their tax obligations -lrb- and their right to receive the sacraments at the same time -rrb- .
in addition , germany 's sluggish economy with its high unemployment rates and lower wages meant there was even less money available to tax . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : apart from mass events like world youth day , more and more christians are becoming disenchanted with the church but now , things are looking up because the levy , the church 's biggest single source of income , is back up to levels not seen since 1998 . according to sebastian anneser , the financial director of the catholic archdiocese of munich and freising , a key reason for this " surprising " development is increasing business confidence and its positive effects on employment . in his march budget statement , though , anneser warned the increase " was n't expected to hold in the long-term " because a combination of low birthrates , aging population and waning interest were causing people to " turn their backs on the church . " however , the church has managed to stem the floodtide somewhat - the rate at which people are abandoning catholic pews has fallen sharply in the past few years . german in the vatican while there have been some suggestions that this is because a german now sits on the papal chair , the catholic church itself is hesitant to make this connection . " curiosity about the catholic church and religion has definitely increased because of -lrb- joseph -rrb- ratzinger becoming pope in 2005 as well as the death of pope john paul ii , " said adelheid utters-adam , a spokesperson for the munich archdiocese in ratzinger 's home state of bavaria . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benedict xvi is the first german pope in nearly 500 years " but there was a significant fall in the rate of people leaving in 2004 and that definitely does n't have anything to do with the current pope , " utters-adam said . in fact , according to some , having a german sitting in the papal chair could actually be a liability for germany 's catholic church . " every time -lrb- pope benedict -rrb- has visited bavaria , there has been a dramatic rise in the number of departures from the church , " said carsten frerk , a sociologist who researches religious institutions . the last papal visit cost 30 million euros . " that annoyed many people who thought the money could have otherwise been better spent on social projects instead of a media spectacle , " frerk said . back to the collection plate ? according to frerk , it 's not just the church which is becoming increasingly unpopular , it 's also the church tax system . " polls show that around 60 percent of people are against collecting the tax in this way - they would prefer to donate voluntarily , " frerk said .
interestingly though , only a third of those surveyed " knew exactly how much church tax they paid , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the governments of denmark , finland , austria and parts of switzerland also collect church tax " that 's the ingenious thing about the system - the tax is just deducted automatically , " he said . thirty five-year-old teacher marion corpus decided to cancel her church contributions four years ago .
she said it was n't until she got a new job that came with an easier to read pay slip that she realized for the first time how much cash she was giving the church . " it was about 80 euros a month , " corpus said .
" i thought i could do something better with the money because i did n't like what the church was doing .
instead , i 've now got a monthly membership to amnesty international plus i sponsor a child in malawi . " despite the system 's unpopularity , the right of recognized churches to tax its adherents is enshrined in the german constitution .

" the entry into the first quarter was very favorable , so there is a possibility that we will upgrade our forecast , " said weber , who as head of the german central bank sits on the ecb 's policy-setting governing council . warnings about complacency bdi chief thumann told a news conference in hanover said the current robust growth would make itself felt on the labor market where unemployment could feasibly fall below 3.5 million . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : exports are the real economic driver but the government must not rest on its laurels , thumann said , urging the ruling left-right coalition to press ahead with decisive structural reforms . " with the global economy set to expand by 5.0 percent , 2.5 percent growth for germany is not much , " thumann said .
" a lot remains to be done . " later this week , germany 's leading economic institutes also look set to raise their own growth forecasts , too . faster growth coupled with accelerating inflation will provide additional ammunition for the ecb to raise euro-zone borrowing costs - already at a five-and-a-year high - again later this year to prevent the economy from overheating . ecb chief jean-claude trichet sent clear signals last week that , with the current upturn set to continue , the guardian of the euro will notch up its benchmark " refi " refinancing rate to 4.0 percent in june . only the beginning ? the government , too , is becoming increasingly optimistic , with economy minister michael glos suggesting recently that berlin might raise its 2007 growth forecast from 1.7 percent to at least 2.0 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european central bank will likely increase rates to stop possible overheating " there are some indications that germany is still only at the beginning of an upturn that looks set to continue in the coming years , " weber said . the euro zone 's biggest economy was in a traditional cyclical upturn , with the strong export performance of past years now feeding through to investment , the central bank chief said . " at the end of last year , companies said they were investing to increase capacity , " he said . and private consumption could similarly start contributing to growth from the middle of the year , as well , weber continued . vat effect that should be the case once the so-called vat effect had faded , he argued , referring to a three-percentage-point increase in value-added or sales tax -lrb- vat -rrb- , which came into effect at the start of this year and which persuaded consumers to bring forward big-ticket purchases to the end of 2006 . recent rises in oil prices had been almost wholly offset by the rise in the value of the euro against the dollar , limiting the negative economic effects , weber said .
and the economic slowdown in the united states would not harm german exports , too much , given the growing importance of dynamic economies such as china and arab states , he argued . in their widely watched spring report , to be published on thursday , the country 's leading economic research institutes are widely expected to raise their forecasts for german growth this year and next year . newspaper reports have said that five of the six think-tanks - ifo in munich , diw in berlin , hwwa in hamburg , ifw in kiel , iwh in halle and rwi in essen - were pencilling 2.5-percent growth for the german economy both in 2007 and 2008 .

" the entry into the first quarter was very favorable , so there is a possibility that we will upgrade our forecast , " said weber , who as head of the german central bank sits on the ecb 's policy-setting governing council . warnings about complacency bdi chief thumann told a news conference in hanover said the current robust growth would make itself felt on the labor market where unemployment could feasibly fall below 3.5 million . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : exports are the real economic driver but the government must not rest on its laurels , thumann said , urging the ruling left-right coalition to press ahead with decisive structural reforms .

in fact , if a german does n't have a massive pile of dog-eared guide books and glossy travel brochures about the world 's best beaches , mountains and museums in their lounge room , their friends will probably take his or her temperature and book an emergency appointment at a travel agency .
and although germans can be found swarming around tourist highlights all around the world , it seems the one place they do n't like to visit is the east of their own country .
according to a poll by the tns-emnid institute , nearly 90 percent of eastern germans had visited the west but just under half of all western germans -lrb- or wessies as they are called here -rrb- have never been to the former ddr .
it seems former communist east germany has a bad reputation despite its picture-postcard towns , wealth of art and culture and beautiful countryside .
hard to shake off communist past " the buildings are old and everything is run down , " said one cologne woman happy to share her opinions about her country 's east , although she 'd never been there .
" nothing is new there . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rise of the right in eastern germany has damaged its reputation some parts of eastern germany had some bad press because of far right attacks on foreigners and an increase in support for extreme right wing parties .
this does n't go down well with wessies who pride themselves on their tolerance .
" they are unemployed and have no motivation for the future so they are racist , " said another wessie .
though high unemployment does n't seem to stop germans visiting other countries such france or romania .
those that do take a look at eastern germany 17 years after the fall of the berlin wall are the elderly with the majority of german visitors to the region over 50 .
where do germans go ?
bildunterschrift : you just ca n't beat the beach for making germans happy within their own country , it seems germans are just suckers for one-liter beers steins , men in leather pants and mountain scenery - more than 20 percent of the 212 million domestic trips made last year were to bavaria .
otherwise , the preferred german holiday destination is spain , spain and spain .

it was a country where nearly 4 million people had died in the civil war since 1997 , a conflict that had raged until the warring sides called an armistice in 2002 . the unsteady peace made it possible for the first free elections in 40 years to take place in 2006 and the 780 soldiers of the eufor force , sent under a mandate from the european union , would be in the capital kinshasa to ensure stability during the voting . despite this ceasefire and these steps towards democracy , there were risks .
there was sporadic fighting across the country , political tensions which threatened to spill out onto the streets and the disturbing problem of child soldiers .
nevertheless , the eu mandate and the german deployment was approved and continued even when the situation in congo deteriorated further as the european soldiers arrived . the conditions for the soldiers on the ground in congo was given little consideration when the application for the german deployment was agreed on ; this seems to be the case in most foreign deployments these days with the soldiers considered little more than a buffer force between warring factions by the politicians making the decisions .
however , the armed forces were consulted about the situation and therefore it was assumed that all aspects of the mission had been discussed and made clear . unacceptable and volatile conditions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many german troops had no idea what to expect in congo the defense commissioner for the german lower house of parliament - the bundestag - even described the living conditions of european soldiers in the congo as " unacceptable " before the german application was made .
the troops lived together for months in the narrowest of tents which soon went moldy in the rainy season , where the air humidity was 90 percent and temperatures were as high as 40 degrees celsius -lrb- 104 degrees f -rrb- .
the monsoon caused floods and made the latrine pits overflow .
there were also defective showers and at times scarcely enough drinking water for the contingent . being separated from their loved ones also brought many problems for the troops .
the workload in kinshasa was more than expected with fighting breaking out between rival factions causing strain on those caught in the conflict and those waiting at home for news .
the uncertainty and worry put strain on marriages and families and brought many to the breaking point . experienced soldiers who had seen action in afghanistan and the balkans had been confronted with conditions like this before , but for the less experienced troops the reality of the misery , decay and the results of a long and brutal civil war made very deep impressions on them .
for many it was not an easy situation . a tinderbox threatening to ignite bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eufor troops soon saw how fragile the peace was far from just monitoring elections in the midst of a fragile ceasefire , the europeans found themselves dealing with riots and battles between drc troops and the forces of presidential candidate jean-pierre bemba . as the election neared , bemba 's bodyguards and armed fighters became increasingly nervous and when government soldiers attacked the candidate 's residence , there was a real chance that the civil war could reignite .
dozens died as a result , and european forces found themselves caught in the middle .
however , if they had not been there , it would have been a lot worse . the situation in kinshasa became like a tinderbox .
seemingly innocuous incidents could become inflammatory in seconds .
soldiers keeping the peace would regularly and suddenly find themselves facing a hostile crowd intent on rioting or criminal gangs moving through the capital . in these cases , the eufor troops had to make split-second decisions to avoid escalation .
was a stone thrown towards them the beginning of an attack or the action of a high-spirited youngster ?
an overreaction from just one soldier could have had catastrophic effects , but a show of weakness or passivity also could have led to severe consequences . to make the right decisions in such a volatile environment requires a high degree of professionalism and judgment .

it was a country where nearly 4 million people had died in the civil war since 1997 , a conflict that had raged until the warring sides called an armistice in 2002 . the unsteady peace made it possible for the first free elections in 40 years to take place in 2006 and the 780 soldiers of the eufor force , sent under a mandate from the european union , would be in the capital kinshasa to ensure stability during the voting . despite this ceasefire and these steps towards democracy , there were risks .
there was sporadic fighting across the country , political tensions which threatened to spill out onto the streets and the disturbing problem of child soldiers .
nevertheless , the eu mandate and the german deployment was approved and continued even when the situation in congo deteriorated further as the european soldiers arrived . the conditions for the soldiers on the ground in congo was given little consideration when the application for the german deployment was agreed on ; this seems to be the case in most foreign deployments these days with the soldiers considered little more than a buffer force between warring factions by the politicians making the decisions .
however , the armed forces were consulted about the situation and therefore it was assumed that all aspects of the mission had been discussed and made clear . unacceptable and volatile conditions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many german troops had no idea what to expect in congo the defense commissioner for the german lower house of parliament - the bundestag - even described the living conditions of european soldiers in the congo as " unacceptable " before the german application was made .
the troops lived together for months in the narrowest of tents which soon went moldy in the rainy season , where the air humidity was 90 percent and temperatures were as high as 40 degrees celsius -lrb- 104 degrees f -rrb- .
the monsoon caused floods and made the latrine pits overflow .
there were also defective showers and at times scarcely enough drinking water for the contingent . being separated from their loved ones also brought many problems for the troops .
the workload in kinshasa was more than expected with fighting breaking out between rival factions causing strain on those caught in the conflict and those waiting at home for news .
the uncertainty and worry put strain on marriages and families and brought many to the breaking point . experienced soldiers who had seen action in afghanistan and the balkans had been confronted with conditions like this before , but for the less experienced troops the reality of the misery , decay and the results of a long and brutal civil war made very deep impressions on them .
for many it was not an easy situation . a tinderbox threatening to ignite bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eufor troops soon saw how fragile the peace was far from just monitoring elections in the midst of a fragile ceasefire , the europeans found themselves dealing with riots and battles between drc troops and the forces of presidential candidate jean-pierre bemba . as the election neared , bemba 's bodyguards and armed fighters became increasingly nervous and when government soldiers attacked the candidate 's residence , there was a real chance that the civil war could reignite .
dozens died as a result , and european forces found themselves caught in the middle .
however , if they had not been there , it would have been a lot worse . the situation in kinshasa became like a tinderbox .
seemingly innocuous incidents could become inflammatory in seconds .
soldiers keeping the peace would regularly and suddenly find themselves facing a hostile crowd intent on rioting or criminal gangs moving through the capital . in these cases , the eufor troops had to make split-second decisions to avoid escalation .
was a stone thrown towards them the beginning of an attack or the action of a high-spirited youngster ?
an overreaction from just one soldier could have had catastrophic effects , but a show of weakness or passivity also could have led to severe consequences . to make the right decisions in such a volatile environment requires a high degree of professionalism and judgment .

now the goethe institute is stepping up efforts to restore interest in learning the german language . the kids clap their hands as thomas diekhaus is abruptly interrupted while reading " max and moritz , " a famous 19th century poem about the antics of two naughty boys .
their caps pulled down low on their heads , two real life boys dressed as max and moritz have snuck up onto the stage .
diekhaus directs the language department of the goethe institute in riga , latvia , and wants to encourage the children to learn german .
there 's lots of work to be done , he said , because the number of german learners has dropped by 10 percent to 11 percent every year since 2000 .
800 years of common history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : humorit wilhelm busch published his max und moritz poem in 1865 latvia 's german connection is hundreds of years old .
in 1201 , bishop albert from bremen founded the city of riga , now the capital , where the daugava river flows into the baltic sea .
as a member of the hanseatic league , many german traders came to riga and the city flourished .
it also became an important center of trade with russia .
when world war ii broke out in 1939 , most of the germans living in latvia moved to germany .
even while under soviet rule after the war , latvia maintained strong connections with communist east germany , and german continued to be taught as a foreign language .
when the iron curtain collapsed and the soviet union dissolved , latvian students found a renewed interest in the german language - particularly when russian stopped being offered in schools in 1991 .

the newly opened baltic region became an attractive investment location for numerous western companies .
just outside of riga , the german company knauf produces plasterboard that is sold throughout the baltic region .
all of the management personnel have to speak german , said knauf manager peter rumer , since the riga branch has daily contact with co-workers in germany .
" in latvia it ’ s not at all hard to find german-speakers - and good ones at that , " added rumer .

unlike the goethe institute , the ministry of education does n't see a need for action .
" the ministry of education values multilingualism , however the generally tendency in latvia toward english as a first foreign language can ’ t be avoided , " said gundega muceniece from the ministry .
meanwhile at the goethe institute , max is smoking on stage .

now the goethe institute is stepping up efforts to restore interest in learning the german language . the kids clap their hands as thomas diekhaus is abruptly interrupted while reading " max and moritz , " a famous 19th century poem about the antics of two naughty boys .
their caps pulled down low on their heads , two real life boys dressed as max and moritz have snuck up onto the stage .
diekhaus directs the language department of the goethe institute in riga , latvia , and wants to encourage the children to learn german .
there 's lots of work to be done , he said , because the number of german learners has dropped by 10 percent to 11 percent every year since 2000 .
800 years of common history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : humorit wilhelm busch published his max und moritz poem in 1865 latvia 's german connection is hundreds of years old .
in 1201 , bishop albert from bremen founded the city of riga , now the capital , where the daugava river flows into the baltic sea .
as a member of the hanseatic league , many german traders came to riga and the city flourished .
it also became an important center of trade with russia .
when world war ii broke out in 1939 , most of the germans living in latvia moved to germany .
even while under soviet rule after the war , latvia maintained strong connections with communist east germany , and german continued to be taught as a foreign language .
when the iron curtain collapsed and the soviet union dissolved , latvian students found a renewed interest in the german language - particularly when russian stopped being offered in schools in 1991 .
post-communist business boom today , some 16 years after the fall of communism in eastern europe , germany has become latvia ’ s biggest trading partner .
the newly opened baltic region became an attractive investment location for numerous western companies .
just outside of riga , the german company knauf produces plasterboard that is sold throughout the baltic region .
all of the management personnel have to speak german , said knauf manager peter rumer , since the riga branch has daily contact with co-workers in germany .
" in latvia it ’ s not at all hard to find german-speakers - and good ones at that , " added rumer .
shakespeare vs. goethe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the goethe institute is germany 's world-wide cultural ambassador according to the latvian ministry of education , however , the trend is heading in the opposite direction .
since english was introduced 12 years ago on the recommendation of the school authorities , the number of high school students taking the advanced german exam has dropped by 50 percent .
unlike the goethe institute , the ministry of education does n't see a need for action .
" the ministry of education values multilingualism , however the generally tendency in latvia toward english as a first foreign language can ’ t be avoided , " said gundega muceniece from the ministry .
meanwhile at the goethe institute , max is smoking on stage .
after the first cigarette he gets dizzy and ca n't get a single german word out of his mouth .
even without words , the children understand that max and moritz want to annoy widow bolte 's proud rooster - not an unusual pastime for the two pranksters .
catching up " what people missed at school they have to catch up on at the goethe institute , " said the institute 's director rudolf de baey .
" that 's good for business , but not for german-latvian relations . "
max has just promised his friend moritz that he wants to start learning a few german vocabulary words .
after all , both of them want to travel as soon as possible to all of the german-speaking countries in europe . aya bach -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de danes worry english onslaught could undermine the language danish linguists have warned the government that the increasing use of english in the country , especially in education , could wear away at the very foundation of danish .
similar concerns are shared by others in europe .

in fact , if a german does n't have a massive pile of dog-eared guide books and glossy travel brochures about the world 's best beaches , mountains and museums in their lounge room , their friends will probably take his or her temperature and book an emergency appointment at a travel agency .
and although germans can be found swarming around tourist highlights all around the world , it seems the one place they do n't like to visit is the east of their own country .
according to a poll by the tns-emnid institute , nearly 90 percent of eastern germans had visited the west but just under half of all western germans -lrb- or wessies as they are called here -rrb- have never been to the former ddr .
it seems former communist east germany has a bad reputation despite its picture-postcard towns , wealth of art and culture and beautiful countryside .
hard to shake off communist past " the buildings are old and everything is run down , " said one cologne woman happy to share her opinions about her country 's east , although she 'd never been there .
" nothing is new there . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rise of the right in eastern germany has damaged its reputation some parts of eastern germany had some bad press because of far right attacks on foreigners and an increase in support for extreme right wing parties .
this does n't go down well with wessies who pride themselves on their tolerance .
" they are unemployed and have no motivation for the future so they are racist , " said another wessie .
though high unemployment does n't seem to stop germans visiting other countries such france or romania .
those that do take a look at eastern germany 17 years after the fall of the berlin wall are the elderly with the majority of german visitors to the region over 50 .

in fact , if a german does n't have a massive pile of dog-eared guide books and glossy travel brochures about the world 's best beaches , mountains and museums in their lounge room , their friends will probably take his or her temperature and book an emergency appointment at a travel agency .
and although germans can be found swarming around tourist highlights all around the world , it seems the one place they do n't like to visit is the east of their own country .
according to a poll by the tns-emnid institute , nearly 90 percent of eastern germans had visited the west but just under half of all western germans -lrb- or wessies as they are called here -rrb- have never been to the former ddr .
it seems former communist east germany has a bad reputation despite its picture-postcard towns , wealth of art and culture and beautiful countryside .
hard to shake off communist past " the buildings are old and everything is run down , " said one cologne woman happy to share her opinions about her country 's east , although she 'd never been there .
" nothing is new there . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rise of the right in eastern germany has damaged its reputation some parts of eastern germany had some bad press because of far right attacks on foreigners and an increase in support for extreme right wing parties .
this does n't go down well with wessies who pride themselves on their tolerance .
" they are unemployed and have no motivation for the future so they are racist , " said another wessie .
though high unemployment does n't seem to stop germans visiting other countries such france or romania .
those that do take a look at eastern germany 17 years after the fall of the berlin wall are the elderly with the majority of german visitors to the region over 50 .
where do germans go ?
bildunterschrift : you just ca n't beat the beach for making germans happy within their own country , it seems germans are just suckers for one-liter beers steins , men in leather pants and mountain scenery - more than 20 percent of the 212 million domestic trips made last year were to bavaria .
otherwise , the preferred german holiday destination is spain , spain and spain .

" we are on a long , narrow road and we have to be patient .
but our two countries are friends . " erdogan , however , added that he felt the criticism he had voiced was " legitimate . " in the magazine interview , the turkish pm was quoted as saying : " seriously , i expected more from germany .
we would like a clear idea of a date , a roadmap and a calendar for negotiations .
the europeans could thereby show our people that they are serious . " he also suggested 2014 or 2015 as a possible date for turkish accession , calling on the eu to decide whether it was a true " family of different cultures or a christian club . " turkish pm makes peace and case for membership but after discussions with the german chancellor , erdogan moderated his criticism , saying there had been a " boost " to the talks under the german presidency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands protested in turkey at the notion that erdogan run for the country 's presidency erdogan also reiterated his belief that turkey had enormous potential and that his country wanted to enter the eu not as a burden but to help carry the burden , noting that turkey had undergone considerable reforms . " every new country in the eu means new markets and new investment opportunities , " he said .
" the turkish economy has become more open and more liberal . " merkel seemed to understand erdogan 's frustrations , saying the european union could open two more chapters of membership talks with turkey by july but reiterated the eu 's stance with turkey over the cyprus dispute . merkel offers progress with cyprus caveat " under the german presidency of the eu , two more chapters could probably be opened if things go well , " said merkel .
" we are looking ahead but the outcome of this process remains open , " she said , adding that it is " important that turkey normalizes ties with cyprus . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel wants the cyprus dispute solved the european union relaunched membership talks with turkey at the end of march after a long hiatus caused by ankara 's refusal to respect its trade obligations to cyprus under a customs agreement with the eu . turkey has refused to open its ports and airports to greek cypriot traffic until the eu lives up to its pledge to end the isolation of the turkish cypriot state in the north of the mediterranean island , which is recognized only by ankara . merkel 's conservative christian democrats oppose turkish membership of the eu and would prefer instead that the secular islamic nation become a " privileged partner " of the 27-member bloc .
but she has agreed to support the eu 's ongoing accession negotiations with ankara as part of her government 's coalition agreement with the center-left social democrats . the social democrats are in favor of turkey joining the eu , a stance reiterated by statements made by foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier on sunday . " security and stability would be raised in europe if turkey is involved , " he said , adding that the reform process in turkey needed to continue and become better integrated if its bid for membership was to be successful . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkish premier criticizes germany ahead of visit turkey 's prime minister recep tayyip erdogan reproached germany for failing to do more to advance his country 's hopes of joining the european union , in an interview to be published on monday .

" we are on a long , narrow road and we have to be patient .
but our two countries are friends . " erdogan , however , added that he felt the criticism he had voiced was " legitimate . " in the magazine interview , the turkish pm was quoted as saying : " seriously , i expected more from germany .
we would like a clear idea of a date , a roadmap and a calendar for negotiations .
the europeans could thereby show our people that they are serious . " he also suggested 2014 or 2015 as a possible date for turkish accession , calling on the eu to decide whether it was a true " family of different cultures or a christian club . " turkish pm makes peace and case for membership but after discussions with the german chancellor , erdogan moderated his criticism , saying there had been a " boost " to the talks under the german presidency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands protested in turkey at the notion that erdogan run for the country 's presidency erdogan also reiterated his belief that turkey had enormous potential and that his country wanted to enter the eu not as a burden but to help carry the burden , noting that turkey had undergone considerable reforms . " every new country in the eu means new markets and new investment opportunities , " he said .
" the turkish economy has become more open and more liberal . " merkel seemed to understand erdogan 's frustrations , saying the european union could open two more chapters of membership talks with turkey by july but reiterated the eu 's stance with turkey over the cyprus dispute . merkel offers progress with cyprus caveat " under the german presidency of the eu , two more chapters could probably be opened if things go well , " said merkel .
" we are looking ahead but the outcome of this process remains open , " she said , adding that it is " important that turkey normalizes ties with cyprus . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel wants the cyprus dispute solved the european union relaunched membership talks with turkey at the end of march after a long hiatus caused by ankara 's refusal to respect its trade obligations to cyprus under a customs agreement with the eu . turkey has refused to open its ports and airports to greek cypriot traffic until the eu lives up to its pledge to end the isolation of the turkish cypriot state in the north of the mediterranean island , which is recognized only by ankara . merkel 's conservative christian democrats oppose turkish membership of the eu and would prefer instead that the secular islamic nation become a " privileged partner " of the 27-member bloc .
but she has agreed to support the eu 's ongoing accession negotiations with ankara as part of her government 's coalition agreement with the center-left social democrats . the social democrats are in favor of turkey joining the eu , a stance reiterated by statements made by foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier on sunday . " security and stability would be raised in europe if turkey is involved , " he said , adding that the reform process in turkey needed to continue and become better integrated if its bid for membership was to be successful . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkish premier criticizes germany ahead of visit turkey 's prime minister recep tayyip erdogan reproached germany for failing to do more to advance his country 's hopes of joining the european union , in an interview to be published on monday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 16.04.2007 goethe institute picks up long german tradition in latvia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : riga , latvia 's capital , had contact to germany as a member of the hanseatic league latvia has traditionally had close ties to germany , ever since its capital city riga was founded by a german in 1201 .
now the goethe institute is stepping up efforts to restore interest in learning the german language . the kids clap their hands as thomas diekhaus is abruptly interrupted while reading " max and moritz , " a famous 19th century poem about the antics of two naughty boys .
their caps pulled down low on their heads , two real life boys dressed as max and moritz have snuck up onto the stage .
diekhaus directs the language department of the goethe institute in riga , latvia , and wants to encourage the children to learn german .
there 's lots of work to be done , he said , because the number of german learners has dropped by 10 percent to 11 percent every year since 2000 .
800 years of common history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : humorit wilhelm busch published his max und moritz poem in 1865 latvia 's german connection is hundreds of years old .
in 1201 , bishop albert from bremen founded the city of riga , now the capital , where the daugava river flows into the baltic sea .
as a member of the hanseatic league , many german traders came to riga and the city flourished .
it also became an important center of trade with russia .
when world war ii broke out in 1939 , most of the germans living in latvia moved to germany .
even while under soviet rule after the war , latvia maintained strong connections with communist east germany , and german continued to be taught as a foreign language .
when the iron curtain collapsed and the soviet union dissolved , latvian students found a renewed interest in the german language - particularly when russian stopped being offered in schools in 1991 .
post-communist business boom today , some 16 years after the fall of communism in eastern europe , germany has become latvia ’ s biggest trading partner .
the newly opened baltic region became an attractive investment location for numerous western companies .
just outside of riga , the german company knauf produces plasterboard that is sold throughout the baltic region .
all of the management personnel have to speak german , said knauf manager peter rumer , since the riga branch has daily contact with co-workers in germany .
" in latvia it ’ s not at all hard to find german-speakers - and good ones at that , " added rumer .
shakespeare vs. goethe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the goethe institute is germany 's world-wide cultural ambassador according to the latvian ministry of education , however , the trend is heading in the opposite direction .
since english was introduced 12 years ago on the recommendation of the school authorities , the number of high school students taking the advanced german exam has dropped by 50 percent .
unlike the goethe institute , the ministry of education does n't see a need for action .
" the ministry of education values multilingualism , however the generally tendency in latvia toward english as a first foreign language can ’ t be avoided , " said gundega muceniece from the ministry .
meanwhile at the goethe institute , max is smoking on stage .
after the first cigarette he gets dizzy and ca n't get a single german word out of his mouth .
even without words , the children understand that max and moritz want to annoy widow bolte 's proud rooster - not an unusual pastime for the two pranksters .
catching up " what people missed at school they have to catch up on at the goethe institute , " said the institute 's director rudolf de baey .
" that 's good for business , but not for german-latvian relations . "
max has just promised his friend moritz that he wants to start learning a few german vocabulary words .
after all , both of them want to travel as soon as possible to all of the german-speaking countries in europe . aya bach -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de danes worry english onslaught could undermine the language danish linguists have warned the government that the increasing use of english in the country , especially in education , could wear away at the very foundation of danish .
similar concerns are shared by others in europe .

" we are on a long , narrow road and we have to be patient .

we would like a clear idea of a date , a roadmap and a calendar for negotiations .
the europeans could thereby show our people that they are serious . " he also suggested 2014 or 2015 as a possible date for turkish accession , calling on the eu to decide whether it was a true " family of different cultures or a christian club . " turkish pm makes peace and case for membership but after discussions with the german chancellor , erdogan moderated his criticism , saying there had been a " boost " to the talks under the german presidency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands protested in turkey at the notion that erdogan run for the country 's presidency erdogan also reiterated his belief that turkey had enormous potential and that his country wanted to enter the eu not as a burden but to help carry the burden , noting that turkey had undergone considerable reforms . " every new country in the eu means new markets and new investment opportunities , " he said .
" the turkish economy has become more open and more liberal . " merkel seemed to understand erdogan 's frustrations , saying the european union could open two more chapters of membership talks with turkey by july but reiterated the eu 's stance with turkey over the cyprus dispute . merkel offers progress with cyprus caveat " under the german presidency of the eu , two more chapters could probably be opened if things go well , " said merkel .
" we are looking ahead but the outcome of this process remains open , " she said , adding that it is " important that turkey normalizes ties with cyprus . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel wants the cyprus dispute solved the european union relaunched membership talks with turkey at the end of march after a long hiatus caused by ankara 's refusal to respect its trade obligations to cyprus under a customs agreement with the eu . turkey has refused to open its ports and airports to greek cypriot traffic until the eu lives up to its pledge to end the isolation of the turkish cypriot state in the north of the mediterranean island , which is recognized only by ankara . merkel 's conservative christian democrats oppose turkish membership of the eu and would prefer instead that the secular islamic nation become a " privileged partner " of the 27-member bloc .
but she has agreed to support the eu 's ongoing accession negotiations with ankara as part of her government 's coalition agreement with the center-left social democrats . the social democrats are in favor of turkey joining the eu , a stance reiterated by statements made by foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier on sunday . " security and stability would be raised in europe if turkey is involved , " he said , adding that the reform process in turkey needed to continue and become better integrated if its bid for membership was to be successful . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkish premier criticizes germany ahead of visit turkey 's prime minister recep tayyip erdogan reproached germany for failing to do more to advance his country 's hopes of joining the european union , in an interview to be published on monday .

in fact , if a german does n't have a massive pile of dog-eared guide books and glossy travel brochures about the world 's best beaches , mountains and museums in their lounge room , their friends will probably take his or her temperature and book an emergency appointment at a travel agency .
and although germans can be found swarming around tourist highlights all around the world , it seems the one place they do n't like to visit is the east of their own country .
according to a poll by the tns-emnid institute , nearly 90 percent of eastern germans had visited the west but just under half of all western germans -lrb- or wessies as they are called here -rrb- have never been to the former ddr .
it seems former communist east germany has a bad reputation despite its picture-postcard towns , wealth of art and culture and beautiful countryside .
hard to shake off communist past " the buildings are old and everything is run down , " said one cologne woman happy to share her opinions about her country 's east , although she 'd never been there .
" nothing is new there . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rise of the right in eastern germany has damaged its reputation some parts of eastern germany had some bad press because of far right attacks on foreigners and an increase in support for extreme right wing parties .
this does n't go down well with wessies who pride themselves on their tolerance .
" they are unemployed and have no motivation for the future so they are racist , " said another wessie .
though high unemployment does n't seem to stop germans visiting other countries such france or romania .
those that do take a look at eastern germany 17 years after the fall of the berlin wall are the elderly with the majority of german visitors to the region over 50 .
where do germans go ?
bildunterschrift : you just ca n't beat the beach for making germans happy within their own country , it seems germans are just suckers for one-liter beers steins , men in leather pants and mountain scenery - more than 20 percent of the 212 million domestic trips made last year were to bavaria .
otherwise , the preferred german holiday destination is spain , spain and spain .

" we are on a long , narrow road and we have to be patient .
but our two countries are friends . " erdogan , however , added that he felt the criticism he had voiced was " legitimate . " in the magazine interview , the turkish pm was quoted as saying : " seriously , i expected more from germany .
we would like a clear idea of a date , a roadmap and a calendar for negotiations .
the europeans could thereby show our people that they are serious . " he also suggested 2014 or 2015 as a possible date for turkish accession , calling on the eu to decide whether it was a true " family of different cultures or a christian club . " turkish pm makes peace and case for membership but after discussions with the german chancellor , erdogan moderated his criticism , saying there had been a " boost " to the talks under the german presidency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands protested in turkey at the notion that erdogan run for the country 's presidency erdogan also reiterated his belief that turkey had enormous potential and that his country wanted to enter the eu not as a burden but to help carry the burden , noting that turkey had undergone considerable reforms . " every new country in the eu means new markets and new investment opportunities , " he said .
" the turkish economy has become more open and more liberal . " merkel seemed to understand erdogan 's frustrations , saying the european union could open two more chapters of membership talks with turkey by july but reiterated the eu 's stance with turkey over the cyprus dispute . merkel offers progress with cyprus caveat " under the german presidency of the eu , two more chapters could probably be opened if things go well , " said merkel .
" we are looking ahead but the outcome of this process remains open , " she said , adding that it is " important that turkey normalizes ties with cyprus . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel wants the cyprus dispute solved the european union relaunched membership talks with turkey at the end of march after a long hiatus caused by ankara 's refusal to respect its trade obligations to cyprus under a customs agreement with the eu . turkey has refused to open its ports and airports to greek cypriot traffic until the eu lives up to its pledge to end the isolation of the turkish cypriot state in the north of the mediterranean island , which is recognized only by ankara . merkel 's conservative christian democrats oppose turkish membership of the eu and would prefer instead that the secular islamic nation become a " privileged partner " of the 27-member bloc .
but she has agreed to support the eu 's ongoing accession negotiations with ankara as part of her government 's coalition agreement with the center-left social democrats . the social democrats are in favor of turkey joining the eu , a stance reiterated by statements made by foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier on sunday . " security and stability would be raised in europe if turkey is involved , " he said , adding that the reform process in turkey needed to continue and become better integrated if its bid for membership was to be successful . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkish premier criticizes germany ahead of visit turkey 's prime minister recep tayyip erdogan reproached germany for failing to do more to advance his country 's hopes of joining the european union , in an interview to be published on monday .

but it 's not german pope benedict xiv who is responsible for the tax boon - rather it 's the country 's pumping economy . the catholic church in germany had a bumper year in 2006 .
according to recent estimates , the 27 dioceses on average took in some eight percent more when compared to 2005 .
financial experts for the church expect that revenue for 2007 could amount to 4.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 6 billion -rrb- - 500 million euros more than two years ago . germany has a system of ecclesiastical financing unique to only a few european countries .
germany 's 28 million catholics - along with other members of state-recognized religions - are obligated to pay their churches a tax of between 8 percent and 9 percent , depending on where they live . the federal tax office automatically deducts this from people 's monthly pay packets every month , with the result that germany 's churches are among the richest in the world . catholics leaving in droves despite this comfortable tax arrangement , the last few years have n't been too kind to the catholic church . between 2000 and 2005 , more than 680,000 people officially registered to leave the church and free themselves from their tax obligations -lrb- and their right to receive the sacraments at the same time -rrb- .
in addition , germany 's sluggish economy with its high unemployment rates and lower wages meant there was even less money available to tax . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : apart from mass events like world youth day , more and more christians are becoming disenchanted with the church but now , things are looking up because the levy , the church 's biggest single source of income , is back up to levels not seen since 1998 . according to sebastian anneser , the financial director of the catholic archdiocese of munich and freising , a key reason for this " surprising " development is increasing business confidence and its positive effects on employment . in his march budget statement , though , anneser warned the increase " was n't expected to hold in the long-term " because a combination of low birthrates , aging population and waning interest were causing people to " turn their backs on the church . " however , the church has managed to stem the floodtide somewhat - the rate at which people are abandoning catholic pews has fallen sharply in the past few years . german in the vatican while there have been some suggestions that this is because a german now sits on the papal chair , the catholic church itself is hesitant to make this connection .

if you 're the parent of a tokio hotel fan , however , standing in line for hours just got a whole lot better . for the kids , standing for hours on end to get the chance to get a glimpse of their heroes on stage is just part of being infatuated with a pop group .
the dedicated fan thinks nothing of camping out for tickets overnight or queuing for a gig for days .
for most , this is not a problem .
teenagers are hardy sorts and - with parental permission - can quite easily withstand the rigors of serious fandom . but for fans of german teen sensations tokio hotel , it is an entirely different pot of eyeliner . while the fans themselves are more than willing to withstand the boredom of lining up with other like-minded souls for the chance to scream at bill , tom , gustav and georg , a large number of those are well below the age of parental consent .
this means that mum and dad have to queue as well .
and this is where the problem lies . a parent 's worst nightmare made bearable bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bill kaulitz takes his skunk / porcupine for a walk mummy and daddy may have only just gotten round to the idea that their offspring is having confusingly carnal thoughts about an androgynous teenage boy with what appears to be a humongous skunk-like porcupine stuck on his head .
now they have to stand in almost 40-degree heat for hours , if not days , to make sure said infatuated child is safely ticketed and ensconced in the secure atmosphere of the kindergarten / rock concert of their dreams . this was the case this weekend when tokio hotel were set to play to 8000 screamer pre-teens at the frankfurt festival hall .
in scorching sunshine , the parents of the eight to 15-year old crowd members soon found themselves wilting along with their crazed offspring .

if you 're the parent of a tokio hotel fan , however , standing in line for hours just got a whole lot better . for the kids , standing for hours on end to get the chance to get a glimpse of their heroes on stage is just part of being infatuated with a pop group .
the dedicated fan thinks nothing of camping out for tickets overnight or queuing for a gig for days .
for most , this is not a problem .
teenagers are hardy sorts and - with parental permission - can quite easily withstand the rigors of serious fandom . but for fans of german teen sensations tokio hotel , it is an entirely different pot of eyeliner . while the fans themselves are more than willing to withstand the boredom of lining up with other like-minded souls for the chance to scream at bill , tom , gustav and georg , a large number of those are well below the age of parental consent .
this means that mum and dad have to queue as well .
and this is where the problem lies . a parent 's worst nightmare made bearable bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bill kaulitz takes his skunk / porcupine for a walk mummy and daddy may have only just gotten round to the idea that their offspring is having confusingly carnal thoughts about an androgynous teenage boy with what appears to be a humongous skunk-like porcupine stuck on his head .
now they have to stand in almost 40-degree heat for hours , if not days , to make sure said infatuated child is safely ticketed and ensconced in the secure atmosphere of the kindergarten / rock concert of their dreams . this was the case this weekend when tokio hotel were set to play to 8000 screamer pre-teens at the frankfurt festival hall .
in scorching sunshine , the parents of the eight to 15-year old crowd members soon found themselves wilting along with their crazed offspring .
luckily , they also soon found themselves to be the subject of a parental care experiment . local radio broadcaster hr3 , a sponsor of the tokio hotel show , provided parents with refreshments , music to dance to , formula one racing arcade games and other pastimes to help the hours fly by .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 16.04.2007 west germans have hang-ups about going east großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dresden in germany 's east is a unesco world heritage site as they pick up pictures taken over the easter holidays , few western germans are flipping through photos of the country 's east , and experts say not many vacations in the former east germany are being planned . as the world 's undisputed traveling kings , checking out the ultimate holiday deal is virtually a national pastime here in germany .
in fact , if a german does n't have a massive pile of dog-eared guide books and glossy travel brochures about the world 's best beaches , mountains and museums in their lounge room , their friends will probably take his or her temperature and book an emergency appointment at a travel agency .
and although germans can be found swarming around tourist highlights all around the world , it seems the one place they do n't like to visit is the east of their own country .
according to a poll by the tns-emnid institute , nearly 90 percent of eastern germans had visited the west but just under half of all western germans -lrb- or wessies as they are called here -rrb- have never been to the former ddr .
it seems former communist east germany has a bad reputation despite its picture-postcard towns , wealth of art and culture and beautiful countryside .
hard to shake off communist past " the buildings are old and everything is run down , " said one cologne woman happy to share her opinions about her country 's east , although she 'd never been there .
" nothing is new there . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rise of the right in eastern germany has damaged its reputation some parts of eastern germany had some bad press because of far right attacks on foreigners and an increase in support for extreme right wing parties .
this does n't go down well with wessies who pride themselves on their tolerance .
" they are unemployed and have no motivation for the future so they are racist , " said another wessie .
though high unemployment does n't seem to stop germans visiting other countries such france or romania .
those that do take a look at eastern germany 17 years after the fall of the berlin wall are the elderly with the majority of german visitors to the region over 50 .

in fact , if a german does n't have a massive pile of dog-eared guide books and glossy travel brochures about the world 's best beaches , mountains and museums in their lounge room , their friends will probably take his or her temperature and book an emergency appointment at a travel agency .
and although germans can be found swarming around tourist highlights all around the world , it seems the one place they do n't like to visit is the east of their own country .
according to a poll by the tns-emnid institute , nearly 90 percent of eastern germans had visited the west but just under half of all western germans -lrb- or wessies as they are called here -rrb- have never been to the former ddr .
it seems former communist east germany has a bad reputation despite its picture-postcard towns , wealth of art and culture and beautiful countryside .
hard to shake off communist past " the buildings are old and everything is run down , " said one cologne woman happy to share her opinions about her country 's east , although she 'd never been there .
" nothing is new there . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rise of the right in eastern germany has damaged its reputation some parts of eastern germany had some bad press because of far right attacks on foreigners and an increase in support for extreme right wing parties .
this does n't go down well with wessies who pride themselves on their tolerance .
" they are unemployed and have no motivation for the future so they are racist , " said another wessie .
though high unemployment does n't seem to stop germans visiting other countries such france or romania .
those that do take a look at eastern germany 17 years after the fall of the berlin wall are the elderly with the majority of german visitors to the region over 50 .
where do germans go ?
bildunterschrift : you just ca n't beat the beach for making germans happy within their own country , it seems germans are just suckers for one-liter beers steins , men in leather pants and mountain scenery - more than 20 percent of the 212 million domestic trips made last year were to bavaria .

" the friends of kasparov will not gain any popularity because their demonstrations are suppressed .
the tough actions of the police will not trigger a wave of protest against those in power .
nevertheless , the kremlin is showing an astonishing weakness by reacting so rigorously to the smallest sign of protest , " muses the paper .
austrian newspaper die presse also wondered why the kremlin had acted so brutally : " you really ask yourself whether the people in power in moscow are completely crazy .
apparently , president putin continues to have the backing of 70 percent and more of the population .
what are he and his technocrats afraid of ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : riot police officers detain russian opposition leader garry kasparov it added later : " if this small heap of civil and human rights campaigners , liberals , national bolchevists and anarchists really frightens the putinists so much that they deploy a whole army of police against them , then their power base is n't looking rosy -lrb- … -rrb- in that case , this demonstration of power from the kremlin has actually revealed its weakness . " bulgarian newspaper dnewnik described the beatings and arrests as par for the course .
" really no one should be surprised .
it is enough to remember that the russian president is a former kgb agent and that 90 percent of the leadership in today 's russia are a product of the former secret services . " swiss newspaper basler zeitung argued putin was attempting to deter what had happened in parts of the former soviet union .
" from the point of view of the governing regime of president vladimir putin this makes perfect sense . -lrb- … -rrb- the kremlin has learnt its lesson from the peaceful revolutions in georgia and the ukraine where after blatant vote rigging , protest rallies quickly gained momentum and led to the toppling of the respective governments .
he wants to keep the protests as small as possible and incite fear among normal citizens . " but the paper also questioned whether this approach would really work .
" it may work in the short-term , " it wrote .
" but in the long-term this was rarely a healthy political strategy . " danish newspaper berlingske tidende was damning about russia 's political system .
" you have to be completely blind or excessively tolerant not to see that there is something wrong with russia .
just a year before the elections that mark the end of president putin 's time in office , he has this country so firmly in his grip that democracy is just a shell . " the paper calls upon the international community to do more .
" the eu and the us could happily exercise more pressure than is the case at the moment .
putin can carry out his actions largely unhindered " . finally , german newspaper die welt also urged the west not to beat about the bush .
the paper says any misguided sense of respect or fear of having russia energy supplies cut should not stop the international community from taking action .

now the goethe institute is stepping up efforts to restore interest in learning the german language . the kids clap their hands as thomas diekhaus is abruptly interrupted while reading " max and moritz , " a famous 19th century poem about the antics of two naughty boys .
their caps pulled down low on their heads , two real life boys dressed as max and moritz have snuck up onto the stage .
diekhaus directs the language department of the goethe institute in riga , latvia , and wants to encourage the children to learn german .
there 's lots of work to be done , he said , because the number of german learners has dropped by 10 percent to 11 percent every year since 2000 .
800 years of common history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : humorit wilhelm busch published his max und moritz poem in 1865 latvia 's german connection is hundreds of years old .
in 1201 , bishop albert from bremen founded the city of riga , now the capital , where the daugava river flows into the baltic sea .
as a member of the hanseatic league , many german traders came to riga and the city flourished .
it also became an important center of trade with russia .
when world war ii broke out in 1939 , most of the germans living in latvia moved to germany .
even while under soviet rule after the war , latvia maintained strong connections with communist east germany , and german continued to be taught as a foreign language .
when the iron curtain collapsed and the soviet union dissolved , latvian students found a renewed interest in the german language - particularly when russian stopped being offered in schools in 1991 .
post-communist business boom today , some 16 years after the fall of communism in eastern europe , germany has become latvia ’ s biggest trading partner .
the newly opened baltic region became an attractive investment location for numerous western companies .
just outside of riga , the german company knauf produces plasterboard that is sold throughout the baltic region .
all of the management personnel have to speak german , said knauf manager peter rumer , since the riga branch has daily contact with co-workers in germany .
" in latvia it ’ s not at all hard to find german-speakers - and good ones at that , " added rumer .
shakespeare vs. goethe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the goethe institute is germany 's world-wide cultural ambassador according to the latvian ministry of education , however , the trend is heading in the opposite direction .
since english was introduced 12 years ago on the recommendation of the school authorities , the number of high school students taking the advanced german exam has dropped by 50 percent .
unlike the goethe institute , the ministry of education does n't see a need for action .
" the ministry of education values multilingualism , however the generally tendency in latvia toward english as a first foreign language can ’ t be avoided , " said gundega muceniece from the ministry .
meanwhile at the goethe institute , max is smoking on stage .
after the first cigarette he gets dizzy and ca n't get a single german word out of his mouth .
even without words , the children understand that max and moritz want to annoy widow bolte 's proud rooster - not an unusual pastime for the two pranksters .
catching up " what people missed at school they have to catch up on at the goethe institute , " said the institute 's director rudolf de baey .
" that 's good for business , but not for german-latvian relations . "
max has just promised his friend moritz that he wants to start learning a few german vocabulary words .
after all , both of them want to travel as soon as possible to all of the german-speaking countries in europe . aya bach -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de danes worry english onslaught could undermine the language danish linguists have warned the government that the increasing use of english in the country , especially in education , could wear away at the very foundation of danish .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 16.04.2007 a soldier 's experiences in the kinshasa tinderbox großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundeswehr troops faced tough conditions and volatile situations in congo after the un extended the mandate for peacekeeping troops in the democratic republic of congo last week , political scientist simon wunder , a reservist with the eufor contingent deployed there , described his experiences . there were huge doubts about the german government 's decision at the beginning of last year to send a deployment of german troops to democratic republic of congo -lrb- drc -rrb- .
it was a country where nearly 4 million people had died in the civil war since 1997 , a conflict that had raged until the warring sides called an armistice in 2002 . the unsteady peace made it possible for the first free elections in 40 years to take place in 2006 and the 780 soldiers of the eufor force , sent under a mandate from the european union , would be in the capital kinshasa to ensure stability during the voting . despite this ceasefire and these steps towards democracy , there were risks .
there was sporadic fighting across the country , political tensions which threatened to spill out onto the streets and the disturbing problem of child soldiers .
nevertheless , the eu mandate and the german deployment was approved and continued even when the situation in congo deteriorated further as the european soldiers arrived . the conditions for the soldiers on the ground in congo was given little consideration when the application for the german deployment was agreed on ; this seems to be the case in most foreign deployments these days with the soldiers considered little more than a buffer force between warring factions by the politicians making the decisions .
however , the armed forces were consulted about the situation and therefore it was assumed that all aspects of the mission had been discussed and made clear . unacceptable and volatile conditions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many german troops had no idea what to expect in congo the defense commissioner for the german lower house of parliament - the bundestag - even described the living conditions of european soldiers in the congo as " unacceptable " before the german application was made .
the troops lived together for months in the narrowest of tents which soon went moldy in the rainy season , where the air humidity was 90 percent and temperatures were as high as 40 degrees celsius -lrb- 104 degrees f -rrb- .
the monsoon caused floods and made the latrine pits overflow .
there were also defective showers and at times scarcely enough drinking water for the contingent . being separated from their loved ones also brought many problems for the troops .
the workload in kinshasa was more than expected with fighting breaking out between rival factions causing strain on those caught in the conflict and those waiting at home for news .
the uncertainty and worry put strain on marriages and families and brought many to the breaking point . experienced soldiers who had seen action in afghanistan and the balkans had been confronted with conditions like this before , but for the less experienced troops the reality of the misery , decay and the results of a long and brutal civil war made very deep impressions on them .
for many it was not an easy situation . a tinderbox threatening to ignite bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eufor troops soon saw how fragile the peace was far from just monitoring elections in the midst of a fragile ceasefire , the europeans found themselves dealing with riots and battles between drc troops and the forces of presidential candidate jean-pierre bemba . as the election neared , bemba 's bodyguards and armed fighters became increasingly nervous and when government soldiers attacked the candidate 's residence , there was a real chance that the civil war could reignite .
dozens died as a result , and european forces found themselves caught in the middle .
however , if they had not been there , it would have been a lot worse . the situation in kinshasa became like a tinderbox .
seemingly innocuous incidents could become inflammatory in seconds .
soldiers keeping the peace would regularly and suddenly find themselves facing a hostile crowd intent on rioting or criminal gangs moving through the capital . in these cases , the eufor troops had to make split-second decisions to avoid escalation .
was a stone thrown towards them the beginning of an attack or the action of a high-spirited youngster ?
an overreaction from just one soldier could have had catastrophic effects , but a show of weakness or passivity also could have led to severe consequences . to make the right decisions in such a volatile environment requires a high degree of professionalism and judgment .
the soldiers making these types of decisions were in their early twenties and often making them alone . eufor prevented a return to war bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eufor mission was widely seen as a success in the end , it was widely accepted that the decision to station united nations forces in kinshasa , the political center of the country , to provide stability was a successful one .
while the deployment was initially viewed with much skepticism , it eventually gained support and sympathy .
in general , the deployment of the eufor troops was seen as a success and that their presence , particularly during the august riots , was a decisive factor in the prevention of a return to civil war . every soldier at some point questions whether his or her deployment is worth the risk it may put on their life .
the mainly positive reaction of the congolese people by the end of the deployment convinced many that they had done a good and worthwhile job . however , by the end , it also became clear that the deployment of troops in congo could not solve the country 's problems .
a society that works with the government to create peace and stability is established only in parts .
old conflicts continue and they can only be solved by the congolese people themselves . simon wunder is a reserve officer in the bundeswehr and a doctoral candidate in aachen .
he was deployed with the operative information regiment in kinshasa and presents his personal view in this article . -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de africa expert confident of un mission in dr congo serious fighting has erupted in the dr congo after surprisingly peaceful elections last year .

european newpapers have reacted to the beating and arrest of hundreds of russian protesters , including opposition politician garry kasparov . french newspaper le figaro expressed surprise at the events in russia in the light of putin 's domestic support . " the friends of kasparov will not gain any popularity because their demonstrations are suppressed .
the tough actions of the police will not trigger a wave of protest against those in power .
nevertheless , the kremlin is showing an astonishing weakness by reacting so rigorously to the smallest sign of protest , " muses the paper .
austrian newspaper die presse also wondered why the kremlin had acted so brutally : " you really ask yourself whether the people in power in moscow are completely crazy .
apparently , president putin continues to have the backing of 70 percent and more of the population .
what are he and his technocrats afraid of ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : riot police officers detain russian opposition leader garry kasparov it added later : " if this small heap of civil and human rights campaigners , liberals , national bolchevists and anarchists really frightens the putinists so much that they deploy a whole army of police against them , then their power base is n't looking rosy -lrb- … -rrb- in that case , this demonstration of power from the kremlin has actually revealed its weakness . " bulgarian newspaper dnewnik described the beatings and arrests as par for the course .
" really no one should be surprised .
it is enough to remember that the russian president is a former kgb agent and that 90 percent of the leadership in today 's russia are a product of the former secret services .

" from the point of view of the governing regime of president vladimir putin this makes perfect sense . -lrb- … -rrb- the kremlin has learnt its lesson from the peaceful revolutions in georgia and the ukraine where after blatant vote rigging , protest rallies quickly gained momentum and led to the toppling of the respective governments .

it was a country where nearly 4 million people had died in the civil war since 1997 , a conflict that had raged until the warring sides called an armistice in 2002 . the unsteady peace made it possible for the first free elections in 40 years to take place in 2006 and the 780 soldiers of the eufor force , sent under a mandate from the european union , would be in the capital kinshasa to ensure stability during the voting . despite this ceasefire and these steps towards democracy , there were risks .
there was sporadic fighting across the country , political tensions which threatened to spill out onto the streets and the disturbing problem of child soldiers .
nevertheless , the eu mandate and the german deployment was approved and continued even when the situation in congo deteriorated further as the european soldiers arrived . the conditions for the soldiers on the ground in congo was given little consideration when the application for the german deployment was agreed on ; this seems to be the case in most foreign deployments these days with the soldiers considered little more than a buffer force between warring factions by the politicians making the decisions .
however , the armed forces were consulted about the situation and therefore it was assumed that all aspects of the mission had been discussed and made clear . unacceptable and volatile conditions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many german troops had no idea what to expect in congo the defense commissioner for the german lower house of parliament - the bundestag - even described the living conditions of european soldiers in the congo as " unacceptable " before the german application was made .
the troops lived together for months in the narrowest of tents which soon went moldy in the rainy season , where the air humidity was 90 percent and temperatures were as high as 40 degrees celsius -lrb- 104 degrees f -rrb- .
the monsoon caused floods and made the latrine pits overflow .
there were also defective showers and at times scarcely enough drinking water for the contingent . being separated from their loved ones also brought many problems for the troops .
the workload in kinshasa was more than expected with fighting breaking out between rival factions causing strain on those caught in the conflict and those waiting at home for news .
the uncertainty and worry put strain on marriages and families and brought many to the breaking point . experienced soldiers who had seen action in afghanistan and the balkans had been confronted with conditions like this before , but for the less experienced troops the reality of the misery , decay and the results of a long and brutal civil war made very deep impressions on them .
for many it was not an easy situation . a tinderbox threatening to ignite bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eufor troops soon saw how fragile the peace was far from just monitoring elections in the midst of a fragile ceasefire , the europeans found themselves dealing with riots and battles between drc troops and the forces of presidential candidate jean-pierre bemba . as the election neared , bemba 's bodyguards and armed fighters became increasingly nervous and when government soldiers attacked the candidate 's residence , there was a real chance that the civil war could reignite .
dozens died as a result , and european forces found themselves caught in the middle .
however , if they had not been there , it would have been a lot worse . the situation in kinshasa became like a tinderbox .
seemingly innocuous incidents could become inflammatory in seconds .
soldiers keeping the peace would regularly and suddenly find themselves facing a hostile crowd intent on rioting or criminal gangs moving through the capital . in these cases , the eufor troops had to make split-second decisions to avoid escalation .
was a stone thrown towards them the beginning of an attack or the action of a high-spirited youngster ?
an overreaction from just one soldier could have had catastrophic effects , but a show of weakness or passivity also could have led to severe consequences . to make the right decisions in such a volatile environment requires a high degree of professionalism and judgment .
the soldiers making these types of decisions were in their early twenties and often making them alone . eufor prevented a return to war bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eufor mission was widely seen as a success in the end , it was widely accepted that the decision to station united nations forces in kinshasa , the political center of the country , to provide stability was a successful one .
while the deployment was initially viewed with much skepticism , it eventually gained support and sympathy .
in general , the deployment of the eufor troops was seen as a success and that their presence , particularly during the august riots , was a decisive factor in the prevention of a return to civil war . every soldier at some point questions whether his or her deployment is worth the risk it may put on their life .
the mainly positive reaction of the congolese people by the end of the deployment convinced many that they had done a good and worthwhile job . however , by the end , it also became clear that the deployment of troops in congo could not solve the country 's problems .
a society that works with the government to create peace and stability is established only in parts .

it was a country where nearly 4 million people had died in the civil war since 1997 , a conflict that had raged until the warring sides called an armistice in 2002 . the unsteady peace made it possible for the first free elections in 40 years to take place in 2006 and the 780 soldiers of the eufor force , sent under a mandate from the european union , would be in the capital kinshasa to ensure stability during the voting . despite this ceasefire and these steps towards democracy , there were risks .
there was sporadic fighting across the country , political tensions which threatened to spill out onto the streets and the disturbing problem of child soldiers .
nevertheless , the eu mandate and the german deployment was approved and continued even when the situation in congo deteriorated further as the european soldiers arrived . the conditions for the soldiers on the ground in congo was given little consideration when the application for the german deployment was agreed on ; this seems to be the case in most foreign deployments these days with the soldiers considered little more than a buffer force between warring factions by the politicians making the decisions .
however , the armed forces were consulted about the situation and therefore it was assumed that all aspects of the mission had been discussed and made clear . unacceptable and volatile conditions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many german troops had no idea what to expect in congo the defense commissioner for the german lower house of parliament - the bundestag - even described the living conditions of european soldiers in the congo as " unacceptable " before the german application was made .

" the entry into the first quarter was very favorable , so there is a possibility that we will upgrade our forecast , " said weber , who as head of the german central bank sits on the ecb 's policy-setting governing council . warnings about complacency bdi chief thumann told a news conference in hanover said the current robust growth would make itself felt on the labor market where unemployment could feasibly fall below 3.5 million . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : exports are the real economic driver but the government must not rest on its laurels , thumann said , urging the ruling left-right coalition to press ahead with decisive structural reforms . " with the global economy set to expand by 5.0 percent , 2.5 percent growth for germany is not much , " thumann said .
" a lot remains to be done . " later this week , germany 's leading economic institutes also look set to raise their own growth forecasts , too . faster growth coupled with accelerating inflation will provide additional ammunition for the ecb to raise euro-zone borrowing costs - already at a five-and-a-year high - again later this year to prevent the economy from overheating . ecb chief jean-claude trichet sent clear signals last week that , with the current upturn set to continue , the guardian of the euro will notch up its benchmark " refi " refinancing rate to 4.0 percent in june . only the beginning ? the government , too , is becoming increasingly optimistic , with economy minister michael glos suggesting recently that berlin might raise its 2007 growth forecast from 1.7 percent to at least 2.0 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european central bank will likely increase rates to stop possible overheating " there are some indications that germany is still only at the beginning of an upturn that looks set to continue in the coming years , " weber said . the euro zone 's biggest economy was in a traditional cyclical upturn , with the strong export performance of past years now feeding through to investment , the central bank chief said . " at the end of last year , companies said they were investing to increase capacity , " he said . and private consumption could similarly start contributing to growth from the middle of the year , as well , weber continued . vat effect that should be the case once the so-called vat effect had faded , he argued , referring to a three-percentage-point increase in value-added or sales tax -lrb- vat -rrb- , which came into effect at the start of this year and which persuaded consumers to bring forward big-ticket purchases to the end of 2006 . recent rises in oil prices had been almost wholly offset by the rise in the value of the euro against the dollar , limiting the negative economic effects , weber said .
and the economic slowdown in the united states would not harm german exports , too much , given the growing importance of dynamic economies such as china and arab states , he argued . in their widely watched spring report , to be published on thursday , the country 's leading economic research institutes are widely expected to raise their forecasts for german growth this year and next year . newspaper reports have said that five of the six think-tanks - ifo in munich , diw in berlin , hwwa in hamburg , ifw in kiel , iwh in halle and rwi in essen - were pencilling 2.5-percent growth for the german economy both in 2007 and 2008 .

" we are on a long , narrow road and we have to be patient .

we would like a clear idea of a date , a roadmap and a calendar for negotiations .
the europeans could thereby show our people that they are serious . " he also suggested 2014 or 2015 as a possible date for turkish accession , calling on the eu to decide whether it was a true " family of different cultures or a christian club . " turkish pm makes peace and case for membership but after discussions with the german chancellor , erdogan moderated his criticism , saying there had been a " boost " to the talks under the german presidency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands protested in turkey at the notion that erdogan run for the country 's presidency erdogan also reiterated his belief that turkey had enormous potential and that his country wanted to enter the eu not as a burden but to help carry the burden , noting that turkey had undergone considerable reforms . " every new country in the eu means new markets and new investment opportunities , " he said .
" the turkish economy has become more open and more liberal . " merkel seemed to understand erdogan 's frustrations , saying the european union could open two more chapters of membership talks with turkey by july but reiterated the eu 's stance with turkey over the cyprus dispute . merkel offers progress with cyprus caveat " under the german presidency of the eu , two more chapters could probably be opened if things go well , " said merkel .
" we are looking ahead but the outcome of this process remains open , " she said , adding that it is " important that turkey normalizes ties with cyprus . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel wants the cyprus dispute solved the european union relaunched membership talks with turkey at the end of march after a long hiatus caused by ankara 's refusal to respect its trade obligations to cyprus under a customs agreement with the eu . turkey has refused to open its ports and airports to greek cypriot traffic until the eu lives up to its pledge to end the isolation of the turkish cypriot state in the north of the mediterranean island , which is recognized only by ankara . merkel 's conservative christian democrats oppose turkish membership of the eu and would prefer instead that the secular islamic nation become a " privileged partner " of the 27-member bloc .
but she has agreed to support the eu 's ongoing accession negotiations with ankara as part of her government 's coalition agreement with the center-left social democrats . the social democrats are in favor of turkey joining the eu , a stance reiterated by statements made by foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier on sunday . " security and stability would be raised in europe if turkey is involved , " he said , adding that the reform process in turkey needed to continue and become better integrated if its bid for membership was to be successful . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkish premier criticizes germany ahead of visit turkey 's prime minister recep tayyip erdogan reproached germany for failing to do more to advance his country 's hopes of joining the european union , in an interview to be published on monday .

financial experts for the church expect that revenue for 2007 could amount to 4.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 6 billion -rrb- - 500 million euros more than two years ago . germany has a system of ecclesiastical financing unique to only a few european countries .

" we are on a long , narrow road and we have to be patient .
but our two countries are friends . " erdogan , however , added that he felt the criticism he had voiced was " legitimate . " in the magazine interview , the turkish pm was quoted as saying : " seriously , i expected more from germany .
we would like a clear idea of a date , a roadmap and a calendar for negotiations .
the europeans could thereby show our people that they are serious . " he also suggested 2014 or 2015 as a possible date for turkish accession , calling on the eu to decide whether it was a true " family of different cultures or a christian club . " turkish pm makes peace and case for membership but after discussions with the german chancellor , erdogan moderated his criticism , saying there had been a " boost " to the talks under the german presidency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands protested in turkey at the notion that erdogan run for the country 's presidency erdogan also reiterated his belief that turkey had enormous potential and that his country wanted to enter the eu not as a burden but to help carry the burden , noting that turkey had undergone considerable reforms . " every new country in the eu means new markets and new investment opportunities , " he said .
" the turkish economy has become more open and more liberal . " merkel seemed to understand erdogan 's frustrations , saying the european union could open two more chapters of membership talks with turkey by july but reiterated the eu 's stance with turkey over the cyprus dispute . merkel offers progress with cyprus caveat " under the german presidency of the eu , two more chapters could probably be opened if things go well , " said merkel .
" we are looking ahead but the outcome of this process remains open , " she said , adding that it is " important that turkey normalizes ties with cyprus . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel wants the cyprus dispute solved the european union relaunched membership talks with turkey at the end of march after a long hiatus caused by ankara 's refusal to respect its trade obligations to cyprus under a customs agreement with the eu . turkey has refused to open its ports and airports to greek cypriot traffic until the eu lives up to its pledge to end the isolation of the turkish cypriot state in the north of the mediterranean island , which is recognized only by ankara . merkel 's conservative christian democrats oppose turkish membership of the eu and would prefer instead that the secular islamic nation become a " privileged partner " of the 27-member bloc .
but she has agreed to support the eu 's ongoing accession negotiations with ankara as part of her government 's coalition agreement with the center-left social democrats . the social democrats are in favor of turkey joining the eu , a stance reiterated by statements made by foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier on sunday .

but it 's not german pope benedict xiv who is responsible for the tax boon - rather it 's the country 's pumping economy . the catholic church in germany had a bumper year in 2006 .
according to recent estimates , the 27 dioceses on average took in some eight percent more when compared to 2005 .
financial experts for the church expect that revenue for 2007 could amount to 4.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 6 billion -rrb- - 500 million euros more than two years ago . germany has a system of ecclesiastical financing unique to only a few european countries .
germany 's 28 million catholics - along with other members of state-recognized religions - are obligated to pay their churches a tax of between 8 percent and 9 percent , depending on where they live . the federal tax office automatically deducts this from people 's monthly pay packets every month , with the result that germany 's churches are among the richest in the world . catholics leaving in droves despite this comfortable tax arrangement , the last few years have n't been too kind to the catholic church . between 2000 and 2005 , more than 680,000 people officially registered to leave the church and free themselves from their tax obligations -lrb- and their right to receive the sacraments at the same time -rrb- .
in addition , germany 's sluggish economy with its high unemployment rates and lower wages meant there was even less money available to tax . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : apart from mass events like world youth day , more and more christians are becoming disenchanted with the church but now , things are looking up because the levy , the church 's biggest single source of income , is back up to levels not seen since 1998 . according to sebastian anneser , the financial director of the catholic archdiocese of munich and freising , a key reason for this " surprising " development is increasing business confidence and its positive effects on employment . in his march budget statement , though , anneser warned the increase " was n't expected to hold in the long-term " because a combination of low birthrates , aging population and waning interest were causing people to " turn their backs on the church . " however , the church has managed to stem the floodtide somewhat - the rate at which people are abandoning catholic pews has fallen sharply in the past few years . german in the vatican while there have been some suggestions that this is because a german now sits on the papal chair , the catholic church itself is hesitant to make this connection . " curiosity about the catholic church and religion has definitely increased because of -lrb- joseph -rrb- ratzinger becoming pope in 2005 as well as the death of pope john paul ii , " said adelheid utters-adam , a spokesperson for the munich archdiocese in ratzinger 's home state of bavaria . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benedict xvi is the first german pope in nearly 500 years " but there was a significant fall in the rate of people leaving in 2004 and that definitely does n't have anything to do with the current pope , " utters-adam said . in fact , according to some , having a german sitting in the papal chair could actually be a liability for germany 's catholic church . " every time -lrb- pope benedict -rrb- has visited bavaria , there has been a dramatic rise in the number of departures from the church , " said carsten frerk , a sociologist who researches religious institutions . the last papal visit cost 30 million euros . " that annoyed many people who thought the money could have otherwise been better spent on social projects instead of a media spectacle , " frerk said . back to the collection plate ? according to frerk , it 's not just the church which is becoming increasingly unpopular , it 's also the church tax system . " polls show that around 60 percent of people are against collecting the tax in this way - they would prefer to donate voluntarily , " frerk said .
interestingly though , only a third of those surveyed " knew exactly how much church tax they paid , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the governments of denmark , finland , austria and parts of switzerland also collect church tax " that 's the ingenious thing about the system - the tax is just deducted automatically , " he said . thirty five-year-old teacher marion corpus decided to cancel her church contributions four years ago .
she said it was n't until she got a new job that came with an easier to read pay slip that she realized for the first time how much cash she was giving the church . " it was about 80 euros a month , " corpus said .
" i thought i could do something better with the money because i did n't like what the church was doing .
instead , i 've now got a monthly membership to amnesty international plus i sponsor a child in malawi . " despite the system 's unpopularity , the right of recognized churches to tax its adherents is enshrined in the german constitution .
the government only collects the levy because churches contract it to do so .
but this arrangement is unlikely to change any time soon - after all , the state gets to keep three percent of the all money it amasses through the church tax . kate hairsine send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de as church loses appeal , protestants try rebranding religion 490 years after martin luther nailed his ninety-five theses to a door in wittenberg , the city is the staging post for a revival aimed at reversing the fortunes of the nation 's ailing protestant church .

now the goethe institute is stepping up efforts to restore interest in learning the german language . the kids clap their hands as thomas diekhaus is abruptly interrupted while reading " max and moritz , " a famous 19th century poem about the antics of two naughty boys .
their caps pulled down low on their heads , two real life boys dressed as max and moritz have snuck up onto the stage .
diekhaus directs the language department of the goethe institute in riga , latvia , and wants to encourage the children to learn german .
there 's lots of work to be done , he said , because the number of german learners has dropped by 10 percent to 11 percent every year since 2000 .
800 years of common history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : humorit wilhelm busch published his max und moritz poem in 1865 latvia 's german connection is hundreds of years old .
in 1201 , bishop albert from bremen founded the city of riga , now the capital , where the daugava river flows into the baltic sea .
as a member of the hanseatic league , many german traders came to riga and the city flourished .
it also became an important center of trade with russia .
when world war ii broke out in 1939 , most of the germans living in latvia moved to germany .
even while under soviet rule after the war , latvia maintained strong connections with communist east germany , and german continued to be taught as a foreign language .
when the iron curtain collapsed and the soviet union dissolved , latvian students found a renewed interest in the german language - particularly when russian stopped being offered in schools in 1991 .
post-communist business boom today , some 16 years after the fall of communism in eastern europe , germany has become latvia ’ s biggest trading partner .
the newly opened baltic region became an attractive investment location for numerous western companies .
just outside of riga , the german company knauf produces plasterboard that is sold throughout the baltic region .
all of the management personnel have to speak german , said knauf manager peter rumer , since the riga branch has daily contact with co-workers in germany .
" in latvia it ’ s not at all hard to find german-speakers - and good ones at that , " added rumer .
shakespeare vs. goethe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the goethe institute is germany 's world-wide cultural ambassador according to the latvian ministry of education , however , the trend is heading in the opposite direction .
since english was introduced 12 years ago on the recommendation of the school authorities , the number of high school students taking the advanced german exam has dropped by 50 percent .
unlike the goethe institute , the ministry of education does n't see a need for action .
" the ministry of education values multilingualism , however the generally tendency in latvia toward english as a first foreign language can ’ t be avoided , " said gundega muceniece from the ministry .
meanwhile at the goethe institute , max is smoking on stage .
after the first cigarette he gets dizzy and ca n't get a single german word out of his mouth .
even without words , the children understand that max and moritz want to annoy widow bolte 's proud rooster - not an unusual pastime for the two pranksters .
catching up " what people missed at school they have to catch up on at the goethe institute , " said the institute 's director rudolf de baey .
" that 's good for business , but not for german-latvian relations . "
max has just promised his friend moritz that he wants to start learning a few german vocabulary words .
after all , both of them want to travel as soon as possible to all of the german-speaking countries in europe . aya bach -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de danes worry english onslaught could undermine the language danish linguists have warned the government that the increasing use of english in the country , especially in education , could wear away at the very foundation of danish .

european newpapers have reacted to the beating and arrest of hundreds of russian protesters , including opposition politician garry kasparov . french newspaper le figaro expressed surprise at the events in russia in the light of putin 's domestic support . " the friends of kasparov will not gain any popularity because their demonstrations are suppressed .
the tough actions of the police will not trigger a wave of protest against those in power .
nevertheless , the kremlin is showing an astonishing weakness by reacting so rigorously to the smallest sign of protest , " muses the paper .
austrian newspaper die presse also wondered why the kremlin had acted so brutally : " you really ask yourself whether the people in power in moscow are completely crazy .
apparently , president putin continues to have the backing of 70 percent and more of the population .
what are he and his technocrats afraid of ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : riot police officers detain russian opposition leader garry kasparov it added later : " if this small heap of civil and human rights campaigners , liberals , national bolchevists and anarchists really frightens the putinists so much that they deploy a whole army of police against them , then their power base is n't looking rosy -lrb- … -rrb- in that case , this demonstration of power from the kremlin has actually revealed its weakness . " bulgarian newspaper dnewnik described the beatings and arrests as par for the course .
" really no one should be surprised .
it is enough to remember that the russian president is a former kgb agent and that 90 percent of the leadership in today 's russia are a product of the former secret services . " swiss newspaper basler zeitung argued putin was attempting to deter what had happened in parts of the former soviet union .
" from the point of view of the governing regime of president vladimir putin this makes perfect sense . -lrb- … -rrb- the kremlin has learnt its lesson from the peaceful revolutions in georgia and the ukraine where after blatant vote rigging , protest rallies quickly gained momentum and led to the toppling of the respective governments .
he wants to keep the protests as small as possible and incite fear among normal citizens . " but the paper also questioned whether this approach would really work .
" it may work in the short-term , " it wrote .
" but in the long-term this was rarely a healthy political strategy . " danish newspaper berlingske tidende was damning about russia 's political system .
" you have to be completely blind or excessively tolerant not to see that there is something wrong with russia .
just a year before the elections that mark the end of president putin 's time in office , he has this country so firmly in his grip that democracy is just a shell . " the paper calls upon the international community to do more .
" the eu and the us could happily exercise more pressure than is the case at the moment .
putin can carry out his actions largely unhindered " . finally , german newspaper die welt also urged the west not to beat about the bush .
the paper says any misguided sense of respect or fear of having russia energy supplies cut should not stop the international community from taking action .

we would like a clear idea of a date , a roadmap and a calendar for negotiations .
the europeans could thereby show our people that they are serious . " he also suggested 2014 or 2015 as a possible date for turkish accession , calling on the eu to decide whether it was a true " family of different cultures or a christian club . " turkish pm makes peace and case for membership but after discussions with the german chancellor , erdogan moderated his criticism , saying there had been a " boost " to the talks under the german presidency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands protested in turkey at the notion that erdogan run for the country 's presidency erdogan also reiterated his belief that turkey had enormous potential and that his country wanted to enter the eu not as a burden but to help carry the burden , noting that turkey had undergone considerable reforms .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 16.04.2007 european press review : the kremlin shows its true colors großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the crackdown on anti-kremlin protestors sparked international condemnation a sign of " weakness " or blatant disregard for international opinion ?
european newpapers have reacted to the beating and arrest of hundreds of russian protesters , including opposition politician garry kasparov . french newspaper le figaro expressed surprise at the events in russia in the light of putin 's domestic support . " the friends of kasparov will not gain any popularity because their demonstrations are suppressed .
the tough actions of the police will not trigger a wave of protest against those in power .
nevertheless , the kremlin is showing an astonishing weakness by reacting so rigorously to the smallest sign of protest , " muses the paper .
austrian newspaper die presse also wondered why the kremlin had acted so brutally : " you really ask yourself whether the people in power in moscow are completely crazy .
apparently , president putin continues to have the backing of 70 percent and more of the population .
what are he and his technocrats afraid of ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : riot police officers detain russian opposition leader garry kasparov it added later : " if this small heap of civil and human rights campaigners , liberals , national bolchevists and anarchists really frightens the putinists so much that they deploy a whole army of police against them , then their power base is n't looking rosy -lrb- … -rrb- in that case , this demonstration of power from the kremlin has actually revealed its weakness . " bulgarian newspaper dnewnik described the beatings and arrests as par for the course .
" really no one should be surprised .
it is enough to remember that the russian president is a former kgb agent and that 90 percent of the leadership in today 's russia are a product of the former secret services . " swiss newspaper basler zeitung argued putin was attempting to deter what had happened in parts of the former soviet union .
" from the point of view of the governing regime of president vladimir putin this makes perfect sense . -lrb- … -rrb- the kremlin has learnt its lesson from the peaceful revolutions in georgia and the ukraine where after blatant vote rigging , protest rallies quickly gained momentum and led to the toppling of the respective governments .
he wants to keep the protests as small as possible and incite fear among normal citizens . " but the paper also questioned whether this approach would really work .
" it may work in the short-term , " it wrote .
" but in the long-term this was rarely a healthy political strategy . " danish newspaper berlingske tidende was damning about russia 's political system .
" you have to be completely blind or excessively tolerant not to see that there is something wrong with russia .
just a year before the elections that mark the end of president putin 's time in office , he has this country so firmly in his grip that democracy is just a shell . " the paper calls upon the international community to do more .
" the eu and the us could happily exercise more pressure than is the case at the moment .
putin can carry out his actions largely unhindered " . finally , german newspaper die welt also urged the west not to beat about the bush .
the paper says any misguided sense of respect or fear of having russia energy supplies cut should not stop the international community from taking action .
" the west owes it to the dissidents in putin 's empire to speak openly . " dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's foreign minister urges russia to solve murders german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier has called for russian authorities to solve the recent killings of russian journalist anna politkovskaya and former kgb agent alexander litvinenko as quickly as possible .
-lrb- 21.12.2006 -rrb- merkel calls for improved eu-russia energy ties german chancellor merkel and russian president putin wrapped up a meeting sunday , agreeing to work to improve eu-russia energy ties to avoid tensions following supply disruptions .

" when they said this service was available , it eased those fears . " once the queuing was over and the kids rushed to be as close as possible to their idols , the parents relaxed further .
taking advantage of showers set up in the nearby train station and continuing their own fun at the various arcade machines set up around the venue , the adults were well occupied until they could pick up their kids safely again at the concert 's end at nine o 'clock that evening . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic feedback would you take advantage of parental care at a child 's concert ?

it said the economy continues to expand at a robust rate , although growth has slowed a little in the past month .
the survey predicts a further increase in employment , particularly in the building trade , as firms win new business .
ulster bank chief economist pat mcardle said there were backlogs of work .
" global rates of increase in private sector activity eased in march and northern ireland was no exception , " he said .
" however , ni continues to expand at a robust rate and in line with the uk .
growth in employment remained strong with only three other regions ahead of it in march .
" although below recent exceptional growth rates , the march employment pmi reading was still well ahead of its long-term average .
" interestingly , backlogs of work are still growing , whereas they are contracting in the uk , an indication that employment growth is likely to remain strong , at least in construction where the bulk of the backlogs exist . "
he said construction is more than ever the driving force with retail and manufacturing easing and services relatively strong .
" input cost inflation remains a problem but the gap between costs and prices charged has levelled off in recent months , easing the squeeze on profit margins , " he added .
the report forms part of a series of regional surveys published by the royal bank of scotland group and ntc economics , and is derived from the purchasing managers ' index surveys produced by ntc for the chartered institute of purchasing and supply .

they hope to solve the mystery of where the hefty creatures migrate over the summer months .
our science reporter joined the research team on its expedition .
monday 16 april : goodbye greenland the time has now come to say farewell to greenland .
getting a taste of life here , both on sea and on land , has been a privilege , as has been getting to know mikkel , the trawler 's crew : knud , ole and gustav , as well as the other friends i have made along the way .
and , of course , there were the walruses .
my close encounter with the tusked giants was possibly one of the coldest , scariest but most exhilarating experiences i have ever had .
as i return home to warm up a bit , the baton is now handed over to the " wallies " who begin their migration to who knows where .
i 'm very much looking forward to seeing what these magnificent animals get up to over the next few months .
saturday 14 april : back on dry land a couple of days ago , the team and i returned to sisimiut 's harbour jubilant with the walrus tagging success .
it felt as if we had been at sea forever and setting foot back on to dry land was a strange experience - i suffered a sort of reverse sea sickness as my body was , by now , very much used to reacting to the pitches and swells of the sea rather than the static ground .
the few days ' delay before i can get on to a flight back to the uk has given me the opportunity to see the crew in another setting .
at sea , they worked incredibly hard all of the time , often from 6am through to midnight without a break .
so seeing skipper knud lennart relaxing in his beautiful home , when mikkel and i were invited around for some very delicious roast musk ox , felt very much out of the ordinary .
and visiting deck-hand ole lennart , his wife marie and grandson kim in his home gave me a chance to talk more to him about his experiences in the town .
life had changed a lot and very fast since he grew up here in the 1950s , he said , the population had exploded from just a few hundred people to 6,000 .
but tradition in greenland remained strong , his grandson kim translated for me .
i was shown intricate greenlandic costumes , stitched out of seal skin and fur by ole 's wife .
and on proud display throughout the house were symbols of inuit culture - beautifully crafted model kayaks and harpoons , ancient walrus tusks that had been found on the shore , a mounted seal 's head , and a tupilaq - a carving once used by witch-doctors .
the visit made me think about what life must have been like here years ago .
as someone used to living with every conceivable modern convenience , i find it hard to imagine how people could not only have survived , but thrived , in this harsh climate .
greenlandic people are very proud of their culture , explained ole , and it is important that it is kept alive .
wednesday 11 april : walrus jackpot after five days of waiting and waiting , we finally hit the walrus jackpot .
on tuesday morning , we awoke to find that a strong wind had broken up some of the sea ice , allowing the skipper to navigate the boat to a bank where walruses often go to feed .
soon after we got there , a closer look at a brown blob far off on the horizon revealed it to be a walrus .
layers of clothing were thrown on , and researcher mikkel , crew-member ole and i jumped into a skiff that the trawler had been carrying throughout its journey .
the smaller vessel meant we were able to sneak up on the animal as it lay snoozing on a hunk of ice , but it heard us as we cracked through the frozen water and promptly slid into the sea .
a chase ensued - the walrus would pop its head up a few tens of metres away to breathe in some air , someone would spot it , yell , and the boat would race towards it , arriving just as it dived back under again .
this happened a few times until we finally got lucky and arrived just as the walrus came up .
a quick " thwunk " from the crossbow and the satellite tag was attached to the animal 's shoulder .
even though i had been assured that the tags would n't hurt the walruses because of their tough skin and thick layer of blubber , i was still relieved to see that the animal barely seemed to notice the tag as it landed on its hide .
as we were celebrating , another cry of walrus went up , and soon the animals were being tagged left , right and centre ; some with the crossbow , some with the co2-powered gun and others with a harpoon that knud , our skipper , had crafted .
after days of nothing , seven walruses had been tagged in just a few hours .
and today turned out to be just as action packed .
unfortunately two of the tags were lost - they skimmed on the water just before they hit the walruses , sinking to the bottom of the sea , but another one , launched by ole with the harpoon , hit a walrus squarely between the shoulders - the perfect place for a sat-tag .
a success rate of eight out of 10 tags was " pretty good going " , mikkel concluded .
and what of the walruses ?
well , i knew they were going to be huge , but i did n't realise quite how big they were going to be , especially when you are only a couple of metres away from them in a puny boat .
i suddenly realised that if there was to be a tussle between walrus and skiff , walrus would very definitely win .
but i also found them rather lovely - their faces with tusks and whiskers were just so full of character , and they were sociable too , often swimming around in groups of two , looking much more graceful in the sea than when on the ice .
i was a bit unsure about what i 'd make of them before i came out here but , i have to admit , i 'm a walrus convert .
monday 9 april : food is fuel while i 've been on board , waiting for a walrus to appear , i 've been getting to know the crew better and learn a little about greenlandic life .
gustav , one of the deck-hands , spoke to me about how important hunting was to the inuit population .
he told me how his grandfather lived off the land , hunting seal , reindeer , whales and walruses for food and also to make clothing and tools .
he said that hunting was still important for the local population .
many goods are imported from europe , he explained , making them extremely expensive .
for some locals , hunting was still necessary to get the food and clothing they needed to survive the harsh conditions , he told me .
i 've also had the chance to experience some traditional greenlandic dishes here on the boat .
in the colder-than-a-freezer temperatures , food really is fuel .
the body burns up a lot of calories just trying to keep warm ; so rich , meaty stews are a regular feature on the menu on the boat .
last night , i tried reindeer - putting any thoughts of rudolph and his red nose to the back of my mind .
mikkel told me that it was a nutritious , tasty meat - and it 's cheap too , since it does n't have to be imported .
it was soft - tasting somewhat like beef , but better .
and then i found out the other steaming pot next to it was seal meat .
earlier that day , a boat had pulled up next to ours with a bloody bag sat upon the deck - i did n't really think much of it at the time , but now i suddenly understood that the bag had contained my dinner .
innards , blood , blubber and meat had been boiled up into a very rich stew - the crew looked at me with anticipation as they spooned some of it into my bowl .
the meat was almost black in colour , a little chewy and both fishy and meaty in taste .
but the thing i really noticed was how warm it was making me feel - my face turned red and my toes were glowing - and even though i 'm having problems getting the images of cute pinnipeds out of my mind , i can understand why this sort of food is important in a territory like this .
sunday 8 april : waiting for wally it 's all about the ice , here at sea .
you need enough of the frozen stuff so that the walruses can laze about on it after dining on a feast of clams and other molluscs , but not so much - as has been the case so far - that it is impossible to get to the arctic animals .
" ice , ice ... too much ice , " has been something our skipper has been saying rather regularly over the last few days .
we have been trying to reach the shallow banks where the " wallys " , as mikkel calls them , go to feed .
but so far , we have only been able to skirt around their edges , every so often finding a break between the thick layers of frozen water to steer through , all the time with huge icebergs drifting around .
still , a couple of " walrus " cries have been sounded by the beady-eyed crew , who spend the hours scanning the white horizon for the tusked creatures as the trawler crunches through the icy water .
i 've got the routine down pat now .
the slightest sniff of a walrus means you have to rush into the galley , throw on your michelin-man-like flotation suit over the four layers you are already wearing , then the extra socks and snow boots go on , followed by balaclava , neck gaiter , hat , gloves and mittens .
then we rush outside .
mikkel grabs his crossbow and satellite tag on the way , and climbs up the ice-covered ladder on to the deck .
and then we wait , and wait , and wait in the hope that the walrus might reappear , all the time standing in the -25c temperatures while a strong wind slaps the freezing air on to your face .
i had n't really thought a 1.5-tonne beast could be described as wily , but so far , that 's exactly what these walruses have been !
some days have been so icy we have n't even been able to move from the cove where we have been spending the night .
but the spare time has given mikkel the chance to rehearse his walrus tagging skills .
i was amazed to see the crew fearlessly clamber on to the sea ice to set down an orange for him to fire a dummy sat tag at from his co2-powered gun -lrb- which he had brought along in addition to the crossbow -rrb- .
after a few shots , he told me he was ready to swap fruit for walruses - should we ever get close enough ...
thursday 5 april : turning green before i left the uk , just about everyone i told about the walrus trip asked me what my sea legs were like .
i had to give the honest answer that i did n't have a clue as i 'd never been sailing before .
armed with plenty of sea sickness pills - just in case - i boarded the nanna l trawler -lrb- named after knud 's daughter -rrb- .
and as we left sisimiut , heading west , i soon discovered that my sea legs were a little shaky .
a plastic bag quickly became my accessory of choice as i sat staring at the horizon turning an icky shade of green .
but i 'm pleased to say that the bag never got used - and a few hours into the trip as we approached the calmer , ice-covered waters , i began to feel just about normal .
with me on board are mikkel , chief walrus tagger ; knud the skipper ; and his two deckhands , ole and gustav .
the boat and crew are usually at sea fishing the arctic waters for prawns , but gustav told me it made a nice change to look for walruses .
the day was spent scanning the water for signs of the tusked beasts , both from the bridge , and also from the deck of the boat .
gustav and ole would regularly clamber on to the slippery deck to survey the ice for a clearer view of any creatures , braving the -25c temperatures outside .
i joined them for a while .
with the wind helping along the freezing conditions , it is safe to say that it really was ridiculously cold out there - and i soon had to go back in to defrost .
the day was not to provide us with a walrus sighting - a glimpse of a bearded seal off in the distance was the closest we got .
wednesday 4 april : down with the dogs mikkel and i met the boat 's skipper knud lennert this afternoon .
he knows these icy waters very well , having spent the last 20 years navigating them .
he thinks we may be able to leave the port tomorrow morning , but warned that it is going to get cold out at sea - and for a local to have said this means it is going to be really , really freezing .
knud 's 18-year-old daughter nanna joined us to translate some of the information for me .
the greenlandic ski champion recently spent a year in new zealand perfecting her english .
she asked me if i wanted to join her and her younger brother on a dog sleigh ride - and who could refuse such an offer ?
no place like home nine beautiful huskies pulled us over the hilly terrain , crossing frozen lakes covered with snow that had fallen the night before .
the sleigh was covered with a reindeer hide , making a snug , warm seat to sit on as we were whisked around at some pretty scary speeds .
during the journey , nanna told me about sisimiut .
about 5,000 people lived there , she explained , making it the second largest town in greenland .
it was the kind of place where everybody knew everybody , she said .
nanna said that although she had a great desire for travel and adventure - like many greenlandic people - she loved her home very much .
i 'm sad to be leaving sisimiut after such a short stay - it truly is beautiful here , but my boat and the walruses await .
wednesday 4 april : walrus for sale this morning , i got the chance to don my thermals and go out and explore the town .
bbc news - walrus watch up to 10 walruses to be tagged location data fed to denmark bbc news to map positions with me was mikkel villum jensen who is leading the walrus expedition .
after weeks of talking to him on the phone in preparation for the trip , it was good to finally meet in person .
it soon became apparent that walruses are prominent in sisimiut .
they feature on the town 's flag , some of the pretty buildings are painted with pictures of them - and walrus meat is also for sale .
we walked -lrb- or rather , mikkel walked , i slipped and fell -rrb- up the steep hill to the shop where local fishermen and hunters sell their wares .
behind the counter lay slabs of deep-red , fatty meat on sale for 40 danish kroner -lrb- about £ 3.50 -rrb- a kilo .
erik , the shop-owner , told me that the meat was popular in sisimiut and it was " very tasty " .
about seven walruses had been killed for meat this winter , he explained .
he said that greenlandic people had eaten walrus meat for many years , along with reindeer , seal and musk ox , and it was a strong part of their tradition .
walrus meat and skin were also fed to the huskies , he added , as a protein rich meal for the working dogs .
tuesday 3 april : a shaky start getting to sisimiut - the port in west greenland where the walrus tracking trawler is to set sail - was supposed to be the easy part of my trip .
fly to copenhagen from london , jump on the flight to kangerlussuaq , a former us army base in central greenland , then a 10-minute wait before the short connecting flight to my final destination .
or so i thought .
the 10 minutes quickly turned into hours , before , eventually , the dreaded " your flight to sisimiut has been cancelled " call came over the tannoy , followed swiftly by an even more fearsome " and there will be no more flights there today " .
i soon learnt , after finding some kind companions - morten and vivian - to share my waiting time with , that delays are common in this part of the world .
planes are at the whim of the weather , which can turn at any second .
there was nothing i could do , they said , but sit and wait it out .
picturesque but today , after a night spent in some old army barracks , the weather settled and i could continue my journey .
the flight to sisimiut was breathtaking .
the window of the tiny plane revealed a mountainous snow-covered landscape studded with bright blue fjords .
and the town itself was also stunning .
small houses , painted in primary colours , nestle in the snowy hillside , overlooking a harbour below packed with fishing boats bobbing amongst the ice .
i have a few days to wait until the weather is deemed good enough to set sail - and in the meantime , i ca n't wait to brave the -10c temperatures to go and explore .
it is not clear whether the laptev walrus is a separate subspecies the tagging study is being run by the greenland institute of natural resources , in cooperation with the danish national environmental research institute and the technical university of denmark .

they hope to solve the mystery of where the hefty creatures migrate over the summer months .
our science reporter joined the research team on its expedition .
monday 16 april : goodbye greenland the time has now come to say farewell to greenland .
a job well done getting a taste of life here , both on sea and on land , has been a privilege , as has been getting to know mikkel , the trawler 's crew : knud , ole and gustav , as well as the other friends i have made along the way .
and , of course , there were the walruses .
my close encounter with the tusked giants was possibly one of the coldest , scariest but most exhilarating experiences i have ever had .
as i return home to warm up a bit , the baton is now handed over to the " wallies " who begin their migration to who knows where .
i 'm very much looking forward to seeing what these magnificent animals get up to over the next few months .
saturday 14 april : back on dry land a couple of days ago , the team and i returned to sisimiut 's harbour jubilant with the walrus tagging success .
a tupilaq was once used by witch doctors it felt as if we had been at sea forever and setting foot back on to dry land was a strange experience - i suffered a sort of reverse sea sickness as my body was , by now , very much used to reacting to the pitches and swells of the sea rather than the static ground .
the few days ' delay before i can get on to a flight back to the uk has given me the opportunity to see the crew in another setting .
at sea , they worked incredibly hard all of the time , often from 6am through to midnight without a break .
so seeing skipper knud lennart relaxing in his beautiful home , when mikkel and i were invited around for some very delicious roast musk ox , felt very much out of the ordinary .
and visiting deck-hand ole lennart , his wife marie and grandson kim in his home gave me a chance to talk more to him about his experiences in the town .
life had changed a lot and very fast since he grew up here in the 1950s , he said , the population had exploded from just a few hundred people to 6,000 .
ole and his family told me more about greenlandic culture but tradition in greenland remained strong , his grandson kim translated for me .
i was shown intricate greenlandic costumes , stitched out of seal skin and fur by ole 's wife .
and on proud display throughout the house were symbols of inuit culture - beautifully crafted model kayaks and harpoons , ancient walrus tusks that had been found on the shore , a mounted seal 's head , and a tupilaq - a carving once used by witch-doctors .
the visit made me think about what life must have been like here years ago .
as someone used to living with every conceivable modern convenience , i find it hard to imagine how people could not only have survived , but thrived , in this harsh climate .
greenlandic people are very proud of their culture , explained ole , and it is important that it is kept alive .
wednesday 11 april : walrus jackpot after five days of waiting and waiting , we finally hit the walrus jackpot .
on tuesday morning , we awoke to find that a strong wind had broken up some of the sea ice , allowing the skipper to navigate the boat to a bank where walruses often go to feed .
tagging walruses in greenland in pictures soon after we got there , a closer look at a brown blob far off on the horizon revealed it to be a walrus .
layers of clothing were thrown on , and researcher mikkel , crew-member ole and i jumped into a skiff that the trawler had been carrying throughout its journey .
the smaller vessel meant we were able to sneak up on the animal as it lay snoozing on a hunk of ice , but it heard us as we cracked through the frozen water and promptly slid into the sea .
a chase ensued - the walrus would pop its head up a few tens of metres away to breathe in some air , someone would spot it , yell , and the boat would race towards it , arriving just as it dived back under again .
keeping watch for walruses paid dividends after five days this happened a few times until we finally got lucky and arrived just as the walrus came up .
a quick " thwunk " from the crossbow and the satellite tag was attached to the animal 's shoulder .
even though i had been assured that the tags would n't hurt the walruses because of their tough skin and thick layer of blubber , i was still relieved to see that the animal barely seemed to notice the tag as it landed on its hide .
as we were celebrating , another cry of walrus went up , and soon the animals were being tagged left , right and centre ; some with the crossbow , some with the co2-powered gun and others with a harpoon that knud , our skipper , had crafted .
after days of nothing , seven walruses had been tagged in just a few hours .
and today turned out to be just as action packed .
unfortunately two of the tags were lost - they skimmed on the water just before they hit the walruses , sinking to the bottom of the sea , but another one , launched by ole with the harpoon , hit a walrus squarely between the shoulders - the perfect place for a sat-tag .
a success rate of eight out of 10 tags was " pretty good going " , mikkel concluded .
the satellite tags were about the same size as a lighter and what of the walruses ?
well , i knew they were going to be huge , but i did n't realise quite how big they were going to be , especially when you are only a couple of metres away from them in a puny boat .
i suddenly realised that if there was to be a tussle between walrus and skiff , walrus would very definitely win .
but i also found them rather lovely - their faces with tusks and whiskers were just so full of character , and they were sociable too , often swimming around in groups of two , looking much more graceful in the sea than when on the ice .
i was a bit unsure about what i 'd make of them before i came out here but , i have to admit , i 'm a walrus convert .
monday 9 april : food is fuel while i 've been on board , waiting for a walrus to appear , i 've been getting to know the crew better and learn a little about greenlandic life .
gustav , one of the deck-hands , spoke to me about how important hunting was to the inuit population .
gustav says hunting is vital for the inuit people he told me how his grandfather lived off the land , hunting seal , reindeer , whales and walruses for food and also to make clothing and tools .
he said that hunting was still important for the local population .
many goods are imported from europe , he explained , making them extremely expensive .
for some locals , hunting was still necessary to get the food and clothing they needed to survive the harsh conditions , he told me .
i 've also had the chance to experience some traditional greenlandic dishes here on the boat .
in the colder-than-a-freezer temperatures , food really is fuel .
the body burns up a lot of calories just trying to keep warm ; so rich , meaty stews are a regular feature on the menu on the boat .
last night , i tried reindeer - putting any thoughts of rudolph and his red nose to the back of my mind .
mikkel told me that it was a nutritious , tasty meat - and it 's cheap too , since it does n't have to be imported .
it was soft - tasting somewhat like beef , but better .
seal meat is tasty , nutritious and cheap , says mikkel and then i found out the other steaming pot next to it was seal meat .
earlier that day , a boat had pulled up next to ours with a bloody bag sat upon the deck - i did n't really think much of it at the time , but now i suddenly understood that the bag had contained my dinner .
innards , blood , blubber and meat had been boiled up into a very rich stew - the crew looked at me with anticipation as they spooned some of it into my bowl .
the meat was almost black in colour , a little chewy and both fishy and meaty in taste .
but the thing i really noticed was how warm it was making me feel - my face turned red and my toes were glowing - and even though i 'm having problems getting the images of cute pinnipeds out of my mind , i can understand why this sort of food is important in a territory like this .
sunday 8 april : waiting for wally it 's all about the ice , here at sea .
you need enough of the frozen stuff so that the walruses can laze about on it after dining on a feast of clams and other molluscs , but not so much - as has been the case so far - that it is impossible to get to the arctic animals .
a crew member used an orange to practise his tagging technique " ice , ice ... too much ice , " has been something our skipper has been saying rather regularly over the last few days .

i 've got the routine down pat now .
the slightest sniff of a walrus means you have to rush into the galley , throw on your michelin-man-like flotation suit over the four layers you are already wearing , then the extra socks and snow boots go on , followed by balaclava , neck gaiter , hat , gloves and mittens .
the boat has been hemmed in by the ice then we rush outside .
mikkel grabs his crossbow and satellite tag on the way , and climbs up the ice-covered ladder on to the deck .
and then we wait , and wait , and wait in the hope that the walrus might reappear , all the time standing in the -25c temperatures while a strong wind slaps the freezing air on to your face .

life had changed a lot and very fast since he grew up here in the 1950s , he said , the population had exploded from just a few hundred people to 6,000 .
ole and his family told me more about greenlandic culture but tradition in greenland remained strong , his grandson kim translated for me .
i was shown intricate greenlandic costumes , stitched out of seal skin and fur by ole 's wife .
and on proud display throughout the house were symbols of inuit culture - beautifully crafted model kayaks and harpoons , ancient walrus tusks that had been found on the shore , a mounted seal 's head , and a tupilaq - a carving once used by witch-doctors .
the visit made me think about what life must have been like here years ago .
as someone used to living with every conceivable modern convenience , i find it hard to imagine how people could not only have survived , but thrived , in this harsh climate .
greenlandic people are very proud of their culture , explained ole , and it is important that it is kept alive .
wednesday 11 april : walrus jackpot after five days of waiting and waiting , we finally hit the walrus jackpot .
on tuesday morning , we awoke to find that a strong wind had broken up some of the sea ice , allowing the skipper to navigate the boat to a bank where walruses often go to feed .
tagging walruses in greenland in pictures soon after we got there , a closer look at a brown blob far off on the horizon revealed it to be a walrus .
layers of clothing were thrown on , and researcher mikkel , crew-member ole and i jumped into a skiff that the trawler had been carrying throughout its journey .
the smaller vessel meant we were able to sneak up on the animal as it lay snoozing on a hunk of ice , but it heard us as we cracked through the frozen water and promptly slid into the sea .
a chase ensued - the walrus would pop its head up a few tens of metres away to breathe in some air , someone would spot it , yell , and the boat would race towards it , arriving just as it dived back under again .
keeping watch for walruses paid dividends after five days this happened a few times until we finally got lucky and arrived just as the walrus came up .
a quick " thwunk " from the crossbow and the satellite tag was attached to the animal 's shoulder .
even though i had been assured that the tags would n't hurt the walruses because of their tough skin and thick layer of blubber , i was still relieved to see that the animal barely seemed to notice the tag as it landed on its hide .
as we were celebrating , another cry of walrus went up , and soon the animals were being tagged left , right and centre ; some with the crossbow , some with the co2-powered gun and others with a harpoon that knud , our skipper , had crafted .
after days of nothing , seven walruses had been tagged in just a few hours .
and today turned out to be just as action packed .
unfortunately two of the tags were lost - they skimmed on the water just before they hit the walruses , sinking to the bottom of the sea , but another one , launched by ole with the harpoon , hit a walrus squarely between the shoulders - the perfect place for a sat-tag .
a success rate of eight out of 10 tags was " pretty good going " , mikkel concluded .
the satellite tags were about the same size as a lighter and what of the walruses ?
well , i knew they were going to be huge , but i did n't realise quite how big they were going to be , especially when you are only a couple of metres away from them in a puny boat .
i suddenly realised that if there was to be a tussle between walrus and skiff , walrus would very definitely win .
but i also found them rather lovely - their faces with tusks and whiskers were just so full of character , and they were sociable too , often swimming around in groups of two , looking much more graceful in the sea than when on the ice .
i was a bit unsure about what i 'd make of them before i came out here but , i have to admit , i 'm a walrus convert .
monday 9 april : food is fuel while i 've been on board , waiting for a walrus to appear , i 've been getting to know the crew better and learn a little about greenlandic life .
gustav , one of the deck-hands , spoke to me about how important hunting was to the inuit population .
gustav says hunting is vital for the inuit people he told me how his grandfather lived off the land , hunting seal , reindeer , whales and walruses for food and also to make clothing and tools .
he said that hunting was still important for the local population .
many goods are imported from europe , he explained , making them extremely expensive .
for some locals , hunting was still necessary to get the food and clothing they needed to survive the harsh conditions , he told me .
i 've also had the chance to experience some traditional greenlandic dishes here on the boat .
in the colder-than-a-freezer temperatures , food really is fuel .
the body burns up a lot of calories just trying to keep warm ; so rich , meaty stews are a regular feature on the menu on the boat .
last night , i tried reindeer - putting any thoughts of rudolph and his red nose to the back of my mind .
mikkel told me that it was a nutritious , tasty meat - and it 's cheap too , since it does n't have to be imported .
it was soft - tasting somewhat like beef , but better .
seal meat is tasty , nutritious and cheap , says mikkel and then i found out the other steaming pot next to it was seal meat .
earlier that day , a boat had pulled up next to ours with a bloody bag sat upon the deck - i did n't really think much of it at the time , but now i suddenly understood that the bag had contained my dinner .
innards , blood , blubber and meat had been boiled up into a very rich stew - the crew looked at me with anticipation as they spooned some of it into my bowl .
the meat was almost black in colour , a little chewy and both fishy and meaty in taste .
but the thing i really noticed was how warm it was making me feel - my face turned red and my toes were glowing - and even though i 'm having problems getting the images of cute pinnipeds out of my mind , i can understand why this sort of food is important in a territory like this .
sunday 8 april : waiting for wally it 's all about the ice , here at sea .
you need enough of the frozen stuff so that the walruses can laze about on it after dining on a feast of clams and other molluscs , but not so much - as has been the case so far - that it is impossible to get to the arctic animals .
a crew member used an orange to practise his tagging technique " ice , ice ... too much ice , " has been something our skipper has been saying rather regularly over the last few days .
we have been trying to reach the shallow banks where the " wallys " , as mikkel calls them , go to feed .
but so far , we have only been able to skirt around their edges , every so often finding a break between the thick layers of frozen water to steer through , all the time with huge icebergs drifting around .
still , a couple of " walrus " cries have been sounded by the beady-eyed crew , who spend the hours scanning the white horizon for the tusked creatures as the trawler crunches through the icy water .
i 've got the routine down pat now .
the slightest sniff of a walrus means you have to rush into the galley , throw on your michelin-man-like flotation suit over the four layers you are already wearing , then the extra socks and snow boots go on , followed by balaclava , neck gaiter , hat , gloves and mittens .
the boat has been hemmed in by the ice then we rush outside .
mikkel grabs his crossbow and satellite tag on the way , and climbs up the ice-covered ladder on to the deck .
and then we wait , and wait , and wait in the hope that the walrus might reappear , all the time standing in the -25c temperatures while a strong wind slaps the freezing air on to your face .
i had n't really thought a 1.5-tonne beast could be described as wily , but so far , that 's exactly what these walruses have been !
some days have been so icy we have n't even been able to move from the cove where we have been spending the night .
but the spare time has given mikkel the chance to rehearse his walrus tagging skills .
i was amazed to see the crew fearlessly clamber on to the sea ice to set down an orange for him to fire a dummy sat tag at from his co2-powered gun -lrb- which he had brought along in addition to the crossbow -rrb- .
after a few shots , he told me he was ready to swap fruit for walruses - should we ever get close enough ...
thursday 5 april : turning green before i left the uk , just about everyone i told about the walrus trip asked me what my sea legs were like .
view from the boat , heading west from sisimiut i had to give the honest answer that i did n't have a clue as i 'd never been sailing before .
armed with plenty of sea sickness pills - just in case - i boarded the nanna l trawler -lrb- named after knud 's daughter -rrb- .
and as we left sisimiut , heading west , i soon discovered that my sea legs were a little shaky .
a plastic bag quickly became my accessory of choice as i sat staring at the horizon turning an icky shade of green .
but i 'm pleased to say that the bag never got used - and a few hours into the trip as we approached the calmer , ice-covered waters , i began to feel just about normal .
with me on board are mikkel , chief walrus tagger ; knud the skipper ; and his two deckhands , ole and gustav .
the boat and crew are usually at sea fishing the arctic waters for prawns , but gustav told me it made a nice change to look for walruses .
the day was spent scanning the water for signs of the tusked beasts , both from the bridge , and also from the deck of the boat .
temperatures were -25c on deck gustav and ole would regularly clamber on to the slippery deck to survey the ice for a clearer view of any creatures , braving the -25c temperatures outside .
i joined them for a while .
with the wind helping along the freezing conditions , it is safe to say that it really was ridiculously cold out there - and i soon had to go back in to defrost .
the day was not to provide us with a walrus sighting - a glimpse of a bearded seal off in the distance was the closest we got .
wednesday 4 april : down with the dogs mikkel and i met the boat 's skipper knud lennert this afternoon .
he knows these icy waters very well , having spent the last 20 years navigating them .
nanna says sisimiut is a place where everybody knows everybody he thinks we may be able to leave the port tomorrow morning , but warned that it is going to get cold out at sea - and for a local to have said this means it is going to be really , really freezing .
knud 's 18-year-old daughter nanna joined us to translate some of the information for me .
the greenlandic ski champion recently spent a year in new zealand perfecting her english .
she asked me if i wanted to join her and her younger brother on a dog sleigh ride - and who could refuse such an offer ?
no place like home nine beautiful huskies pulled us over the hilly terrain , crossing frozen lakes covered with snow that had fallen the night before .
huskies whisk the sleighs along at fast speeds the sleigh was covered with a reindeer hide , making a snug , warm seat to sit on as we were whisked around at some pretty scary speeds .
during the journey , nanna told me about sisimiut .
about 5,000 people lived there , she explained , making it the second largest town in greenland .
it was the kind of place where everybody knew everybody , she said .
nanna said that although she had a great desire for travel and adventure - like many greenlandic people - she loved her home very much .
i 'm sad to be leaving sisimiut after such a short stay - it truly is beautiful here , but my boat and the walruses await .
wednesday 4 april : walrus for sale this morning , i got the chance to don my thermals and go out and explore the town .
bbc news - walrus watch up to 10 walruses to be tagged location data fed to denmark bbc news to map positions with me was mikkel villum jensen who is leading the walrus expedition .
after weeks of talking to him on the phone in preparation for the trip , it was good to finally meet in person .
it soon became apparent that walruses are prominent in sisimiut .
they feature on the town 's flag , some of the pretty buildings are painted with pictures of them - and walrus meat is also for sale .
we walked -lrb- or rather , mikkel walked , i slipped and fell -rrb- up the steep hill to the shop where local fishermen and hunters sell their wares .
behind the counter lay slabs of deep-red , fatty meat on sale for 40 danish kroner -lrb- about £ 3.50 -rrb- a kilo .
shop-owner erik said walrus meat was very tasty .
erik , the shop-owner , told me that the meat was popular in sisimiut and it was " very tasty " .
about seven walruses had been killed for meat this winter , he explained .
he said that greenlandic people had eaten walrus meat for many years , along with reindeer , seal and musk ox , and it was a strong part of their tradition .
walrus meat and skin were also fed to the huskies , he added , as a protein rich meal for the working dogs .
tuesday 3 april : a shaky start getting to sisimiut - the port in west greenland where the walrus tracking trawler is to set sail - was supposed to be the easy part of my trip .
fly to copenhagen from london , jump on the flight to kangerlussuaq , a former us army base in central greenland , then a 10-minute wait before the short connecting flight to my final destination .
or so i thought .
the 10 minutes quickly turned into hours , before , eventually , the dreaded " your flight to sisimiut has been cancelled " call came over the tannoy , followed swiftly by an even more fearsome " and there will be no more flights there today " .
i soon learnt , after finding some kind companions - morten and vivian - to share my waiting time with , that delays are common in this part of the world .
planes are at the whim of the weather , which can turn at any second .
there was nothing i could do , they said , but sit and wait it out .
picturesque but today , after a night spent in some old army barracks , the weather settled and i could continue my journey .
boats in sisimiut harbour are waiting for good weather the flight to sisimiut was breathtaking .
the window of the tiny plane revealed a mountainous snow-covered landscape studded with bright blue fjords .
and the town itself was also stunning .
small houses , painted in primary colours , nestle in the snowy hillside , overlooking a harbour below packed with fishing boats bobbing amongst the ice .
i have a few days to wait until the weather is deemed good enough to set sail - and in the meantime , i ca n't wait to brave the -10c temperatures to go and explore .
it is not clear whether the laptev walrus is a separate subspecies the tagging study is being run by the greenland institute of natural resources , in cooperation with the danish national environmental research institute and the technical university of denmark .

they hope to solve the mystery of where the hefty creatures migrate over the summer months .
our science reporter joined the research team on its expedition .
monday 16 april : goodbye greenland the time has now come to say farewell to greenland .
a job well done getting a taste of life here , both on sea and on land , has been a privilege , as has been getting to know mikkel , the trawler 's crew : knud , ole and gustav , as well as the other friends i have made along the way .
and , of course , there were the walruses .
my close encounter with the tusked giants was possibly one of the coldest , scariest but most exhilarating experiences i have ever had .
as i return home to warm up a bit , the baton is now handed over to the " wallies " who begin their migration to who knows where .
i 'm very much looking forward to seeing what these magnificent animals get up to over the next few months .
saturday 14 april : back on dry land a couple of days ago , the team and i returned to sisimiut 's harbour jubilant with the walrus tagging success .
a tupilaq was once used by witch doctors it felt as if we had been at sea forever and setting foot back on to dry land was a strange experience - i suffered a sort of reverse sea sickness as my body was , by now , very much used to reacting to the pitches and swells of the sea rather than the static ground .
the few days ' delay before i can get on to a flight back to the uk has given me the opportunity to see the crew in another setting .
at sea , they worked incredibly hard all of the time , often from 6am through to midnight without a break .
so seeing skipper knud lennart relaxing in his beautiful home , when mikkel and i were invited around for some very delicious roast musk ox , felt very much out of the ordinary .
and visiting deck-hand ole lennart , his wife marie and grandson kim in his home gave me a chance to talk more to him about his experiences in the town .
life had changed a lot and very fast since he grew up here in the 1950s , he said , the population had exploded from just a few hundred people to 6,000 .

the visit made me think about what life must have been like here years ago .
as someone used to living with every conceivable modern convenience , i find it hard to imagine how people could not only have survived , but thrived , in this harsh climate .

i soon learnt , after finding some kind companions - morten and vivian - to share my waiting time with , that delays are common in this part of the world .
planes are at the whim of the weather , which can turn at any second .
there was nothing i could do , they said , but sit and wait it out .
picturesque but today , after a night spent in some old army barracks , the weather settled and i could continue my journey .
boats in sisimiut harbour are waiting for good weather the flight to sisimiut was breathtaking .
the window of the tiny plane revealed a mountainous snow-covered landscape studded with bright blue fjords .
and the town itself was also stunning .
small houses , painted in primary colours , nestle in the snowy hillside , overlooking a harbour below packed with fishing boats bobbing amongst the ice .
i have a few days to wait until the weather is deemed good enough to set sail - and in the meantime , i ca n't wait to brave the -10c temperatures to go and explore .
it is not clear whether the laptev walrus is a separate subspecies the tagging study is being run by the greenland institute of natural resources , in cooperation with the danish national environmental research institute and the technical university of denmark .

they hope to solve the mystery of where the hefty creatures migrate over the summer months .
our science reporter joined the research team on its expedition .
monday 16 april : goodbye greenland the time has now come to say farewell to greenland .
a job well done getting a taste of life here , both on sea and on land , has been a privilege , as has been getting to know mikkel , the trawler 's crew : knud , ole and gustav , as well as the other friends i have made along the way .
and , of course , there were the walruses .
my close encounter with the tusked giants was possibly one of the coldest , scariest but most exhilarating experiences i have ever had .
as i return home to warm up a bit , the baton is now handed over to the " wallies " who begin their migration to who knows where .
i 'm very much looking forward to seeing what these magnificent animals get up to over the next few months .
saturday 14 april : back on dry land a couple of days ago , the team and i returned to sisimiut 's harbour jubilant with the walrus tagging success .
a tupilaq was once used by witch doctors it felt as if we had been at sea forever and setting foot back on to dry land was a strange experience - i suffered a sort of reverse sea sickness as my body was , by now , very much used to reacting to the pitches and swells of the sea rather than the static ground .
the few days ' delay before i can get on to a flight back to the uk has given me the opportunity to see the crew in another setting .
at sea , they worked incredibly hard all of the time , often from 6am through to midnight without a break .
so seeing skipper knud lennart relaxing in his beautiful home , when mikkel and i were invited around for some very delicious roast musk ox , felt very much out of the ordinary .
and visiting deck-hand ole lennart , his wife marie and grandson kim in his home gave me a chance to talk more to him about his experiences in the town .
life had changed a lot and very fast since he grew up here in the 1950s , he said , the population had exploded from just a few hundred people to 6,000 .
ole and his family told me more about greenlandic culture but tradition in greenland remained strong , his grandson kim translated for me .
i was shown intricate greenlandic costumes , stitched out of seal skin and fur by ole 's wife .
and on proud display throughout the house were symbols of inuit culture - beautifully crafted model kayaks and harpoons , ancient walrus tusks that had been found on the shore , a mounted seal 's head , and a tupilaq - a carving once used by witch-doctors .
the visit made me think about what life must have been like here years ago .
as someone used to living with every conceivable modern convenience , i find it hard to imagine how people could not only have survived , but thrived , in this harsh climate .
greenlandic people are very proud of their culture , explained ole , and it is important that it is kept alive .
wednesday 11 april : walrus jackpot after five days of waiting and waiting , we finally hit the walrus jackpot .
on tuesday morning , we awoke to find that a strong wind had broken up some of the sea ice , allowing the skipper to navigate the boat to a bank where walruses often go to feed .
tagging walruses in greenland in pictures soon after we got there , a closer look at a brown blob far off on the horizon revealed it to be a walrus .
layers of clothing were thrown on , and researcher mikkel , crew-member ole and i jumped into a skiff that the trawler had been carrying throughout its journey .
the smaller vessel meant we were able to sneak up on the animal as it lay snoozing on a hunk of ice , but it heard us as we cracked through the frozen water and promptly slid into the sea .
a chase ensued - the walrus would pop its head up a few tens of metres away to breathe in some air , someone would spot it , yell , and the boat would race towards it , arriving just as it dived back under again .
keeping watch for walruses paid dividends after five days this happened a few times until we finally got lucky and arrived just as the walrus came up .
a quick " thwunk " from the crossbow and the satellite tag was attached to the animal 's shoulder .
even though i had been assured that the tags would n't hurt the walruses because of their tough skin and thick layer of blubber , i was still relieved to see that the animal barely seemed to notice the tag as it landed on its hide .
as we were celebrating , another cry of walrus went up , and soon the animals were being tagged left , right and centre ; some with the crossbow , some with the co2-powered gun and others with a harpoon that knud , our skipper , had crafted .
after days of nothing , seven walruses had been tagged in just a few hours .
and today turned out to be just as action packed .
unfortunately two of the tags were lost - they skimmed on the water just before they hit the walruses , sinking to the bottom of the sea , but another one , launched by ole with the harpoon , hit a walrus squarely between the shoulders - the perfect place for a sat-tag .
a success rate of eight out of 10 tags was " pretty good going " , mikkel concluded .
the satellite tags were about the same size as a lighter and what of the walruses ?
well , i knew they were going to be huge , but i did n't realise quite how big they were going to be , especially when you are only a couple of metres away from them in a puny boat .
i suddenly realised that if there was to be a tussle between walrus and skiff , walrus would very definitely win .
but i also found them rather lovely - their faces with tusks and whiskers were just so full of character , and they were sociable too , often swimming around in groups of two , looking much more graceful in the sea than when on the ice .
i was a bit unsure about what i 'd make of them before i came out here but , i have to admit , i 'm a walrus convert .
monday 9 april : food is fuel while i 've been on board , waiting for a walrus to appear , i 've been getting to know the crew better and learn a little about greenlandic life .
gustav , one of the deck-hands , spoke to me about how important hunting was to the inuit population .
gustav says hunting is vital for the inuit people he told me how his grandfather lived off the land , hunting seal , reindeer , whales and walruses for food and also to make clothing and tools .
he said that hunting was still important for the local population .
many goods are imported from europe , he explained , making them extremely expensive .
for some locals , hunting was still necessary to get the food and clothing they needed to survive the harsh conditions , he told me .
i 've also had the chance to experience some traditional greenlandic dishes here on the boat .
in the colder-than-a-freezer temperatures , food really is fuel .
the body burns up a lot of calories just trying to keep warm ; so rich , meaty stews are a regular feature on the menu on the boat .
last night , i tried reindeer - putting any thoughts of rudolph and his red nose to the back of my mind .
mikkel told me that it was a nutritious , tasty meat - and it 's cheap too , since it does n't have to be imported .
it was soft - tasting somewhat like beef , but better .
seal meat is tasty , nutritious and cheap , says mikkel and then i found out the other steaming pot next to it was seal meat .
earlier that day , a boat had pulled up next to ours with a bloody bag sat upon the deck - i did n't really think much of it at the time , but now i suddenly understood that the bag had contained my dinner .
innards , blood , blubber and meat had been boiled up into a very rich stew - the crew looked at me with anticipation as they spooned some of it into my bowl .
the meat was almost black in colour , a little chewy and both fishy and meaty in taste .
but the thing i really noticed was how warm it was making me feel - my face turned red and my toes were glowing - and even though i 'm having problems getting the images of cute pinnipeds out of my mind , i can understand why this sort of food is important in a territory like this .
sunday 8 april : waiting for wally it 's all about the ice , here at sea .
you need enough of the frozen stuff so that the walruses can laze about on it after dining on a feast of clams and other molluscs , but not so much - as has been the case so far - that it is impossible to get to the arctic animals .
a crew member used an orange to practise his tagging technique " ice , ice ... too much ice , " has been something our skipper has been saying rather regularly over the last few days .
we have been trying to reach the shallow banks where the " wallys " , as mikkel calls them , go to feed .
but so far , we have only been able to skirt around their edges , every so often finding a break between the thick layers of frozen water to steer through , all the time with huge icebergs drifting around .
still , a couple of " walrus " cries have been sounded by the beady-eyed crew , who spend the hours scanning the white horizon for the tusked creatures as the trawler crunches through the icy water .
i 've got the routine down pat now .
the slightest sniff of a walrus means you have to rush into the galley , throw on your michelin-man-like flotation suit over the four layers you are already wearing , then the extra socks and snow boots go on , followed by balaclava , neck gaiter , hat , gloves and mittens .
the boat has been hemmed in by the ice then we rush outside .
mikkel grabs his crossbow and satellite tag on the way , and climbs up the ice-covered ladder on to the deck .
and then we wait , and wait , and wait in the hope that the walrus might reappear , all the time standing in the -25c temperatures while a strong wind slaps the freezing air on to your face .
i had n't really thought a 1.5-tonne beast could be described as wily , but so far , that 's exactly what these walruses have been !
some days have been so icy we have n't even been able to move from the cove where we have been spending the night .
but the spare time has given mikkel the chance to rehearse his walrus tagging skills .
i was amazed to see the crew fearlessly clamber on to the sea ice to set down an orange for him to fire a dummy sat tag at from his co2-powered gun -lrb- which he had brought along in addition to the crossbow -rrb- .
after a few shots , he told me he was ready to swap fruit for walruses - should we ever get close enough ...
thursday 5 april : turning green before i left the uk , just about everyone i told about the walrus trip asked me what my sea legs were like .
view from the boat , heading west from sisimiut i had to give the honest answer that i did n't have a clue as i 'd never been sailing before .
armed with plenty of sea sickness pills - just in case - i boarded the nanna l trawler -lrb- named after knud 's daughter -rrb- .
and as we left sisimiut , heading west , i soon discovered that my sea legs were a little shaky .
a plastic bag quickly became my accessory of choice as i sat staring at the horizon turning an icky shade of green .
but i 'm pleased to say that the bag never got used - and a few hours into the trip as we approached the calmer , ice-covered waters , i began to feel just about normal .
with me on board are mikkel , chief walrus tagger ; knud the skipper ; and his two deckhands , ole and gustav .
the boat and crew are usually at sea fishing the arctic waters for prawns , but gustav told me it made a nice change to look for walruses .
the day was spent scanning the water for signs of the tusked beasts , both from the bridge , and also from the deck of the boat .
temperatures were -25c on deck gustav and ole would regularly clamber on to the slippery deck to survey the ice for a clearer view of any creatures , braving the -25c temperatures outside .
i joined them for a while .
with the wind helping along the freezing conditions , it is safe to say that it really was ridiculously cold out there - and i soon had to go back in to defrost .
the day was not to provide us with a walrus sighting - a glimpse of a bearded seal off in the distance was the closest we got .
wednesday 4 april : down with the dogs mikkel and i met the boat 's skipper knud lennert this afternoon .
he knows these icy waters very well , having spent the last 20 years navigating them .
nanna says sisimiut is a place where everybody knows everybody he thinks we may be able to leave the port tomorrow morning , but warned that it is going to get cold out at sea - and for a local to have said this means it is going to be really , really freezing .
knud 's 18-year-old daughter nanna joined us to translate some of the information for me .
the greenlandic ski champion recently spent a year in new zealand perfecting her english .
she asked me if i wanted to join her and her younger brother on a dog sleigh ride - and who could refuse such an offer ?
no place like home nine beautiful huskies pulled us over the hilly terrain , crossing frozen lakes covered with snow that had fallen the night before .
huskies whisk the sleighs along at fast speeds the sleigh was covered with a reindeer hide , making a snug , warm seat to sit on as we were whisked around at some pretty scary speeds .
during the journey , nanna told me about sisimiut .
about 5,000 people lived there , she explained , making it the second largest town in greenland .
it was the kind of place where everybody knew everybody , she said .
nanna said that although she had a great desire for travel and adventure - like many greenlandic people - she loved her home very much .
i 'm sad to be leaving sisimiut after such a short stay - it truly is beautiful here , but my boat and the walruses await .
wednesday 4 april : walrus for sale this morning , i got the chance to don my thermals and go out and explore the town .
bbc news - walrus watch up to 10 walruses to be tagged location data fed to denmark bbc news to map positions with me was mikkel villum jensen who is leading the walrus expedition .
after weeks of talking to him on the phone in preparation for the trip , it was good to finally meet in person .
it soon became apparent that walruses are prominent in sisimiut .
they feature on the town 's flag , some of the pretty buildings are painted with pictures of them - and walrus meat is also for sale .
we walked -lrb- or rather , mikkel walked , i slipped and fell -rrb- up the steep hill to the shop where local fishermen and hunters sell their wares .
behind the counter lay slabs of deep-red , fatty meat on sale for 40 danish kroner -lrb- about £ 3.50 -rrb- a kilo .
shop-owner erik said walrus meat was very tasty .
erik , the shop-owner , told me that the meat was popular in sisimiut and it was " very tasty " .
about seven walruses had been killed for meat this winter , he explained .
he said that greenlandic people had eaten walrus meat for many years , along with reindeer , seal and musk ox , and it was a strong part of their tradition .
walrus meat and skin were also fed to the huskies , he added , as a protein rich meal for the working dogs .
tuesday 3 april : a shaky start getting to sisimiut - the port in west greenland where the walrus tracking trawler is to set sail - was supposed to be the easy part of my trip .
fly to copenhagen from london , jump on the flight to kangerlussuaq , a former us army base in central greenland , then a 10-minute wait before the short connecting flight to my final destination .
or so i thought .
the 10 minutes quickly turned into hours , before , eventually , the dreaded " your flight to sisimiut has been cancelled " call came over the tannoy , followed swiftly by an even more fearsome " and there will be no more flights there today " .
i soon learnt , after finding some kind companions - morten and vivian - to share my waiting time with , that delays are common in this part of the world .
planes are at the whim of the weather , which can turn at any second .
there was nothing i could do , they said , but sit and wait it out .
picturesque but today , after a night spent in some old army barracks , the weather settled and i could continue my journey .
boats in sisimiut harbour are waiting for good weather the flight to sisimiut was breathtaking .
the window of the tiny plane revealed a mountainous snow-covered landscape studded with bright blue fjords .

after a few shots , he told me he was ready to swap fruit for walruses - should we ever get close enough ...
thursday 5 april : turning green before i left the uk , just about everyone i told about the walrus trip asked me what my sea legs were like .
view from the boat , heading west from sisimiut i had to give the honest answer that i did n't have a clue as i 'd never been sailing before .
armed with plenty of sea sickness pills - just in case - i boarded the nanna l trawler -lrb- named after knud 's daughter -rrb- .
and as we left sisimiut , heading west , i soon discovered that my sea legs were a little shaky .
a plastic bag quickly became my accessory of choice as i sat staring at the horizon turning an icky shade of green .
but i 'm pleased to say that the bag never got used - and a few hours into the trip as we approached the calmer , ice-covered waters , i began to feel just about normal .
with me on board are mikkel , chief walrus tagger ; knud the skipper ; and his two deckhands , ole and gustav .
the boat and crew are usually at sea fishing the arctic waters for prawns , but gustav told me it made a nice change to look for walruses .
the day was spent scanning the water for signs of the tusked beasts , both from the bridge , and also from the deck of the boat .
temperatures were -25c on deck gustav and ole would regularly clamber on to the slippery deck to survey the ice for a clearer view of any creatures , braving the -25c temperatures outside .
i joined them for a while .
with the wind helping along the freezing conditions , it is safe to say that it really was ridiculously cold out there - and i soon had to go back in to defrost .
the day was not to provide us with a walrus sighting - a glimpse of a bearded seal off in the distance was the closest we got .
wednesday 4 april : down with the dogs mikkel and i met the boat 's skipper knud lennert this afternoon .
he knows these icy waters very well , having spent the last 20 years navigating them .
nanna says sisimiut is a place where everybody knows everybody he thinks we may be able to leave the port tomorrow morning , but warned that it is going to get cold out at sea - and for a local to have said this means it is going to be really , really freezing .
knud 's 18-year-old daughter nanna joined us to translate some of the information for me .
the greenlandic ski champion recently spent a year in new zealand perfecting her english .
she asked me if i wanted to join her and her younger brother on a dog sleigh ride - and who could refuse such an offer ?
no place like home nine beautiful huskies pulled us over the hilly terrain , crossing frozen lakes covered with snow that had fallen the night before .
huskies whisk the sleighs along at fast speeds the sleigh was covered with a reindeer hide , making a snug , warm seat to sit on as we were whisked around at some pretty scary speeds .
during the journey , nanna told me about sisimiut .
about 5,000 people lived there , she explained , making it the second largest town in greenland .
it was the kind of place where everybody knew everybody , she said .
nanna said that although she had a great desire for travel and adventure - like many greenlandic people - she loved her home very much .
i 'm sad to be leaving sisimiut after such a short stay - it truly is beautiful here , but my boat and the walruses await .
wednesday 4 april : walrus for sale this morning , i got the chance to don my thermals and go out and explore the town .
bbc news - walrus watch up to 10 walruses to be tagged location data fed to denmark bbc news to map positions with me was mikkel villum jensen who is leading the walrus expedition .
after weeks of talking to him on the phone in preparation for the trip , it was good to finally meet in person .
it soon became apparent that walruses are prominent in sisimiut .
they feature on the town 's flag , some of the pretty buildings are painted with pictures of them - and walrus meat is also for sale .
we walked -lrb- or rather , mikkel walked , i slipped and fell -rrb- up the steep hill to the shop where local fishermen and hunters sell their wares .
behind the counter lay slabs of deep-red , fatty meat on sale for 40 danish kroner -lrb- about £ 3.50 -rrb- a kilo .
shop-owner erik said walrus meat was very tasty .
erik , the shop-owner , told me that the meat was popular in sisimiut and it was " very tasty " .
about seven walruses had been killed for meat this winter , he explained .
he said that greenlandic people had eaten walrus meat for many years , along with reindeer , seal and musk ox , and it was a strong part of their tradition .
walrus meat and skin were also fed to the huskies , he added , as a protein rich meal for the working dogs .
tuesday 3 april : a shaky start getting to sisimiut - the port in west greenland where the walrus tracking trawler is to set sail - was supposed to be the easy part of my trip .
fly to copenhagen from london , jump on the flight to kangerlussuaq , a former us army base in central greenland , then a 10-minute wait before the short connecting flight to my final destination .
or so i thought .
the 10 minutes quickly turned into hours , before , eventually , the dreaded " your flight to sisimiut has been cancelled " call came over the tannoy , followed swiftly by an even more fearsome " and there will be no more flights there today " .
i soon learnt , after finding some kind companions - morten and vivian - to share my waiting time with , that delays are common in this part of the world .
planes are at the whim of the weather , which can turn at any second .
there was nothing i could do , they said , but sit and wait it out .
picturesque but today , after a night spent in some old army barracks , the weather settled and i could continue my journey .
boats in sisimiut harbour are waiting for good weather the flight to sisimiut was breathtaking .
the window of the tiny plane revealed a mountainous snow-covered landscape studded with bright blue fjords .
and the town itself was also stunning .
small houses , painted in primary colours , nestle in the snowy hillside , overlooking a harbour below packed with fishing boats bobbing amongst the ice .
i have a few days to wait until the weather is deemed good enough to set sail - and in the meantime , i ca n't wait to brave the -10c temperatures to go and explore .
it is not clear whether the laptev walrus is a separate subspecies the tagging study is being run by the greenland institute of natural resources , in cooperation with the danish national environmental research institute and the technical university of denmark .

two heavyweights of the uk music industry explain why .
" the uk live music scene is more buoyant now than i can ever remember it . "
that is the view of stuart galbraith , the uk managing director of live entertainment company live nation and someone who has been working in the music industry for nearly 30 years .
galbraith says musical talent in the uk has never been stronger he believes the reason behind the current live music renaissance is a simple one .
" i think there are generally more people interested in music full stop and i think that the breadth and depth of talent in the uk is unprecedented , " he says .
" live music is the ultimate experience .
it 's not bootleggable , you ca n't replicate it , you ca n't steal it , and you ca n't mimic that experience of actually standing at a gig - the roar of the crowd , the smell of the greasepaint . "
many believe new technology - in the shape of myspace and music forums - has boosted the scene .
" computers , e-mail , texts and mobile phones mean people have much more access to information than they did five or six years ago , " says charlie presburg of concert information service pollstar .
u2 or the rolling stones can make a lot of money , especially when they are charging a lot of money for tickets charlie presburg , pollstar " myspace , youtube , and artists ' websites have influenced things massively because it puts them more in contact with the fans , and the fans want to be part of it . "
those fans are not necessarily the stereotypical beered-up students or pre-pubescent girls .
" take that last year , duran duran a couple of years ago , the police this year - all age brackets seem to want to be able consume live music , " explains mr galbraith .
" your age range literally runs from eight to 88 , and there is an active market in every single one of those age brackets . "
have your say ticket prices are just about fair ... until you add the booking fee ted , stamford send your comments in the face of falling physical music sales , it is those willing markets that also provides another reason why the live scene is booming - money .
" a lot of these artists can make a decent revenue touring , " says mr presburg .
" u2 or the rolling stones can make a lot of money , especially when they are charging a lot of money for tickets .
" you get people in their 50s and 60s going to gigs because they want to see them , and they have got the disposable income .
" but the bottom line is that this is what these guys do .
it 's a compulsion .
what else are the rolling stones going to do ?
the stones ' bigger bang world tour started two years ago " they will probably tour until they drop down dead , and i mean that in a very positive way , because we need artists like that .
that 's what they do best . "
but while stars like the rolling stones and the police lead the way in terms of touring , it is the music festivals that have everyone talking .
glastonbury has grown to be 30 times its original size , and with reading , leeds , and t in the park booming , it is perhaps no surprise that more festivals are being added to the summer line-up every year .
new boys on the block like connect , fflam and latitude may not be as well known as glastonbury or t in the park , but they still offer top class performers in the shape of primal scream , manic street preachers and arcade fire .
" festivals give people the ability to see so many bands over the course of one weekend , so it represents good value for money , " says mr galbraith , whose festival offerings include download and the wireless festival .
' hippy behemoths ' " in the last five or six years festival tickets have gone through the roof , they are selling out more quickly and there are more festivals in the uk and europe , " says mr presburg .
" also festivals are no longer these hippy behemoths that they used to be .
the facilities are better , they are more comfortable , and they have been cleaned up a lot . "
while the festival scene is booming , it must be careful not to go too far , mr presburg warns .
" the festival market is going to get very , very busy .
there is hardly a weekend goes by in the uk from june to august where there is no festivals happening , " he says .
" you could literally leapfrog from one festival to another for like four months solidly .
i think that could be an issue in the future .
it 's just getting a little too crowded . "
it is not just big festivals and big names that are booming - smaller venues around the country are also getting a boost .
" i was at a very small venue in birmingham last sunday night and it was absolutely rammed to the rafters , charging a quid to get in , " says presburg .
" it 's great .
that 's what the industry was built on .
it 's what keeps the music alive . "

" computers , e-mail , texts and mobile phones mean people have much more access to information than they did five or six years ago , " says charlie presburg of concert information service pollstar .
u2 or the rolling stones can make a lot of money , especially when they are charging a lot of money for tickets charlie presburg , pollstar " myspace , youtube , and artists ' websites have influenced things massively because it puts them more in contact with the fans , and the fans want to be part of it .

those fans are not necessarily the stereotypical beered-up students or pre-pubescent girls .
" take that last year , duran duran a couple of years ago , the police this year - all age brackets seem to want to be able consume live music , " explains mr galbraith .
" your age range literally runs from eight to 88 , and there is an active market in every single one of those age brackets . "
have your say ticket prices are just about fair ... until you add the booking fee ted , stamford send your comments in the face of falling physical music sales , it is those willing markets that also provides another reason why the live scene is booming - money .
" a lot of these artists can make a decent revenue touring , " says mr presburg .
" u2 or the rolling stones can make a lot of money , especially when they are charging a lot of money for tickets .
" you get people in their 50s and 60s going to gigs because they want to see them , and they have got the disposable income .
" but the bottom line is that this is what these guys do .
it 's a compulsion .
what else are the rolling stones going to do ?
the stones ' bigger bang world tour started two years ago " they will probably tour until they drop down dead , and i mean that in a very positive way , because we need artists like that .
that 's what they do best . "
but while stars like the rolling stones and the police lead the way in terms of touring , it is the music festivals that have everyone talking .
glastonbury has grown to be 30 times its original size , and with reading , leeds , and t in the park booming , it is perhaps no surprise that more festivals are being added to the summer line-up every year .
new boys on the block like connect , fflam and latitude may not be as well known as glastonbury or t in the park , but they still offer top class performers in the shape of primal scream , manic street preachers and arcade fire .
" festivals give people the ability to see so many bands over the course of one weekend , so it represents good value for money , " says mr galbraith , whose festival offerings include download and the wireless festival .
' hippy behemoths ' " in the last five or six years festival tickets have gone through the roof , they are selling out more quickly and there are more festivals in the uk and europe , " says mr presburg .
" also festivals are no longer these hippy behemoths that they used to be .
the facilities are better , they are more comfortable , and they have been cleaned up a lot . "
while the festival scene is booming , it must be careful not to go too far , mr presburg warns .
" the festival market is going to get very , very busy .
there is hardly a weekend goes by in the uk from june to august where there is no festivals happening , " he says .
" you could literally leapfrog from one festival to another for like four months solidly .
i think that could be an issue in the future .
it 's just getting a little too crowded . "
it is not just big festivals and big names that are booming - smaller venues around the country are also getting a boost .
" i was at a very small venue in birmingham last sunday night and it was absolutely rammed to the rafters , charging a quid to get in , " says presburg .
" it 's great .
that 's what the industry was built on .
it 's what keeps the music alive . "
