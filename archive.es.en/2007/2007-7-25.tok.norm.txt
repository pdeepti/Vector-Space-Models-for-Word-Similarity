the six went home tuesday after eight years in jail . as they hugged their celebrating family members , the slender silhouette of cecilia sarkozy appeared on the plane 's stairs , " rome 's la repubblica daily wrote .
" she is certainly the heroine of this release … along with her husband nicolas and the grey eminence claude gueant , secretary general of elysee palace .
despite the criticism from … the left-wing opposition , the matter is a triumph for the sarkozys , the baptism of ' couple diplomacy ' that never existed before : yesterday cecilia brought the nurses home and at the same time emphasized the humanitarian aspect of her role .
today nicolas travels to tripoli to meet -lsb- libyan leader -rsb- gadhafi and to lend the agreement a political dimension . "
but others were n't quite so happy with with sarkozy 's behavior .
" madame sarkozy 's intervention has caused displeasure , " according to de morgen in brussels .
" the european commission can hardly explain itself why , of all people , cecilia sarkozy traveled to libya , and some eu parliamentarians and members of the french opposition find it outrageous that the sarkozys want to ' take the credit ' for the release , while the eu has been lobbying for years for the unfortunate six . "
" ' super sarko ' layed it on too thick after the happy resolution of the drama , too artlessly did he take the credit that actually belongs to others , " wrote germany 's nürnberger zeitung daily .
for , it was the diplomats of the eu , britain 's former prime minister tony blair and germany 's foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , who over the years doggedly negotiated with the libyan leader behind the scenes .
worse still : sarkozy artlessly used the touchy affair to help his capricious spouse with her personal search for meaningful activities .
with that he demoted complicated foreign policy to a sort of therapy for couples .
not everyone is enthusiastic about cecilia sarkozy 's charm offensive as a humanitarian ambassador on the political frontline . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the medics flew back to bulgaria in a french presidential jet " we ca n't exactly understand why cecilia sarkozy travelled to tripoli twice within a two-week period - even if she was , like many , outraged and concerned about the fate of the nurses , " commented french catholic daily la croix shortly before the medics were flown out of libya .
" we can only hope that the idea was not to take advantage of the media attention the release would attract .
the eu 's diplomats , who have been negotiating with libya for years , would hardly be able to appreciate the french activism in the moment of the release .
is it really the french first lady 's job to get involved in a very touchy and complicated case in which much has been unsaid … and in which there are possibly secret negotiations for the french armaments industry ? "
" it is a real success for the -lsb- european union 's -rsb- common foreign policy and one that was earned only by years of gruelling effort and negotiation , " wrote the financial times in london .
" bulgaria on its own could never have done what was achieved by the eu as a whole .
that said , it comes as no surprise to see cecilia sarkozy , wife of nicolas sarkozy , the french president , appearing in libya just before the prisoners ' release . … while france has , along with the uk and germany , contributed to the complex deal that secured the bulgarians ' freedom , it would not be the first time that one eu power has tried to hog the limelight and take the credit for a shared success .

meeting at the german embassy in vienna , officials from the us , russia , germany , france , britain and italy attempted to overcome the us-russian deadlock over the un plan to grant kosovo internationally monitored independence and to find a new format for talks .
eu foreign ministers had decided monday to limit new talks to 120 days and hold them within a smaller format to make them more effective .
germany suggested a troika of the eu , russia and us to lead the negotiations .
in a surprise move , russia agreed on the troika format suggested by german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier at the eu foreign ministers ' meeting on monday . moscow has previously said it is against moving kosovo negotiations away from the un security council , where it , along with the four other permanent council members , has the ability to veto any resolution tabled , and president vladimir putin on tuesday had again rejected talks on kosovo 's independence , fearing this could create a precedent for secession in other regions . ahtisaari steps down empty-handed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahtisaari leaves with his plan blowing in the wind meanwhile , the un 's special envoy to kosovo , martti ahtisaari , said wednesday he regarded his mission as over , saying , " my work is done . "
the 70-year-old former finnish president and career diplomat had previously said he would not prolong his engagement if either kosovo or serbia blocked the process towards determining the break-away province ’ s status .
ahtisaari has said neither the un nor the contact group had asked him to continue mediations in the face of russia 's persistent refusal to support independence for the serbian province .
he has , however , said he would be willing to take on " a role as consultant " if requested .
ahtisaari ’ s mediating efforts had been repeatedly criticized by serbia and russia as being partial towards the kosovo side .
in january , after a year of talks between serbia and kosovar albanians , he presented a proposal granting internationally monitored independence to the province .
this was rejected by moscow and belgrade .
continuing this stalemate , russian foreign minister sergei lavrov had said on tuesday that ahtisaari 's roadmap was no basis for new talks .
for the us , however , the un plan is not negotiable .
the southern serbian province had been under un administration since nato forced serbian troops to withdraw .
serbia cranks up rhetoric over unilateral independence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " self governance " is the priority for kosovans kosovo 's ethnic albanian majority , frustrated by setbacks and delays , will accept nothing short of full independence .
belgrade is only ready to grant far-reaching autonomy , fearing kosovo 's serb minority will be endangered in case of independence .
a unilateral declaration of independence by the province 's leadership could lead to a further destabilization of the region , diplomats fear .

fearing that kosovo would push forward alone as the stalemate continued , the parliament of serbia overwhelmingly voted late on tuesday to back the government 's resolution to reject any move to grant independence .
the resolution says the government will " respond promptly and energetically " to any indication of unilateral recognition of an independent kosovo , but the draft gives no details on measures the government should take .

"
however , aleksandar vucic of the hard-line nationalist serbian radical party accused the government of being " too meek " and demanded a break of diplomatic relations with any state recognizing an independent kosovo .
his party leader tomislav nikolic called on the government to give up its plans for serbia to join the european union and nato and " use all available means to defend our kosovo . "

meeting at the german embassy in vienna , officials from the us , russia , germany , france , britain and italy attempted to overcome the us-russian deadlock over the un plan to grant kosovo internationally monitored independence and to find a new format for talks .
eu foreign ministers had decided monday to limit new talks to 120 days and hold them within a smaller format to make them more effective .
germany suggested a troika of the eu , russia and us to lead the negotiations .
in a surprise move , russia agreed on the troika format suggested by german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier at the eu foreign ministers ' meeting on monday . moscow has previously said it is against moving kosovo negotiations away from the un security council , where it , along with the four other permanent council members , has the ability to veto any resolution tabled , and president vladimir putin on tuesday had again rejected talks on kosovo 's independence , fearing this could create a precedent for secession in other regions . ahtisaari steps down empty-handed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahtisaari leaves with his plan blowing in the wind meanwhile , the un 's special envoy to kosovo , martti ahtisaari , said wednesday he regarded his mission as over , saying , " my work is done .

the 70-year-old former finnish president and career diplomat had previously said he would not prolong his engagement if either kosovo or serbia blocked the process towards determining the break-away province ’ s status .

could you please explain ? as early as 1969 , i made clear in an official statement that it was up to the tibetan people whether or not the institution of the dalai lama should continue .
that means that if the majority of the tibetan people decide that the old institution of the dalai lama is no longer relevant to the tibetan nation , it will cease to exist .
if i were to die soon , i think most of the tibetan people would want to keep the institution .
if i live on 20 or 30 years , it might be different .
that 's okay .
that would be an end with dignity . do you ever hope to return to tibet ? oh yes .
all tibetans get homesick and hope to see their own country .

about a month ago i met a tibetan who spent eight years in a chinese prison .
his only crime , which took place in a village near lhasa , was to express his own feelings . china reacted harshly when you spoke about the issue of tibet in hamburg .
did that surprise you ? not at all .
even i live in silence .
there 's always some sort of condemnation .
they just keep going on like that . what do you think of the german government 's stance toward tibet ?
do you think berlin does enough for your cause ? the german government is like other governments - basically sympathetic .
certainly there 's a sense of concern .
the question is whether that 's adequate .
we appreciate expressions of concern from the outside world .
that 's necessary and helpful . what are your goals when you visit other countries ? my main purpose and motivation is not the issue of tibet , but rather the promotion of human values in order to have happier individuals , families and communities - and , in that way , a happier humanity .
i consider that to be my contribution .
i think every human being has a responsibility to better the world .
that 's my conviction , and i always try to promote that .
my second goal is the promotion of religious harmony .
when i teach in india , more and more chinese come .
sometimes , the chinese government puts up restrictions to prevent chinese from coming to india .
but despite that , some chinese always come .
many of them say that , after seeing the tibetan community , they found big difference s to what they had heard in china .
eventually there 's some positive impact . bildunterschrift : tens of thousands of buddhists have turned out to hear the dalai lama you have said that you could be the last dalai lama .
could you please explain ? as early as 1969 , i made clear in an official statement that it was up to the tibetan people whether or not the institution of the dalai lama should continue .
that means that if the majority of the tibetan people decide that the old institution of the dalai lama is no longer relevant to the tibetan nation , it will cease to exist .
if i were to die soon , i think most of the tibetan people would want to keep the institution .
if i live on 20 or 30 years , it might be different .
that 's okay .
that would be an end with dignity . do you ever hope to return to tibet ? oh yes .
all tibetans get homesick and hope to see their own country .
me , too .
but at the same time , i 'm a buddhist monk .
so mentally and personally one 's own birthplace is n't all that important .

sarkozy 's wife , cecilia , and his top aide , claude gueant , helped negotiate the liberation of the five bulgarian nurses and a palestinian doctor who received bulgarian citizenship .
the six had been sentenced to death for allegedly infecting more than 400 libyan children with aids .
the anti-nuclear group sortir du nucleaire has charged that sarkozy helped liberate the nurses by promising to help build up libya 's nuclear energy program .
two nuclear deals signed " sarkozy seems already to have forgotten that gadhafi is a dictator , " the group said in a press statement .
" to deliver atomic energy technology to libya means helping the country build nuclear weapons . "
the two countries signed a memorandum of understanding on the construction of a libyan nuclear reactor for water desalination , said gueant , who accompanied sarkozy on the trip . gueant added that " there is still much work to do " on the feasibility study of the desalination project . a second agreement , outlining a framework for civilian nuclear energy cooperation was also signed at the end of the talks between kadhafi and sarkozy by libyan foreign minister abdel rahman shalgham and his french counterpart , bernard kouchner , officials said . sarkozy in search of energy deals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy was looking to strike deals with gadhafi in addition to strengthening ties between the oil exporting nation and the west by making libya part of the mediterranean union sarkozy is trying to establish , the french president had hoped to land big contracts for the french nuclear energy company areva and petroleum giant total .
before sarkozy landed in libya on wednesday , presidential spokesman david martinon confirmed this on french television : " what we are going to talk about is wide-ranging cooperation , in all fields .
" we can do a lot more and a lot better with libya , and that is why the head of state is traveling there , " he added .
the presidential airbus landed at mitiga military airport on wednesday afternoon and sarkozy and kouchner headed straight to the bab azizia palace for an official welcoming ceremony and then to the signing of the cooperation agreements .
the french entourage was to attend a dinner hosted by libyan leader gadhafi at bab azizia , a sprawling complex outside tripoli .
following his visit to libya , where he wrote he was " happy to be in your country to talk about the future " in a guest book , sarkozy will travel on to senegal , south africa and congo .
libya expected to become trading partner du jour bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : libya 's oilfields are of particular interest to western partners analysts believe the resources-rich north african country could now become a key trading partner for france and other western states after the negotiations which saw the bulgarian nurses released .
according to a libyan government official , new deals could cover the areas of security , energy , education , immigration , health and scientific research .
franco-libyan relations have been steadily improving since a 2004 accord on a libyan compensation deal for the victims of a french dc-10 airliner bombing over niger , which killed 170 people , including 54 french nationals , in 1989 .

sarkozy 's wife , cecilia , and his top aide , claude gueant , helped negotiate the liberation of the five bulgarian nurses and a palestinian doctor who received bulgarian citizenship .
the six had been sentenced to death for allegedly infecting more than 400 libyan children with aids .
the anti-nuclear group sortir du nucleaire has charged that sarkozy helped liberate the nurses by promising to help build up libya 's nuclear energy program .
two nuclear deals signed " sarkozy seems already to have forgotten that gadhafi is a dictator , " the group said in a press statement .
" to deliver atomic energy technology to libya means helping the country build nuclear weapons . "
the two countries signed a memorandum of understanding on the construction of a libyan nuclear reactor for water desalination , said gueant , who accompanied sarkozy on the trip . gueant added that " there is still much work to do " on the feasibility study of the desalination project . a second agreement , outlining a framework for civilian nuclear energy cooperation was also signed at the end of the talks between kadhafi and sarkozy by libyan foreign minister abdel rahman shalgham and his french counterpart , bernard kouchner , officials said . sarkozy in search of energy deals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy was looking to strike deals with gadhafi in addition to strengthening ties between the oil exporting nation and the west by making libya part of the mediterranean union sarkozy is trying to establish , the french president had hoped to land big contracts for the french nuclear energy company areva and petroleum giant total .
before sarkozy landed in libya on wednesday , presidential spokesman david martinon confirmed this on french television : " what we are going to talk about is wide-ranging cooperation , in all fields .
" we can do a lot more and a lot better with libya , and that is why the head of state is traveling there , " he added .
the presidential airbus landed at mitiga military airport on wednesday afternoon and sarkozy and kouchner headed straight to the bab azizia palace for an official welcoming ceremony and then to the signing of the cooperation agreements .
the french entourage was to attend a dinner hosted by libyan leader gadhafi at bab azizia , a sprawling complex outside tripoli .
following his visit to libya , where he wrote he was " happy to be in your country to talk about the future " in a guest book , sarkozy will travel on to senegal , south africa and congo .

five years later , it is globally stretched by two .
military experts are now rethinking the strategy . plans adopted by the united states in 2002 to transform its military into a leaner , more cost-effective force , which would mean significant troop withdrawals from europe , are being reviewed in the light of the on-going conflicts in iraq and afghanistan , and the ever-changing geo-political climate around the world .
experts at the us defense department were studying whether the plans to cut troops on the continent by nearly half , formulated by former us defense secretary donald rumsfeld , were still relevant to today ’ s global challenges , according to an unnamed pentagon source quoted in reports from the associated press monday .
rumsfeld 's plan to reduce troop numbers from 68,000 in 2001 to 28,000 by 2012 was conceived before the united states embarked on the invasion of iraq in 2003 .
defense analysts are now concerned that the plan is outdated , given america 's involvement in two theaters of war , the worsening relations with russia and iran and a recent plan to extend the size and range of the us army .

as some troop reductions have already taken place and the turnover in deployments to afghanistan , iraq and other " operation enduring freedom " missions increases , us forces in europe have had to postpone , and in some cases cancel , training with armies in european " partner nations . "
that has made it difficult for us military planners to pursue a more active strategy with nations such as poland , the czech republic and former soviet states , and potentially prevent disputes before they occur .
" we have very little capacity left for these ongoing -lrb- operations -rrb- , " said craddock during a congressional hearing concerning his report , referring to european missions .
" our ability to do that now is limited because we do n't have the forces available since they are in the rotation to -lrb- iraq or afghanistan -rrb- . "
an estimated 75 percent of the us military in europe is either deployed to afghanistan or iraq , is about to go , or just returned , according to the defense officials .

sites in darmstadt and hanau would also be closed in 2009 , it revealed .
the closure of the five bases would affect 2,372 soldiers , nine airmen , 799 us civilians and 679 local workers .

another problem which craddock revealed in his report relates to the closure of bases in europe , particularly in germany , in regard to returning or wounded soldiers coming out of war zones .
the reduction of barracks and services in europe means that returning us military personnel are now being flown directly to the united states , and in such numbers that it is putting strain on bases in the us which have also been downsized under the rumsfeld-approved base realignment and closure act .

five years later , it is globally stretched by two .
military experts are now rethinking the strategy . plans adopted by the united states in 2002 to transform its military into a leaner , more cost-effective force , which would mean significant troop withdrawals from europe , are being reviewed in the light of the on-going conflicts in iraq and afghanistan , and the ever-changing geo-political climate around the world .
experts at the us defense department were studying whether the plans to cut troops on the continent by nearly half , formulated by former us defense secretary donald rumsfeld , were still relevant to today ’ s global challenges , according to an unnamed pentagon source quoted in reports from the associated press monday .
rumsfeld 's plan to reduce troop numbers from 68,000 in 2001 to 28,000 by 2012 was conceived before the united states embarked on the invasion of iraq in 2003 .
defense analysts are now concerned that the plan is outdated , given america 's involvement in two theaters of war , the worsening relations with russia and iran and a recent plan to extend the size and range of the us army .
the source claimed that defense secretary robert gates and the joint chiefs of staff are considering recommendations for a review made in june by gen. bantz craddock , who took over as head of the us european command -lrb- eucom -rrb- last year .
european command chief recommends review bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : craddock -lrb- r . -rrb- believes the 2002 plan is outdated craddock 's report questioned the troop reduction plan and highlighted incidents that hinted at a compromising of us military effectiveness in europe .
as some troop reductions have already taken place and the turnover in deployments to afghanistan , iraq and other " operation enduring freedom " missions increases , us forces in europe have had to postpone , and in some cases cancel , training with armies in european " partner nations . "
that has made it difficult for us military planners to pursue a more active strategy with nations such as poland , the czech republic and former soviet states , and potentially prevent disputes before they occur .
" we have very little capacity left for these ongoing -lrb- operations -rrb- , " said craddock during a congressional hearing concerning his report , referring to european missions .
" our ability to do that now is limited because we do n't have the forces available since they are in the rotation to -lrb- iraq or afghanistan -rrb- . "
an estimated 75 percent of the us military in europe is either deployed to afghanistan or iraq , is about to go , or just returned , according to the defense officials .
us unable to fulfill european commitments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eucom has had to pull out of joint exercises the claims of a review of the troop reduction plan comes just two weeks after the us announced it had emptied the ramstein air base in southwestern germany of nuclear weapons and that it would close five more us military sites in germany by 2009 .
the defense department revealed earlier in july that turley barracks in mannheim , scheduled for closure at the end of september this year , would be followed by us army europe facilities in büdingen and gelnhausen in 2008 .
sites in darmstadt and hanau would also be closed in 2009 , it revealed .
the closure of the five bases would affect 2,372 soldiers , nine airmen , 799 us civilians and 679 local workers .
the announcement was part of the long-term plan to close a total of 51 bases in germany and other areas of western and northern europe .

sarkozy 's wife , cecilia , and his top aide , claude gueant , helped negotiate the liberation of the five bulgarian nurses and a palestinian doctor who received bulgarian citizenship .
the six had been sentenced to death for allegedly infecting more than 400 libyan children with aids .
the anti-nuclear group sortir du nucleaire has charged that sarkozy helped liberate the nurses by promising to help build up libya 's nuclear energy program .
two nuclear deals signed " sarkozy seems already to have forgotten that gadhafi is a dictator , " the group said in a press statement .
" to deliver atomic energy technology to libya means helping the country build nuclear weapons . "
the two countries signed a memorandum of understanding on the construction of a libyan nuclear reactor for water desalination , said gueant , who accompanied sarkozy on the trip . gueant added that " there is still much work to do " on the feasibility study of the desalination project . a second agreement , outlining a framework for civilian nuclear energy cooperation was also signed at the end of the talks between kadhafi and sarkozy by libyan foreign minister abdel rahman shalgham and his french counterpart , bernard kouchner , officials said . sarkozy in search of energy deals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy was looking to strike deals with gadhafi in addition to strengthening ties between the oil exporting nation and the west by making libya part of the mediterranean union sarkozy is trying to establish , the french president had hoped to land big contracts for the french nuclear energy company areva and petroleum giant total .
before sarkozy landed in libya on wednesday , presidential spokesman david martinon confirmed this on french television : " what we are going to talk about is wide-ranging cooperation , in all fields .
" we can do a lot more and a lot better with libya , and that is why the head of state is traveling there , " he added .
the presidential airbus landed at mitiga military airport on wednesday afternoon and sarkozy and kouchner headed straight to the bab azizia palace for an official welcoming ceremony and then to the signing of the cooperation agreements .
the french entourage was to attend a dinner hosted by libyan leader gadhafi at bab azizia , a sprawling complex outside tripoli .
following his visit to libya , where he wrote he was " happy to be in your country to talk about the future " in a guest book , sarkozy will travel on to senegal , south africa and congo .
libya expected to become trading partner du jour bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : libya 's oilfields are of particular interest to western partners analysts believe the resources-rich north african country could now become a key trading partner for france and other western states after the negotiations which saw the bulgarian nurses released .
according to a libyan government official , new deals could cover the areas of security , energy , education , immigration , health and scientific research .
franco-libyan relations have been steadily improving since a 2004 accord on a libyan compensation deal for the victims of a french dc-10 airliner bombing over niger , which killed 170 people , including 54 french nationals , in 1989 .
the upturn paved the way for a visit by sarkozy 's predecessor jacques chirac in november 2004 .
the two countries resumed defense cooperation in february 2005 and struck an accord on civilian nuclear research in march 2006 .
french aerospace manufacturer dassault has also struck an agreement to service 12 french-bought mirage f1 jets - although it denies persistent rumors of negotiations on a libyan purchase of its rafale fighter .
french exports to the country jumped 43.4 percent in 2006 to reach 433.6 million euros -lrb- $ 600 million -rrb- - although it imported 1.9 billion euros worth of goods - almost all oil - from libya over the same period . article based on new reports -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

and things could get worse .
with sinkewitz set to find out if the b sample of his june 8 drug test matches the a sample that showed abnormal levels of testosterone , german cycling is bracing for another high-profile doping confession to add to the many others which have brought the sport into the spotlight for all the wrong reasons this year .
sinkewitz 's b sample is expected to be tested next tuesday and the bdr was keen to talk to the cyclist .
" of course , we want to talk through the situation with patrik , " bdr president rudolf scharping - germany 's former minister of defense - told german sports news agency sid .
germany 's biggest team under threat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the t-mobile confessions rocked the cycling world t-mobile have suspended sinkewitz pending the results of his second sample , and the team - as well as the sport in general - is reeling from a series of recent blows .
earlier this year , seven former telekom -lrb- t-mobile 's previous name -rrb- riders , including now disgraced 1996 tour de france winner bjarne riis and sprinter erik zabel , confessed to using banned blood-booster erythropoietin -lrb- epo -rrb- .
german cycling legend jan ullrich was also embroiled in a doping scandal , though no charges have been brought against him .
the future hangs in the balance for germany ’ s biggest cycling team as the german mobile operators who sponsor the team are set to make an announcement after the current tour ends on sunday as to whether they will continue to fund t-mobile .
if the sponsors choose to leave the sport it will be a devastating blow to cycling in germany , which has watched as german television channels ard and zdf largely cancelled their coverage of this year 's tour after sinkewitz 's failed test .
german sportswear giant adidas has said it is also considering pulling out of their partnership agreement with t-mobile and the german cycling team in protest .
klöden suffers as team pulls out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vinokourov 's first blood sample came out positive doping , meanwhile , has ended the tour for another german rider , albeit because of a teammate 's usage .
andreas klöden was fifth in the tour ’ s overall standings when alexandre vinokourov of kazakhstan tested positive in the a sample for a homologous blood transfusion .
the results suggest vinokourov underwent a blood transfusion shortly before the start of the stage .
" alexandre vinokourov was tested positive for a blood transfusion and the team is leaving the tour , " astana spokeswoman corinne druey said on tuesday .
using this technique , blood is withdrawn from an athlete before a competition , and then is injected into his body again when he needs an extra boost .
this can also be done with another person 's blood .

and things could get worse .
with sinkewitz set to find out if the b sample of his june 8 drug test matches the a sample that showed abnormal levels of testosterone , german cycling is bracing for another high-profile doping confession to add to the many others which have brought the sport into the spotlight for all the wrong reasons this year .
sinkewitz 's b sample is expected to be tested next tuesday and the bdr was keen to talk to the cyclist .
" of course , we want to talk through the situation with patrik , " bdr president rudolf scharping - germany 's former minister of defense - told german sports news agency sid .
germany 's biggest team under threat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the t-mobile confessions rocked the cycling world t-mobile have suspended sinkewitz pending the results of his second sample , and the team - as well as the sport in general - is reeling from a series of recent blows .
earlier this year , seven former telekom -lrb- t-mobile 's previous name -rrb- riders , including now disgraced 1996 tour de france winner bjarne riis and sprinter erik zabel , confessed to using banned blood-booster erythropoietin -lrb- epo -rrb- .
german cycling legend jan ullrich was also embroiled in a doping scandal , though no charges have been brought against him .
the future hangs in the balance for germany ’ s biggest cycling team as the german mobile operators who sponsor the team are set to make an announcement after the current tour ends on sunday as to whether they will continue to fund t-mobile .
if the sponsors choose to leave the sport it will be a devastating blow to cycling in germany , which has watched as german television channels ard and zdf largely cancelled their coverage of this year 's tour after sinkewitz 's failed test .
german sportswear giant adidas has said it is also considering pulling out of their partnership agreement with t-mobile and the german cycling team in protest .
klöden suffers as team pulls out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vinokourov 's first blood sample came out positive doping , meanwhile , has ended the tour for another german rider , albeit because of a teammate 's usage .
andreas klöden was fifth in the tour ’ s overall standings when alexandre vinokourov of kazakhstan tested positive in the a sample for a homologous blood transfusion .
the results suggest vinokourov underwent a blood transfusion shortly before the start of the stage .
" alexandre vinokourov was tested positive for a blood transfusion and the team is leaving the tour , " astana spokeswoman corinne druey said on tuesday .
using this technique , blood is withdrawn from an athlete before a competition , and then is injected into his body again when he needs an extra boost .
this can also be done with another person 's blood .

and things could get worse .
with sinkewitz set to find out if the b sample of his june 8 drug test matches the a sample that showed abnormal levels of testosterone , german cycling is bracing for another high-profile doping confession to add to the many others which have brought the sport into the spotlight for all the wrong reasons this year .
sinkewitz 's b sample is expected to be tested next tuesday and the bdr was keen to talk to the cyclist .
" of course , we want to talk through the situation with patrik , " bdr president rudolf scharping - germany 's former minister of defense - told german sports news agency sid .
germany 's biggest team under threat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the t-mobile confessions rocked the cycling world t-mobile have suspended sinkewitz pending the results of his second sample , and the team - as well as the sport in general - is reeling from a series of recent blows .
earlier this year , seven former telekom -lrb- t-mobile 's previous name -rrb- riders , including now disgraced 1996 tour de france winner bjarne riis and sprinter erik zabel , confessed to using banned blood-booster erythropoietin -lrb- epo -rrb- .
german cycling legend jan ullrich was also embroiled in a doping scandal , though no charges have been brought against him .
the future hangs in the balance for germany ’ s biggest cycling team as the german mobile operators who sponsor the team are set to make an announcement after the current tour ends on sunday as to whether they will continue to fund t-mobile .
if the sponsors choose to leave the sport it will be a devastating blow to cycling in germany , which has watched as german television channels ard and zdf largely cancelled their coverage of this year 's tour after sinkewitz 's failed test .
german sportswear giant adidas has said it is also considering pulling out of their partnership agreement with t-mobile and the german cycling team in protest .
klöden suffers as team pulls out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vinokourov 's first blood sample came out positive doping , meanwhile , has ended the tour for another german rider , albeit because of a teammate 's usage .
andreas klöden was fifth in the tour ’ s overall standings when alexandre vinokourov of kazakhstan tested positive in the a sample for a homologous blood transfusion .
the results suggest vinokourov underwent a blood transfusion shortly before the start of the stage .
" alexandre vinokourov was tested positive for a blood transfusion and the team is leaving the tour , " astana spokeswoman corinne druey said on tuesday .
using this technique , blood is withdrawn from an athlete before a competition , and then is injected into his body again when he needs an extra boost .
this can also be done with another person 's blood .
based on the analysis of the french anti-doping laboratory at chatenay-malabry , vinokourov apparently used the blood of a compatible donor as two types of blood cells were found in his sample , france 's sports daily l 'equipe reported on its web site tuesday .
if the positive test is confirmed by the so-called b sample , vinokourov - widely considered a favorite to win the tour before the race started - faces a ban from the sport of at least two years .
after the revelations , the swiss-based astana team announced it was pulling all its riders , including klöden , out of the tour . article based on news reports -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

sarkozy 's wife , cecilia , and his top aide , claude gueant , helped negotiate the liberation of the five bulgarian nurses and a palestinian doctor who received bulgarian citizenship .
the six had been sentenced to death for allegedly infecting more than 400 libyan children with aids .
the anti-nuclear group sortir du nucleaire has charged that sarkozy helped liberate the nurses by promising to help build up libya 's nuclear energy program .
two nuclear deals signed " sarkozy seems already to have forgotten that gadhafi is a dictator , " the group said in a press statement .
" to deliver atomic energy technology to libya means helping the country build nuclear weapons . "
the two countries signed a memorandum of understanding on the construction of a libyan nuclear reactor for water desalination , said gueant , who accompanied sarkozy on the trip . gueant added that " there is still much work to do " on the feasibility study of the desalination project . a second agreement , outlining a framework for civilian nuclear energy cooperation was also signed at the end of the talks between kadhafi and sarkozy by libyan foreign minister abdel rahman shalgham and his french counterpart , bernard kouchner , officials said . sarkozy in search of energy deals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy was looking to strike deals with gadhafi in addition to strengthening ties between the oil exporting nation and the west by making libya part of the mediterranean union sarkozy is trying to establish , the french president had hoped to land big contracts for the french nuclear energy company areva and petroleum giant total .
before sarkozy landed in libya on wednesday , presidential spokesman david martinon confirmed this on french television : " what we are going to talk about is wide-ranging cooperation , in all fields .
" we can do a lot more and a lot better with libya , and that is why the head of state is traveling there , " he added .
the presidential airbus landed at mitiga military airport on wednesday afternoon and sarkozy and kouchner headed straight to the bab azizia palace for an official welcoming ceremony and then to the signing of the cooperation agreements .
the french entourage was to attend a dinner hosted by libyan leader gadhafi at bab azizia , a sprawling complex outside tripoli .

according to a libyan government official , new deals could cover the areas of security , energy , education , immigration , health and scientific research .
franco-libyan relations have been steadily improving since a 2004 accord on a libyan compensation deal for the victims of a french dc-10 airliner bombing over niger , which killed 170 people , including 54 french nationals , in 1989 .

french aerospace manufacturer dassault has also struck an agreement to service 12 french-bought mirage f1 jets - although it denies persistent rumors of negotiations on a libyan purchase of its rafale fighter .

meeting at the german embassy in vienna , officials from the us , russia , germany , france , britain and italy attempted to overcome the us-russian deadlock over the un plan to grant kosovo internationally monitored independence and to find a new format for talks .
eu foreign ministers had decided monday to limit new talks to 120 days and hold them within a smaller format to make them more effective .
germany suggested a troika of the eu , russia and us to lead the negotiations .
in a surprise move , russia agreed on the troika format suggested by german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier at the eu foreign ministers ' meeting on monday . moscow has previously said it is against moving kosovo negotiations away from the un security council , where it , along with the four other permanent council members , has the ability to veto any resolution tabled , and president vladimir putin on tuesday had again rejected talks on kosovo 's independence , fearing this could create a precedent for secession in other regions . ahtisaari steps down empty-handed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahtisaari leaves with his plan blowing in the wind meanwhile , the un 's special envoy to kosovo , martti ahtisaari , said wednesday he regarded his mission as over , saying , " my work is done . "
the 70-year-old former finnish president and career diplomat had previously said he would not prolong his engagement if either kosovo or serbia blocked the process towards determining the break-away province ’ s status .
ahtisaari has said neither the un nor the contact group had asked him to continue mediations in the face of russia 's persistent refusal to support independence for the serbian province .
he has , however , said he would be willing to take on " a role as consultant " if requested .
ahtisaari ’ s mediating efforts had been repeatedly criticized by serbia and russia as being partial towards the kosovo side .
in january , after a year of talks between serbia and kosovar albanians , he presented a proposal granting internationally monitored independence to the province .
this was rejected by moscow and belgrade .
continuing this stalemate , russian foreign minister sergei lavrov had said on tuesday that ahtisaari 's roadmap was no basis for new talks .
for the us , however , the un plan is not negotiable .
the southern serbian province had been under un administration since nato forced serbian troops to withdraw .
serbia cranks up rhetoric over unilateral independence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " self governance " is the priority for kosovans kosovo 's ethnic albanian majority , frustrated by setbacks and delays , will accept nothing short of full independence .
belgrade is only ready to grant far-reaching autonomy , fearing kosovo 's serb minority will be endangered in case of independence .
a unilateral declaration of independence by the province 's leadership could lead to a further destabilization of the region , diplomats fear .
while the us indicated it may recognize the country , secretary of state condoleezza rice also warned kosovo 's leaders not to short-circuit diplomatic efforts .
kosovo 's political leaders have issued contradictory statements as to whether the province would unilaterally declare independence .
" i think , given where we are in the diplomacy , it 's unlikely that we will get full agreement , " us state department spokesman sean mccormack told reporters in washington .
" but it is our belief - and the shared belief of many - that , in the absence of that end point , independence for kosovo , that you are actually going to see an outbreak of further violence in the region , which is n't good for anybody . "
fearing that kosovo would push forward alone as the stalemate continued , the parliament of serbia overwhelmingly voted late on tuesday to back the government 's resolution to reject any move to grant independence .
the resolution says the government will " respond promptly and energetically " to any indication of unilateral recognition of an independent kosovo , but the draft gives no details on measures the government should take .
" serbia will reject any attempt by -lrb- kosovo -rrb- albanians to unilaterally proclaim independence , " serbian prime minister vojislav kostunica said , adding that " any state that wants normal and friendly relations with serbia must respect the un charter , which guarantees that the internationally recognized borders can not be altered . "
however , aleksandar vucic of the hard-line nationalist serbian radical party accused the government of being " too meek " and demanded a break of diplomatic relations with any state recognizing an independent kosovo .
his party leader tomislav nikolic called on the government to give up its plans for serbia to join the european union and nato and " use all available means to defend our kosovo . "
un governor warns of increasing frustration bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rücker warned that kosovars are reaching their limit elsewhere , the un governor in kosovo , joachim rücker , returned to pristina after meeting with the eu foreign ministers this week and admitted that he had issued the europeans with a warning over further delaying a decision the people of kosovo had been led to expect by last october .
" i stressed that there is a lot of anxiety and tension and people need and deserve clarity on status and also on the status process , " rücker told reporters .
he called on the major powers to set a clear roadmap to the final status of kosovo and end the increasingly frustrating wait for those who had lived under un rule for eight years .
" it will be very helpful if we would have something like roadmap or timetable on the way forward , something more than just an announcement of the time of engagement , " rücker added . article based on news reports -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but dw 's jefferson chase thinks that 's inevitable because of the way the sport itself works . it was hard not to feel just a tiny bit sorry for the organizers of the tour de france when the news broke that alexander vinokourov had flunked a doping test .
the last thing the already embattled event needed was for another top cyclist to be caught out in what was , if the test results are confirmed , a brazen attempt at cheating . the public outcry after vinokourov and team astana 's sorry departure from the tour was predictable .
so , too , was the organizers ' attempt to put a positive spin on the scandal by claiming that it proved the effectiveness of anti-doping tests . the incident , however , also broached an issue that an increasing number of hardcore cycling fans have raised during the course of this particularly ill-fated tour .
is it not unfair of the media to pillory cycling while remaining more-or-less silent about comparable abuses in other sports ? indeed , there is a certain measure of hypocrisy here .
no one would seriously contend that soccer , tennis or even golf is free from athletes using banned performance-enhancing substances or techniques .
the line between cheating and gaining a competitive advantage in pursuit of that all-important goal , victory , is at best blurry . nonetheless , because of the nature of cycling itself , doping presents a particular threat to the athletes ' and the sport 's credibility . cycling - and especially its premier event , the tour de france - is not a game of hand-to-eye coordination .
it is a contest of perseverance without any nifty one-two combinations , breathtaking goals or diving saves . the appeal of cycling depends on the ideal of the lone rider overcoming the constraints of the human body .
the drama of a race - for instance , the point at which the eventual winner pedals away from the pack - resides in spectators being able to imagine that he is breaking through his own personal pain barrier and summoning up previously unknown reserves of strength and determination . that illusion is completely dispelled when the audience assumes that the decisive surge is just the epo kicking in . it 's an unavoidable fact that doping provides more of a competitive advantage in cycling than it does in many other sports .
a transfusion of oxygen-enriched blood , for instance , might give a soccer or tennis player extra energy for a 15-minute overtime period or a long fifth set .
but in the absence of individual skill , it would n't help them flick a lob over the keeper 's head or paint the baseline at match point . in cycling , as disgraced tour de france winner floyd landis seems to have shown last year , hormones alone can turn the tide .
when doping is introduced into the sporting equation , cycling appears more and more like a contest between medical teams - and who wants to watch a bunch of physicians battling it out ? the effectiveness of doping in cycling also makes it more difficult to eradicate , and the sport is set to pay heavily for this inherent shortcoming .
major sponsors like t-mobile are likely to scale back or discontinue their sponsorship of teams , and tv stations will certainly think twice about shelling out major cash for the broadcast rights to next year 's tour de france . and that may be the only silver lining in the very dark cloud that hangs over cycling at the moment .

but dw 's jefferson chase thinks that 's inevitable because of the way the sport itself works . it was hard not to feel just a tiny bit sorry for the organizers of the tour de france when the news broke that alexander vinokourov had flunked a doping test .
the last thing the already embattled event needed was for another top cyclist to be caught out in what was , if the test results are confirmed , a brazen attempt at cheating . the public outcry after vinokourov and team astana 's sorry departure from the tour was predictable .
so , too , was the organizers ' attempt to put a positive spin on the scandal by claiming that it proved the effectiveness of anti-doping tests . the incident , however , also broached an issue that an increasing number of hardcore cycling fans have raised during the course of this particularly ill-fated tour .
is it not unfair of the media to pillory cycling while remaining more-or-less silent about comparable abuses in other sports ? indeed , there is a certain measure of hypocrisy here .
no one would seriously contend that soccer , tennis or even golf is free from athletes using banned performance-enhancing substances or techniques .
the line between cheating and gaining a competitive advantage in pursuit of that all-important goal , victory , is at best blurry . nonetheless , because of the nature of cycling itself , doping presents a particular threat to the athletes ' and the sport 's credibility . cycling - and especially its premier event , the tour de france - is not a game of hand-to-eye coordination .
it is a contest of perseverance without any nifty one-two combinations , breathtaking goals or diving saves . the appeal of cycling depends on the ideal of the lone rider overcoming the constraints of the human body .
the drama of a race - for instance , the point at which the eventual winner pedals away from the pack - resides in spectators being able to imagine that he is breaking through his own personal pain barrier and summoning up previously unknown reserves of strength and determination . that illusion is completely dispelled when the audience assumes that the decisive surge is just the epo kicking in . it 's an unavoidable fact that doping provides more of a competitive advantage in cycling than it does in many other sports .
a transfusion of oxygen-enriched blood , for instance , might give a soccer or tennis player extra energy for a 15-minute overtime period or a long fifth set .
but in the absence of individual skill , it would n't help them flick a lob over the keeper 's head or paint the baseline at match point . in cycling , as disgraced tour de france winner floyd landis seems to have shown last year , hormones alone can turn the tide .
when doping is introduced into the sporting equation , cycling appears more and more like a contest between medical teams - and who wants to watch a bunch of physicians battling it out ? the effectiveness of doping in cycling also makes it more difficult to eradicate , and the sport is set to pay heavily for this inherent shortcoming .
major sponsors like t-mobile are likely to scale back or discontinue their sponsorship of teams , and tv stations will certainly think twice about shelling out major cash for the broadcast rights to next year 's tour de france . and that may be the only silver lining in the very dark cloud that hangs over cycling at the moment .
perhaps with less money and publicity in play , athletes and teams will be less willing to risk their reputations for 15 minutes of dubious fame . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

meeting at the german embassy in vienna , officials from the us , russia , germany , france , britain and italy attempted to overcome the us-russian deadlock over the un plan to grant kosovo internationally monitored independence and to find a new format for talks .
eu foreign ministers had decided monday to limit new talks to 120 days and hold them within a smaller format to make them more effective .
germany suggested a troika of the eu , russia and us to lead the negotiations .
in a surprise move , russia agreed on the troika format suggested by german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier at the eu foreign ministers ' meeting on monday . moscow has previously said it is against moving kosovo negotiations away from the un security council , where it , along with the four other permanent council members , has the ability to veto any resolution tabled , and president vladimir putin on tuesday had again rejected talks on kosovo 's independence , fearing this could create a precedent for secession in other regions . ahtisaari steps down empty-handed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahtisaari leaves with his plan blowing in the wind meanwhile , the un 's special envoy to kosovo , martti ahtisaari , said wednesday he regarded his mission as over , saying , " my work is done . "
the 70-year-old former finnish president and career diplomat had previously said he would not prolong his engagement if either kosovo or serbia blocked the process towards determining the break-away province ’ s status .
ahtisaari has said neither the un nor the contact group had asked him to continue mediations in the face of russia 's persistent refusal to support independence for the serbian province .
he has , however , said he would be willing to take on " a role as consultant " if requested .
ahtisaari ’ s mediating efforts had been repeatedly criticized by serbia and russia as being partial towards the kosovo side .
in january , after a year of talks between serbia and kosovar albanians , he presented a proposal granting internationally monitored independence to the province .
this was rejected by moscow and belgrade .
continuing this stalemate , russian foreign minister sergei lavrov had said on tuesday that ahtisaari 's roadmap was no basis for new talks .
for the us , however , the un plan is not negotiable .
the southern serbian province had been under un administration since nato forced serbian troops to withdraw .
serbia cranks up rhetoric over unilateral independence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " self governance " is the priority for kosovans kosovo 's ethnic albanian majority , frustrated by setbacks and delays , will accept nothing short of full independence .
belgrade is only ready to grant far-reaching autonomy , fearing kosovo 's serb minority will be endangered in case of independence .
a unilateral declaration of independence by the province 's leadership could lead to a further destabilization of the region , diplomats fear .
while the us indicated it may recognize the country , secretary of state condoleezza rice also warned kosovo 's leaders not to short-circuit diplomatic efforts .
kosovo 's political leaders have issued contradictory statements as to whether the province would unilaterally declare independence .
" i think , given where we are in the diplomacy , it 's unlikely that we will get full agreement , " us state department spokesman sean mccormack told reporters in washington .
" but it is our belief - and the shared belief of many - that , in the absence of that end point , independence for kosovo , that you are actually going to see an outbreak of further violence in the region , which is n't good for anybody . "
fearing that kosovo would push forward alone as the stalemate continued , the parliament of serbia overwhelmingly voted late on tuesday to back the government 's resolution to reject any move to grant independence .
the resolution says the government will " respond promptly and energetically " to any indication of unilateral recognition of an independent kosovo , but the draft gives no details on measures the government should take .
" serbia will reject any attempt by -lrb- kosovo -rrb- albanians to unilaterally proclaim independence , " serbian prime minister vojislav kostunica said , adding that " any state that wants normal and friendly relations with serbia must respect the un charter , which guarantees that the internationally recognized borders can not be altered . "
however , aleksandar vucic of the hard-line nationalist serbian radical party accused the government of being " too meek " and demanded a break of diplomatic relations with any state recognizing an independent kosovo .
his party leader tomislav nikolic called on the government to give up its plans for serbia to join the european union and nato and " use all available means to defend our kosovo . "
un governor warns of increasing frustration bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rücker warned that kosovars are reaching their limit elsewhere , the un governor in kosovo , joachim rücker , returned to pristina after meeting with the eu foreign ministers this week and admitted that he had issued the europeans with a warning over further delaying a decision the people of kosovo had been led to expect by last october .
" i stressed that there is a lot of anxiety and tension and people need and deserve clarity on status and also on the status process , " rücker told reporters .
he called on the major powers to set a clear roadmap to the final status of kosovo and end the increasingly frustrating wait for those who had lived under un rule for eight years .

the six went home tuesday after eight years in jail . as they hugged their celebrating family members , the slender silhouette of cecilia sarkozy appeared on the plane 's stairs , " rome 's la repubblica daily wrote .
" she is certainly the heroine of this release … along with her husband nicolas and the grey eminence claude gueant , secretary general of elysee palace .
despite the criticism from … the left-wing opposition , the matter is a triumph for the sarkozys , the baptism of ' couple diplomacy ' that never existed before : yesterday cecilia brought the nurses home and at the same time emphasized the humanitarian aspect of her role .
today nicolas travels to tripoli to meet -lsb- libyan leader -rsb- gadhafi and to lend the agreement a political dimension . "
but others were n't quite so happy with with sarkozy 's behavior .
" madame sarkozy 's intervention has caused displeasure , " according to de morgen in brussels .
" the european commission can hardly explain itself why , of all people , cecilia sarkozy traveled to libya , and some eu parliamentarians and members of the french opposition find it outrageous that the sarkozys want to ' take the credit ' for the release , while the eu has been lobbying for years for the unfortunate six . "
" ' super sarko ' layed it on too thick after the happy resolution of the drama , too artlessly did he take the credit that actually belongs to others , " wrote germany 's nürnberger zeitung daily .
for , it was the diplomats of the eu , britain 's former prime minister tony blair and germany 's foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , who over the years doggedly negotiated with the libyan leader behind the scenes .
worse still : sarkozy artlessly used the touchy affair to help his capricious spouse with her personal search for meaningful activities .
with that he demoted complicated foreign policy to a sort of therapy for couples .
not everyone is enthusiastic about cecilia sarkozy 's charm offensive as a humanitarian ambassador on the political frontline . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the medics flew back to bulgaria in a french presidential jet " we ca n't exactly understand why cecilia sarkozy travelled to tripoli twice within a two-week period - even if she was , like many , outraged and concerned about the fate of the nurses , " commented french catholic daily la croix shortly before the medics were flown out of libya .
" we can only hope that the idea was not to take advantage of the media attention the release would attract .
the eu 's diplomats , who have been negotiating with libya for years , would hardly be able to appreciate the french activism in the moment of the release .
is it really the french first lady 's job to get involved in a very touchy and complicated case in which much has been unsaid … and in which there are possibly secret negotiations for the french armaments industry ? "
" it is a real success for the -lsb- european union 's -rsb- common foreign policy and one that was earned only by years of gruelling effort and negotiation , " wrote the financial times in london .
" bulgaria on its own could never have done what was achieved by the eu as a whole .
that said , it comes as no surprise to see cecilia sarkozy , wife of nicolas sarkozy , the french president , appearing in libya just before the prisoners ' release . … while france has , along with the uk and germany , contributed to the complex deal that secured the bulgarians ' freedom , it would not be the first time that one eu power has tried to hog the limelight and take the credit for a shared success .
this behavior is self-centered but political ego is one of the many motors driving the eu .

" she is certainly the heroine of this release … along with her husband nicolas and the grey eminence claude gueant , secretary general of elysee palace .
despite the criticism from … the left-wing opposition , the matter is a triumph for the sarkozys , the baptism of ' couple diplomacy ' that never existed before : yesterday cecilia brought the nurses home and at the same time emphasized the humanitarian aspect of her role .

up to 500 hungarians and 30 romanians have died from the heat . across central and western england , high waters have flooded at least 4,500 homes , threatened many more and left cars submerged . crop-harvesting has been delayed and milk production has dropped , triggering fears of possible food shortages . flood waters have begun receding in the worst hit areas of england , but the environment agency still has six severe flood warnings in effect . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flooded crops could cause food shortage in england renewed rain forecasts for later in the week have people bracing themselves for more trouble . britain has been wrestling with the worst floods in 60 years , with emergency services having evacuated people from hundreds of homes in the the university city of oxford as the river thames broke its banks . people have had to shelter in oxford 's soccer stadium . authorities said that in gloucestershire , the western english county worst hit by the deluge , up to 350,000 people could be without running water for the next two weeks . the army has meanwhile been called in to distribute millions of bottles of water as eager families lined up for supplies and loaded them onto supermarket carts . close call bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an electricity sub-station under water near tewkesbury one power distribution station at walham was nearly flooded while emergency workers frantically tried to shore it up as water came within six inches of breaching defenses . that would have left up to 500,000 people without electricity and plunged hospitals , shops and homes into chaos . high waters transformed the historic market town of tewkesbury into an island . lifeboats were seen floating down the town 's main street . britain 's environment secretary hilary benn has warned that the crisis is not over , and said that it already caused " considerable human distress . " in tewkesbury , one teenage boy is still missing , one man died in a flooded cellar and a woman trapped in the floods lost her premature newborn twins despite being airlifted out .

the fire forced people to flee from campsites and hotels . tourists had to be rescued via patrol boats and helicopters . authorities said at least two people were caught in the fires and burned alive in their car , while another pair on a beach suffocated . the heat wave is reminiscent of that in france in 2003 , when scorching temperatures led to the early deaths of up to 15,000 mainly elderly people . the effects of climate change ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a zest for cooling off in italy forests in bosnia , serbia , montenegro , macedonia , bulgaria and greece have also been ravaged by fires this week , blamed on record-high temperatures following a dry winter . temperatures in macedonia have reached an all-time record high of 45 degrees , with many parts of the country without power as high consumption , likely from the use of air-conditioning units , overloaded transmission lines , officials said . authorities in the balkans warned people to stay indoors to avoid the extreme heat . the extreme weather has prompted debate about whether the effects of global warming are at hand .

on monday , much to the ire of beijing , he made critical remarks about china .
dw took part in a group interview with him . dw : your holiness , please tell us about the human rights situation in tibet . dalai lama : it 's still very serious .
about a month ago i met a tibetan who spent eight years in a chinese prison .
his only crime , which took place in a village near lhasa , was to express his own feelings . china reacted harshly when you spoke about the issue of tibet in hamburg .
did that surprise you ? not at all .
even i live in silence .
there 's always some sort of condemnation .
they just keep going on like that . what do you think of the german government 's stance toward tibet ?
do you think berlin does enough for your cause ? the german government is like other governments - basically sympathetic .
certainly there 's a sense of concern .
the question is whether that 's adequate .
we appreciate expressions of concern from the outside world .
that 's necessary and helpful . what are your goals when you visit other countries ? my main purpose and motivation is not the issue of tibet , but rather the promotion of human values in order to have happier individuals , families and communities - and , in that way , a happier humanity .
i consider that to be my contribution .
i think every human being has a responsibility to better the world .
that 's my conviction , and i always try to promote that .
my second goal is the promotion of religious harmony .
when i teach in india , more and more chinese come .
sometimes , the chinese government puts up restrictions to prevent chinese from coming to india .
but despite that , some chinese always come .
many of them say that , after seeing the tibetan community , they found big difference s to what they had heard in china .
eventually there 's some positive impact . bildunterschrift : tens of thousands of buddhists have turned out to hear the dalai lama you have said that you could be the last dalai lama .
could you please explain ? as early as 1969 , i made clear in an official statement that it was up to the tibetan people whether or not the institution of the dalai lama should continue .
that means that if the majority of the tibetan people decide that the old institution of the dalai lama is no longer relevant to the tibetan nation , it will cease to exist .
if i were to die soon , i think most of the tibetan people would want to keep the institution .
if i live on 20 or 30 years , it might be different .
that 's okay .
that would be an end with dignity . do you ever hope to return to tibet ? oh yes .
all tibetans get homesick and hope to see their own country .
me , too .
but at the same time , i 'm a buddhist monk .
so mentally and personally one 's own birthplace is n't all that important .
there 's a tibetan saying : " home is where you feel good , and your parents are anyone who does good things for you . "
-lsb- editors note : the dalai lama said this in tibetan , english translation from news reports . -rsb-
i really enjoy the very positive atmosphere of hamburg .
in the past nine days , i really feel it 's my home .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de united states -pipe- 25.07.2007 us considering rethink of troop withdrawals in europe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : almost 75 percent of us troops in europe are in the iraq-afghanistan deployment cycle when former us secretary of defense rumsfeld issued a plan to reduce troops in europe , the us was fighting one war .
five years later , it is globally stretched by two .
military experts are now rethinking the strategy . plans adopted by the united states in 2002 to transform its military into a leaner , more cost-effective force , which would mean significant troop withdrawals from europe , are being reviewed in the light of the on-going conflicts in iraq and afghanistan , and the ever-changing geo-political climate around the world .
experts at the us defense department were studying whether the plans to cut troops on the continent by nearly half , formulated by former us defense secretary donald rumsfeld , were still relevant to today ’ s global challenges , according to an unnamed pentagon source quoted in reports from the associated press monday .
rumsfeld 's plan to reduce troop numbers from 68,000 in 2001 to 28,000 by 2012 was conceived before the united states embarked on the invasion of iraq in 2003 .
defense analysts are now concerned that the plan is outdated , given america 's involvement in two theaters of war , the worsening relations with russia and iran and a recent plan to extend the size and range of the us army .
the source claimed that defense secretary robert gates and the joint chiefs of staff are considering recommendations for a review made in june by gen. bantz craddock , who took over as head of the us european command -lrb- eucom -rrb- last year .
european command chief recommends review bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : craddock -lrb- r . -rrb- believes the 2002 plan is outdated craddock 's report questioned the troop reduction plan and highlighted incidents that hinted at a compromising of us military effectiveness in europe .
as some troop reductions have already taken place and the turnover in deployments to afghanistan , iraq and other " operation enduring freedom " missions increases , us forces in europe have had to postpone , and in some cases cancel , training with armies in european " partner nations . "
that has made it difficult for us military planners to pursue a more active strategy with nations such as poland , the czech republic and former soviet states , and potentially prevent disputes before they occur .
" we have very little capacity left for these ongoing -lrb- operations -rrb- , " said craddock during a congressional hearing concerning his report , referring to european missions .
" our ability to do that now is limited because we do n't have the forces available since they are in the rotation to -lrb- iraq or afghanistan -rrb- . "
an estimated 75 percent of the us military in europe is either deployed to afghanistan or iraq , is about to go , or just returned , according to the defense officials .
us unable to fulfill european commitments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eucom has had to pull out of joint exercises the claims of a review of the troop reduction plan comes just two weeks after the us announced it had emptied the ramstein air base in southwestern germany of nuclear weapons and that it would close five more us military sites in germany by 2009 .
the defense department revealed earlier in july that turley barracks in mannheim , scheduled for closure at the end of september this year , would be followed by us army europe facilities in büdingen and gelnhausen in 2008 .
sites in darmstadt and hanau would also be closed in 2009 , it revealed .
the closure of the five bases would affect 2,372 soldiers , nine airmen , 799 us civilians and 679 local workers .
the announcement was part of the long-term plan to close a total of 51 bases in germany and other areas of western and northern europe .
possible rethink on closure of german bases bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with fewer european bases , troops are flown directly home while the planned closures in germany related to those bases not involved in leading operations in afghanistan and iraq , if a review of the plan found that the us military presence and involvement in european defense issues was being undermined by troop withdrawals , the removal of german bases may also be reconsidered .
another problem which craddock revealed in his report relates to the closure of bases in europe , particularly in germany , in regard to returning or wounded soldiers coming out of war zones .
the reduction of barracks and services in europe means that returning us military personnel are now being flown directly to the united states , and in such numbers that it is putting strain on bases in the us which have also been downsized under the rumsfeld-approved base realignment and closure act .
at the height of the cold war , the united states had as many as 110,000 troops based in europe . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 25.07.2007 opinion : doping threatens cycling more than other sports großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as the tour de france deals with yet another doping scandal , some hardcore fans say the press unfairly singles out cycling .
but dw 's jefferson chase thinks that 's inevitable because of the way the sport itself works . it was hard not to feel just a tiny bit sorry for the organizers of the tour de france when the news broke that alexander vinokourov had flunked a doping test .
the last thing the already embattled event needed was for another top cyclist to be caught out in what was , if the test results are confirmed , a brazen attempt at cheating . the public outcry after vinokourov and team astana 's sorry departure from the tour was predictable .
so , too , was the organizers ' attempt to put a positive spin on the scandal by claiming that it proved the effectiveness of anti-doping tests . the incident , however , also broached an issue that an increasing number of hardcore cycling fans have raised during the course of this particularly ill-fated tour .
is it not unfair of the media to pillory cycling while remaining more-or-less silent about comparable abuses in other sports ? indeed , there is a certain measure of hypocrisy here .
no one would seriously contend that soccer , tennis or even golf is free from athletes using banned performance-enhancing substances or techniques .
the line between cheating and gaining a competitive advantage in pursuit of that all-important goal , victory , is at best blurry . nonetheless , because of the nature of cycling itself , doping presents a particular threat to the athletes ' and the sport 's credibility . cycling - and especially its premier event , the tour de france - is not a game of hand-to-eye coordination .
it is a contest of perseverance without any nifty one-two combinations , breathtaking goals or diving saves . the appeal of cycling depends on the ideal of the lone rider overcoming the constraints of the human body .
the drama of a race - for instance , the point at which the eventual winner pedals away from the pack - resides in spectators being able to imagine that he is breaking through his own personal pain barrier and summoning up previously unknown reserves of strength and determination . that illusion is completely dispelled when the audience assumes that the decisive surge is just the epo kicking in . it 's an unavoidable fact that doping provides more of a competitive advantage in cycling than it does in many other sports .
a transfusion of oxygen-enriched blood , for instance , might give a soccer or tennis player extra energy for a 15-minute overtime period or a long fifth set .
but in the absence of individual skill , it would n't help them flick a lob over the keeper 's head or paint the baseline at match point . in cycling , as disgraced tour de france winner floyd landis seems to have shown last year , hormones alone can turn the tide .
when doping is introduced into the sporting equation , cycling appears more and more like a contest between medical teams - and who wants to watch a bunch of physicians battling it out ? the effectiveness of doping in cycling also makes it more difficult to eradicate , and the sport is set to pay heavily for this inherent shortcoming .
major sponsors like t-mobile are likely to scale back or discontinue their sponsorship of teams , and tv stations will certainly think twice about shelling out major cash for the broadcast rights to next year 's tour de france . and that may be the only silver lining in the very dark cloud that hangs over cycling at the moment .
perhaps with less money and publicity in play , athletes and teams will be less willing to risk their reputations for 15 minutes of dubious fame . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the deal satisfies germany 's protectionists who warned against selling outside the country . us firm trw had challenged for vdo , but siemens appears to have been swayed by continental 's argument that german technology should not be put into foreign hands .
the fee of 11.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 15.7 billion -rrb- for the subsidiary may have also been a factor in siemens ' decision .
the decision to sell within germany is certain please german politicians who were strongly against vdo going to a foreign firm and have recently floated the idea of placing limits on foreign investment in germany 's " core " business branches .
politicians in favor of continental bid last week , christian wulff , the conservative premier of lower saxony , spoke publicly about his support for continental 's bid for vdo .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wulff publicly advocated continental 's bid for vdo " we want conti and vdo to merge , then there would be a large automotive parts supplier operating throughout the globe out of germany , " wulff told german regional public radio station ndr .
" it would look a lot worse for the employees of the automotive supplier division of siemens if international financial investors got their hands on technology , jobs and production plants here , " wulff added .
foreign interest reignites protectionism debate the situation with vdo reignited the debate within the german government over whether germany needed an industrial policy modeled on the french to protect key industries from the influence of foreign investors .
german economics minister michael glos has said that his department was looking at how other european nations protected their domestic industries , though he added that he did not want germany to be a forerunner when it came to protectionism .
siemens swoops to buy us company bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siemens are ready to divert new funds to the us meanwhile , siemens looked to be directing some of the cash raised by the prospective sale of vdo towards the united states wednesday as it announced it had agreed to pay 5.09 billion euros for dade behring inc . , a clinical laboratory diagnostics company based in deerfield , illinois .
the munich-based giant issued a statement saying it had signed a merger agreement with dade behring to acquire all of its outstanding shares at 56.03 euros apiece .
the deal is subject to regulatory approval but is expected to be completed by the second quarter of fiscal 2008 . article based on news reports -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the deal satisfies germany 's protectionists who warned against selling outside the country . us firm trw had challenged for vdo , but siemens appears to have been swayed by continental 's argument that german technology should not be put into foreign hands .
the fee of 11.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 15.7 billion -rrb- for the subsidiary may have also been a factor in siemens ' decision .
the decision to sell within germany is certain please german politicians who were strongly against vdo going to a foreign firm and have recently floated the idea of placing limits on foreign investment in germany 's " core " business branches .
politicians in favor of continental bid last week , christian wulff , the conservative premier of lower saxony , spoke publicly about his support for continental 's bid for vdo .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wulff publicly advocated continental 's bid for vdo " we want conti and vdo to merge , then there would be a large automotive parts supplier operating throughout the globe out of germany , " wulff told german regional public radio station ndr .
" it would look a lot worse for the employees of the automotive supplier division of siemens if international financial investors got their hands on technology , jobs and production plants here , " wulff added .
foreign interest reignites protectionism debate the situation with vdo reignited the debate within the german government over whether germany needed an industrial policy modeled on the french to protect key industries from the influence of foreign investors .
german economics minister michael glos has said that his department was looking at how other european nations protected their domestic industries , though he added that he did not want germany to be a forerunner when it came to protectionism .
siemens swoops to buy us company bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siemens are ready to divert new funds to the us meanwhile , siemens looked to be directing some of the cash raised by the prospective sale of vdo towards the united states wednesday as it announced it had agreed to pay 5.09 billion euros for dade behring inc . , a clinical laboratory diagnostics company based in deerfield , illinois .
the munich-based giant issued a statement saying it had signed a merger agreement with dade behring to acquire all of its outstanding shares at 56.03 euros apiece .
the deal is subject to regulatory approval but is expected to be completed by the second quarter of fiscal 2008 . article based on news reports -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

meeting at the german embassy in vienna , officials from the us , russia , germany , france , britain and italy attempted to overcome the us-russian deadlock over the un plan to grant kosovo internationally monitored independence and to find a new format for talks .
eu foreign ministers had decided monday to limit new talks to 120 days and hold them within a smaller format to make them more effective .
germany suggested a troika of the eu , russia and us to lead the negotiations .
in a surprise move , russia agreed on the troika format suggested by german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier at the eu foreign ministers ' meeting on monday . moscow has previously said it is against moving kosovo negotiations away from the un security council , where it , along with the four other permanent council members , has the ability to veto any resolution tabled , and president vladimir putin on tuesday had again rejected talks on kosovo 's independence , fearing this could create a precedent for secession in other regions . ahtisaari steps down empty-handed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahtisaari leaves with his plan blowing in the wind meanwhile , the un 's special envoy to kosovo , martti ahtisaari , said wednesday he regarded his mission as over , saying , " my work is done . "
the 70-year-old former finnish president and career diplomat had previously said he would not prolong his engagement if either kosovo or serbia blocked the process towards determining the break-away province ’ s status .
ahtisaari has said neither the un nor the contact group had asked him to continue mediations in the face of russia 's persistent refusal to support independence for the serbian province .
he has , however , said he would be willing to take on " a role as consultant " if requested .
ahtisaari ’ s mediating efforts had been repeatedly criticized by serbia and russia as being partial towards the kosovo side .
in january , after a year of talks between serbia and kosovar albanians , he presented a proposal granting internationally monitored independence to the province .
this was rejected by moscow and belgrade .
continuing this stalemate , russian foreign minister sergei lavrov had said on tuesday that ahtisaari 's roadmap was no basis for new talks .
for the us , however , the un plan is not negotiable .
the southern serbian province had been under un administration since nato forced serbian troops to withdraw .
serbia cranks up rhetoric over unilateral independence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " self governance " is the priority for kosovans kosovo 's ethnic albanian majority , frustrated by setbacks and delays , will accept nothing short of full independence .
belgrade is only ready to grant far-reaching autonomy , fearing kosovo 's serb minority will be endangered in case of independence .
a unilateral declaration of independence by the province 's leadership could lead to a further destabilization of the region , diplomats fear .
while the us indicated it may recognize the country , secretary of state condoleezza rice also warned kosovo 's leaders not to short-circuit diplomatic efforts .
kosovo 's political leaders have issued contradictory statements as to whether the province would unilaterally declare independence .
" i think , given where we are in the diplomacy , it 's unlikely that we will get full agreement , " us state department spokesman sean mccormack told reporters in washington .
" but it is our belief - and the shared belief of many - that , in the absence of that end point , independence for kosovo , that you are actually going to see an outbreak of further violence in the region , which is n't good for anybody . "
fearing that kosovo would push forward alone as the stalemate continued , the parliament of serbia overwhelmingly voted late on tuesday to back the government 's resolution to reject any move to grant independence .
the resolution says the government will " respond promptly and energetically " to any indication of unilateral recognition of an independent kosovo , but the draft gives no details on measures the government should take .
" serbia will reject any attempt by -lrb- kosovo -rrb- albanians to unilaterally proclaim independence , " serbian prime minister vojislav kostunica said , adding that " any state that wants normal and friendly relations with serbia must respect the un charter , which guarantees that the internationally recognized borders can not be altered . "
however , aleksandar vucic of the hard-line nationalist serbian radical party accused the government of being " too meek " and demanded a break of diplomatic relations with any state recognizing an independent kosovo .
his party leader tomislav nikolic called on the government to give up its plans for serbia to join the european union and nato and " use all available means to defend our kosovo . "
un governor warns of increasing frustration bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rücker warned that kosovars are reaching their limit elsewhere , the un governor in kosovo , joachim rücker , returned to pristina after meeting with the eu foreign ministers this week and admitted that he had issued the europeans with a warning over further delaying a decision the people of kosovo had been led to expect by last october .
" i stressed that there is a lot of anxiety and tension and people need and deserve clarity on status and also on the status process , " rücker told reporters .
he called on the major powers to set a clear roadmap to the final status of kosovo and end the increasingly frustrating wait for those who had lived under un rule for eight years .
" it will be very helpful if we would have something like roadmap or timetable on the way forward , something more than just an announcement of the time of engagement , " rücker added . article based on news reports -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

sarkozy 's wife , cecilia , and his top aide , claude gueant , helped negotiate the liberation of the five bulgarian nurses and a palestinian doctor who received bulgarian citizenship .
the six had been sentenced to death for allegedly infecting more than 400 libyan children with aids .
the anti-nuclear group sortir du nucleaire has charged that sarkozy helped liberate the nurses by promising to help build up libya 's nuclear energy program .
two nuclear deals signed " sarkozy seems already to have forgotten that gadhafi is a dictator , " the group said in a press statement .
" to deliver atomic energy technology to libya means helping the country build nuclear weapons . "
the two countries signed a memorandum of understanding on the construction of a libyan nuclear reactor for water desalination , said gueant , who accompanied sarkozy on the trip . gueant added that " there is still much work to do " on the feasibility study of the desalination project . a second agreement , outlining a framework for civilian nuclear energy cooperation was also signed at the end of the talks between kadhafi and sarkozy by libyan foreign minister abdel rahman shalgham and his french counterpart , bernard kouchner , officials said . sarkozy in search of energy deals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy was looking to strike deals with gadhafi in addition to strengthening ties between the oil exporting nation and the west by making libya part of the mediterranean union sarkozy is trying to establish , the french president had hoped to land big contracts for the french nuclear energy company areva and petroleum giant total .

" we can do a lot more and a lot better with libya , and that is why the head of state is traveling there , " he added .
the presidential airbus landed at mitiga military airport on wednesday afternoon and sarkozy and kouchner headed straight to the bab azizia palace for an official welcoming ceremony and then to the signing of the cooperation agreements .
the french entourage was to attend a dinner hosted by libyan leader gadhafi at bab azizia , a sprawling complex outside tripoli .

according to a libyan government official , new deals could cover the areas of security , energy , education , immigration , health and scientific research .
franco-libyan relations have been steadily improving since a 2004 accord on a libyan compensation deal for the victims of a french dc-10 airliner bombing over niger , which killed 170 people , including 54 french nationals , in 1989 .

the anti-nuclear group sortir du nucleaire has charged that sarkozy helped liberate the nurses by promising to help build up libya 's nuclear energy program .
two nuclear deals signed " sarkozy seems already to have forgotten that gadhafi is a dictator , " the group said in a press statement .
" to deliver atomic energy technology to libya means helping the country build nuclear weapons . "
the two countries signed a memorandum of understanding on the construction of a libyan nuclear reactor for water desalination , said gueant , who accompanied sarkozy on the trip . gueant added that " there is still much work to do " on the feasibility study of the desalination project . a second agreement , outlining a framework for civilian nuclear energy cooperation was also signed at the end of the talks between kadhafi and sarkozy by libyan foreign minister abdel rahman shalgham and his french counterpart , bernard kouchner , officials said . sarkozy in search of energy deals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy was looking to strike deals with gadhafi in addition to strengthening ties between the oil exporting nation and the west by making libya part of the mediterranean union sarkozy is trying to establish , the french president had hoped to land big contracts for the french nuclear energy company areva and petroleum giant total .
before sarkozy landed in libya on wednesday , presidential spokesman david martinon confirmed this on french television : " what we are going to talk about is wide-ranging cooperation , in all fields .
" we can do a lot more and a lot better with libya , and that is why the head of state is traveling there , " he added .
the presidential airbus landed at mitiga military airport on wednesday afternoon and sarkozy and kouchner headed straight to the bab azizia palace for an official welcoming ceremony and then to the signing of the cooperation agreements .
the french entourage was to attend a dinner hosted by libyan leader gadhafi at bab azizia , a sprawling complex outside tripoli .
following his visit to libya , where he wrote he was " happy to be in your country to talk about the future " in a guest book , sarkozy will travel on to senegal , south africa and congo .
libya expected to become trading partner du jour bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : libya 's oilfields are of particular interest to western partners analysts believe the resources-rich north african country could now become a key trading partner for france and other western states after the negotiations which saw the bulgarian nurses released .
according to a libyan government official , new deals could cover the areas of security , energy , education , immigration , health and scientific research .
franco-libyan relations have been steadily improving since a 2004 accord on a libyan compensation deal for the victims of a french dc-10 airliner bombing over niger , which killed 170 people , including 54 french nationals , in 1989 .
the upturn paved the way for a visit by sarkozy 's predecessor jacques chirac in november 2004 .
the two countries resumed defense cooperation in february 2005 and struck an accord on civilian nuclear research in march 2006 .
french aerospace manufacturer dassault has also struck an agreement to service 12 french-bought mirage f1 jets - although it denies persistent rumors of negotiations on a libyan purchase of its rafale fighter .
french exports to the country jumped 43.4 percent in 2006 to reach 433.6 million euros -lrb- $ 600 million -rrb- - although it imported 1.9 billion euros worth of goods - almost all oil - from libya over the same period . article based on new reports -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

five years later , it is globally stretched by two .
military experts are now rethinking the strategy . plans adopted by the united states in 2002 to transform its military into a leaner , more cost-effective force , which would mean significant troop withdrawals from europe , are being reviewed in the light of the on-going conflicts in iraq and afghanistan , and the ever-changing geo-political climate around the world .
experts at the us defense department were studying whether the plans to cut troops on the continent by nearly half , formulated by former us defense secretary donald rumsfeld , were still relevant to today ’ s global challenges , according to an unnamed pentagon source quoted in reports from the associated press monday .
rumsfeld 's plan to reduce troop numbers from 68,000 in 2001 to 28,000 by 2012 was conceived before the united states embarked on the invasion of iraq in 2003 .
defense analysts are now concerned that the plan is outdated , given america 's involvement in two theaters of war , the worsening relations with russia and iran and a recent plan to extend the size and range of the us army .
the source claimed that defense secretary robert gates and the joint chiefs of staff are considering recommendations for a review made in june by gen. bantz craddock , who took over as head of the us european command -lrb- eucom -rrb- last year .
european command chief recommends review bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : craddock -lrb- r . -rrb- believes the 2002 plan is outdated craddock 's report questioned the troop reduction plan and highlighted incidents that hinted at a compromising of us military effectiveness in europe .
as some troop reductions have already taken place and the turnover in deployments to afghanistan , iraq and other " operation enduring freedom " missions increases , us forces in europe have had to postpone , and in some cases cancel , training with armies in european " partner nations . "
that has made it difficult for us military planners to pursue a more active strategy with nations such as poland , the czech republic and former soviet states , and potentially prevent disputes before they occur .
" we have very little capacity left for these ongoing -lrb- operations -rrb- , " said craddock during a congressional hearing concerning his report , referring to european missions .
" our ability to do that now is limited because we do n't have the forces available since they are in the rotation to -lrb- iraq or afghanistan -rrb- . "
an estimated 75 percent of the us military in europe is either deployed to afghanistan or iraq , is about to go , or just returned , according to the defense officials .
us unable to fulfill european commitments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eucom has had to pull out of joint exercises the claims of a review of the troop reduction plan comes just two weeks after the us announced it had emptied the ramstein air base in southwestern germany of nuclear weapons and that it would close five more us military sites in germany by 2009 .
the defense department revealed earlier in july that turley barracks in mannheim , scheduled for closure at the end of september this year , would be followed by us army europe facilities in büdingen and gelnhausen in 2008 .
sites in darmstadt and hanau would also be closed in 2009 , it revealed .
the closure of the five bases would affect 2,372 soldiers , nine airmen , 799 us civilians and 679 local workers .
the announcement was part of the long-term plan to close a total of 51 bases in germany and other areas of western and northern europe .
possible rethink on closure of german bases bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with fewer european bases , troops are flown directly home while the planned closures in germany related to those bases not involved in leading operations in afghanistan and iraq , if a review of the plan found that the us military presence and involvement in european defense issues was being undermined by troop withdrawals , the removal of german bases may also be reconsidered .
another problem which craddock revealed in his report relates to the closure of bases in europe , particularly in germany , in regard to returning or wounded soldiers coming out of war zones .
the reduction of barracks and services in europe means that returning us military personnel are now being flown directly to the united states , and in such numbers that it is putting strain on bases in the us which have also been downsized under the rumsfeld-approved base realignment and closure act .
at the height of the cold war , the united states had as many as 110,000 troops based in europe . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

and things could get worse .
with sinkewitz set to find out if the b sample of his june 8 drug test matches the a sample that showed abnormal levels of testosterone , german cycling is bracing for another high-profile doping confession to add to the many others which have brought the sport into the spotlight for all the wrong reasons this year .
sinkewitz 's b sample is expected to be tested next tuesday and the bdr was keen to talk to the cyclist .
" of course , we want to talk through the situation with patrik , " bdr president rudolf scharping - germany 's former minister of defense - told german sports news agency sid .
germany 's biggest team under threat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the t-mobile confessions rocked the cycling world t-mobile have suspended sinkewitz pending the results of his second sample , and the team - as well as the sport in general - is reeling from a series of recent blows .
earlier this year , seven former telekom -lrb- t-mobile 's previous name -rrb- riders , including now disgraced 1996 tour de france winner bjarne riis and sprinter erik zabel , confessed to using banned blood-booster erythropoietin -lrb- epo -rrb- .
german cycling legend jan ullrich was also embroiled in a doping scandal , though no charges have been brought against him .
the future hangs in the balance for germany ’ s biggest cycling team as the german mobile operators who sponsor the team are set to make an announcement after the current tour ends on sunday as to whether they will continue to fund t-mobile .
if the sponsors choose to leave the sport it will be a devastating blow to cycling in germany , which has watched as german television channels ard and zdf largely cancelled their coverage of this year 's tour after sinkewitz 's failed test .

andreas klöden was fifth in the tour ’ s overall standings when alexandre vinokourov of kazakhstan tested positive in the a sample for a homologous blood transfusion .
the results suggest vinokourov underwent a blood transfusion shortly before the start of the stage .
" alexandre vinokourov was tested positive for a blood transfusion and the team is leaving the tour , " astana spokeswoman corinne druey said on tuesday .
using this technique , blood is withdrawn from an athlete before a competition , and then is injected into his body again when he needs an extra boost .

based on the analysis of the french anti-doping laboratory at chatenay-malabry , vinokourov apparently used the blood of a compatible donor as two types of blood cells were found in his sample , france 's sports daily l 'equipe reported on its web site tuesday .
if the positive test is confirmed by the so-called b sample , vinokourov - widely considered a favorite to win the tour before the race started - faces a ban from the sport of at least two years .

meeting at the german embassy in vienna , officials from the us , russia , germany , france , britain and italy attempted to overcome the us-russian deadlock over the un plan to grant kosovo internationally monitored independence and to find a new format for talks .
eu foreign ministers had decided monday to limit new talks to 120 days and hold them within a smaller format to make them more effective .
germany suggested a troika of the eu , russia and us to lead the negotiations .
in a surprise move , russia agreed on the troika format suggested by german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier at the eu foreign ministers ' meeting on monday . moscow has previously said it is against moving kosovo negotiations away from the un security council , where it , along with the four other permanent council members , has the ability to veto any resolution tabled , and president vladimir putin on tuesday had again rejected talks on kosovo 's independence , fearing this could create a precedent for secession in other regions . ahtisaari steps down empty-handed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahtisaari leaves with his plan blowing in the wind meanwhile , the un 's special envoy to kosovo , martti ahtisaari , said wednesday he regarded his mission as over , saying , " my work is done . "
the 70-year-old former finnish president and career diplomat had previously said he would not prolong his engagement if either kosovo or serbia blocked the process towards determining the break-away province ’ s status .
ahtisaari has said neither the un nor the contact group had asked him to continue mediations in the face of russia 's persistent refusal to support independence for the serbian province .
he has , however , said he would be willing to take on " a role as consultant " if requested .
ahtisaari ’ s mediating efforts had been repeatedly criticized by serbia and russia as being partial towards the kosovo side .
in january , after a year of talks between serbia and kosovar albanians , he presented a proposal granting internationally monitored independence to the province .
this was rejected by moscow and belgrade .
continuing this stalemate , russian foreign minister sergei lavrov had said on tuesday that ahtisaari 's roadmap was no basis for new talks .
for the us , however , the un plan is not negotiable .
the southern serbian province had been under un administration since nato forced serbian troops to withdraw .
serbia cranks up rhetoric over unilateral independence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " self governance " is the priority for kosovans kosovo 's ethnic albanian majority , frustrated by setbacks and delays , will accept nothing short of full independence .
belgrade is only ready to grant far-reaching autonomy , fearing kosovo 's serb minority will be endangered in case of independence .
a unilateral declaration of independence by the province 's leadership could lead to a further destabilization of the region , diplomats fear .
while the us indicated it may recognize the country , secretary of state condoleezza rice also warned kosovo 's leaders not to short-circuit diplomatic efforts .
kosovo 's political leaders have issued contradictory statements as to whether the province would unilaterally declare independence .
" i think , given where we are in the diplomacy , it 's unlikely that we will get full agreement , " us state department spokesman sean mccormack told reporters in washington .
" but it is our belief - and the shared belief of many - that , in the absence of that end point , independence for kosovo , that you are actually going to see an outbreak of further violence in the region , which is n't good for anybody . "
fearing that kosovo would push forward alone as the stalemate continued , the parliament of serbia overwhelmingly voted late on tuesday to back the government 's resolution to reject any move to grant independence .
the resolution says the government will " respond promptly and energetically " to any indication of unilateral recognition of an independent kosovo , but the draft gives no details on measures the government should take .
" serbia will reject any attempt by -lrb- kosovo -rrb- albanians to unilaterally proclaim independence , " serbian prime minister vojislav kostunica said , adding that " any state that wants normal and friendly relations with serbia must respect the un charter , which guarantees that the internationally recognized borders can not be altered . "
however , aleksandar vucic of the hard-line nationalist serbian radical party accused the government of being " too meek " and demanded a break of diplomatic relations with any state recognizing an independent kosovo .
his party leader tomislav nikolic called on the government to give up its plans for serbia to join the european union and nato and " use all available means to defend our kosovo . "
un governor warns of increasing frustration bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rücker warned that kosovars are reaching their limit elsewhere , the un governor in kosovo , joachim rücker , returned to pristina after meeting with the eu foreign ministers this week and admitted that he had issued the europeans with a warning over further delaying a decision the people of kosovo had been led to expect by last october .
" i stressed that there is a lot of anxiety and tension and people need and deserve clarity on status and also on the status process , " rücker told reporters .
he called on the major powers to set a clear roadmap to the final status of kosovo and end the increasingly frustrating wait for those who had lived under un rule for eight years .
" it will be very helpful if we would have something like roadmap or timetable on the way forward , something more than just an announcement of the time of engagement , " rücker added . article based on news reports -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

meeting at the german embassy in vienna , officials from the us , russia , germany , france , britain and italy attempted to overcome the us-russian deadlock over the un plan to grant kosovo internationally monitored independence and to find a new format for talks .
eu foreign ministers had decided monday to limit new talks to 120 days and hold them within a smaller format to make them more effective .
germany suggested a troika of the eu , russia and us to lead the negotiations .
in a surprise move , russia agreed on the troika format suggested by german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier at the eu foreign ministers ' meeting on monday . moscow has previously said it is against moving kosovo negotiations away from the un security council , where it , along with the four other permanent council members , has the ability to veto any resolution tabled , and president vladimir putin on tuesday had again rejected talks on kosovo 's independence , fearing this could create a precedent for secession in other regions . ahtisaari steps down empty-handed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahtisaari leaves with his plan blowing in the wind meanwhile , the un 's special envoy to kosovo , martti ahtisaari , said wednesday he regarded his mission as over , saying , " my work is done . "
the 70-year-old former finnish president and career diplomat had previously said he would not prolong his engagement if either kosovo or serbia blocked the process towards determining the break-away province ’ s status .
ahtisaari has said neither the un nor the contact group had asked him to continue mediations in the face of russia 's persistent refusal to support independence for the serbian province .
he has , however , said he would be willing to take on " a role as consultant " if requested .
ahtisaari ’ s mediating efforts had been repeatedly criticized by serbia and russia as being partial towards the kosovo side .
in january , after a year of talks between serbia and kosovar albanians , he presented a proposal granting internationally monitored independence to the province .
this was rejected by moscow and belgrade .
continuing this stalemate , russian foreign minister sergei lavrov had said on tuesday that ahtisaari 's roadmap was no basis for new talks .
for the us , however , the un plan is not negotiable .
the southern serbian province had been under un administration since nato forced serbian troops to withdraw .
serbia cranks up rhetoric over unilateral independence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " self governance " is the priority for kosovans kosovo 's ethnic albanian majority , frustrated by setbacks and delays , will accept nothing short of full independence .
belgrade is only ready to grant far-reaching autonomy , fearing kosovo 's serb minority will be endangered in case of independence .
a unilateral declaration of independence by the province 's leadership could lead to a further destabilization of the region , diplomats fear .
while the us indicated it may recognize the country , secretary of state condoleezza rice also warned kosovo 's leaders not to short-circuit diplomatic efforts .
kosovo 's political leaders have issued contradictory statements as to whether the province would unilaterally declare independence .
" i think , given where we are in the diplomacy , it 's unlikely that we will get full agreement , " us state department spokesman sean mccormack told reporters in washington .
" but it is our belief - and the shared belief of many - that , in the absence of that end point , independence for kosovo , that you are actually going to see an outbreak of further violence in the region , which is n't good for anybody . "
fearing that kosovo would push forward alone as the stalemate continued , the parliament of serbia overwhelmingly voted late on tuesday to back the government 's resolution to reject any move to grant independence .
the resolution says the government will " respond promptly and energetically " to any indication of unilateral recognition of an independent kosovo , but the draft gives no details on measures the government should take .
" serbia will reject any attempt by -lrb- kosovo -rrb- albanians to unilaterally proclaim independence , " serbian prime minister vojislav kostunica said , adding that " any state that wants normal and friendly relations with serbia must respect the un charter , which guarantees that the internationally recognized borders can not be altered . "
however , aleksandar vucic of the hard-line nationalist serbian radical party accused the government of being " too meek " and demanded a break of diplomatic relations with any state recognizing an independent kosovo .
his party leader tomislav nikolic called on the government to give up its plans for serbia to join the european union and nato and " use all available means to defend our kosovo . "
un governor warns of increasing frustration bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rücker warned that kosovars are reaching their limit elsewhere , the un governor in kosovo , joachim rücker , returned to pristina after meeting with the eu foreign ministers this week and admitted that he had issued the europeans with a warning over further delaying a decision the people of kosovo had been led to expect by last october .
" i stressed that there is a lot of anxiety and tension and people need and deserve clarity on status and also on the status process , " rücker told reporters .
he called on the major powers to set a clear roadmap to the final status of kosovo and end the increasingly frustrating wait for those who had lived under un rule for eight years .
" it will be very helpful if we would have something like roadmap or timetable on the way forward , something more than just an announcement of the time of engagement , " rücker added . article based on news reports -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the deal satisfies germany 's protectionists who warned against selling outside the country . us firm trw had challenged for vdo , but siemens appears to have been swayed by continental 's argument that german technology should not be put into foreign hands .
the fee of 11.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 15.7 billion -rrb- for the subsidiary may have also been a factor in siemens ' decision .
the decision to sell within germany is certain please german politicians who were strongly against vdo going to a foreign firm and have recently floated the idea of placing limits on foreign investment in germany 's " core " business branches .
politicians in favor of continental bid last week , christian wulff , the conservative premier of lower saxony , spoke publicly about his support for continental 's bid for vdo .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wulff publicly advocated continental 's bid for vdo " we want conti and vdo to merge , then there would be a large automotive parts supplier operating throughout the globe out of germany , " wulff told german regional public radio station ndr .
" it would look a lot worse for the employees of the automotive supplier division of siemens if international financial investors got their hands on technology , jobs and production plants here , " wulff added .
foreign interest reignites protectionism debate the situation with vdo reignited the debate within the german government over whether germany needed an industrial policy modeled on the french to protect key industries from the influence of foreign investors .
german economics minister michael glos has said that his department was looking at how other european nations protected their domestic industries , though he added that he did not want germany to be a forerunner when it came to protectionism .
siemens swoops to buy us company bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siemens are ready to divert new funds to the us meanwhile , siemens looked to be directing some of the cash raised by the prospective sale of vdo towards the united states wednesday as it announced it had agreed to pay 5.09 billion euros for dade behring inc . , a clinical laboratory diagnostics company based in deerfield , illinois .
the munich-based giant issued a statement saying it had signed a merger agreement with dade behring to acquire all of its outstanding shares at 56.03 euros apiece .

and things could get worse .
with sinkewitz set to find out if the b sample of his june 8 drug test matches the a sample that showed abnormal levels of testosterone , german cycling is bracing for another high-profile doping confession to add to the many others which have brought the sport into the spotlight for all the wrong reasons this year .
sinkewitz 's b sample is expected to be tested next tuesday and the bdr was keen to talk to the cyclist .
" of course , we want to talk through the situation with patrik , " bdr president rudolf scharping - germany 's former minister of defense - told german sports news agency sid .
germany 's biggest team under threat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the t-mobile confessions rocked the cycling world t-mobile have suspended sinkewitz pending the results of his second sample , and the team - as well as the sport in general - is reeling from a series of recent blows .
earlier this year , seven former telekom -lrb- t-mobile 's previous name -rrb- riders , including now disgraced 1996 tour de france winner bjarne riis and sprinter erik zabel , confessed to using banned blood-booster erythropoietin -lrb- epo -rrb- .
german cycling legend jan ullrich was also embroiled in a doping scandal , though no charges have been brought against him .
the future hangs in the balance for germany ’ s biggest cycling team as the german mobile operators who sponsor the team are set to make an announcement after the current tour ends on sunday as to whether they will continue to fund t-mobile .
if the sponsors choose to leave the sport it will be a devastating blow to cycling in germany , which has watched as german television channels ard and zdf largely cancelled their coverage of this year 's tour after sinkewitz 's failed test .
german sportswear giant adidas has said it is also considering pulling out of their partnership agreement with t-mobile and the german cycling team in protest .
klöden suffers as team pulls out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vinokourov 's first blood sample came out positive doping , meanwhile , has ended the tour for another german rider , albeit because of a teammate 's usage .
andreas klöden was fifth in the tour ’ s overall standings when alexandre vinokourov of kazakhstan tested positive in the a sample for a homologous blood transfusion .
the results suggest vinokourov underwent a blood transfusion shortly before the start of the stage .
" alexandre vinokourov was tested positive for a blood transfusion and the team is leaving the tour , " astana spokeswoman corinne druey said on tuesday .
using this technique , blood is withdrawn from an athlete before a competition , and then is injected into his body again when he needs an extra boost .
this can also be done with another person 's blood .
based on the analysis of the french anti-doping laboratory at chatenay-malabry , vinokourov apparently used the blood of a compatible donor as two types of blood cells were found in his sample , france 's sports daily l 'equipe reported on its web site tuesday .
if the positive test is confirmed by the so-called b sample , vinokourov - widely considered a favorite to win the tour before the race started - faces a ban from the sport of at least two years .
after the revelations , the swiss-based astana team announced it was pulling all its riders , including klöden , out of the tour . article based on news reports -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but dw 's jefferson chase thinks that 's inevitable because of the way the sport itself works . it was hard not to feel just a tiny bit sorry for the organizers of the tour de france when the news broke that alexander vinokourov had flunked a doping test .
the last thing the already embattled event needed was for another top cyclist to be caught out in what was , if the test results are confirmed , a brazen attempt at cheating . the public outcry after vinokourov and team astana 's sorry departure from the tour was predictable .
so , too , was the organizers ' attempt to put a positive spin on the scandal by claiming that it proved the effectiveness of anti-doping tests . the incident , however , also broached an issue that an increasing number of hardcore cycling fans have raised during the course of this particularly ill-fated tour .
is it not unfair of the media to pillory cycling while remaining more-or-less silent about comparable abuses in other sports ? indeed , there is a certain measure of hypocrisy here .
no one would seriously contend that soccer , tennis or even golf is free from athletes using banned performance-enhancing substances or techniques .
the line between cheating and gaining a competitive advantage in pursuit of that all-important goal , victory , is at best blurry . nonetheless , because of the nature of cycling itself , doping presents a particular threat to the athletes ' and the sport 's credibility . cycling - and especially its premier event , the tour de france - is not a game of hand-to-eye coordination .
it is a contest of perseverance without any nifty one-two combinations , breathtaking goals or diving saves . the appeal of cycling depends on the ideal of the lone rider overcoming the constraints of the human body .
the drama of a race - for instance , the point at which the eventual winner pedals away from the pack - resides in spectators being able to imagine that he is breaking through his own personal pain barrier and summoning up previously unknown reserves of strength and determination . that illusion is completely dispelled when the audience assumes that the decisive surge is just the epo kicking in . it 's an unavoidable fact that doping provides more of a competitive advantage in cycling than it does in many other sports .
a transfusion of oxygen-enriched blood , for instance , might give a soccer or tennis player extra energy for a 15-minute overtime period or a long fifth set .
but in the absence of individual skill , it would n't help them flick a lob over the keeper 's head or paint the baseline at match point . in cycling , as disgraced tour de france winner floyd landis seems to have shown last year , hormones alone can turn the tide .
when doping is introduced into the sporting equation , cycling appears more and more like a contest between medical teams - and who wants to watch a bunch of physicians battling it out ? the effectiveness of doping in cycling also makes it more difficult to eradicate , and the sport is set to pay heavily for this inherent shortcoming .
major sponsors like t-mobile are likely to scale back or discontinue their sponsorship of teams , and tv stations will certainly think twice about shelling out major cash for the broadcast rights to next year 's tour de france . and that may be the only silver lining in the very dark cloud that hangs over cycling at the moment .

the deal satisfies germany 's protectionists who warned against selling outside the country . us firm trw had challenged for vdo , but siemens appears to have been swayed by continental 's argument that german technology should not be put into foreign hands .
the fee of 11.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 15.7 billion -rrb- for the subsidiary may have also been a factor in siemens ' decision .
the decision to sell within germany is certain please german politicians who were strongly against vdo going to a foreign firm and have recently floated the idea of placing limits on foreign investment in germany 's " core " business branches .
politicians in favor of continental bid last week , christian wulff , the conservative premier of lower saxony , spoke publicly about his support for continental 's bid for vdo .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wulff publicly advocated continental 's bid for vdo " we want conti and vdo to merge , then there would be a large automotive parts supplier operating throughout the globe out of germany , " wulff told german regional public radio station ndr .
" it would look a lot worse for the employees of the automotive supplier division of siemens if international financial investors got their hands on technology , jobs and production plants here , " wulff added .
foreign interest reignites protectionism debate the situation with vdo reignited the debate within the german government over whether germany needed an industrial policy modeled on the french to protect key industries from the influence of foreign investors .
german economics minister michael glos has said that his department was looking at how other european nations protected their domestic industries , though he added that he did not want germany to be a forerunner when it came to protectionism .
siemens swoops to buy us company bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siemens are ready to divert new funds to the us meanwhile , siemens looked to be directing some of the cash raised by the prospective sale of vdo towards the united states wednesday as it announced it had agreed to pay 5.09 billion euros for dade behring inc . , a clinical laboratory diagnostics company based in deerfield , illinois .
the munich-based giant issued a statement saying it had signed a merger agreement with dade behring to acquire all of its outstanding shares at 56.03 euros apiece .
the deal is subject to regulatory approval but is expected to be completed by the second quarter of fiscal 2008 . article based on news reports -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the deal satisfies germany 's protectionists who warned against selling outside the country . us firm trw had challenged for vdo , but siemens appears to have been swayed by continental 's argument that german technology should not be put into foreign hands .
the fee of 11.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 15.7 billion -rrb- for the subsidiary may have also been a factor in siemens ' decision .
the decision to sell within germany is certain please german politicians who were strongly against vdo going to a foreign firm and have recently floated the idea of placing limits on foreign investment in germany 's " core " business branches .
politicians in favor of continental bid last week , christian wulff , the conservative premier of lower saxony , spoke publicly about his support for continental 's bid for vdo .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wulff publicly advocated continental 's bid for vdo " we want conti and vdo to merge , then there would be a large automotive parts supplier operating throughout the globe out of germany , " wulff told german regional public radio station ndr .
" it would look a lot worse for the employees of the automotive supplier division of siemens if international financial investors got their hands on technology , jobs and production plants here , " wulff added .
foreign interest reignites protectionism debate the situation with vdo reignited the debate within the german government over whether germany needed an industrial policy modeled on the french to protect key industries from the influence of foreign investors .
german economics minister michael glos has said that his department was looking at how other european nations protected their domestic industries , though he added that he did not want germany to be a forerunner when it came to protectionism .
siemens swoops to buy us company bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siemens are ready to divert new funds to the us meanwhile , siemens looked to be directing some of the cash raised by the prospective sale of vdo towards the united states wednesday as it announced it had agreed to pay 5.09 billion euros for dade behring inc . , a clinical laboratory diagnostics company based in deerfield , illinois .
the munich-based giant issued a statement saying it had signed a merger agreement with dade behring to acquire all of its outstanding shares at 56.03 euros apiece .

on monday , much to the ire of beijing , he made critical remarks about china .
dw took part in a group interview with him . dw : your holiness , please tell us about the human rights situation in tibet . dalai lama : it 's still very serious .
about a month ago i met a tibetan who spent eight years in a chinese prison .
his only crime , which took place in a village near lhasa , was to express his own feelings . china reacted harshly when you spoke about the issue of tibet in hamburg .
did that surprise you ? not at all .
even i live in silence .
there 's always some sort of condemnation .
they just keep going on like that . what do you think of the german government 's stance toward tibet ?
do you think berlin does enough for your cause ? the german government is like other governments - basically sympathetic .
certainly there 's a sense of concern .
the question is whether that 's adequate .
we appreciate expressions of concern from the outside world .
that 's necessary and helpful . what are your goals when you visit other countries ? my main purpose and motivation is not the issue of tibet , but rather the promotion of human values in order to have happier individuals , families and communities - and , in that way , a happier humanity .
i consider that to be my contribution .
i think every human being has a responsibility to better the world .
that 's my conviction , and i always try to promote that .
my second goal is the promotion of religious harmony .
when i teach in india , more and more chinese come .
sometimes , the chinese government puts up restrictions to prevent chinese from coming to india .
but despite that , some chinese always come .
many of them say that , after seeing the tibetan community , they found big difference s to what they had heard in china .
eventually there 's some positive impact . bildunterschrift : tens of thousands of buddhists have turned out to hear the dalai lama you have said that you could be the last dalai lama .
could you please explain ? as early as 1969 , i made clear in an official statement that it was up to the tibetan people whether or not the institution of the dalai lama should continue .
that means that if the majority of the tibetan people decide that the old institution of the dalai lama is no longer relevant to the tibetan nation , it will cease to exist .
if i were to die soon , i think most of the tibetan people would want to keep the institution .
if i live on 20 or 30 years , it might be different .
that 's okay .
that would be an end with dignity . do you ever hope to return to tibet ? oh yes .
all tibetans get homesick and hope to see their own country .
me , too .
but at the same time , i 'm a buddhist monk .
so mentally and personally one 's own birthplace is n't all that important .
there 's a tibetan saying : " home is where you feel good , and your parents are anyone who does good things for you . "
-lsb- editors note : the dalai lama said this in tibetan , english translation from news reports . -rsb-
i really enjoy the very positive atmosphere of hamburg .
in the past nine days , i really feel it 's my home .
many people , including those from the media , were full of smiles .

on monday , much to the ire of beijing , he made critical remarks about china .
dw took part in a group interview with him . dw : your holiness , please tell us about the human rights situation in tibet . dalai lama : it 's still very serious .
about a month ago i met a tibetan who spent eight years in a chinese prison .
his only crime , which took place in a village near lhasa , was to express his own feelings . china reacted harshly when you spoke about the issue of tibet in hamburg .
did that surprise you ? not at all .
even i live in silence .
there 's always some sort of condemnation .
they just keep going on like that . what do you think of the german government 's stance toward tibet ?
do you think berlin does enough for your cause ? the german government is like other governments - basically sympathetic .
certainly there 's a sense of concern .
the question is whether that 's adequate .
we appreciate expressions of concern from the outside world .
that 's necessary and helpful . what are your goals when you visit other countries ? my main purpose and motivation is not the issue of tibet , but rather the promotion of human values in order to have happier individuals , families and communities - and , in that way , a happier humanity .
i consider that to be my contribution .
i think every human being has a responsibility to better the world .
that 's my conviction , and i always try to promote that .
my second goal is the promotion of religious harmony .
when i teach in india , more and more chinese come .
sometimes , the chinese government puts up restrictions to prevent chinese from coming to india .
but despite that , some chinese always come .
many of them say that , after seeing the tibetan community , they found big difference s to what they had heard in china .
eventually there 's some positive impact . bildunterschrift : tens of thousands of buddhists have turned out to hear the dalai lama you have said that you could be the last dalai lama .
could you please explain ? as early as 1969 , i made clear in an official statement that it was up to the tibetan people whether or not the institution of the dalai lama should continue .
that means that if the majority of the tibetan people decide that the old institution of the dalai lama is no longer relevant to the tibetan nation , it will cease to exist .
if i were to die soon , i think most of the tibetan people would want to keep the institution .
if i live on 20 or 30 years , it might be different .
that 's okay .
that would be an end with dignity . do you ever hope to return to tibet ? oh yes .
all tibetans get homesick and hope to see their own country .
me , too .
but at the same time , i 'm a buddhist monk .
so mentally and personally one 's own birthplace is n't all that important .
there 's a tibetan saying : " home is where you feel good , and your parents are anyone who does good things for you . "
-lsb- editors note : the dalai lama said this in tibetan , english translation from news reports . -rsb-
i really enjoy the very positive atmosphere of hamburg .

five years later , it is globally stretched by two .
military experts are now rethinking the strategy . plans adopted by the united states in 2002 to transform its military into a leaner , more cost-effective force , which would mean significant troop withdrawals from europe , are being reviewed in the light of the on-going conflicts in iraq and afghanistan , and the ever-changing geo-political climate around the world .
experts at the us defense department were studying whether the plans to cut troops on the continent by nearly half , formulated by former us defense secretary donald rumsfeld , were still relevant to today ’ s global challenges , according to an unnamed pentagon source quoted in reports from the associated press monday .
rumsfeld 's plan to reduce troop numbers from 68,000 in 2001 to 28,000 by 2012 was conceived before the united states embarked on the invasion of iraq in 2003 .
defense analysts are now concerned that the plan is outdated , given america 's involvement in two theaters of war , the worsening relations with russia and iran and a recent plan to extend the size and range of the us army .
the source claimed that defense secretary robert gates and the joint chiefs of staff are considering recommendations for a review made in june by gen. bantz craddock , who took over as head of the us european command -lrb- eucom -rrb- last year .
european command chief recommends review bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : craddock -lrb- r . -rrb- believes the 2002 plan is outdated craddock 's report questioned the troop reduction plan and highlighted incidents that hinted at a compromising of us military effectiveness in europe .
as some troop reductions have already taken place and the turnover in deployments to afghanistan , iraq and other " operation enduring freedom " missions increases , us forces in europe have had to postpone , and in some cases cancel , training with armies in european " partner nations . "
that has made it difficult for us military planners to pursue a more active strategy with nations such as poland , the czech republic and former soviet states , and potentially prevent disputes before they occur .
" we have very little capacity left for these ongoing -lrb- operations -rrb- , " said craddock during a congressional hearing concerning his report , referring to european missions .
" our ability to do that now is limited because we do n't have the forces available since they are in the rotation to -lrb- iraq or afghanistan -rrb- . "
an estimated 75 percent of the us military in europe is either deployed to afghanistan or iraq , is about to go , or just returned , according to the defense officials .
us unable to fulfill european commitments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eucom has had to pull out of joint exercises the claims of a review of the troop reduction plan comes just two weeks after the us announced it had emptied the ramstein air base in southwestern germany of nuclear weapons and that it would close five more us military sites in germany by 2009 .
the defense department revealed earlier in july that turley barracks in mannheim , scheduled for closure at the end of september this year , would be followed by us army europe facilities in büdingen and gelnhausen in 2008 .
sites in darmstadt and hanau would also be closed in 2009 , it revealed .
the closure of the five bases would affect 2,372 soldiers , nine airmen , 799 us civilians and 679 local workers .
the announcement was part of the long-term plan to close a total of 51 bases in germany and other areas of western and northern europe .
possible rethink on closure of german bases bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with fewer european bases , troops are flown directly home while the planned closures in germany related to those bases not involved in leading operations in afghanistan and iraq , if a review of the plan found that the us military presence and involvement in european defense issues was being undermined by troop withdrawals , the removal of german bases may also be reconsidered .
another problem which craddock revealed in his report relates to the closure of bases in europe , particularly in germany , in regard to returning or wounded soldiers coming out of war zones .
the reduction of barracks and services in europe means that returning us military personnel are now being flown directly to the united states , and in such numbers that it is putting strain on bases in the us which have also been downsized under the rumsfeld-approved base realignment and closure act .

and things could get worse .
with sinkewitz set to find out if the b sample of his june 8 drug test matches the a sample that showed abnormal levels of testosterone , german cycling is bracing for another high-profile doping confession to add to the many others which have brought the sport into the spotlight for all the wrong reasons this year .
sinkewitz 's b sample is expected to be tested next tuesday and the bdr was keen to talk to the cyclist .
" of course , we want to talk through the situation with patrik , " bdr president rudolf scharping - germany 's former minister of defense - told german sports news agency sid .
germany 's biggest team under threat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the t-mobile confessions rocked the cycling world t-mobile have suspended sinkewitz pending the results of his second sample , and the team - as well as the sport in general - is reeling from a series of recent blows .
earlier this year , seven former telekom -lrb- t-mobile 's previous name -rrb- riders , including now disgraced 1996 tour de france winner bjarne riis and sprinter erik zabel , confessed to using banned blood-booster erythropoietin -lrb- epo -rrb- .
german cycling legend jan ullrich was also embroiled in a doping scandal , though no charges have been brought against him .
the future hangs in the balance for germany ’ s biggest cycling team as the german mobile operators who sponsor the team are set to make an announcement after the current tour ends on sunday as to whether they will continue to fund t-mobile .
if the sponsors choose to leave the sport it will be a devastating blow to cycling in germany , which has watched as german television channels ard and zdf largely cancelled their coverage of this year 's tour after sinkewitz 's failed test .
german sportswear giant adidas has said it is also considering pulling out of their partnership agreement with t-mobile and the german cycling team in protest .
klöden suffers as team pulls out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vinokourov 's first blood sample came out positive doping , meanwhile , has ended the tour for another german rider , albeit because of a teammate 's usage .
andreas klöden was fifth in the tour ’ s overall standings when alexandre vinokourov of kazakhstan tested positive in the a sample for a homologous blood transfusion .
the results suggest vinokourov underwent a blood transfusion shortly before the start of the stage .
" alexandre vinokourov was tested positive for a blood transfusion and the team is leaving the tour , " astana spokeswoman corinne druey said on tuesday .
using this technique , blood is withdrawn from an athlete before a competition , and then is injected into his body again when he needs an extra boost .
this can also be done with another person 's blood .
based on the analysis of the french anti-doping laboratory at chatenay-malabry , vinokourov apparently used the blood of a compatible donor as two types of blood cells were found in his sample , france 's sports daily l 'equipe reported on its web site tuesday .
if the positive test is confirmed by the so-called b sample , vinokourov - widely considered a favorite to win the tour before the race started - faces a ban from the sport of at least two years .

and things could get worse .
with sinkewitz set to find out if the b sample of his june 8 drug test matches the a sample that showed abnormal levels of testosterone , german cycling is bracing for another high-profile doping confession to add to the many others which have brought the sport into the spotlight for all the wrong reasons this year .
sinkewitz 's b sample is expected to be tested next tuesday and the bdr was keen to talk to the cyclist .
" of course , we want to talk through the situation with patrik , " bdr president rudolf scharping - germany 's former minister of defense - told german sports news agency sid .
germany 's biggest team under threat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the t-mobile confessions rocked the cycling world t-mobile have suspended sinkewitz pending the results of his second sample , and the team - as well as the sport in general - is reeling from a series of recent blows .
earlier this year , seven former telekom -lrb- t-mobile 's previous name -rrb- riders , including now disgraced 1996 tour de france winner bjarne riis and sprinter erik zabel , confessed to using banned blood-booster erythropoietin -lrb- epo -rrb- .
german cycling legend jan ullrich was also embroiled in a doping scandal , though no charges have been brought against him .
the future hangs in the balance for germany ’ s biggest cycling team as the german mobile operators who sponsor the team are set to make an announcement after the current tour ends on sunday as to whether they will continue to fund t-mobile .
if the sponsors choose to leave the sport it will be a devastating blow to cycling in germany , which has watched as german television channels ard and zdf largely cancelled their coverage of this year 's tour after sinkewitz 's failed test .
german sportswear giant adidas has said it is also considering pulling out of their partnership agreement with t-mobile and the german cycling team in protest .
klöden suffers as team pulls out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vinokourov 's first blood sample came out positive doping , meanwhile , has ended the tour for another german rider , albeit because of a teammate 's usage .
andreas klöden was fifth in the tour ’ s overall standings when alexandre vinokourov of kazakhstan tested positive in the a sample for a homologous blood transfusion .
the results suggest vinokourov underwent a blood transfusion shortly before the start of the stage .
" alexandre vinokourov was tested positive for a blood transfusion and the team is leaving the tour , " astana spokeswoman corinne druey said on tuesday .
using this technique , blood is withdrawn from an athlete before a competition , and then is injected into his body again when he needs an extra boost .
this can also be done with another person 's blood .
based on the analysis of the french anti-doping laboratory at chatenay-malabry , vinokourov apparently used the blood of a compatible donor as two types of blood cells were found in his sample , france 's sports daily l 'equipe reported on its web site tuesday .
if the positive test is confirmed by the so-called b sample , vinokourov - widely considered a favorite to win the tour before the race started - faces a ban from the sport of at least two years .
after the revelations , the swiss-based astana team announced it was pulling all its riders , including klöden , out of the tour . article based on news reports -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 25.07.2007 opinion : doping threatens cycling more than other sports großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as the tour de france deals with yet another doping scandal , some hardcore fans say the press unfairly singles out cycling .
but dw 's jefferson chase thinks that 's inevitable because of the way the sport itself works . it was hard not to feel just a tiny bit sorry for the organizers of the tour de france when the news broke that alexander vinokourov had flunked a doping test .
the last thing the already embattled event needed was for another top cyclist to be caught out in what was , if the test results are confirmed , a brazen attempt at cheating . the public outcry after vinokourov and team astana 's sorry departure from the tour was predictable .
so , too , was the organizers ' attempt to put a positive spin on the scandal by claiming that it proved the effectiveness of anti-doping tests . the incident , however , also broached an issue that an increasing number of hardcore cycling fans have raised during the course of this particularly ill-fated tour .
is it not unfair of the media to pillory cycling while remaining more-or-less silent about comparable abuses in other sports ? indeed , there is a certain measure of hypocrisy here .
no one would seriously contend that soccer , tennis or even golf is free from athletes using banned performance-enhancing substances or techniques .
the line between cheating and gaining a competitive advantage in pursuit of that all-important goal , victory , is at best blurry . nonetheless , because of the nature of cycling itself , doping presents a particular threat to the athletes ' and the sport 's credibility . cycling - and especially its premier event , the tour de france - is not a game of hand-to-eye coordination .
it is a contest of perseverance without any nifty one-two combinations , breathtaking goals or diving saves . the appeal of cycling depends on the ideal of the lone rider overcoming the constraints of the human body .
the drama of a race - for instance , the point at which the eventual winner pedals away from the pack - resides in spectators being able to imagine that he is breaking through his own personal pain barrier and summoning up previously unknown reserves of strength and determination . that illusion is completely dispelled when the audience assumes that the decisive surge is just the epo kicking in . it 's an unavoidable fact that doping provides more of a competitive advantage in cycling than it does in many other sports .
a transfusion of oxygen-enriched blood , for instance , might give a soccer or tennis player extra energy for a 15-minute overtime period or a long fifth set .

but dw 's jefferson chase thinks that 's inevitable because of the way the sport itself works . it was hard not to feel just a tiny bit sorry for the organizers of the tour de france when the news broke that alexander vinokourov had flunked a doping test .
the last thing the already embattled event needed was for another top cyclist to be caught out in what was , if the test results are confirmed , a brazen attempt at cheating . the public outcry after vinokourov and team astana 's sorry departure from the tour was predictable .
so , too , was the organizers ' attempt to put a positive spin on the scandal by claiming that it proved the effectiveness of anti-doping tests . the incident , however , also broached an issue that an increasing number of hardcore cycling fans have raised during the course of this particularly ill-fated tour .
is it not unfair of the media to pillory cycling while remaining more-or-less silent about comparable abuses in other sports ? indeed , there is a certain measure of hypocrisy here .
no one would seriously contend that soccer , tennis or even golf is free from athletes using banned performance-enhancing substances or techniques .
the line between cheating and gaining a competitive advantage in pursuit of that all-important goal , victory , is at best blurry . nonetheless , because of the nature of cycling itself , doping presents a particular threat to the athletes ' and the sport 's credibility . cycling - and especially its premier event , the tour de france - is not a game of hand-to-eye coordination .
it is a contest of perseverance without any nifty one-two combinations , breathtaking goals or diving saves . the appeal of cycling depends on the ideal of the lone rider overcoming the constraints of the human body .
the drama of a race - for instance , the point at which the eventual winner pedals away from the pack - resides in spectators being able to imagine that he is breaking through his own personal pain barrier and summoning up previously unknown reserves of strength and determination . that illusion is completely dispelled when the audience assumes that the decisive surge is just the epo kicking in . it 's an unavoidable fact that doping provides more of a competitive advantage in cycling than it does in many other sports .
a transfusion of oxygen-enriched blood , for instance , might give a soccer or tennis player extra energy for a 15-minute overtime period or a long fifth set .

the line between cheating and gaining a competitive advantage in pursuit of that all-important goal , victory , is at best blurry . nonetheless , because of the nature of cycling itself , doping presents a particular threat to the athletes ' and the sport 's credibility . cycling - and especially its premier event , the tour de france - is not a game of hand-to-eye coordination .
it is a contest of perseverance without any nifty one-two combinations , breathtaking goals or diving saves . the appeal of cycling depends on the ideal of the lone rider overcoming the constraints of the human body .
the drama of a race - for instance , the point at which the eventual winner pedals away from the pack - resides in spectators being able to imagine that he is breaking through his own personal pain barrier and summoning up previously unknown reserves of strength and determination . that illusion is completely dispelled when the audience assumes that the decisive surge is just the epo kicking in . it 's an unavoidable fact that doping provides more of a competitive advantage in cycling than it does in many other sports .
a transfusion of oxygen-enriched blood , for instance , might give a soccer or tennis player extra energy for a 15-minute overtime period or a long fifth set .
but in the absence of individual skill , it would n't help them flick a lob over the keeper 's head or paint the baseline at match point . in cycling , as disgraced tour de france winner floyd landis seems to have shown last year , hormones alone can turn the tide .
when doping is introduced into the sporting equation , cycling appears more and more like a contest between medical teams - and who wants to watch a bunch of physicians battling it out ? the effectiveness of doping in cycling also makes it more difficult to eradicate , and the sport is set to pay heavily for this inherent shortcoming .
major sponsors like t-mobile are likely to scale back or discontinue their sponsorship of teams , and tv stations will certainly think twice about shelling out major cash for the broadcast rights to next year 's tour de france . and that may be the only silver lining in the very dark cloud that hangs over cycling at the moment .
perhaps with less money and publicity in play , athletes and teams will be less willing to risk their reputations for 15 minutes of dubious fame . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

sarkozy 's wife , cecilia , and his top aide , claude gueant , helped negotiate the liberation of the five bulgarian nurses and a palestinian doctor who received bulgarian citizenship .
the six had been sentenced to death for allegedly infecting more than 400 libyan children with aids .
the anti-nuclear group sortir du nucleaire has charged that sarkozy helped liberate the nurses by promising to help build up libya 's nuclear energy program .
two nuclear deals signed " sarkozy seems already to have forgotten that gadhafi is a dictator , " the group said in a press statement .
" to deliver atomic energy technology to libya means helping the country build nuclear weapons . "
the two countries signed a memorandum of understanding on the construction of a libyan nuclear reactor for water desalination , said gueant , who accompanied sarkozy on the trip . gueant added that " there is still much work to do " on the feasibility study of the desalination project . a second agreement , outlining a framework for civilian nuclear energy cooperation was also signed at the end of the talks between kadhafi and sarkozy by libyan foreign minister abdel rahman shalgham and his french counterpart , bernard kouchner , officials said . sarkozy in search of energy deals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy was looking to strike deals with gadhafi in addition to strengthening ties between the oil exporting nation and the west by making libya part of the mediterranean union sarkozy is trying to establish , the french president had hoped to land big contracts for the french nuclear energy company areva and petroleum giant total .
before sarkozy landed in libya on wednesday , presidential spokesman david martinon confirmed this on french television : " what we are going to talk about is wide-ranging cooperation , in all fields .
" we can do a lot more and a lot better with libya , and that is why the head of state is traveling there , " he added .
the presidential airbus landed at mitiga military airport on wednesday afternoon and sarkozy and kouchner headed straight to the bab azizia palace for an official welcoming ceremony and then to the signing of the cooperation agreements .
the french entourage was to attend a dinner hosted by libyan leader gadhafi at bab azizia , a sprawling complex outside tripoli .
following his visit to libya , where he wrote he was " happy to be in your country to talk about the future " in a guest book , sarkozy will travel on to senegal , south africa and congo .
libya expected to become trading partner du jour bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : libya 's oilfields are of particular interest to western partners analysts believe the resources-rich north african country could now become a key trading partner for france and other western states after the negotiations which saw the bulgarian nurses released .
according to a libyan government official , new deals could cover the areas of security , energy , education , immigration , health and scientific research .
franco-libyan relations have been steadily improving since a 2004 accord on a libyan compensation deal for the victims of a french dc-10 airliner bombing over niger , which killed 170 people , including 54 french nationals , in 1989 .
the upturn paved the way for a visit by sarkozy 's predecessor jacques chirac in november 2004 .
the two countries resumed defense cooperation in february 2005 and struck an accord on civilian nuclear research in march 2006 .
french aerospace manufacturer dassault has also struck an agreement to service 12 french-bought mirage f1 jets - although it denies persistent rumors of negotiations on a libyan purchase of its rafale fighter .

" she is certainly the heroine of this release … along with her husband nicolas and the grey eminence claude gueant , secretary general of elysee palace .

" madame sarkozy 's intervention has caused displeasure , " according to de morgen in brussels .

worse still : sarkozy artlessly used the touchy affair to help his capricious spouse with her personal search for meaningful activities .
with that he demoted complicated foreign policy to a sort of therapy for couples .

" we can only hope that the idea was not to take advantage of the media attention the release would attract .
the eu 's diplomats , who have been negotiating with libya for years , would hardly be able to appreciate the french activism in the moment of the release .
is it really the french first lady 's job to get involved in a very touchy and complicated case in which much has been unsaid … and in which there are possibly secret negotiations for the french armaments industry ? "
" it is a real success for the -lsb- european union 's -rsb- common foreign policy and one that was earned only by years of gruelling effort and negotiation , " wrote the financial times in london .

sarkozy 's wife , cecilia , and his top aide , claude gueant , helped negotiate the liberation of the five bulgarian nurses and a palestinian doctor who received bulgarian citizenship .
the six had been sentenced to death for allegedly infecting more than 400 libyan children with aids .
the anti-nuclear group sortir du nucleaire has charged that sarkozy helped liberate the nurses by promising to help build up libya 's nuclear energy program .
two nuclear deals signed " sarkozy seems already to have forgotten that gadhafi is a dictator , " the group said in a press statement .
" to deliver atomic energy technology to libya means helping the country build nuclear weapons . "
the two countries signed a memorandum of understanding on the construction of a libyan nuclear reactor for water desalination , said gueant , who accompanied sarkozy on the trip . gueant added that " there is still much work to do " on the feasibility study of the desalination project . a second agreement , outlining a framework for civilian nuclear energy cooperation was also signed at the end of the talks between kadhafi and sarkozy by libyan foreign minister abdel rahman shalgham and his french counterpart , bernard kouchner , officials said . sarkozy in search of energy deals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy was looking to strike deals with gadhafi in addition to strengthening ties between the oil exporting nation and the west by making libya part of the mediterranean union sarkozy is trying to establish , the french president had hoped to land big contracts for the french nuclear energy company areva and petroleum giant total .
before sarkozy landed in libya on wednesday , presidential spokesman david martinon confirmed this on french television : " what we are going to talk about is wide-ranging cooperation , in all fields .
" we can do a lot more and a lot better with libya , and that is why the head of state is traveling there , " he added .
the presidential airbus landed at mitiga military airport on wednesday afternoon and sarkozy and kouchner headed straight to the bab azizia palace for an official welcoming ceremony and then to the signing of the cooperation agreements .
the french entourage was to attend a dinner hosted by libyan leader gadhafi at bab azizia , a sprawling complex outside tripoli .
following his visit to libya , where he wrote he was " happy to be in your country to talk about the future " in a guest book , sarkozy will travel on to senegal , south africa and congo .
libya expected to become trading partner du jour bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : libya 's oilfields are of particular interest to western partners analysts believe the resources-rich north african country could now become a key trading partner for france and other western states after the negotiations which saw the bulgarian nurses released .
according to a libyan government official , new deals could cover the areas of security , energy , education , immigration , health and scientific research .
franco-libyan relations have been steadily improving since a 2004 accord on a libyan compensation deal for the victims of a french dc-10 airliner bombing over niger , which killed 170 people , including 54 french nationals , in 1989 .

sarkozy 's wife , cecilia , and his top aide , claude gueant , helped negotiate the liberation of the five bulgarian nurses and a palestinian doctor who received bulgarian citizenship .
the six had been sentenced to death for allegedly infecting more than 400 libyan children with aids .
the anti-nuclear group sortir du nucleaire has charged that sarkozy helped liberate the nurses by promising to help build up libya 's nuclear energy program .
two nuclear deals signed " sarkozy seems already to have forgotten that gadhafi is a dictator , " the group said in a press statement .
" to deliver atomic energy technology to libya means helping the country build nuclear weapons . "
the two countries signed a memorandum of understanding on the construction of a libyan nuclear reactor for water desalination , said gueant , who accompanied sarkozy on the trip . gueant added that " there is still much work to do " on the feasibility study of the desalination project . a second agreement , outlining a framework for civilian nuclear energy cooperation was also signed at the end of the talks between kadhafi and sarkozy by libyan foreign minister abdel rahman shalgham and his french counterpart , bernard kouchner , officials said . sarkozy in search of energy deals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy was looking to strike deals with gadhafi in addition to strengthening ties between the oil exporting nation and the west by making libya part of the mediterranean union sarkozy is trying to establish , the french president had hoped to land big contracts for the french nuclear energy company areva and petroleum giant total .
before sarkozy landed in libya on wednesday , presidential spokesman david martinon confirmed this on french television : " what we are going to talk about is wide-ranging cooperation , in all fields .
" we can do a lot more and a lot better with libya , and that is why the head of state is traveling there , " he added .
the presidential airbus landed at mitiga military airport on wednesday afternoon and sarkozy and kouchner headed straight to the bab azizia palace for an official welcoming ceremony and then to the signing of the cooperation agreements .
the french entourage was to attend a dinner hosted by libyan leader gadhafi at bab azizia , a sprawling complex outside tripoli .
following his visit to libya , where he wrote he was " happy to be in your country to talk about the future " in a guest book , sarkozy will travel on to senegal , south africa and congo .
libya expected to become trading partner du jour bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : libya 's oilfields are of particular interest to western partners analysts believe the resources-rich north african country could now become a key trading partner for france and other western states after the negotiations which saw the bulgarian nurses released .
according to a libyan government official , new deals could cover the areas of security , energy , education , immigration , health and scientific research .
franco-libyan relations have been steadily improving since a 2004 accord on a libyan compensation deal for the victims of a french dc-10 airliner bombing over niger , which killed 170 people , including 54 french nationals , in 1989 .
the upturn paved the way for a visit by sarkozy 's predecessor jacques chirac in november 2004 .
the two countries resumed defense cooperation in february 2005 and struck an accord on civilian nuclear research in march 2006 .

meeting at the german embassy in vienna , officials from the us , russia , germany , france , britain and italy attempted to overcome the us-russian deadlock over the un plan to grant kosovo internationally monitored independence and to find a new format for talks .
eu foreign ministers had decided monday to limit new talks to 120 days and hold them within a smaller format to make them more effective .
germany suggested a troika of the eu , russia and us to lead the negotiations .
in a surprise move , russia agreed on the troika format suggested by german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier at the eu foreign ministers ' meeting on monday . moscow has previously said it is against moving kosovo negotiations away from the un security council , where it , along with the four other permanent council members , has the ability to veto any resolution tabled , and president vladimir putin on tuesday had again rejected talks on kosovo 's independence , fearing this could create a precedent for secession in other regions . ahtisaari steps down empty-handed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahtisaari leaves with his plan blowing in the wind meanwhile , the un 's special envoy to kosovo , martti ahtisaari , said wednesday he regarded his mission as over , saying , " my work is done . "
the 70-year-old former finnish president and career diplomat had previously said he would not prolong his engagement if either kosovo or serbia blocked the process towards determining the break-away province ’ s status .
ahtisaari has said neither the un nor the contact group had asked him to continue mediations in the face of russia 's persistent refusal to support independence for the serbian province .
he has , however , said he would be willing to take on " a role as consultant " if requested .
ahtisaari ’ s mediating efforts had been repeatedly criticized by serbia and russia as being partial towards the kosovo side .
in january , after a year of talks between serbia and kosovar albanians , he presented a proposal granting internationally monitored independence to the province .
this was rejected by moscow and belgrade .
continuing this stalemate , russian foreign minister sergei lavrov had said on tuesday that ahtisaari 's roadmap was no basis for new talks .
for the us , however , the un plan is not negotiable .
the southern serbian province had been under un administration since nato forced serbian troops to withdraw .
serbia cranks up rhetoric over unilateral independence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " self governance " is the priority for kosovans kosovo 's ethnic albanian majority , frustrated by setbacks and delays , will accept nothing short of full independence .
belgrade is only ready to grant far-reaching autonomy , fearing kosovo 's serb minority will be endangered in case of independence .
a unilateral declaration of independence by the province 's leadership could lead to a further destabilization of the region , diplomats fear .
while the us indicated it may recognize the country , secretary of state condoleezza rice also warned kosovo 's leaders not to short-circuit diplomatic efforts .
kosovo 's political leaders have issued contradictory statements as to whether the province would unilaterally declare independence .
" i think , given where we are in the diplomacy , it 's unlikely that we will get full agreement , " us state department spokesman sean mccormack told reporters in washington .
" but it is our belief - and the shared belief of many - that , in the absence of that end point , independence for kosovo , that you are actually going to see an outbreak of further violence in the region , which is n't good for anybody . "
fearing that kosovo would push forward alone as the stalemate continued , the parliament of serbia overwhelmingly voted late on tuesday to back the government 's resolution to reject any move to grant independence .
the resolution says the government will " respond promptly and energetically " to any indication of unilateral recognition of an independent kosovo , but the draft gives no details on measures the government should take .
" serbia will reject any attempt by -lrb- kosovo -rrb- albanians to unilaterally proclaim independence , " serbian prime minister vojislav kostunica said , adding that " any state that wants normal and friendly relations with serbia must respect the un charter , which guarantees that the internationally recognized borders can not be altered . "
however , aleksandar vucic of the hard-line nationalist serbian radical party accused the government of being " too meek " and demanded a break of diplomatic relations with any state recognizing an independent kosovo .
his party leader tomislav nikolic called on the government to give up its plans for serbia to join the european union and nato and " use all available means to defend our kosovo . "
un governor warns of increasing frustration bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rücker warned that kosovars are reaching their limit elsewhere , the un governor in kosovo , joachim rücker , returned to pristina after meeting with the eu foreign ministers this week and admitted that he had issued the europeans with a warning over further delaying a decision the people of kosovo had been led to expect by last october .
" i stressed that there is a lot of anxiety and tension and people need and deserve clarity on status and also on the status process , " rücker told reporters .
he called on the major powers to set a clear roadmap to the final status of kosovo and end the increasingly frustrating wait for those who had lived under un rule for eight years .

this was rejected by moscow and belgrade .
continuing this stalemate , russian foreign minister sergei lavrov had said on tuesday that ahtisaari 's roadmap was no basis for new talks .
for the us , however , the un plan is not negotiable .
the southern serbian province had been under un administration since nato forced serbian troops to withdraw .
serbia cranks up rhetoric over unilateral independence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " self governance " is the priority for kosovans kosovo 's ethnic albanian majority , frustrated by setbacks and delays , will accept nothing short of full independence .
belgrade is only ready to grant far-reaching autonomy , fearing kosovo 's serb minority will be endangered in case of independence .
a unilateral declaration of independence by the province 's leadership could lead to a further destabilization of the region , diplomats fear .
while the us indicated it may recognize the country , secretary of state condoleezza rice also warned kosovo 's leaders not to short-circuit diplomatic efforts .
kosovo 's political leaders have issued contradictory statements as to whether the province would unilaterally declare independence .
" i think , given where we are in the diplomacy , it 's unlikely that we will get full agreement , " us state department spokesman sean mccormack told reporters in washington .
" but it is our belief - and the shared belief of many - that , in the absence of that end point , independence for kosovo , that you are actually going to see an outbreak of further violence in the region , which is n't good for anybody . "
fearing that kosovo would push forward alone as the stalemate continued , the parliament of serbia overwhelmingly voted late on tuesday to back the government 's resolution to reject any move to grant independence .
the resolution says the government will " respond promptly and energetically " to any indication of unilateral recognition of an independent kosovo , but the draft gives no details on measures the government should take .
" serbia will reject any attempt by -lrb- kosovo -rrb- albanians to unilaterally proclaim independence , " serbian prime minister vojislav kostunica said , adding that " any state that wants normal and friendly relations with serbia must respect the un charter , which guarantees that the internationally recognized borders can not be altered . "
however , aleksandar vucic of the hard-line nationalist serbian radical party accused the government of being " too meek " and demanded a break of diplomatic relations with any state recognizing an independent kosovo .
his party leader tomislav nikolic called on the government to give up its plans for serbia to join the european union and nato and " use all available means to defend our kosovo . "

meeting at the german embassy in vienna , officials from the us , russia , germany , france , britain and italy attempted to overcome the us-russian deadlock over the un plan to grant kosovo internationally monitored independence and to find a new format for talks .
eu foreign ministers had decided monday to limit new talks to 120 days and hold them within a smaller format to make them more effective .
germany suggested a troika of the eu , russia and us to lead the negotiations .
in a surprise move , russia agreed on the troika format suggested by german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier at the eu foreign ministers ' meeting on monday . moscow has previously said it is against moving kosovo negotiations away from the un security council , where it , along with the four other permanent council members , has the ability to veto any resolution tabled , and president vladimir putin on tuesday had again rejected talks on kosovo 's independence , fearing this could create a precedent for secession in other regions . ahtisaari steps down empty-handed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahtisaari leaves with his plan blowing in the wind meanwhile , the un 's special envoy to kosovo , martti ahtisaari , said wednesday he regarded his mission as over , saying , " my work is done . "
the 70-year-old former finnish president and career diplomat had previously said he would not prolong his engagement if either kosovo or serbia blocked the process towards determining the break-away province ’ s status .
ahtisaari has said neither the un nor the contact group had asked him to continue mediations in the face of russia 's persistent refusal to support independence for the serbian province .
he has , however , said he would be willing to take on " a role as consultant " if requested .

sarkozy 's wife , cecilia , and his top aide , claude gueant , helped negotiate the liberation of the five bulgarian nurses and a palestinian doctor who received bulgarian citizenship .
the six had been sentenced to death for allegedly infecting more than 400 libyan children with aids .
the anti-nuclear group sortir du nucleaire has charged that sarkozy helped liberate the nurses by promising to help build up libya 's nuclear energy program .

franco-libyan relations have been steadily improving since a 2004 accord on a libyan compensation deal for the victims of a french dc-10 airliner bombing over niger , which killed 170 people , including 54 french nationals , in 1989 .

meeting at the german embassy in vienna , officials from the us , russia , germany , france , britain and italy attempted to overcome the us-russian deadlock over the un plan to grant kosovo internationally monitored independence and to find a new format for talks .
eu foreign ministers had decided monday to limit new talks to 120 days and hold them within a smaller format to make them more effective .
germany suggested a troika of the eu , russia and us to lead the negotiations .
in a surprise move , russia agreed on the troika format suggested by german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier at the eu foreign ministers ' meeting on monday . moscow has previously said it is against moving kosovo negotiations away from the un security council , where it , along with the four other permanent council members , has the ability to veto any resolution tabled , and president vladimir putin on tuesday had again rejected talks on kosovo 's independence , fearing this could create a precedent for secession in other regions . ahtisaari steps down empty-handed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahtisaari leaves with his plan blowing in the wind meanwhile , the un 's special envoy to kosovo , martti ahtisaari , said wednesday he regarded his mission as over , saying , " my work is done . "
the 70-year-old former finnish president and career diplomat had previously said he would not prolong his engagement if either kosovo or serbia blocked the process towards determining the break-away province ’ s status .
ahtisaari has said neither the un nor the contact group had asked him to continue mediations in the face of russia 's persistent refusal to support independence for the serbian province .
he has , however , said he would be willing to take on " a role as consultant " if requested .
ahtisaari ’ s mediating efforts had been repeatedly criticized by serbia and russia as being partial towards the kosovo side .
in january , after a year of talks between serbia and kosovar albanians , he presented a proposal granting internationally monitored independence to the province .
this was rejected by moscow and belgrade .
continuing this stalemate , russian foreign minister sergei lavrov had said on tuesday that ahtisaari 's roadmap was no basis for new talks .
for the us , however , the un plan is not negotiable .
the southern serbian province had been under un administration since nato forced serbian troops to withdraw .
serbia cranks up rhetoric over unilateral independence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " self governance " is the priority for kosovans kosovo 's ethnic albanian majority , frustrated by setbacks and delays , will accept nothing short of full independence .
belgrade is only ready to grant far-reaching autonomy , fearing kosovo 's serb minority will be endangered in case of independence .
a unilateral declaration of independence by the province 's leadership could lead to a further destabilization of the region , diplomats fear .
while the us indicated it may recognize the country , secretary of state condoleezza rice also warned kosovo 's leaders not to short-circuit diplomatic efforts .
kosovo 's political leaders have issued contradictory statements as to whether the province would unilaterally declare independence .
" i think , given where we are in the diplomacy , it 's unlikely that we will get full agreement , " us state department spokesman sean mccormack told reporters in washington .
" but it is our belief - and the shared belief of many - that , in the absence of that end point , independence for kosovo , that you are actually going to see an outbreak of further violence in the region , which is n't good for anybody . "
fearing that kosovo would push forward alone as the stalemate continued , the parliament of serbia overwhelmingly voted late on tuesday to back the government 's resolution to reject any move to grant independence .
the resolution says the government will " respond promptly and energetically " to any indication of unilateral recognition of an independent kosovo , but the draft gives no details on measures the government should take .
" serbia will reject any attempt by -lrb- kosovo -rrb- albanians to unilaterally proclaim independence , " serbian prime minister vojislav kostunica said , adding that " any state that wants normal and friendly relations with serbia must respect the un charter , which guarantees that the internationally recognized borders can not be altered . "
however , aleksandar vucic of the hard-line nationalist serbian radical party accused the government of being " too meek " and demanded a break of diplomatic relations with any state recognizing an independent kosovo .
his party leader tomislav nikolic called on the government to give up its plans for serbia to join the european union and nato and " use all available means to defend our kosovo . "

" i stressed that there is a lot of anxiety and tension and people need and deserve clarity on status and also on the status process , " rücker told reporters .
he called on the major powers to set a clear roadmap to the final status of kosovo and end the increasingly frustrating wait for those who had lived under un rule for eight years .

meeting at the german embassy in vienna , officials from the us , russia , germany , france , britain and italy attempted to overcome the us-russian deadlock over the un plan to grant kosovo internationally monitored independence and to find a new format for talks .
eu foreign ministers had decided monday to limit new talks to 120 days and hold them within a smaller format to make them more effective .
germany suggested a troika of the eu , russia and us to lead the negotiations .
in a surprise move , russia agreed on the troika format suggested by german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier at the eu foreign ministers ' meeting on monday . moscow has previously said it is against moving kosovo negotiations away from the un security council , where it , along with the four other permanent council members , has the ability to veto any resolution tabled , and president vladimir putin on tuesday had again rejected talks on kosovo 's independence , fearing this could create a precedent for secession in other regions . ahtisaari steps down empty-handed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahtisaari leaves with his plan blowing in the wind meanwhile , the un 's special envoy to kosovo , martti ahtisaari , said wednesday he regarded his mission as over , saying , " my work is done . "
the 70-year-old former finnish president and career diplomat had previously said he would not prolong his engagement if either kosovo or serbia blocked the process towards determining the break-away province ’ s status .
ahtisaari has said neither the un nor the contact group had asked him to continue mediations in the face of russia 's persistent refusal to support independence for the serbian province .
he has , however , said he would be willing to take on " a role as consultant " if requested .
ahtisaari ’ s mediating efforts had been repeatedly criticized by serbia and russia as being partial towards the kosovo side .
in january , after a year of talks between serbia and kosovar albanians , he presented a proposal granting internationally monitored independence to the province .
this was rejected by moscow and belgrade .
continuing this stalemate , russian foreign minister sergei lavrov had said on tuesday that ahtisaari 's roadmap was no basis for new talks .
for the us , however , the un plan is not negotiable .
the southern serbian province had been under un administration since nato forced serbian troops to withdraw .
serbia cranks up rhetoric over unilateral independence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " self governance " is the priority for kosovans kosovo 's ethnic albanian majority , frustrated by setbacks and delays , will accept nothing short of full independence .
belgrade is only ready to grant far-reaching autonomy , fearing kosovo 's serb minority will be endangered in case of independence .
a unilateral declaration of independence by the province 's leadership could lead to a further destabilization of the region , diplomats fear .
while the us indicated it may recognize the country , secretary of state condoleezza rice also warned kosovo 's leaders not to short-circuit diplomatic efforts .
kosovo 's political leaders have issued contradictory statements as to whether the province would unilaterally declare independence .
" i think , given where we are in the diplomacy , it 's unlikely that we will get full agreement , " us state department spokesman sean mccormack told reporters in washington .
" but it is our belief - and the shared belief of many - that , in the absence of that end point , independence for kosovo , that you are actually going to see an outbreak of further violence in the region , which is n't good for anybody . "
fearing that kosovo would push forward alone as the stalemate continued , the parliament of serbia overwhelmingly voted late on tuesday to back the government 's resolution to reject any move to grant independence .
the resolution says the government will " respond promptly and energetically " to any indication of unilateral recognition of an independent kosovo , but the draft gives no details on measures the government should take .
" serbia will reject any attempt by -lrb- kosovo -rrb- albanians to unilaterally proclaim independence , " serbian prime minister vojislav kostunica said , adding that " any state that wants normal and friendly relations with serbia must respect the un charter , which guarantees that the internationally recognized borders can not be altered . "
however , aleksandar vucic of the hard-line nationalist serbian radical party accused the government of being " too meek " and demanded a break of diplomatic relations with any state recognizing an independent kosovo .
his party leader tomislav nikolic called on the government to give up its plans for serbia to join the european union and nato and " use all available means to defend our kosovo . "

" i stressed that there is a lot of anxiety and tension and people need and deserve clarity on status and also on the status process , " rücker told reporters .
he called on the major powers to set a clear roadmap to the final status of kosovo and end the increasingly frustrating wait for those who had lived under un rule for eight years .

the deal satisfies germany 's protectionists who warned against selling outside the country . us firm trw had challenged for vdo , but siemens appears to have been swayed by continental 's argument that german technology should not be put into foreign hands .
the fee of 11.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 15.7 billion -rrb- for the subsidiary may have also been a factor in siemens ' decision .
the decision to sell within germany is certain please german politicians who were strongly against vdo going to a foreign firm and have recently floated the idea of placing limits on foreign investment in germany 's " core " business branches .
politicians in favor of continental bid last week , christian wulff , the conservative premier of lower saxony , spoke publicly about his support for continental 's bid for vdo .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wulff publicly advocated continental 's bid for vdo " we want conti and vdo to merge , then there would be a large automotive parts supplier operating throughout the globe out of germany , " wulff told german regional public radio station ndr .
" it would look a lot worse for the employees of the automotive supplier division of siemens if international financial investors got their hands on technology , jobs and production plants here , " wulff added .
foreign interest reignites protectionism debate the situation with vdo reignited the debate within the german government over whether germany needed an industrial policy modeled on the french to protect key industries from the influence of foreign investors .
german economics minister michael glos has said that his department was looking at how other european nations protected their domestic industries , though he added that he did not want germany to be a forerunner when it came to protectionism .
siemens swoops to buy us company bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siemens are ready to divert new funds to the us meanwhile , siemens looked to be directing some of the cash raised by the prospective sale of vdo towards the united states wednesday as it announced it had agreed to pay 5.09 billion euros for dade behring inc . , a clinical laboratory diagnostics company based in deerfield , illinois .
the munich-based giant issued a statement saying it had signed a merger agreement with dade behring to acquire all of its outstanding shares at 56.03 euros apiece .

dw spoke with four of the singers who are preparing to take the stage . in her bayreuth premiere last year , canadian mezzo-soprano adrianne pieczonka impressed the audience with her perfect intonation , warm timbre and convincing portrayal of the role of sieglinde in " die walküre . "
in the interview , she describes her approach to the role and her experience of rehearsing and performing in the legendary bayreuth opera house . in opera , vocal soloists often have to come to terms with texts in languages that are foreign to them and roles and characters that may be difficult to relate to .
south african mezzo-soprano michelle breedt has given a lot of thought to her role , that of fricka in wagner 's " der ring des nibelungen . "
click to listen to the interview , where she reveals herself as a highly inspired and insightful artist : bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the trip to bayreuth 's festspielhaus can often be a long one for opera singers when it comes to wagnerian opera , many vocalists consider it the supreme privilege to sing in the theater the composer himself designed for his music dramas .
but sometimes the route to bayreuth is a surprisingly indirect one , as indicated by american tenor stephen gould , who sings the role of siegfried in the current production of " der ring des nibelungen . " part of the attraction of wagner lies in the universal nature of the stories , dealing with jealousy , ambition , humiliation , murder and incest , but also with more noble issues like altruism and - most significantly - love .
this is a topic pursued in an interview with american soprano linda watson , who sings the role of brünnhilde in " der ring des nibelungen .

on monday , much to the ire of beijing , he made critical remarks about china .
dw took part in a group interview with him . dw : your holiness , please tell us about the human rights situation in tibet . dalai lama : it 's still very serious .
about a month ago i met a tibetan who spent eight years in a chinese prison .
his only crime , which took place in a village near lhasa , was to express his own feelings . china reacted harshly when you spoke about the issue of tibet in hamburg .
did that surprise you ? not at all .
even i live in silence .
there 's always some sort of condemnation .
they just keep going on like that . what do you think of the german government 's stance toward tibet ?
do you think berlin does enough for your cause ? the german government is like other governments - basically sympathetic .
certainly there 's a sense of concern .
the question is whether that 's adequate .
we appreciate expressions of concern from the outside world .
that 's necessary and helpful . what are your goals when you visit other countries ? my main purpose and motivation is not the issue of tibet , but rather the promotion of human values in order to have happier individuals , families and communities - and , in that way , a happier humanity .
i consider that to be my contribution .
i think every human being has a responsibility to better the world .
that 's my conviction , and i always try to promote that .
my second goal is the promotion of religious harmony .
when i teach in india , more and more chinese come .
sometimes , the chinese government puts up restrictions to prevent chinese from coming to india .
but despite that , some chinese always come .
many of them say that , after seeing the tibetan community , they found big difference s to what they had heard in china .
eventually there 's some positive impact . bildunterschrift : tens of thousands of buddhists have turned out to hear the dalai lama you have said that you could be the last dalai lama .
could you please explain ? as early as 1969 , i made clear in an official statement that it was up to the tibetan people whether or not the institution of the dalai lama should continue .
that means that if the majority of the tibetan people decide that the old institution of the dalai lama is no longer relevant to the tibetan nation , it will cease to exist .
if i were to die soon , i think most of the tibetan people would want to keep the institution .
if i live on 20 or 30 years , it might be different .
that 's okay .
that would be an end with dignity . do you ever hope to return to tibet ? oh yes .
all tibetans get homesick and hope to see their own country .
me , too .
but at the same time , i 'm a buddhist monk .
so mentally and personally one 's own birthplace is n't all that important .
there 's a tibetan saying : " home is where you feel good , and your parents are anyone who does good things for you . "
-lsb- editors note : the dalai lama said this in tibetan , english translation from news reports . -rsb-

five years later , it is globally stretched by two .
military experts are now rethinking the strategy . plans adopted by the united states in 2002 to transform its military into a leaner , more cost-effective force , which would mean significant troop withdrawals from europe , are being reviewed in the light of the on-going conflicts in iraq and afghanistan , and the ever-changing geo-political climate around the world .
experts at the us defense department were studying whether the plans to cut troops on the continent by nearly half , formulated by former us defense secretary donald rumsfeld , were still relevant to today ’ s global challenges , according to an unnamed pentagon source quoted in reports from the associated press monday .
rumsfeld 's plan to reduce troop numbers from 68,000 in 2001 to 28,000 by 2012 was conceived before the united states embarked on the invasion of iraq in 2003 .
defense analysts are now concerned that the plan is outdated , given america 's involvement in two theaters of war , the worsening relations with russia and iran and a recent plan to extend the size and range of the us army .
the source claimed that defense secretary robert gates and the joint chiefs of staff are considering recommendations for a review made in june by gen. bantz craddock , who took over as head of the us european command -lrb- eucom -rrb- last year .
european command chief recommends review bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : craddock -lrb- r . -rrb- believes the 2002 plan is outdated craddock 's report questioned the troop reduction plan and highlighted incidents that hinted at a compromising of us military effectiveness in europe .
as some troop reductions have already taken place and the turnover in deployments to afghanistan , iraq and other " operation enduring freedom " missions increases , us forces in europe have had to postpone , and in some cases cancel , training with armies in european " partner nations . "
that has made it difficult for us military planners to pursue a more active strategy with nations such as poland , the czech republic and former soviet states , and potentially prevent disputes before they occur .
" we have very little capacity left for these ongoing -lrb- operations -rrb- , " said craddock during a congressional hearing concerning his report , referring to european missions .
" our ability to do that now is limited because we do n't have the forces available since they are in the rotation to -lrb- iraq or afghanistan -rrb- . "
an estimated 75 percent of the us military in europe is either deployed to afghanistan or iraq , is about to go , or just returned , according to the defense officials .
us unable to fulfill european commitments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eucom has had to pull out of joint exercises the claims of a review of the troop reduction plan comes just two weeks after the us announced it had emptied the ramstein air base in southwestern germany of nuclear weapons and that it would close five more us military sites in germany by 2009 .
the defense department revealed earlier in july that turley barracks in mannheim , scheduled for closure at the end of september this year , would be followed by us army europe facilities in büdingen and gelnhausen in 2008 .
sites in darmstadt and hanau would also be closed in 2009 , it revealed .
the closure of the five bases would affect 2,372 soldiers , nine airmen , 799 us civilians and 679 local workers .
the announcement was part of the long-term plan to close a total of 51 bases in germany and other areas of western and northern europe .
possible rethink on closure of german bases bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with fewer european bases , troops are flown directly home while the planned closures in germany related to those bases not involved in leading operations in afghanistan and iraq , if a review of the plan found that the us military presence and involvement in european defense issues was being undermined by troop withdrawals , the removal of german bases may also be reconsidered .
another problem which craddock revealed in his report relates to the closure of bases in europe , particularly in germany , in regard to returning or wounded soldiers coming out of war zones .
the reduction of barracks and services in europe means that returning us military personnel are now being flown directly to the united states , and in such numbers that it is putting strain on bases in the us which have also been downsized under the rumsfeld-approved base realignment and closure act .
at the height of the cold war , the united states had as many as 110,000 troops based in europe . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

and things could get worse .
with sinkewitz set to find out if the b sample of his june 8 drug test matches the a sample that showed abnormal levels of testosterone , german cycling is bracing for another high-profile doping confession to add to the many others which have brought the sport into the spotlight for all the wrong reasons this year .
sinkewitz 's b sample is expected to be tested next tuesday and the bdr was keen to talk to the cyclist .
" of course , we want to talk through the situation with patrik , " bdr president rudolf scharping - germany 's former minister of defense - told german sports news agency sid .
germany 's biggest team under threat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the t-mobile confessions rocked the cycling world t-mobile have suspended sinkewitz pending the results of his second sample , and the team - as well as the sport in general - is reeling from a series of recent blows .
earlier this year , seven former telekom -lrb- t-mobile 's previous name -rrb- riders , including now disgraced 1996 tour de france winner bjarne riis and sprinter erik zabel , confessed to using banned blood-booster erythropoietin -lrb- epo -rrb- .
german cycling legend jan ullrich was also embroiled in a doping scandal , though no charges have been brought against him .
the future hangs in the balance for germany ’ s biggest cycling team as the german mobile operators who sponsor the team are set to make an announcement after the current tour ends on sunday as to whether they will continue to fund t-mobile .
if the sponsors choose to leave the sport it will be a devastating blow to cycling in germany , which has watched as german television channels ard and zdf largely cancelled their coverage of this year 's tour after sinkewitz 's failed test .
german sportswear giant adidas has said it is also considering pulling out of their partnership agreement with t-mobile and the german cycling team in protest .
klöden suffers as team pulls out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vinokourov 's first blood sample came out positive doping , meanwhile , has ended the tour for another german rider , albeit because of a teammate 's usage .
andreas klöden was fifth in the tour ’ s overall standings when alexandre vinokourov of kazakhstan tested positive in the a sample for a homologous blood transfusion .
the results suggest vinokourov underwent a blood transfusion shortly before the start of the stage .
" alexandre vinokourov was tested positive for a blood transfusion and the team is leaving the tour , " astana spokeswoman corinne druey said on tuesday .
using this technique , blood is withdrawn from an athlete before a competition , and then is injected into his body again when he needs an extra boost .
this can also be done with another person 's blood .
based on the analysis of the french anti-doping laboratory at chatenay-malabry , vinokourov apparently used the blood of a compatible donor as two types of blood cells were found in his sample , france 's sports daily l 'equipe reported on its web site tuesday .
if the positive test is confirmed by the so-called b sample , vinokourov - widely considered a favorite to win the tour before the race started - faces a ban from the sport of at least two years .

with sinkewitz set to find out if the b sample of his june 8 drug test matches the a sample that showed abnormal levels of testosterone , german cycling is bracing for another high-profile doping confession to add to the many others which have brought the sport into the spotlight for all the wrong reasons this year .
sinkewitz 's b sample is expected to be tested next tuesday and the bdr was keen to talk to the cyclist .
" of course , we want to talk through the situation with patrik , " bdr president rudolf scharping - germany 's former minister of defense - told german sports news agency sid .
germany 's biggest team under threat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the t-mobile confessions rocked the cycling world t-mobile have suspended sinkewitz pending the results of his second sample , and the team - as well as the sport in general - is reeling from a series of recent blows .
earlier this year , seven former telekom -lrb- t-mobile 's previous name -rrb- riders , including now disgraced 1996 tour de france winner bjarne riis and sprinter erik zabel , confessed to using banned blood-booster erythropoietin -lrb- epo -rrb- .
german cycling legend jan ullrich was also embroiled in a doping scandal , though no charges have been brought against him .
the future hangs in the balance for germany ’ s biggest cycling team as the german mobile operators who sponsor the team are set to make an announcement after the current tour ends on sunday as to whether they will continue to fund t-mobile .
if the sponsors choose to leave the sport it will be a devastating blow to cycling in germany , which has watched as german television channels ard and zdf largely cancelled their coverage of this year 's tour after sinkewitz 's failed test .
german sportswear giant adidas has said it is also considering pulling out of their partnership agreement with t-mobile and the german cycling team in protest .
klöden suffers as team pulls out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vinokourov 's first blood sample came out positive doping , meanwhile , has ended the tour for another german rider , albeit because of a teammate 's usage .
andreas klöden was fifth in the tour ’ s overall standings when alexandre vinokourov of kazakhstan tested positive in the a sample for a homologous blood transfusion .
the results suggest vinokourov underwent a blood transfusion shortly before the start of the stage .
" alexandre vinokourov was tested positive for a blood transfusion and the team is leaving the tour , " astana spokeswoman corinne druey said on tuesday .
using this technique , blood is withdrawn from an athlete before a competition , and then is injected into his body again when he needs an extra boost .
this can also be done with another person 's blood .
based on the analysis of the french anti-doping laboratory at chatenay-malabry , vinokourov apparently used the blood of a compatible donor as two types of blood cells were found in his sample , france 's sports daily l 'equipe reported on its web site tuesday .
if the positive test is confirmed by the so-called b sample , vinokourov - widely considered a favorite to win the tour before the race started - faces a ban from the sport of at least two years .
after the revelations , the swiss-based astana team announced it was pulling all its riders , including klöden , out of the tour . article based on news reports -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but dw 's jefferson chase thinks that 's inevitable because of the way the sport itself works . it was hard not to feel just a tiny bit sorry for the organizers of the tour de france when the news broke that alexander vinokourov had flunked a doping test .
the last thing the already embattled event needed was for another top cyclist to be caught out in what was , if the test results are confirmed , a brazen attempt at cheating . the public outcry after vinokourov and team astana 's sorry departure from the tour was predictable .
so , too , was the organizers ' attempt to put a positive spin on the scandal by claiming that it proved the effectiveness of anti-doping tests . the incident , however , also broached an issue that an increasing number of hardcore cycling fans have raised during the course of this particularly ill-fated tour .
is it not unfair of the media to pillory cycling while remaining more-or-less silent about comparable abuses in other sports ? indeed , there is a certain measure of hypocrisy here .
no one would seriously contend that soccer , tennis or even golf is free from athletes using banned performance-enhancing substances or techniques .
the line between cheating and gaining a competitive advantage in pursuit of that all-important goal , victory , is at best blurry . nonetheless , because of the nature of cycling itself , doping presents a particular threat to the athletes ' and the sport 's credibility . cycling - and especially its premier event , the tour de france - is not a game of hand-to-eye coordination .
it is a contest of perseverance without any nifty one-two combinations , breathtaking goals or diving saves . the appeal of cycling depends on the ideal of the lone rider overcoming the constraints of the human body .
the drama of a race - for instance , the point at which the eventual winner pedals away from the pack - resides in spectators being able to imagine that he is breaking through his own personal pain barrier and summoning up previously unknown reserves of strength and determination . that illusion is completely dispelled when the audience assumes that the decisive surge is just the epo kicking in . it 's an unavoidable fact that doping provides more of a competitive advantage in cycling than it does in many other sports .
a transfusion of oxygen-enriched blood , for instance , might give a soccer or tennis player extra energy for a 15-minute overtime period or a long fifth set .
but in the absence of individual skill , it would n't help them flick a lob over the keeper 's head or paint the baseline at match point . in cycling , as disgraced tour de france winner floyd landis seems to have shown last year , hormones alone can turn the tide .
when doping is introduced into the sporting equation , cycling appears more and more like a contest between medical teams - and who wants to watch a bunch of physicians battling it out ? the effectiveness of doping in cycling also makes it more difficult to eradicate , and the sport is set to pay heavily for this inherent shortcoming .

the six went home tuesday after eight years in jail . as they hugged their celebrating family members , the slender silhouette of cecilia sarkozy appeared on the plane 's stairs , " rome 's la repubblica daily wrote .
" she is certainly the heroine of this release … along with her husband nicolas and the grey eminence claude gueant , secretary general of elysee palace .
despite the criticism from … the left-wing opposition , the matter is a triumph for the sarkozys , the baptism of ' couple diplomacy ' that never existed before : yesterday cecilia brought the nurses home and at the same time emphasized the humanitarian aspect of her role .
today nicolas travels to tripoli to meet -lsb- libyan leader -rsb- gadhafi and to lend the agreement a political dimension . "
but others were n't quite so happy with with sarkozy 's behavior .
" madame sarkozy 's intervention has caused displeasure , " according to de morgen in brussels .
" the european commission can hardly explain itself why , of all people , cecilia sarkozy traveled to libya , and some eu parliamentarians and members of the french opposition find it outrageous that the sarkozys want to ' take the credit ' for the release , while the eu has been lobbying for years for the unfortunate six . "
" ' super sarko ' layed it on too thick after the happy resolution of the drama , too artlessly did he take the credit that actually belongs to others , " wrote germany 's nürnberger zeitung daily .
for , it was the diplomats of the eu , britain 's former prime minister tony blair and germany 's foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , who over the years doggedly negotiated with the libyan leader behind the scenes .
worse still : sarkozy artlessly used the touchy affair to help his capricious spouse with her personal search for meaningful activities .
with that he demoted complicated foreign policy to a sort of therapy for couples .
not everyone is enthusiastic about cecilia sarkozy 's charm offensive as a humanitarian ambassador on the political frontline . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the medics flew back to bulgaria in a french presidential jet " we ca n't exactly understand why cecilia sarkozy travelled to tripoli twice within a two-week period - even if she was , like many , outraged and concerned about the fate of the nurses , " commented french catholic daily la croix shortly before the medics were flown out of libya .
" we can only hope that the idea was not to take advantage of the media attention the release would attract .
the eu 's diplomats , who have been negotiating with libya for years , would hardly be able to appreciate the french activism in the moment of the release .
is it really the french first lady 's job to get involved in a very touchy and complicated case in which much has been unsaid … and in which there are possibly secret negotiations for the french armaments industry ? "
" it is a real success for the -lsb- european union 's -rsb- common foreign policy and one that was earned only by years of gruelling effort and negotiation , " wrote the financial times in london .
" bulgaria on its own could never have done what was achieved by the eu as a whole .
that said , it comes as no surprise to see cecilia sarkozy , wife of nicolas sarkozy , the french president , appearing in libya just before the prisoners ' release . … while france has , along with the uk and germany , contributed to the complex deal that secured the bulgarians ' freedom , it would not be the first time that one eu power has tried to hog the limelight and take the credit for a shared success .
this behavior is self-centered but political ego is one of the many motors driving the eu .
like it or not , it can bring results . " article based on news reports -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de eu plans upgraded ties with libya after medics ' release the european union on tuesday promised to upgrade political and economic ties with libya after authorities in tripoli released six bulgarian medics who had been sentenced to life in prison there .

despite the criticism from … the left-wing opposition , the matter is a triumph for the sarkozys , the baptism of ' couple diplomacy ' that never existed before : yesterday cecilia brought the nurses home and at the same time emphasized the humanitarian aspect of her role .

but others were n't quite so happy with with sarkozy 's behavior .
" madame sarkozy 's intervention has caused displeasure , " according to de morgen in brussels .
" the european commission can hardly explain itself why , of all people , cecilia sarkozy traveled to libya , and some eu parliamentarians and members of the french opposition find it outrageous that the sarkozys want to ' take the credit ' for the release , while the eu has been lobbying for years for the unfortunate six . "

worse still : sarkozy artlessly used the touchy affair to help his capricious spouse with her personal search for meaningful activities .

sarkozy 's wife , cecilia , and his top aide , claude gueant , helped negotiate the liberation of the five bulgarian nurses and a palestinian doctor who received bulgarian citizenship .
the six had been sentenced to death for allegedly infecting more than 400 libyan children with aids .
the anti-nuclear group sortir du nucleaire has charged that sarkozy helped liberate the nurses by promising to help build up libya 's nuclear energy program .
two nuclear deals signed " sarkozy seems already to have forgotten that gadhafi is a dictator , " the group said in a press statement .
" to deliver atomic energy technology to libya means helping the country build nuclear weapons . "
the two countries signed a memorandum of understanding on the construction of a libyan nuclear reactor for water desalination , said gueant , who accompanied sarkozy on the trip . gueant added that " there is still much work to do " on the feasibility study of the desalination project . a second agreement , outlining a framework for civilian nuclear energy cooperation was also signed at the end of the talks between kadhafi and sarkozy by libyan foreign minister abdel rahman shalgham and his french counterpart , bernard kouchner , officials said . sarkozy in search of energy deals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy was looking to strike deals with gadhafi in addition to strengthening ties between the oil exporting nation and the west by making libya part of the mediterranean union sarkozy is trying to establish , the french president had hoped to land big contracts for the french nuclear energy company areva and petroleum giant total .
before sarkozy landed in libya on wednesday , presidential spokesman david martinon confirmed this on french television : " what we are going to talk about is wide-ranging cooperation , in all fields .
" we can do a lot more and a lot better with libya , and that is why the head of state is traveling there , " he added .
the presidential airbus landed at mitiga military airport on wednesday afternoon and sarkozy and kouchner headed straight to the bab azizia palace for an official welcoming ceremony and then to the signing of the cooperation agreements .
the french entourage was to attend a dinner hosted by libyan leader gadhafi at bab azizia , a sprawling complex outside tripoli .
following his visit to libya , where he wrote he was " happy to be in your country to talk about the future " in a guest book , sarkozy will travel on to senegal , south africa and congo .
libya expected to become trading partner du jour bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : libya 's oilfields are of particular interest to western partners analysts believe the resources-rich north african country could now become a key trading partner for france and other western states after the negotiations which saw the bulgarian nurses released .
according to a libyan government official , new deals could cover the areas of security , energy , education , immigration , health and scientific research .
franco-libyan relations have been steadily improving since a 2004 accord on a libyan compensation deal for the victims of a french dc-10 airliner bombing over niger , which killed 170 people , including 54 french nationals , in 1989 .
the upturn paved the way for a visit by sarkozy 's predecessor jacques chirac in november 2004 .
the two countries resumed defense cooperation in february 2005 and struck an accord on civilian nuclear research in march 2006 .
french aerospace manufacturer dassault has also struck an agreement to service 12 french-bought mirage f1 jets - although it denies persistent rumors of negotiations on a libyan purchase of its rafale fighter .
french exports to the country jumped 43.4 percent in 2006 to reach 433.6 million euros -lrb- $ 600 million -rrb- - although it imported 1.9 billion euros worth of goods - almost all oil - from libya over the same period . article based on new reports -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

his only crime , which took place in a village near lhasa , was to express his own feelings . china reacted harshly when you spoke about the issue of tibet in hamburg .
did that surprise you ? not at all .
even i live in silence .
there 's always some sort of condemnation .
they just keep going on like that . what do you think of the german government 's stance toward tibet ?
do you think berlin does enough for your cause ? the german government is like other governments - basically sympathetic .
certainly there 's a sense of concern .
the question is whether that 's adequate .
we appreciate expressions of concern from the outside world .
that 's necessary and helpful . what are your goals when you visit other countries ? my main purpose and motivation is not the issue of tibet , but rather the promotion of human values in order to have happier individuals , families and communities - and , in that way , a happier humanity .
i consider that to be my contribution .
i think every human being has a responsibility to better the world .
that 's my conviction , and i always try to promote that .
my second goal is the promotion of religious harmony .
when i teach in india , more and more chinese come .
sometimes , the chinese government puts up restrictions to prevent chinese from coming to india .
but despite that , some chinese always come .
many of them say that , after seeing the tibetan community , they found big difference s to what they had heard in china .
eventually there 's some positive impact . bildunterschrift : tens of thousands of buddhists have turned out to hear the dalai lama you have said that you could be the last dalai lama .
could you please explain ? as early as 1969 , i made clear in an official statement that it was up to the tibetan people whether or not the institution of the dalai lama should continue .
that means that if the majority of the tibetan people decide that the old institution of the dalai lama is no longer relevant to the tibetan nation , it will cease to exist .
if i were to die soon , i think most of the tibetan people would want to keep the institution .
if i live on 20 or 30 years , it might be different .
that 's okay .
that would be an end with dignity . do you ever hope to return to tibet ? oh yes .
all tibetans get homesick and hope to see their own country .
me , too .
but at the same time , i 'm a buddhist monk .
so mentally and personally one 's own birthplace is n't all that important .
there 's a tibetan saying : " home is where you feel good , and your parents are anyone who does good things for you . "
-lsb- editors note : the dalai lama said this in tibetan , english translation from news reports . -rsb-
i really enjoy the very positive atmosphere of hamburg .
in the past nine days , i really feel it 's my home .
many people , including those from the media , were full of smiles .

on monday , much to the ire of beijing , he made critical remarks about china .
dw took part in a group interview with him . dw : your holiness , please tell us about the human rights situation in tibet . dalai lama : it 's still very serious .
about a month ago i met a tibetan who spent eight years in a chinese prison .
his only crime , which took place in a village near lhasa , was to express his own feelings . china reacted harshly when you spoke about the issue of tibet in hamburg .
did that surprise you ? not at all .
even i live in silence .
there 's always some sort of condemnation .
they just keep going on like that . what do you think of the german government 's stance toward tibet ?
do you think berlin does enough for your cause ? the german government is like other governments - basically sympathetic .
certainly there 's a sense of concern .
the question is whether that 's adequate .
we appreciate expressions of concern from the outside world .
that 's necessary and helpful . what are your goals when you visit other countries ? my main purpose and motivation is not the issue of tibet , but rather the promotion of human values in order to have happier individuals , families and communities - and , in that way , a happier humanity .
i consider that to be my contribution .
i think every human being has a responsibility to better the world .
that 's my conviction , and i always try to promote that .
my second goal is the promotion of religious harmony .
when i teach in india , more and more chinese come .
sometimes , the chinese government puts up restrictions to prevent chinese from coming to india .
but despite that , some chinese always come .
many of them say that , after seeing the tibetan community , they found big difference s to what they had heard in china .
eventually there 's some positive impact . bildunterschrift : tens of thousands of buddhists have turned out to hear the dalai lama you have said that you could be the last dalai lama .
could you please explain ? as early as 1969 , i made clear in an official statement that it was up to the tibetan people whether or not the institution of the dalai lama should continue .
that means that if the majority of the tibetan people decide that the old institution of the dalai lama is no longer relevant to the tibetan nation , it will cease to exist .
if i were to die soon , i think most of the tibetan people would want to keep the institution .
if i live on 20 or 30 years , it might be different .
that 's okay .
that would be an end with dignity . do you ever hope to return to tibet ? oh yes .
all tibetans get homesick and hope to see their own country .
me , too .
but at the same time , i 'm a buddhist monk .
so mentally and personally one 's own birthplace is n't all that important .
there 's a tibetan saying : " home is where you feel good , and your parents are anyone who does good things for you . "
-lsb- editors note : the dalai lama said this in tibetan , english translation from news reports . -rsb-
i really enjoy the very positive atmosphere of hamburg .
in the past nine days , i really feel it 's my home .
many people , including those from the media , were full of smiles .

five years later , it is globally stretched by two .
military experts are now rethinking the strategy . plans adopted by the united states in 2002 to transform its military into a leaner , more cost-effective force , which would mean significant troop withdrawals from europe , are being reviewed in the light of the on-going conflicts in iraq and afghanistan , and the ever-changing geo-political climate around the world .
experts at the us defense department were studying whether the plans to cut troops on the continent by nearly half , formulated by former us defense secretary donald rumsfeld , were still relevant to today ’ s global challenges , according to an unnamed pentagon source quoted in reports from the associated press monday .
rumsfeld 's plan to reduce troop numbers from 68,000 in 2001 to 28,000 by 2012 was conceived before the united states embarked on the invasion of iraq in 2003 .
defense analysts are now concerned that the plan is outdated , given america 's involvement in two theaters of war , the worsening relations with russia and iran and a recent plan to extend the size and range of the us army .
the source claimed that defense secretary robert gates and the joint chiefs of staff are considering recommendations for a review made in june by gen. bantz craddock , who took over as head of the us european command -lrb- eucom -rrb- last year .
european command chief recommends review bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : craddock -lrb- r . -rrb- believes the 2002 plan is outdated craddock 's report questioned the troop reduction plan and highlighted incidents that hinted at a compromising of us military effectiveness in europe .
as some troop reductions have already taken place and the turnover in deployments to afghanistan , iraq and other " operation enduring freedom " missions increases , us forces in europe have had to postpone , and in some cases cancel , training with armies in european " partner nations . "
that has made it difficult for us military planners to pursue a more active strategy with nations such as poland , the czech republic and former soviet states , and potentially prevent disputes before they occur .
" we have very little capacity left for these ongoing -lrb- operations -rrb- , " said craddock during a congressional hearing concerning his report , referring to european missions .
" our ability to do that now is limited because we do n't have the forces available since they are in the rotation to -lrb- iraq or afghanistan -rrb- . "
an estimated 75 percent of the us military in europe is either deployed to afghanistan or iraq , is about to go , or just returned , according to the defense officials .
us unable to fulfill european commitments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eucom has had to pull out of joint exercises the claims of a review of the troop reduction plan comes just two weeks after the us announced it had emptied the ramstein air base in southwestern germany of nuclear weapons and that it would close five more us military sites in germany by 2009 .
the defense department revealed earlier in july that turley barracks in mannheim , scheduled for closure at the end of september this year , would be followed by us army europe facilities in büdingen and gelnhausen in 2008 .
sites in darmstadt and hanau would also be closed in 2009 , it revealed .
the closure of the five bases would affect 2,372 soldiers , nine airmen , 799 us civilians and 679 local workers .
the announcement was part of the long-term plan to close a total of 51 bases in germany and other areas of western and northern europe .
possible rethink on closure of german bases bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with fewer european bases , troops are flown directly home while the planned closures in germany related to those bases not involved in leading operations in afghanistan and iraq , if a review of the plan found that the us military presence and involvement in european defense issues was being undermined by troop withdrawals , the removal of german bases may also be reconsidered .
another problem which craddock revealed in his report relates to the closure of bases in europe , particularly in germany , in regard to returning or wounded soldiers coming out of war zones .
the reduction of barracks and services in europe means that returning us military personnel are now being flown directly to the united states , and in such numbers that it is putting strain on bases in the us which have also been downsized under the rumsfeld-approved base realignment and closure act .

military experts are now rethinking the strategy . plans adopted by the united states in 2002 to transform its military into a leaner , more cost-effective force , which would mean significant troop withdrawals from europe , are being reviewed in the light of the on-going conflicts in iraq and afghanistan , and the ever-changing geo-political climate around the world .
experts at the us defense department were studying whether the plans to cut troops on the continent by nearly half , formulated by former us defense secretary donald rumsfeld , were still relevant to today ’ s global challenges , according to an unnamed pentagon source quoted in reports from the associated press monday .
rumsfeld 's plan to reduce troop numbers from 68,000 in 2001 to 28,000 by 2012 was conceived before the united states embarked on the invasion of iraq in 2003 .
defense analysts are now concerned that the plan is outdated , given america 's involvement in two theaters of war , the worsening relations with russia and iran and a recent plan to extend the size and range of the us army .
the source claimed that defense secretary robert gates and the joint chiefs of staff are considering recommendations for a review made in june by gen. bantz craddock , who took over as head of the us european command -lrb- eucom -rrb- last year .
european command chief recommends review bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : craddock -lrb- r . -rrb- believes the 2002 plan is outdated craddock 's report questioned the troop reduction plan and highlighted incidents that hinted at a compromising of us military effectiveness in europe .
as some troop reductions have already taken place and the turnover in deployments to afghanistan , iraq and other " operation enduring freedom " missions increases , us forces in europe have had to postpone , and in some cases cancel , training with armies in european " partner nations . "
that has made it difficult for us military planners to pursue a more active strategy with nations such as poland , the czech republic and former soviet states , and potentially prevent disputes before they occur .
" we have very little capacity left for these ongoing -lrb- operations -rrb- , " said craddock during a congressional hearing concerning his report , referring to european missions .
" our ability to do that now is limited because we do n't have the forces available since they are in the rotation to -lrb- iraq or afghanistan -rrb- . "
an estimated 75 percent of the us military in europe is either deployed to afghanistan or iraq , is about to go , or just returned , according to the defense officials .
us unable to fulfill european commitments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eucom has had to pull out of joint exercises the claims of a review of the troop reduction plan comes just two weeks after the us announced it had emptied the ramstein air base in southwestern germany of nuclear weapons and that it would close five more us military sites in germany by 2009 .
the defense department revealed earlier in july that turley barracks in mannheim , scheduled for closure at the end of september this year , would be followed by us army europe facilities in büdingen and gelnhausen in 2008 .
sites in darmstadt and hanau would also be closed in 2009 , it revealed .
the closure of the five bases would affect 2,372 soldiers , nine airmen , 799 us civilians and 679 local workers .
the announcement was part of the long-term plan to close a total of 51 bases in germany and other areas of western and northern europe .
possible rethink on closure of german bases bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with fewer european bases , troops are flown directly home while the planned closures in germany related to those bases not involved in leading operations in afghanistan and iraq , if a review of the plan found that the us military presence and involvement in european defense issues was being undermined by troop withdrawals , the removal of german bases may also be reconsidered .
another problem which craddock revealed in his report relates to the closure of bases in europe , particularly in germany , in regard to returning or wounded soldiers coming out of war zones .
the reduction of barracks and services in europe means that returning us military personnel are now being flown directly to the united states , and in such numbers that it is putting strain on bases in the us which have also been downsized under the rumsfeld-approved base realignment and closure act .
at the height of the cold war , the united states had as many as 110,000 troops based in europe . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

and things could get worse .
with sinkewitz set to find out if the b sample of his june 8 drug test matches the a sample that showed abnormal levels of testosterone , german cycling is bracing for another high-profile doping confession to add to the many others which have brought the sport into the spotlight for all the wrong reasons this year .
sinkewitz 's b sample is expected to be tested next tuesday and the bdr was keen to talk to the cyclist .
" of course , we want to talk through the situation with patrik , " bdr president rudolf scharping - germany 's former minister of defense - told german sports news agency sid .
germany 's biggest team under threat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the t-mobile confessions rocked the cycling world t-mobile have suspended sinkewitz pending the results of his second sample , and the team - as well as the sport in general - is reeling from a series of recent blows .
earlier this year , seven former telekom -lrb- t-mobile 's previous name -rrb- riders , including now disgraced 1996 tour de france winner bjarne riis and sprinter erik zabel , confessed to using banned blood-booster erythropoietin -lrb- epo -rrb- .
german cycling legend jan ullrich was also embroiled in a doping scandal , though no charges have been brought against him .
the future hangs in the balance for germany ’ s biggest cycling team as the german mobile operators who sponsor the team are set to make an announcement after the current tour ends on sunday as to whether they will continue to fund t-mobile .
if the sponsors choose to leave the sport it will be a devastating blow to cycling in germany , which has watched as german television channels ard and zdf largely cancelled their coverage of this year 's tour after sinkewitz 's failed test .
german sportswear giant adidas has said it is also considering pulling out of their partnership agreement with t-mobile and the german cycling team in protest .

andreas klöden was fifth in the tour ’ s overall standings when alexandre vinokourov of kazakhstan tested positive in the a sample for a homologous blood transfusion .
the results suggest vinokourov underwent a blood transfusion shortly before the start of the stage .
" alexandre vinokourov was tested positive for a blood transfusion and the team is leaving the tour , " astana spokeswoman corinne druey said on tuesday .
using this technique , blood is withdrawn from an athlete before a competition , and then is injected into his body again when he needs an extra boost .
this can also be done with another person 's blood .
based on the analysis of the french anti-doping laboratory at chatenay-malabry , vinokourov apparently used the blood of a compatible donor as two types of blood cells were found in his sample , france 's sports daily l 'equipe reported on its web site tuesday .
if the positive test is confirmed by the so-called b sample , vinokourov - widely considered a favorite to win the tour before the race started - faces a ban from the sport of at least two years .

and things could get worse .
with sinkewitz set to find out if the b sample of his june 8 drug test matches the a sample that showed abnormal levels of testosterone , german cycling is bracing for another high-profile doping confession to add to the many others which have brought the sport into the spotlight for all the wrong reasons this year .
sinkewitz 's b sample is expected to be tested next tuesday and the bdr was keen to talk to the cyclist .
" of course , we want to talk through the situation with patrik , " bdr president rudolf scharping - germany 's former minister of defense - told german sports news agency sid .
germany 's biggest team under threat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the t-mobile confessions rocked the cycling world t-mobile have suspended sinkewitz pending the results of his second sample , and the team - as well as the sport in general - is reeling from a series of recent blows .
earlier this year , seven former telekom -lrb- t-mobile 's previous name -rrb- riders , including now disgraced 1996 tour de france winner bjarne riis and sprinter erik zabel , confessed to using banned blood-booster erythropoietin -lrb- epo -rrb- .
german cycling legend jan ullrich was also embroiled in a doping scandal , though no charges have been brought against him .
the future hangs in the balance for germany ’ s biggest cycling team as the german mobile operators who sponsor the team are set to make an announcement after the current tour ends on sunday as to whether they will continue to fund t-mobile .
if the sponsors choose to leave the sport it will be a devastating blow to cycling in germany , which has watched as german television channels ard and zdf largely cancelled their coverage of this year 's tour after sinkewitz 's failed test .
german sportswear giant adidas has said it is also considering pulling out of their partnership agreement with t-mobile and the german cycling team in protest .
klöden suffers as team pulls out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vinokourov 's first blood sample came out positive doping , meanwhile , has ended the tour for another german rider , albeit because of a teammate 's usage .
andreas klöden was fifth in the tour ’ s overall standings when alexandre vinokourov of kazakhstan tested positive in the a sample for a homologous blood transfusion .
the results suggest vinokourov underwent a blood transfusion shortly before the start of the stage .
" alexandre vinokourov was tested positive for a blood transfusion and the team is leaving the tour , " astana spokeswoman corinne druey said on tuesday .

but dw 's jefferson chase thinks that 's inevitable because of the way the sport itself works . it was hard not to feel just a tiny bit sorry for the organizers of the tour de france when the news broke that alexander vinokourov had flunked a doping test .
the last thing the already embattled event needed was for another top cyclist to be caught out in what was , if the test results are confirmed , a brazen attempt at cheating . the public outcry after vinokourov and team astana 's sorry departure from the tour was predictable .
so , too , was the organizers ' attempt to put a positive spin on the scandal by claiming that it proved the effectiveness of anti-doping tests . the incident , however , also broached an issue that an increasing number of hardcore cycling fans have raised during the course of this particularly ill-fated tour .
is it not unfair of the media to pillory cycling while remaining more-or-less silent about comparable abuses in other sports ? indeed , there is a certain measure of hypocrisy here .
no one would seriously contend that soccer , tennis or even golf is free from athletes using banned performance-enhancing substances or techniques .
the line between cheating and gaining a competitive advantage in pursuit of that all-important goal , victory , is at best blurry . nonetheless , because of the nature of cycling itself , doping presents a particular threat to the athletes ' and the sport 's credibility . cycling - and especially its premier event , the tour de france - is not a game of hand-to-eye coordination .
it is a contest of perseverance without any nifty one-two combinations , breathtaking goals or diving saves . the appeal of cycling depends on the ideal of the lone rider overcoming the constraints of the human body .
the drama of a race - for instance , the point at which the eventual winner pedals away from the pack - resides in spectators being able to imagine that he is breaking through his own personal pain barrier and summoning up previously unknown reserves of strength and determination . that illusion is completely dispelled when the audience assumes that the decisive surge is just the epo kicking in . it 's an unavoidable fact that doping provides more of a competitive advantage in cycling than it does in many other sports .
a transfusion of oxygen-enriched blood , for instance , might give a soccer or tennis player extra energy for a 15-minute overtime period or a long fifth set .
but in the absence of individual skill , it would n't help them flick a lob over the keeper 's head or paint the baseline at match point . in cycling , as disgraced tour de france winner floyd landis seems to have shown last year , hormones alone can turn the tide .
when doping is introduced into the sporting equation , cycling appears more and more like a contest between medical teams - and who wants to watch a bunch of physicians battling it out ? the effectiveness of doping in cycling also makes it more difficult to eradicate , and the sport is set to pay heavily for this inherent shortcoming .

" in tewkesbury , one teenage boy is still missing , one man died in a flooded cellar and a woman trapped in the floods lost her premature newborn twins despite being airlifted out . " britain must do more " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volunteers try to stop a forest fire in italy meanwhile , british prime minister gordon brown has acknowledged that infrastructure deficits exist .

the fire forced people to flee from campsites and hotels . tourists had to be rescued via patrol boats and helicopters . authorities said at least two people were caught in the fires and burned alive in their car , while another pair on a beach suffocated . the heat wave is reminiscent of that in france in 2003 , when scorching temperatures led to the early deaths of up to 15,000 mainly elderly people . the effects of climate change ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a zest for cooling off in italy forests in bosnia , serbia , montenegro , macedonia , bulgaria and greece have also been ravaged by fires this week , blamed on record-high temperatures following a dry winter . temperatures in macedonia have reached an all-time record high of 45 degrees , with many parts of the country without power as high consumption , likely from the use of air-conditioning units , overloaded transmission lines , officials said . authorities in the balkans warned people to stay indoors to avoid the extreme heat . the extreme weather has prompted debate about whether the effects of global warming are at hand .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de mergers & acquisitions -pipe- 25.07.2007 protectionists happy as siemens sells vdo within germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siemens agreed with continental 's argument about not letting vdo fall into foreign hands the battle for german engineering giant siemens ' auto subsidiary vdo has been won by compatriot auto parts group continental .
the deal satisfies germany 's protectionists who warned against selling outside the country . us firm trw had challenged for vdo , but siemens appears to have been swayed by continental 's argument that german technology should not be put into foreign hands .
the fee of 11.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 15.7 billion -rrb- for the subsidiary may have also been a factor in siemens ' decision .
the decision to sell within germany is certain please german politicians who were strongly against vdo going to a foreign firm and have recently floated the idea of placing limits on foreign investment in germany 's " core " business branches .
politicians in favor of continental bid last week , christian wulff , the conservative premier of lower saxony , spoke publicly about his support for continental 's bid for vdo .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wulff publicly advocated continental 's bid for vdo " we want conti and vdo to merge , then there would be a large automotive parts supplier operating throughout the globe out of germany , " wulff told german regional public radio station ndr .
" it would look a lot worse for the employees of the automotive supplier division of siemens if international financial investors got their hands on technology , jobs and production plants here , " wulff added .

meeting at the german embassy in vienna , officials from the us , russia , germany , france , britain and italy attempted to overcome the us-russian deadlock over the un plan to grant kosovo internationally monitored independence and to find a new format for talks .
eu foreign ministers had decided monday to limit new talks to 120 days and hold them within a smaller format to make them more effective .
germany suggested a troika of the eu , russia and us to lead the negotiations .
in a surprise move , russia agreed on the troika format suggested by german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier at the eu foreign ministers ' meeting on monday . moscow has previously said it is against moving kosovo negotiations away from the un security council , where it , along with the four other permanent council members , has the ability to veto any resolution tabled , and president vladimir putin on tuesday had again rejected talks on kosovo 's independence , fearing this could create a precedent for secession in other regions . ahtisaari steps down empty-handed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahtisaari leaves with his plan blowing in the wind meanwhile , the un 's special envoy to kosovo , martti ahtisaari , said wednesday he regarded his mission as over , saying , " my work is done . "
the 70-year-old former finnish president and career diplomat had previously said he would not prolong his engagement if either kosovo or serbia blocked the process towards determining the break-away province ’ s status .
ahtisaari has said neither the un nor the contact group had asked him to continue mediations in the face of russia 's persistent refusal to support independence for the serbian province .
he has , however , said he would be willing to take on " a role as consultant " if requested .
ahtisaari ’ s mediating efforts had been repeatedly criticized by serbia and russia as being partial towards the kosovo side .
in january , after a year of talks between serbia and kosovar albanians , he presented a proposal granting internationally monitored independence to the province .
this was rejected by moscow and belgrade .
continuing this stalemate , russian foreign minister sergei lavrov had said on tuesday that ahtisaari 's roadmap was no basis for new talks .
for the us , however , the un plan is not negotiable .
the southern serbian province had been under un administration since nato forced serbian troops to withdraw .
serbia cranks up rhetoric over unilateral independence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " self governance " is the priority for kosovans kosovo 's ethnic albanian majority , frustrated by setbacks and delays , will accept nothing short of full independence .
belgrade is only ready to grant far-reaching autonomy , fearing kosovo 's serb minority will be endangered in case of independence .
a unilateral declaration of independence by the province 's leadership could lead to a further destabilization of the region , diplomats fear .
while the us indicated it may recognize the country , secretary of state condoleezza rice also warned kosovo 's leaders not to short-circuit diplomatic efforts .
kosovo 's political leaders have issued contradictory statements as to whether the province would unilaterally declare independence .
" i think , given where we are in the diplomacy , it 's unlikely that we will get full agreement , " us state department spokesman sean mccormack told reporters in washington .
" but it is our belief - and the shared belief of many - that , in the absence of that end point , independence for kosovo , that you are actually going to see an outbreak of further violence in the region , which is n't good for anybody . "
fearing that kosovo would push forward alone as the stalemate continued , the parliament of serbia overwhelmingly voted late on tuesday to back the government 's resolution to reject any move to grant independence .
the resolution says the government will " respond promptly and energetically " to any indication of unilateral recognition of an independent kosovo , but the draft gives no details on measures the government should take .
" serbia will reject any attempt by -lrb- kosovo -rrb- albanians to unilaterally proclaim independence , " serbian prime minister vojislav kostunica said , adding that " any state that wants normal and friendly relations with serbia must respect the un charter , which guarantees that the internationally recognized borders can not be altered . "
however , aleksandar vucic of the hard-line nationalist serbian radical party accused the government of being " too meek " and demanded a break of diplomatic relations with any state recognizing an independent kosovo .
his party leader tomislav nikolic called on the government to give up its plans for serbia to join the european union and nato and " use all available means to defend our kosovo . "
un governor warns of increasing frustration bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rücker warned that kosovars are reaching their limit elsewhere , the un governor in kosovo , joachim rücker , returned to pristina after meeting with the eu foreign ministers this week and admitted that he had issued the europeans with a warning over further delaying a decision the people of kosovo had been led to expect by last october .

meeting at the german embassy in vienna , officials from the us , russia , germany , france , britain and italy attempted to overcome the us-russian deadlock over the un plan to grant kosovo internationally monitored independence and to find a new format for talks .
eu foreign ministers had decided monday to limit new talks to 120 days and hold them within a smaller format to make them more effective .
germany suggested a troika of the eu , russia and us to lead the negotiations .
in a surprise move , russia agreed on the troika format suggested by german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier at the eu foreign ministers ' meeting on monday . moscow has previously said it is against moving kosovo negotiations away from the un security council , where it , along with the four other permanent council members , has the ability to veto any resolution tabled , and president vladimir putin on tuesday had again rejected talks on kosovo 's independence , fearing this could create a precedent for secession in other regions . ahtisaari steps down empty-handed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahtisaari leaves with his plan blowing in the wind meanwhile , the un 's special envoy to kosovo , martti ahtisaari , said wednesday he regarded his mission as over , saying , " my work is done . "
the 70-year-old former finnish president and career diplomat had previously said he would not prolong his engagement if either kosovo or serbia blocked the process towards determining the break-away province ’ s status .
ahtisaari has said neither the un nor the contact group had asked him to continue mediations in the face of russia 's persistent refusal to support independence for the serbian province .
he has , however , said he would be willing to take on " a role as consultant " if requested .
ahtisaari ’ s mediating efforts had been repeatedly criticized by serbia and russia as being partial towards the kosovo side .
in january , after a year of talks between serbia and kosovar albanians , he presented a proposal granting internationally monitored independence to the province .
this was rejected by moscow and belgrade .
continuing this stalemate , russian foreign minister sergei lavrov had said on tuesday that ahtisaari 's roadmap was no basis for new talks .
for the us , however , the un plan is not negotiable .
the southern serbian province had been under un administration since nato forced serbian troops to withdraw .
serbia cranks up rhetoric over unilateral independence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " self governance " is the priority for kosovans kosovo 's ethnic albanian majority , frustrated by setbacks and delays , will accept nothing short of full independence .
belgrade is only ready to grant far-reaching autonomy , fearing kosovo 's serb minority will be endangered in case of independence .
a unilateral declaration of independence by the province 's leadership could lead to a further destabilization of the region , diplomats fear .
while the us indicated it may recognize the country , secretary of state condoleezza rice also warned kosovo 's leaders not to short-circuit diplomatic efforts .
kosovo 's political leaders have issued contradictory statements as to whether the province would unilaterally declare independence .
" i think , given where we are in the diplomacy , it 's unlikely that we will get full agreement , " us state department spokesman sean mccormack told reporters in washington .
" but it is our belief - and the shared belief of many - that , in the absence of that end point , independence for kosovo , that you are actually going to see an outbreak of further violence in the region , which is n't good for anybody . "
fearing that kosovo would push forward alone as the stalemate continued , the parliament of serbia overwhelmingly voted late on tuesday to back the government 's resolution to reject any move to grant independence .
the resolution says the government will " respond promptly and energetically " to any indication of unilateral recognition of an independent kosovo , but the draft gives no details on measures the government should take .
" serbia will reject any attempt by -lrb- kosovo -rrb- albanians to unilaterally proclaim independence , " serbian prime minister vojislav kostunica said , adding that " any state that wants normal and friendly relations with serbia must respect the un charter , which guarantees that the internationally recognized borders can not be altered . "
however , aleksandar vucic of the hard-line nationalist serbian radical party accused the government of being " too meek " and demanded a break of diplomatic relations with any state recognizing an independent kosovo .
his party leader tomislav nikolic called on the government to give up its plans for serbia to join the european union and nato and " use all available means to defend our kosovo . "

in a surprise move , russia agreed on the troika format suggested by german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier at the eu foreign ministers ' meeting on monday . moscow has previously said it is against moving kosovo negotiations away from the un security council , where it , along with the four other permanent council members , has the ability to veto any resolution tabled , and president vladimir putin on tuesday had again rejected talks on kosovo 's independence , fearing this could create a precedent for secession in other regions . ahtisaari steps down empty-handed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahtisaari leaves with his plan blowing in the wind meanwhile , the un 's special envoy to kosovo , martti ahtisaari , said wednesday he regarded his mission as over , saying , " my work is done . "
the 70-year-old former finnish president and career diplomat had previously said he would not prolong his engagement if either kosovo or serbia blocked the process towards determining the break-away province ’ s status .
ahtisaari has said neither the un nor the contact group had asked him to continue mediations in the face of russia 's persistent refusal to support independence for the serbian province .
he has , however , said he would be willing to take on " a role as consultant " if requested .
ahtisaari ’ s mediating efforts had been repeatedly criticized by serbia and russia as being partial towards the kosovo side .
in january , after a year of talks between serbia and kosovar albanians , he presented a proposal granting internationally monitored independence to the province .
this was rejected by moscow and belgrade .
continuing this stalemate , russian foreign minister sergei lavrov had said on tuesday that ahtisaari 's roadmap was no basis for new talks .
for the us , however , the un plan is not negotiable .
the southern serbian province had been under un administration since nato forced serbian troops to withdraw .
serbia cranks up rhetoric over unilateral independence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " self governance " is the priority for kosovans kosovo 's ethnic albanian majority , frustrated by setbacks and delays , will accept nothing short of full independence .
belgrade is only ready to grant far-reaching autonomy , fearing kosovo 's serb minority will be endangered in case of independence .
a unilateral declaration of independence by the province 's leadership could lead to a further destabilization of the region , diplomats fear .
while the us indicated it may recognize the country , secretary of state condoleezza rice also warned kosovo 's leaders not to short-circuit diplomatic efforts .
kosovo 's political leaders have issued contradictory statements as to whether the province would unilaterally declare independence .
" i think , given where we are in the diplomacy , it 's unlikely that we will get full agreement , " us state department spokesman sean mccormack told reporters in washington .
" but it is our belief - and the shared belief of many - that , in the absence of that end point , independence for kosovo , that you are actually going to see an outbreak of further violence in the region , which is n't good for anybody . "
fearing that kosovo would push forward alone as the stalemate continued , the parliament of serbia overwhelmingly voted late on tuesday to back the government 's resolution to reject any move to grant independence .
the resolution says the government will " respond promptly and energetically " to any indication of unilateral recognition of an independent kosovo , but the draft gives no details on measures the government should take .
" serbia will reject any attempt by -lrb- kosovo -rrb- albanians to unilaterally proclaim independence , " serbian prime minister vojislav kostunica said , adding that " any state that wants normal and friendly relations with serbia must respect the un charter , which guarantees that the internationally recognized borders can not be altered . "
however , aleksandar vucic of the hard-line nationalist serbian radical party accused the government of being " too meek " and demanded a break of diplomatic relations with any state recognizing an independent kosovo .
his party leader tomislav nikolic called on the government to give up its plans for serbia to join the european union and nato and " use all available means to defend our kosovo . "
un governor warns of increasing frustration bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rücker warned that kosovars are reaching their limit elsewhere , the un governor in kosovo , joachim rücker , returned to pristina after meeting with the eu foreign ministers this week and admitted that he had issued the europeans with a warning over further delaying a decision the people of kosovo had been led to expect by last october .
" i stressed that there is a lot of anxiety and tension and people need and deserve clarity on status and also on the status process , " rücker told reporters .
he called on the major powers to set a clear roadmap to the final status of kosovo and end the increasingly frustrating wait for those who had lived under un rule for eight years .

meeting at the german embassy in vienna , officials from the us , russia , germany , france , britain and italy attempted to overcome the us-russian deadlock over the un plan to grant kosovo internationally monitored independence and to find a new format for talks .

sarkozy 's wife , cecilia , and his top aide , claude gueant , helped negotiate the liberation of the five bulgarian nurses and a palestinian doctor who received bulgarian citizenship .
the six had been sentenced to death for allegedly infecting more than 400 libyan children with aids .
the anti-nuclear group sortir du nucleaire has charged that sarkozy helped liberate the nurses by promising to help build up libya 's nuclear energy program .
two nuclear deals signed " sarkozy seems already to have forgotten that gadhafi is a dictator , " the group said in a press statement .
" to deliver atomic energy technology to libya means helping the country build nuclear weapons . "
the two countries signed a memorandum of understanding on the construction of a libyan nuclear reactor for water desalination , said gueant , who accompanied sarkozy on the trip . gueant added that " there is still much work to do " on the feasibility study of the desalination project . a second agreement , outlining a framework for civilian nuclear energy cooperation was also signed at the end of the talks between kadhafi and sarkozy by libyan foreign minister abdel rahman shalgham and his french counterpart , bernard kouchner , officials said . sarkozy in search of energy deals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy was looking to strike deals with gadhafi in addition to strengthening ties between the oil exporting nation and the west by making libya part of the mediterranean union sarkozy is trying to establish , the french president had hoped to land big contracts for the french nuclear energy company areva and petroleum giant total .
before sarkozy landed in libya on wednesday , presidential spokesman david martinon confirmed this on french television : " what we are going to talk about is wide-ranging cooperation , in all fields .
" we can do a lot more and a lot better with libya , and that is why the head of state is traveling there , " he added .
the presidential airbus landed at mitiga military airport on wednesday afternoon and sarkozy and kouchner headed straight to the bab azizia palace for an official welcoming ceremony and then to the signing of the cooperation agreements .
the french entourage was to attend a dinner hosted by libyan leader gadhafi at bab azizia , a sprawling complex outside tripoli .
following his visit to libya , where he wrote he was " happy to be in your country to talk about the future " in a guest book , sarkozy will travel on to senegal , south africa and congo .
libya expected to become trading partner du jour bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : libya 's oilfields are of particular interest to western partners analysts believe the resources-rich north african country could now become a key trading partner for france and other western states after the negotiations which saw the bulgarian nurses released .
according to a libyan government official , new deals could cover the areas of security , energy , education , immigration , health and scientific research .
franco-libyan relations have been steadily improving since a 2004 accord on a libyan compensation deal for the victims of a french dc-10 airliner bombing over niger , which killed 170 people , including 54 french nationals , in 1989 .
the upturn paved the way for a visit by sarkozy 's predecessor jacques chirac in november 2004 .
the two countries resumed defense cooperation in february 2005 and struck an accord on civilian nuclear research in march 2006 .
french aerospace manufacturer dassault has also struck an agreement to service 12 french-bought mirage f1 jets - although it denies persistent rumors of negotiations on a libyan purchase of its rafale fighter .
french exports to the country jumped 43.4 percent in 2006 to reach 433.6 million euros -lrb- $ 600 million -rrb- - although it imported 1.9 billion euros worth of goods - almost all oil - from libya over the same period . article based on new reports -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

sarkozy 's wife , cecilia , and his top aide , claude gueant , helped negotiate the liberation of the five bulgarian nurses and a palestinian doctor who received bulgarian citizenship .
the six had been sentenced to death for allegedly infecting more than 400 libyan children with aids .
the anti-nuclear group sortir du nucleaire has charged that sarkozy helped liberate the nurses by promising to help build up libya 's nuclear energy program .

" we can do a lot more and a lot better with libya , and that is why the head of state is traveling there , " he added .
the presidential airbus landed at mitiga military airport on wednesday afternoon and sarkozy and kouchner headed straight to the bab azizia palace for an official welcoming ceremony and then to the signing of the cooperation agreements .
the french entourage was to attend a dinner hosted by libyan leader gadhafi at bab azizia , a sprawling complex outside tripoli .

dw spoke with four of the singers who are preparing to take the stage . in her bayreuth premiere last year , canadian mezzo-soprano adrianne pieczonka impressed the audience with her perfect intonation , warm timbre and convincing portrayal of the role of sieglinde in " die walküre . "
in the interview , she describes her approach to the role and her experience of rehearsing and performing in the legendary bayreuth opera house . in opera , vocal soloists often have to come to terms with texts in languages that are foreign to them and roles and characters that may be difficult to relate to .
south african mezzo-soprano michelle breedt has given a lot of thought to her role , that of fricka in wagner 's " der ring des nibelungen . "
click to listen to the interview , where she reveals herself as a highly inspired and insightful artist : bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the trip to bayreuth 's festspielhaus can often be a long one for opera singers when it comes to wagnerian opera , many vocalists consider it the supreme privilege to sing in the theater the composer himself designed for his music dramas .
but sometimes the route to bayreuth is a surprisingly indirect one , as indicated by american tenor stephen gould , who sings the role of siegfried in the current production of " der ring des nibelungen . " part of the attraction of wagner lies in the universal nature of the stories , dealing with jealousy , ambition , humiliation , murder and incest , but also with more noble issues like altruism and - most significantly - love .

but dw 's jefferson chase thinks that 's inevitable because of the way the sport itself works . it was hard not to feel just a tiny bit sorry for the organizers of the tour de france when the news broke that alexander vinokourov had flunked a doping test .
the last thing the already embattled event needed was for another top cyclist to be caught out in what was , if the test results are confirmed , a brazen attempt at cheating . the public outcry after vinokourov and team astana 's sorry departure from the tour was predictable .
so , too , was the organizers ' attempt to put a positive spin on the scandal by claiming that it proved the effectiveness of anti-doping tests . the incident , however , also broached an issue that an increasing number of hardcore cycling fans have raised during the course of this particularly ill-fated tour .
is it not unfair of the media to pillory cycling while remaining more-or-less silent about comparable abuses in other sports ? indeed , there is a certain measure of hypocrisy here .
no one would seriously contend that soccer , tennis or even golf is free from athletes using banned performance-enhancing substances or techniques .
the line between cheating and gaining a competitive advantage in pursuit of that all-important goal , victory , is at best blurry . nonetheless , because of the nature of cycling itself , doping presents a particular threat to the athletes ' and the sport 's credibility . cycling - and especially its premier event , the tour de france - is not a game of hand-to-eye coordination .
it is a contest of perseverance without any nifty one-two combinations , breathtaking goals or diving saves . the appeal of cycling depends on the ideal of the lone rider overcoming the constraints of the human body .
the drama of a race - for instance , the point at which the eventual winner pedals away from the pack - resides in spectators being able to imagine that he is breaking through his own personal pain barrier and summoning up previously unknown reserves of strength and determination . that illusion is completely dispelled when the audience assumes that the decisive surge is just the epo kicking in . it 's an unavoidable fact that doping provides more of a competitive advantage in cycling than it does in many other sports .
a transfusion of oxygen-enriched blood , for instance , might give a soccer or tennis player extra energy for a 15-minute overtime period or a long fifth set .
but in the absence of individual skill , it would n't help them flick a lob over the keeper 's head or paint the baseline at match point . in cycling , as disgraced tour de france winner floyd landis seems to have shown last year , hormones alone can turn the tide .
when doping is introduced into the sporting equation , cycling appears more and more like a contest between medical teams - and who wants to watch a bunch of physicians battling it out ? the effectiveness of doping in cycling also makes it more difficult to eradicate , and the sport is set to pay heavily for this inherent shortcoming .
major sponsors like t-mobile are likely to scale back or discontinue their sponsorship of teams , and tv stations will certainly think twice about shelling out major cash for the broadcast rights to next year 's tour de france . and that may be the only silver lining in the very dark cloud that hangs over cycling at the moment .

sarkozy 's wife , cecilia , and his top aide , claude gueant , helped negotiate the liberation of the five bulgarian nurses and a palestinian doctor who received bulgarian citizenship .
the six had been sentenced to death for allegedly infecting more than 400 libyan children with aids .
the anti-nuclear group sortir du nucleaire has charged that sarkozy helped liberate the nurses by promising to help build up libya 's nuclear energy program .
two nuclear deals signed " sarkozy seems already to have forgotten that gadhafi is a dictator , " the group said in a press statement .
" to deliver atomic energy technology to libya means helping the country build nuclear weapons . "
the two countries signed a memorandum of understanding on the construction of a libyan nuclear reactor for water desalination , said gueant , who accompanied sarkozy on the trip . gueant added that " there is still much work to do " on the feasibility study of the desalination project . a second agreement , outlining a framework for civilian nuclear energy cooperation was also signed at the end of the talks between kadhafi and sarkozy by libyan foreign minister abdel rahman shalgham and his french counterpart , bernard kouchner , officials said . sarkozy in search of energy deals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy was looking to strike deals with gadhafi in addition to strengthening ties between the oil exporting nation and the west by making libya part of the mediterranean union sarkozy is trying to establish , the french president had hoped to land big contracts for the french nuclear energy company areva and petroleum giant total .
before sarkozy landed in libya on wednesday , presidential spokesman david martinon confirmed this on french television : " what we are going to talk about is wide-ranging cooperation , in all fields .
" we can do a lot more and a lot better with libya , and that is why the head of state is traveling there , " he added .
the presidential airbus landed at mitiga military airport on wednesday afternoon and sarkozy and kouchner headed straight to the bab azizia palace for an official welcoming ceremony and then to the signing of the cooperation agreements .
the french entourage was to attend a dinner hosted by libyan leader gadhafi at bab azizia , a sprawling complex outside tripoli .
following his visit to libya , where he wrote he was " happy to be in your country to talk about the future " in a guest book , sarkozy will travel on to senegal , south africa and congo .
libya expected to become trading partner du jour bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : libya 's oilfields are of particular interest to western partners analysts believe the resources-rich north african country could now become a key trading partner for france and other western states after the negotiations which saw the bulgarian nurses released .
according to a libyan government official , new deals could cover the areas of security , energy , education , immigration , health and scientific research .
franco-libyan relations have been steadily improving since a 2004 accord on a libyan compensation deal for the victims of a french dc-10 airliner bombing over niger , which killed 170 people , including 54 french nationals , in 1989 .
the upturn paved the way for a visit by sarkozy 's predecessor jacques chirac in november 2004 .
the two countries resumed defense cooperation in february 2005 and struck an accord on civilian nuclear research in march 2006 .
french aerospace manufacturer dassault has also struck an agreement to service 12 french-bought mirage f1 jets - although it denies persistent rumors of negotiations on a libyan purchase of its rafale fighter .
french exports to the country jumped 43.4 percent in 2006 to reach 433.6 million euros -lrb- $ 600 million -rrb- - although it imported 1.9 billion euros worth of goods - almost all oil - from libya over the same period . article based on new reports -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

franco-libyan relations have been steadily improving since a 2004 accord on a libyan compensation deal for the victims of a french dc-10 airliner bombing over niger , which killed 170 people , including 54 french nationals , in 1989 .
the upturn paved the way for a visit by sarkozy 's predecessor jacques chirac in november 2004 .
the two countries resumed defense cooperation in february 2005 and struck an accord on civilian nuclear research in march 2006 .
french aerospace manufacturer dassault has also struck an agreement to service 12 french-bought mirage f1 jets - although it denies persistent rumors of negotiations on a libyan purchase of its rafale fighter .
french exports to the country jumped 43.4 percent in 2006 to reach 433.6 million euros -lrb- $ 600 million -rrb- - although it imported 1.9 billion euros worth of goods - almost all oil - from libya over the same period . article based on new reports -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but dw 's jefferson chase thinks that 's inevitable because of the way the sport itself works . it was hard not to feel just a tiny bit sorry for the organizers of the tour de france when the news broke that alexander vinokourov had flunked a doping test .
the last thing the already embattled event needed was for another top cyclist to be caught out in what was , if the test results are confirmed , a brazen attempt at cheating . the public outcry after vinokourov and team astana 's sorry departure from the tour was predictable .
so , too , was the organizers ' attempt to put a positive spin on the scandal by claiming that it proved the effectiveness of anti-doping tests . the incident , however , also broached an issue that an increasing number of hardcore cycling fans have raised during the course of this particularly ill-fated tour .
is it not unfair of the media to pillory cycling while remaining more-or-less silent about comparable abuses in other sports ? indeed , there is a certain measure of hypocrisy here .
no one would seriously contend that soccer , tennis or even golf is free from athletes using banned performance-enhancing substances or techniques .
the line between cheating and gaining a competitive advantage in pursuit of that all-important goal , victory , is at best blurry . nonetheless , because of the nature of cycling itself , doping presents a particular threat to the athletes ' and the sport 's credibility . cycling - and especially its premier event , the tour de france - is not a game of hand-to-eye coordination .
it is a contest of perseverance without any nifty one-two combinations , breathtaking goals or diving saves . the appeal of cycling depends on the ideal of the lone rider overcoming the constraints of the human body .
the drama of a race - for instance , the point at which the eventual winner pedals away from the pack - resides in spectators being able to imagine that he is breaking through his own personal pain barrier and summoning up previously unknown reserves of strength and determination . that illusion is completely dispelled when the audience assumes that the decisive surge is just the epo kicking in . it 's an unavoidable fact that doping provides more of a competitive advantage in cycling than it does in many other sports .
a transfusion of oxygen-enriched blood , for instance , might give a soccer or tennis player extra energy for a 15-minute overtime period or a long fifth set .
but in the absence of individual skill , it would n't help them flick a lob over the keeper 's head or paint the baseline at match point . in cycling , as disgraced tour de france winner floyd landis seems to have shown last year , hormones alone can turn the tide .
when doping is introduced into the sporting equation , cycling appears more and more like a contest between medical teams - and who wants to watch a bunch of physicians battling it out ? the effectiveness of doping in cycling also makes it more difficult to eradicate , and the sport is set to pay heavily for this inherent shortcoming .
major sponsors like t-mobile are likely to scale back or discontinue their sponsorship of teams , and tv stations will certainly think twice about shelling out major cash for the broadcast rights to next year 's tour de france . and that may be the only silver lining in the very dark cloud that hangs over cycling at the moment .

meeting at the german embassy in vienna , officials from the us , russia , germany , france , britain and italy attempted to overcome the us-russian deadlock over the un plan to grant kosovo internationally monitored independence and to find a new format for talks .
eu foreign ministers had decided monday to limit new talks to 120 days and hold them within a smaller format to make them more effective .
germany suggested a troika of the eu , russia and us to lead the negotiations .
in a surprise move , russia agreed on the troika format suggested by german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier at the eu foreign ministers ' meeting on monday . moscow has previously said it is against moving kosovo negotiations away from the un security council , where it , along with the four other permanent council members , has the ability to veto any resolution tabled , and president vladimir putin on tuesday had again rejected talks on kosovo 's independence , fearing this could create a precedent for secession in other regions . ahtisaari steps down empty-handed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahtisaari leaves with his plan blowing in the wind meanwhile , the un 's special envoy to kosovo , martti ahtisaari , said wednesday he regarded his mission as over , saying , " my work is done . "
the 70-year-old former finnish president and career diplomat had previously said he would not prolong his engagement if either kosovo or serbia blocked the process towards determining the break-away province ’ s status .
ahtisaari has said neither the un nor the contact group had asked him to continue mediations in the face of russia 's persistent refusal to support independence for the serbian province .
he has , however , said he would be willing to take on " a role as consultant " if requested .
ahtisaari ’ s mediating efforts had been repeatedly criticized by serbia and russia as being partial towards the kosovo side .
in january , after a year of talks between serbia and kosovar albanians , he presented a proposal granting internationally monitored independence to the province .
this was rejected by moscow and belgrade .
continuing this stalemate , russian foreign minister sergei lavrov had said on tuesday that ahtisaari 's roadmap was no basis for new talks .
for the us , however , the un plan is not negotiable .
the southern serbian province had been under un administration since nato forced serbian troops to withdraw .
serbia cranks up rhetoric over unilateral independence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " self governance " is the priority for kosovans kosovo 's ethnic albanian majority , frustrated by setbacks and delays , will accept nothing short of full independence .
belgrade is only ready to grant far-reaching autonomy , fearing kosovo 's serb minority will be endangered in case of independence .
a unilateral declaration of independence by the province 's leadership could lead to a further destabilization of the region , diplomats fear .
while the us indicated it may recognize the country , secretary of state condoleezza rice also warned kosovo 's leaders not to short-circuit diplomatic efforts .
kosovo 's political leaders have issued contradictory statements as to whether the province would unilaterally declare independence .
" i think , given where we are in the diplomacy , it 's unlikely that we will get full agreement , " us state department spokesman sean mccormack told reporters in washington .
" but it is our belief - and the shared belief of many - that , in the absence of that end point , independence for kosovo , that you are actually going to see an outbreak of further violence in the region , which is n't good for anybody . "
fearing that kosovo would push forward alone as the stalemate continued , the parliament of serbia overwhelmingly voted late on tuesday to back the government 's resolution to reject any move to grant independence .
the resolution says the government will " respond promptly and energetically " to any indication of unilateral recognition of an independent kosovo , but the draft gives no details on measures the government should take .
" serbia will reject any attempt by -lrb- kosovo -rrb- albanians to unilaterally proclaim independence , " serbian prime minister vojislav kostunica said , adding that " any state that wants normal and friendly relations with serbia must respect the un charter , which guarantees that the internationally recognized borders can not be altered . "
however , aleksandar vucic of the hard-line nationalist serbian radical party accused the government of being " too meek " and demanded a break of diplomatic relations with any state recognizing an independent kosovo .
his party leader tomislav nikolic called on the government to give up its plans for serbia to join the european union and nato and " use all available means to defend our kosovo . "

" i stressed that there is a lot of anxiety and tension and people need and deserve clarity on status and also on the status process , " rücker told reporters .
he called on the major powers to set a clear roadmap to the final status of kosovo and end the increasingly frustrating wait for those who had lived under un rule for eight years .

meeting at the german embassy in vienna , officials from the us , russia , germany , france , britain and italy attempted to overcome the us-russian deadlock over the un plan to grant kosovo internationally monitored independence and to find a new format for talks .
eu foreign ministers had decided monday to limit new talks to 120 days and hold them within a smaller format to make them more effective .
germany suggested a troika of the eu , russia and us to lead the negotiations .
in a surprise move , russia agreed on the troika format suggested by german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier at the eu foreign ministers ' meeting on monday . moscow has previously said it is against moving kosovo negotiations away from the un security council , where it , along with the four other permanent council members , has the ability to veto any resolution tabled , and president vladimir putin on tuesday had again rejected talks on kosovo 's independence , fearing this could create a precedent for secession in other regions . ahtisaari steps down empty-handed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahtisaari leaves with his plan blowing in the wind meanwhile , the un 's special envoy to kosovo , martti ahtisaari , said wednesday he regarded his mission as over , saying , " my work is done . "
the 70-year-old former finnish president and career diplomat had previously said he would not prolong his engagement if either kosovo or serbia blocked the process towards determining the break-away province ’ s status .
ahtisaari has said neither the un nor the contact group had asked him to continue mediations in the face of russia 's persistent refusal to support independence for the serbian province .
he has , however , said he would be willing to take on " a role as consultant " if requested .
ahtisaari ’ s mediating efforts had been repeatedly criticized by serbia and russia as being partial towards the kosovo side .
in january , after a year of talks between serbia and kosovar albanians , he presented a proposal granting internationally monitored independence to the province .
this was rejected by moscow and belgrade .
continuing this stalemate , russian foreign minister sergei lavrov had said on tuesday that ahtisaari 's roadmap was no basis for new talks .
for the us , however , the un plan is not negotiable .
the southern serbian province had been under un administration since nato forced serbian troops to withdraw .
serbia cranks up rhetoric over unilateral independence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " self governance " is the priority for kosovans kosovo 's ethnic albanian majority , frustrated by setbacks and delays , will accept nothing short of full independence .
belgrade is only ready to grant far-reaching autonomy , fearing kosovo 's serb minority will be endangered in case of independence .
a unilateral declaration of independence by the province 's leadership could lead to a further destabilization of the region , diplomats fear .
while the us indicated it may recognize the country , secretary of state condoleezza rice also warned kosovo 's leaders not to short-circuit diplomatic efforts .
kosovo 's political leaders have issued contradictory statements as to whether the province would unilaterally declare independence .
" i think , given where we are in the diplomacy , it 's unlikely that we will get full agreement , " us state department spokesman sean mccormack told reporters in washington .
" but it is our belief - and the shared belief of many - that , in the absence of that end point , independence for kosovo , that you are actually going to see an outbreak of further violence in the region , which is n't good for anybody . "
fearing that kosovo would push forward alone as the stalemate continued , the parliament of serbia overwhelmingly voted late on tuesday to back the government 's resolution to reject any move to grant independence .
the resolution says the government will " respond promptly and energetically " to any indication of unilateral recognition of an independent kosovo , but the draft gives no details on measures the government should take .
" serbia will reject any attempt by -lrb- kosovo -rrb- albanians to unilaterally proclaim independence , " serbian prime minister vojislav kostunica said , adding that " any state that wants normal and friendly relations with serbia must respect the un charter , which guarantees that the internationally recognized borders can not be altered . "
however , aleksandar vucic of the hard-line nationalist serbian radical party accused the government of being " too meek " and demanded a break of diplomatic relations with any state recognizing an independent kosovo .
his party leader tomislav nikolic called on the government to give up its plans for serbia to join the european union and nato and " use all available means to defend our kosovo . "

he has , however , said he would be willing to take on " a role as consultant " if requested .
ahtisaari ’ s mediating efforts had been repeatedly criticized by serbia and russia as being partial towards the kosovo side .
in january , after a year of talks between serbia and kosovar albanians , he presented a proposal granting internationally monitored independence to the province .
this was rejected by moscow and belgrade .
continuing this stalemate , russian foreign minister sergei lavrov had said on tuesday that ahtisaari 's roadmap was no basis for new talks .
for the us , however , the un plan is not negotiable .
the southern serbian province had been under un administration since nato forced serbian troops to withdraw .
serbia cranks up rhetoric over unilateral independence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " self governance " is the priority for kosovans kosovo 's ethnic albanian majority , frustrated by setbacks and delays , will accept nothing short of full independence .
belgrade is only ready to grant far-reaching autonomy , fearing kosovo 's serb minority will be endangered in case of independence .
a unilateral declaration of independence by the province 's leadership could lead to a further destabilization of the region , diplomats fear .
while the us indicated it may recognize the country , secretary of state condoleezza rice also warned kosovo 's leaders not to short-circuit diplomatic efforts .
kosovo 's political leaders have issued contradictory statements as to whether the province would unilaterally declare independence .
" i think , given where we are in the diplomacy , it 's unlikely that we will get full agreement , " us state department spokesman sean mccormack told reporters in washington .
" but it is our belief - and the shared belief of many - that , in the absence of that end point , independence for kosovo , that you are actually going to see an outbreak of further violence in the region , which is n't good for anybody . "
fearing that kosovo would push forward alone as the stalemate continued , the parliament of serbia overwhelmingly voted late on tuesday to back the government 's resolution to reject any move to grant independence .
the resolution says the government will " respond promptly and energetically " to any indication of unilateral recognition of an independent kosovo , but the draft gives no details on measures the government should take .
" serbia will reject any attempt by -lrb- kosovo -rrb- albanians to unilaterally proclaim independence , " serbian prime minister vojislav kostunica said , adding that " any state that wants normal and friendly relations with serbia must respect the un charter , which guarantees that the internationally recognized borders can not be altered . "
however , aleksandar vucic of the hard-line nationalist serbian radical party accused the government of being " too meek " and demanded a break of diplomatic relations with any state recognizing an independent kosovo .
his party leader tomislav nikolic called on the government to give up its plans for serbia to join the european union and nato and " use all available means to defend our kosovo . "
un governor warns of increasing frustration bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rücker warned that kosovars are reaching their limit elsewhere , the un governor in kosovo , joachim rücker , returned to pristina after meeting with the eu foreign ministers this week and admitted that he had issued the europeans with a warning over further delaying a decision the people of kosovo had been led to expect by last october .
" i stressed that there is a lot of anxiety and tension and people need and deserve clarity on status and also on the status process , " rücker told reporters .
he called on the major powers to set a clear roadmap to the final status of kosovo and end the increasingly frustrating wait for those who had lived under un rule for eight years .
" it will be very helpful if we would have something like roadmap or timetable on the way forward , something more than just an announcement of the time of engagement , " rücker added . article based on news reports -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

five years later , it is globally stretched by two .
military experts are now rethinking the strategy . plans adopted by the united states in 2002 to transform its military into a leaner , more cost-effective force , which would mean significant troop withdrawals from europe , are being reviewed in the light of the on-going conflicts in iraq and afghanistan , and the ever-changing geo-political climate around the world .
experts at the us defense department were studying whether the plans to cut troops on the continent by nearly half , formulated by former us defense secretary donald rumsfeld , were still relevant to today ’ s global challenges , according to an unnamed pentagon source quoted in reports from the associated press monday .
rumsfeld 's plan to reduce troop numbers from 68,000 in 2001 to 28,000 by 2012 was conceived before the united states embarked on the invasion of iraq in 2003 .
defense analysts are now concerned that the plan is outdated , given america 's involvement in two theaters of war , the worsening relations with russia and iran and a recent plan to extend the size and range of the us army .
the source claimed that defense secretary robert gates and the joint chiefs of staff are considering recommendations for a review made in june by gen. bantz craddock , who took over as head of the us european command -lrb- eucom -rrb- last year .
european command chief recommends review bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : craddock -lrb- r . -rrb- believes the 2002 plan is outdated craddock 's report questioned the troop reduction plan and highlighted incidents that hinted at a compromising of us military effectiveness in europe .
as some troop reductions have already taken place and the turnover in deployments to afghanistan , iraq and other " operation enduring freedom " missions increases , us forces in europe have had to postpone , and in some cases cancel , training with armies in european " partner nations . "
that has made it difficult for us military planners to pursue a more active strategy with nations such as poland , the czech republic and former soviet states , and potentially prevent disputes before they occur .
" we have very little capacity left for these ongoing -lrb- operations -rrb- , " said craddock during a congressional hearing concerning his report , referring to european missions .
" our ability to do that now is limited because we do n't have the forces available since they are in the rotation to -lrb- iraq or afghanistan -rrb- . "
an estimated 75 percent of the us military in europe is either deployed to afghanistan or iraq , is about to go , or just returned , according to the defense officials .
us unable to fulfill european commitments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eucom has had to pull out of joint exercises the claims of a review of the troop reduction plan comes just two weeks after the us announced it had emptied the ramstein air base in southwestern germany of nuclear weapons and that it would close five more us military sites in germany by 2009 .
the defense department revealed earlier in july that turley barracks in mannheim , scheduled for closure at the end of september this year , would be followed by us army europe facilities in büdingen and gelnhausen in 2008 .
sites in darmstadt and hanau would also be closed in 2009 , it revealed .
the closure of the five bases would affect 2,372 soldiers , nine airmen , 799 us civilians and 679 local workers .
the announcement was part of the long-term plan to close a total of 51 bases in germany and other areas of western and northern europe .

another problem which craddock revealed in his report relates to the closure of bases in europe , particularly in germany , in regard to returning or wounded soldiers coming out of war zones .
the reduction of barracks and services in europe means that returning us military personnel are now being flown directly to the united states , and in such numbers that it is putting strain on bases in the us which have also been downsized under the rumsfeld-approved base realignment and closure act .

meeting at the german embassy in vienna , officials from the us , russia , germany , france , britain and italy attempted to overcome the us-russian deadlock over the un plan to grant kosovo internationally monitored independence and to find a new format for talks .
eu foreign ministers had decided monday to limit new talks to 120 days and hold them within a smaller format to make them more effective .
germany suggested a troika of the eu , russia and us to lead the negotiations .
in a surprise move , russia agreed on the troika format suggested by german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier at the eu foreign ministers ' meeting on monday . moscow has previously said it is against moving kosovo negotiations away from the un security council , where it , along with the four other permanent council members , has the ability to veto any resolution tabled , and president vladimir putin on tuesday had again rejected talks on kosovo 's independence , fearing this could create a precedent for secession in other regions . ahtisaari steps down empty-handed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahtisaari leaves with his plan blowing in the wind meanwhile , the un 's special envoy to kosovo , martti ahtisaari , said wednesday he regarded his mission as over , saying , " my work is done . "
the 70-year-old former finnish president and career diplomat had previously said he would not prolong his engagement if either kosovo or serbia blocked the process towards determining the break-away province ’ s status .
ahtisaari has said neither the un nor the contact group had asked him to continue mediations in the face of russia 's persistent refusal to support independence for the serbian province .
he has , however , said he would be willing to take on " a role as consultant " if requested .
ahtisaari ’ s mediating efforts had been repeatedly criticized by serbia and russia as being partial towards the kosovo side .
in january , after a year of talks between serbia and kosovar albanians , he presented a proposal granting internationally monitored independence to the province .
this was rejected by moscow and belgrade .
continuing this stalemate , russian foreign minister sergei lavrov had said on tuesday that ahtisaari 's roadmap was no basis for new talks .
for the us , however , the un plan is not negotiable .
the southern serbian province had been under un administration since nato forced serbian troops to withdraw .
serbia cranks up rhetoric over unilateral independence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " self governance " is the priority for kosovans kosovo 's ethnic albanian majority , frustrated by setbacks and delays , will accept nothing short of full independence .
belgrade is only ready to grant far-reaching autonomy , fearing kosovo 's serb minority will be endangered in case of independence .
a unilateral declaration of independence by the province 's leadership could lead to a further destabilization of the region , diplomats fear .
while the us indicated it may recognize the country , secretary of state condoleezza rice also warned kosovo 's leaders not to short-circuit diplomatic efforts .
kosovo 's political leaders have issued contradictory statements as to whether the province would unilaterally declare independence .
" i think , given where we are in the diplomacy , it 's unlikely that we will get full agreement , " us state department spokesman sean mccormack told reporters in washington .
" but it is our belief - and the shared belief of many - that , in the absence of that end point , independence for kosovo , that you are actually going to see an outbreak of further violence in the region , which is n't good for anybody . "
fearing that kosovo would push forward alone as the stalemate continued , the parliament of serbia overwhelmingly voted late on tuesday to back the government 's resolution to reject any move to grant independence .
the resolution says the government will " respond promptly and energetically " to any indication of unilateral recognition of an independent kosovo , but the draft gives no details on measures the government should take .
" serbia will reject any attempt by -lrb- kosovo -rrb- albanians to unilaterally proclaim independence , " serbian prime minister vojislav kostunica said , adding that " any state that wants normal and friendly relations with serbia must respect the un charter , which guarantees that the internationally recognized borders can not be altered . "
however , aleksandar vucic of the hard-line nationalist serbian radical party accused the government of being " too meek " and demanded a break of diplomatic relations with any state recognizing an independent kosovo .
his party leader tomislav nikolic called on the government to give up its plans for serbia to join the european union and nato and " use all available means to defend our kosovo . "
un governor warns of increasing frustration bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rücker warned that kosovars are reaching their limit elsewhere , the un governor in kosovo , joachim rücker , returned to pristina after meeting with the eu foreign ministers this week and admitted that he had issued the europeans with a warning over further delaying a decision the people of kosovo had been led to expect by last october .
" i stressed that there is a lot of anxiety and tension and people need and deserve clarity on status and also on the status process , " rücker told reporters .
he called on the major powers to set a clear roadmap to the final status of kosovo and end the increasingly frustrating wait for those who had lived under un rule for eight years .
" it will be very helpful if we would have something like roadmap or timetable on the way forward , something more than just an announcement of the time of engagement , " rücker added . article based on news reports -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

five years later , it is globally stretched by two .
military experts are now rethinking the strategy . plans adopted by the united states in 2002 to transform its military into a leaner , more cost-effective force , which would mean significant troop withdrawals from europe , are being reviewed in the light of the on-going conflicts in iraq and afghanistan , and the ever-changing geo-political climate around the world .
experts at the us defense department were studying whether the plans to cut troops on the continent by nearly half , formulated by former us defense secretary donald rumsfeld , were still relevant to today ’ s global challenges , according to an unnamed pentagon source quoted in reports from the associated press monday .
rumsfeld 's plan to reduce troop numbers from 68,000 in 2001 to 28,000 by 2012 was conceived before the united states embarked on the invasion of iraq in 2003 .
defense analysts are now concerned that the plan is outdated , given america 's involvement in two theaters of war , the worsening relations with russia and iran and a recent plan to extend the size and range of the us army .
the source claimed that defense secretary robert gates and the joint chiefs of staff are considering recommendations for a review made in june by gen. bantz craddock , who took over as head of the us european command -lrb- eucom -rrb- last year .
european command chief recommends review bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : craddock -lrb- r . -rrb- believes the 2002 plan is outdated craddock 's report questioned the troop reduction plan and highlighted incidents that hinted at a compromising of us military effectiveness in europe .
as some troop reductions have already taken place and the turnover in deployments to afghanistan , iraq and other " operation enduring freedom " missions increases , us forces in europe have had to postpone , and in some cases cancel , training with armies in european " partner nations . "
that has made it difficult for us military planners to pursue a more active strategy with nations such as poland , the czech republic and former soviet states , and potentially prevent disputes before they occur .
" we have very little capacity left for these ongoing -lrb- operations -rrb- , " said craddock during a congressional hearing concerning his report , referring to european missions .
" our ability to do that now is limited because we do n't have the forces available since they are in the rotation to -lrb- iraq or afghanistan -rrb- . "
an estimated 75 percent of the us military in europe is either deployed to afghanistan or iraq , is about to go , or just returned , according to the defense officials .
us unable to fulfill european commitments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eucom has had to pull out of joint exercises the claims of a review of the troop reduction plan comes just two weeks after the us announced it had emptied the ramstein air base in southwestern germany of nuclear weapons and that it would close five more us military sites in germany by 2009 .
the defense department revealed earlier in july that turley barracks in mannheim , scheduled for closure at the end of september this year , would be followed by us army europe facilities in büdingen and gelnhausen in 2008 .
sites in darmstadt and hanau would also be closed in 2009 , it revealed .
the closure of the five bases would affect 2,372 soldiers , nine airmen , 799 us civilians and 679 local workers .
the announcement was part of the long-term plan to close a total of 51 bases in germany and other areas of western and northern europe .
possible rethink on closure of german bases bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with fewer european bases , troops are flown directly home while the planned closures in germany related to those bases not involved in leading operations in afghanistan and iraq , if a review of the plan found that the us military presence and involvement in european defense issues was being undermined by troop withdrawals , the removal of german bases may also be reconsidered .
another problem which craddock revealed in his report relates to the closure of bases in europe , particularly in germany , in regard to returning or wounded soldiers coming out of war zones .
the reduction of barracks and services in europe means that returning us military personnel are now being flown directly to the united states , and in such numbers that it is putting strain on bases in the us which have also been downsized under the rumsfeld-approved base realignment and closure act .
at the height of the cold war , the united states had as many as 110,000 troops based in europe . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

defense analysts are now concerned that the plan is outdated , given america 's involvement in two theaters of war , the worsening relations with russia and iran and a recent plan to extend the size and range of the us army .
the source claimed that defense secretary robert gates and the joint chiefs of staff are considering recommendations for a review made in june by gen. bantz craddock , who took over as head of the us european command -lrb- eucom -rrb- last year .
european command chief recommends review bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : craddock -lrb- r . -rrb- believes the 2002 plan is outdated craddock 's report questioned the troop reduction plan and highlighted incidents that hinted at a compromising of us military effectiveness in europe .
as some troop reductions have already taken place and the turnover in deployments to afghanistan , iraq and other " operation enduring freedom " missions increases , us forces in europe have had to postpone , and in some cases cancel , training with armies in european " partner nations . "
that has made it difficult for us military planners to pursue a more active strategy with nations such as poland , the czech republic and former soviet states , and potentially prevent disputes before they occur .
" we have very little capacity left for these ongoing -lrb- operations -rrb- , " said craddock during a congressional hearing concerning his report , referring to european missions .
" our ability to do that now is limited because we do n't have the forces available since they are in the rotation to -lrb- iraq or afghanistan -rrb- . "
an estimated 75 percent of the us military in europe is either deployed to afghanistan or iraq , is about to go , or just returned , according to the defense officials .
us unable to fulfill european commitments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eucom has had to pull out of joint exercises the claims of a review of the troop reduction plan comes just two weeks after the us announced it had emptied the ramstein air base in southwestern germany of nuclear weapons and that it would close five more us military sites in germany by 2009 .
the defense department revealed earlier in july that turley barracks in mannheim , scheduled for closure at the end of september this year , would be followed by us army europe facilities in büdingen and gelnhausen in 2008 .
sites in darmstadt and hanau would also be closed in 2009 , it revealed .
the closure of the five bases would affect 2,372 soldiers , nine airmen , 799 us civilians and 679 local workers .
the announcement was part of the long-term plan to close a total of 51 bases in germany and other areas of western and northern europe .

another problem which craddock revealed in his report relates to the closure of bases in europe , particularly in germany , in regard to returning or wounded soldiers coming out of war zones .
the reduction of barracks and services in europe means that returning us military personnel are now being flown directly to the united states , and in such numbers that it is putting strain on bases in the us which have also been downsized under the rumsfeld-approved base realignment and closure act .

the deal satisfies germany 's protectionists who warned against selling outside the country . us firm trw had challenged for vdo , but siemens appears to have been swayed by continental 's argument that german technology should not be put into foreign hands .
the fee of 11.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 15.7 billion -rrb- for the subsidiary may have also been a factor in siemens ' decision .
the decision to sell within germany is certain please german politicians who were strongly against vdo going to a foreign firm and have recently floated the idea of placing limits on foreign investment in germany 's " core " business branches .
politicians in favor of continental bid last week , christian wulff , the conservative premier of lower saxony , spoke publicly about his support for continental 's bid for vdo .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wulff publicly advocated continental 's bid for vdo " we want conti and vdo to merge , then there would be a large automotive parts supplier operating throughout the globe out of germany , " wulff told german regional public radio station ndr .
" it would look a lot worse for the employees of the automotive supplier division of siemens if international financial investors got their hands on technology , jobs and production plants here , " wulff added .
foreign interest reignites protectionism debate the situation with vdo reignited the debate within the german government over whether germany needed an industrial policy modeled on the french to protect key industries from the influence of foreign investors .
german economics minister michael glos has said that his department was looking at how other european nations protected their domestic industries , though he added that he did not want germany to be a forerunner when it came to protectionism .
siemens swoops to buy us company bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siemens are ready to divert new funds to the us meanwhile , siemens looked to be directing some of the cash raised by the prospective sale of vdo towards the united states wednesday as it announced it had agreed to pay 5.09 billion euros for dade behring inc . , a clinical laboratory diagnostics company based in deerfield , illinois .
the munich-based giant issued a statement saying it had signed a merger agreement with dade behring to acquire all of its outstanding shares at 56.03 euros apiece .
the deal is subject to regulatory approval but is expected to be completed by the second quarter of fiscal 2008 . article based on news reports -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

and things could get worse .
with sinkewitz set to find out if the b sample of his june 8 drug test matches the a sample that showed abnormal levels of testosterone , german cycling is bracing for another high-profile doping confession to add to the many others which have brought the sport into the spotlight for all the wrong reasons this year .
sinkewitz 's b sample is expected to be tested next tuesday and the bdr was keen to talk to the cyclist .
" of course , we want to talk through the situation with patrik , " bdr president rudolf scharping - germany 's former minister of defense - told german sports news agency sid .
germany 's biggest team under threat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the t-mobile confessions rocked the cycling world t-mobile have suspended sinkewitz pending the results of his second sample , and the team - as well as the sport in general - is reeling from a series of recent blows .
earlier this year , seven former telekom -lrb- t-mobile 's previous name -rrb- riders , including now disgraced 1996 tour de france winner bjarne riis and sprinter erik zabel , confessed to using banned blood-booster erythropoietin -lrb- epo -rrb- .
german cycling legend jan ullrich was also embroiled in a doping scandal , though no charges have been brought against him .
the future hangs in the balance for germany ’ s biggest cycling team as the german mobile operators who sponsor the team are set to make an announcement after the current tour ends on sunday as to whether they will continue to fund t-mobile .
if the sponsors choose to leave the sport it will be a devastating blow to cycling in germany , which has watched as german television channels ard and zdf largely cancelled their coverage of this year 's tour after sinkewitz 's failed test .
german sportswear giant adidas has said it is also considering pulling out of their partnership agreement with t-mobile and the german cycling team in protest .
klöden suffers as team pulls out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vinokourov 's first blood sample came out positive doping , meanwhile , has ended the tour for another german rider , albeit because of a teammate 's usage .
andreas klöden was fifth in the tour ’ s overall standings when alexandre vinokourov of kazakhstan tested positive in the a sample for a homologous blood transfusion .
the results suggest vinokourov underwent a blood transfusion shortly before the start of the stage .
" alexandre vinokourov was tested positive for a blood transfusion and the team is leaving the tour , " astana spokeswoman corinne druey said on tuesday .
using this technique , blood is withdrawn from an athlete before a competition , and then is injected into his body again when he needs an extra boost .
this can also be done with another person 's blood .
based on the analysis of the french anti-doping laboratory at chatenay-malabry , vinokourov apparently used the blood of a compatible donor as two types of blood cells were found in his sample , france 's sports daily l 'equipe reported on its web site tuesday .
if the positive test is confirmed by the so-called b sample , vinokourov - widely considered a favorite to win the tour before the race started - faces a ban from the sport of at least two years .
after the revelations , the swiss-based astana team announced it was pulling all its riders , including klöden , out of the tour . article based on news reports -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de tour de france doping leads to sport funding questions some in germany are calling for changes to public and private funding for endurance sports after german cyclist patrik sinkewitz 's first blood sample tested positive for performance enhancing drugs .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : behind the scenes at the bayreuth festival katarina wagner 's bayreuth debut elicits boos and bravos alike wagners want to keep bayreuth festival in the family " i stay out of all the wagner family disputes " classical -pipe- 25.07.2007 going backstage with bayreuth festival singers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stephen gould is siegfried in " der ring des nibelungen " the costumes are fitted , the scenery paint has dried , and this year 's five-week bayreuth festival is set to begin on wednesday .
dw spoke with four of the singers who are preparing to take the stage . in her bayreuth premiere last year , canadian mezzo-soprano adrianne pieczonka impressed the audience with her perfect intonation , warm timbre and convincing portrayal of the role of sieglinde in " die walküre . "
in the interview , she describes her approach to the role and her experience of rehearsing and performing in the legendary bayreuth opera house . in opera , vocal soloists often have to come to terms with texts in languages that are foreign to them and roles and characters that may be difficult to relate to .
south african mezzo-soprano michelle breedt has given a lot of thought to her role , that of fricka in wagner 's " der ring des nibelungen . "
click to listen to the interview , where she reveals herself as a highly inspired and insightful artist : bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the trip to bayreuth 's festspielhaus can often be a long one for opera singers when it comes to wagnerian opera , many vocalists consider it the supreme privilege to sing in the theater the composer himself designed for his music dramas .
but sometimes the route to bayreuth is a surprisingly indirect one , as indicated by american tenor stephen gould , who sings the role of siegfried in the current production of " der ring des nibelungen .

in the interview , she describes her approach to the role and her experience of rehearsing and performing in the legendary bayreuth opera house . in opera , vocal soloists often have to come to terms with texts in languages that are foreign to them and roles and characters that may be difficult to relate to .

and things could get worse .
with sinkewitz set to find out if the b sample of his june 8 drug test matches the a sample that showed abnormal levels of testosterone , german cycling is bracing for another high-profile doping confession to add to the many others which have brought the sport into the spotlight for all the wrong reasons this year .
sinkewitz 's b sample is expected to be tested next tuesday and the bdr was keen to talk to the cyclist .
" of course , we want to talk through the situation with patrik , " bdr president rudolf scharping - germany 's former minister of defense - told german sports news agency sid .
germany 's biggest team under threat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the t-mobile confessions rocked the cycling world t-mobile have suspended sinkewitz pending the results of his second sample , and the team - as well as the sport in general - is reeling from a series of recent blows .
earlier this year , seven former telekom -lrb- t-mobile 's previous name -rrb- riders , including now disgraced 1996 tour de france winner bjarne riis and sprinter erik zabel , confessed to using banned blood-booster erythropoietin -lrb- epo -rrb- .
german cycling legend jan ullrich was also embroiled in a doping scandal , though no charges have been brought against him .
the future hangs in the balance for germany ’ s biggest cycling team as the german mobile operators who sponsor the team are set to make an announcement after the current tour ends on sunday as to whether they will continue to fund t-mobile .
if the sponsors choose to leave the sport it will be a devastating blow to cycling in germany , which has watched as german television channels ard and zdf largely cancelled their coverage of this year 's tour after sinkewitz 's failed test .
german sportswear giant adidas has said it is also considering pulling out of their partnership agreement with t-mobile and the german cycling team in protest .
klöden suffers as team pulls out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vinokourov 's first blood sample came out positive doping , meanwhile , has ended the tour for another german rider , albeit because of a teammate 's usage .
andreas klöden was fifth in the tour ’ s overall standings when alexandre vinokourov of kazakhstan tested positive in the a sample for a homologous blood transfusion .
the results suggest vinokourov underwent a blood transfusion shortly before the start of the stage .
" alexandre vinokourov was tested positive for a blood transfusion and the team is leaving the tour , " astana spokeswoman corinne druey said on tuesday .
using this technique , blood is withdrawn from an athlete before a competition , and then is injected into his body again when he needs an extra boost .
this can also be done with another person 's blood .
based on the analysis of the french anti-doping laboratory at chatenay-malabry , vinokourov apparently used the blood of a compatible donor as two types of blood cells were found in his sample , france 's sports daily l 'equipe reported on its web site tuesday .
if the positive test is confirmed by the so-called b sample , vinokourov - widely considered a favorite to win the tour before the race started - faces a ban from the sport of at least two years .
after the revelations , the swiss-based astana team announced it was pulling all its riders , including klöden , out of the tour . article based on news reports -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw took part in a group interview with him . dw : your holiness , please tell us about the human rights situation in tibet . dalai lama : it 's still very serious .
about a month ago i met a tibetan who spent eight years in a chinese prison .
his only crime , which took place in a village near lhasa , was to express his own feelings . china reacted harshly when you spoke about the issue of tibet in hamburg .
did that surprise you ? not at all .
even i live in silence .
there 's always some sort of condemnation .
they just keep going on like that . what do you think of the german government 's stance toward tibet ?
do you think berlin does enough for your cause ? the german government is like other governments - basically sympathetic .
certainly there 's a sense of concern .
the question is whether that 's adequate .
we appreciate expressions of concern from the outside world .
that 's necessary and helpful . what are your goals when you visit other countries ? my main purpose and motivation is not the issue of tibet , but rather the promotion of human values in order to have happier individuals , families and communities - and , in that way , a happier humanity .
i consider that to be my contribution .
i think every human being has a responsibility to better the world .
that 's my conviction , and i always try to promote that .
my second goal is the promotion of religious harmony .
when i teach in india , more and more chinese come .
sometimes , the chinese government puts up restrictions to prevent chinese from coming to india .
but despite that , some chinese always come .
many of them say that , after seeing the tibetan community , they found big difference s to what they had heard in china .
eventually there 's some positive impact . bildunterschrift : tens of thousands of buddhists have turned out to hear the dalai lama you have said that you could be the last dalai lama .
could you please explain ? as early as 1969 , i made clear in an official statement that it was up to the tibetan people whether or not the institution of the dalai lama should continue .
that means that if the majority of the tibetan people decide that the old institution of the dalai lama is no longer relevant to the tibetan nation , it will cease to exist .
if i were to die soon , i think most of the tibetan people would want to keep the institution .
if i live on 20 or 30 years , it might be different .
that 's okay .
that would be an end with dignity . do you ever hope to return to tibet ? oh yes .
all tibetans get homesick and hope to see their own country .
me , too .
but at the same time , i 'm a buddhist monk .
so mentally and personally one 's own birthplace is n't all that important .
there 's a tibetan saying : " home is where you feel good , and your parents are anyone who does good things for you . "

about a month ago i met a tibetan who spent eight years in a chinese prison .
his only crime , which took place in a village near lhasa , was to express his own feelings . china reacted harshly when you spoke about the issue of tibet in hamburg .
did that surprise you ? not at all .
even i live in silence .
there 's always some sort of condemnation .
they just keep going on like that . what do you think of the german government 's stance toward tibet ?
do you think berlin does enough for your cause ? the german government is like other governments - basically sympathetic .
certainly there 's a sense of concern .
the question is whether that 's adequate .
we appreciate expressions of concern from the outside world .
that 's necessary and helpful . what are your goals when you visit other countries ? my main purpose and motivation is not the issue of tibet , but rather the promotion of human values in order to have happier individuals , families and communities - and , in that way , a happier humanity .
i consider that to be my contribution .
i think every human being has a responsibility to better the world .

eventually there 's some positive impact . bildunterschrift : tens of thousands of buddhists have turned out to hear the dalai lama you have said that you could be the last dalai lama .
could you please explain ? as early as 1969 , i made clear in an official statement that it was up to the tibetan people whether or not the institution of the dalai lama should continue .
that means that if the majority of the tibetan people decide that the old institution of the dalai lama is no longer relevant to the tibetan nation , it will cease to exist .
if i were to die soon , i think most of the tibetan people would want to keep the institution .
if i live on 20 or 30 years , it might be different .
that 's okay .
that would be an end with dignity . do you ever hope to return to tibet ? oh yes .
all tibetans get homesick and hope to see their own country .

and things could get worse .
with sinkewitz set to find out if the b sample of his june 8 drug test matches the a sample that showed abnormal levels of testosterone , german cycling is bracing for another high-profile doping confession to add to the many others which have brought the sport into the spotlight for all the wrong reasons this year .
sinkewitz 's b sample is expected to be tested next tuesday and the bdr was keen to talk to the cyclist .
" of course , we want to talk through the situation with patrik , " bdr president rudolf scharping - germany 's former minister of defense - told german sports news agency sid .
germany 's biggest team under threat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the t-mobile confessions rocked the cycling world t-mobile have suspended sinkewitz pending the results of his second sample , and the team - as well as the sport in general - is reeling from a series of recent blows .
earlier this year , seven former telekom -lrb- t-mobile 's previous name -rrb- riders , including now disgraced 1996 tour de france winner bjarne riis and sprinter erik zabel , confessed to using banned blood-booster erythropoietin -lrb- epo -rrb- .
german cycling legend jan ullrich was also embroiled in a doping scandal , though no charges have been brought against him .
the future hangs in the balance for germany ’ s biggest cycling team as the german mobile operators who sponsor the team are set to make an announcement after the current tour ends on sunday as to whether they will continue to fund t-mobile .
if the sponsors choose to leave the sport it will be a devastating blow to cycling in germany , which has watched as german television channels ard and zdf largely cancelled their coverage of this year 's tour after sinkewitz 's failed test .
german sportswear giant adidas has said it is also considering pulling out of their partnership agreement with t-mobile and the german cycling team in protest .
klöden suffers as team pulls out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vinokourov 's first blood sample came out positive doping , meanwhile , has ended the tour for another german rider , albeit because of a teammate 's usage .
andreas klöden was fifth in the tour ’ s overall standings when alexandre vinokourov of kazakhstan tested positive in the a sample for a homologous blood transfusion .
the results suggest vinokourov underwent a blood transfusion shortly before the start of the stage .
" alexandre vinokourov was tested positive for a blood transfusion and the team is leaving the tour , " astana spokeswoman corinne druey said on tuesday .
using this technique , blood is withdrawn from an athlete before a competition , and then is injected into his body again when he needs an extra boost .
this can also be done with another person 's blood .
based on the analysis of the french anti-doping laboratory at chatenay-malabry , vinokourov apparently used the blood of a compatible donor as two types of blood cells were found in his sample , france 's sports daily l 'equipe reported on its web site tuesday .
if the positive test is confirmed by the so-called b sample , vinokourov - widely considered a favorite to win the tour before the race started - faces a ban from the sport of at least two years .

andreas klöden was fifth in the tour ’ s overall standings when alexandre vinokourov of kazakhstan tested positive in the a sample for a homologous blood transfusion .
the results suggest vinokourov underwent a blood transfusion shortly before the start of the stage .
" alexandre vinokourov was tested positive for a blood transfusion and the team is leaving the tour , " astana spokeswoman corinne druey said on tuesday .
using this technique , blood is withdrawn from an athlete before a competition , and then is injected into his body again when he needs an extra boost .
this can also be done with another person 's blood .
based on the analysis of the french anti-doping laboratory at chatenay-malabry , vinokourov apparently used the blood of a compatible donor as two types of blood cells were found in his sample , france 's sports daily l 'equipe reported on its web site tuesday .
if the positive test is confirmed by the so-called b sample , vinokourov - widely considered a favorite to win the tour before the race started - faces a ban from the sport of at least two years .
after the revelations , the swiss-based astana team announced it was pulling all its riders , including klöden , out of the tour . article based on news reports -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw spoke with four of the singers who are preparing to take the stage . in her bayreuth premiere last year , canadian mezzo-soprano adrianne pieczonka impressed the audience with her perfect intonation , warm timbre and convincing portrayal of the role of sieglinde in " die walküre . "
in the interview , she describes her approach to the role and her experience of rehearsing and performing in the legendary bayreuth opera house . in opera , vocal soloists often have to come to terms with texts in languages that are foreign to them and roles and characters that may be difficult to relate to .
south african mezzo-soprano michelle breedt has given a lot of thought to her role , that of fricka in wagner 's " der ring des nibelungen . "
click to listen to the interview , where she reveals herself as a highly inspired and insightful artist : bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the trip to bayreuth 's festspielhaus can often be a long one for opera singers when it comes to wagnerian opera , many vocalists consider it the supreme privilege to sing in the theater the composer himself designed for his music dramas .
but sometimes the route to bayreuth is a surprisingly indirect one , as indicated by american tenor stephen gould , who sings the role of siegfried in the current production of " der ring des nibelungen . " part of the attraction of wagner lies in the universal nature of the stories , dealing with jealousy , ambition , humiliation , murder and incest , but also with more noble issues like altruism and - most significantly - love .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 25.07.2007 opinion : doping threatens cycling more than other sports großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as the tour de france deals with yet another doping scandal , some hardcore fans say the press unfairly singles out cycling .
but dw 's jefferson chase thinks that 's inevitable because of the way the sport itself works . it was hard not to feel just a tiny bit sorry for the organizers of the tour de france when the news broke that alexander vinokourov had flunked a doping test .
the last thing the already embattled event needed was for another top cyclist to be caught out in what was , if the test results are confirmed , a brazen attempt at cheating . the public outcry after vinokourov and team astana 's sorry departure from the tour was predictable .
so , too , was the organizers ' attempt to put a positive spin on the scandal by claiming that it proved the effectiveness of anti-doping tests . the incident , however , also broached an issue that an increasing number of hardcore cycling fans have raised during the course of this particularly ill-fated tour .
is it not unfair of the media to pillory cycling while remaining more-or-less silent about comparable abuses in other sports ? indeed , there is a certain measure of hypocrisy here .
no one would seriously contend that soccer , tennis or even golf is free from athletes using banned performance-enhancing substances or techniques .
the line between cheating and gaining a competitive advantage in pursuit of that all-important goal , victory , is at best blurry . nonetheless , because of the nature of cycling itself , doping presents a particular threat to the athletes ' and the sport 's credibility . cycling - and especially its premier event , the tour de france - is not a game of hand-to-eye coordination .
it is a contest of perseverance without any nifty one-two combinations , breathtaking goals or diving saves . the appeal of cycling depends on the ideal of the lone rider overcoming the constraints of the human body .
the drama of a race - for instance , the point at which the eventual winner pedals away from the pack - resides in spectators being able to imagine that he is breaking through his own personal pain barrier and summoning up previously unknown reserves of strength and determination . that illusion is completely dispelled when the audience assumes that the decisive surge is just the epo kicking in . it 's an unavoidable fact that doping provides more of a competitive advantage in cycling than it does in many other sports .
a transfusion of oxygen-enriched blood , for instance , might give a soccer or tennis player extra energy for a 15-minute overtime period or a long fifth set .
but in the absence of individual skill , it would n't help them flick a lob over the keeper 's head or paint the baseline at match point . in cycling , as disgraced tour de france winner floyd landis seems to have shown last year , hormones alone can turn the tide .
when doping is introduced into the sporting equation , cycling appears more and more like a contest between medical teams - and who wants to watch a bunch of physicians battling it out ? the effectiveness of doping in cycling also makes it more difficult to eradicate , and the sport is set to pay heavily for this inherent shortcoming .
major sponsors like t-mobile are likely to scale back or discontinue their sponsorship of teams , and tv stations will certainly think twice about shelling out major cash for the broadcast rights to next year 's tour de france . and that may be the only silver lining in the very dark cloud that hangs over cycling at the moment .
perhaps with less money and publicity in play , athletes and teams will be less willing to risk their reputations for 15 minutes of dubious fame . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

people living in the area currently go to liverpool for planned neurosurgery .
but health minister edwina hart has said she wants welsh patients treated in wales wherever possible , and added no patients would be disadvantaged .
earlier this month , ms hart put controversial plans to shut the specialist unit in swansea on hold .
an expert report had recommended the service be centralised in cardiff , but , following protests , ms hart said she wanted a fresh approach and would keep the unit in morriston hospital open . "
expecting people who may not be well to travel to a place they do n't know and are not familiar with seems to me to be crazy " darren millar am she said she wanted to make sure as many non-emergency operations as possible were done in cardiff and swansea .
ms hart also warned wales could lose part of its service unless best use was made of it .
but tory am darren millar , who represents clwyd west , said the current arrangement for north wales patients was " very satisfactory " .
" it 's been in place for a number of years and it has served the people of north wales well , " he said .
" to expect people from north wales now to have a 400-mile round trip is totally unacceptable .
" expecting people who may not be well to travel to a place they do n't know and are not familiar with seems to me to be crazy . "
and aberconwy am gareth jones , who represents plaid , asked whether there was an alternative to having two specialist centres in south wales .
" if there 's a choice , then surely north wales needs to be considered , " he said .
" certainly places like llandudno would be ideally situated for that kind of enhancement . "
ms hart has said that emergency cases will be dealt with at the closest hospital available , and has asked an expert group to look at how the set-up would work in practice .
the panel , which will look at a scheme to pay travel costs , is due to report back in october .
eluned kidd , from llanfairfechan near conwy , had a brain tumour earlier this year and said she felt it was essential to have been close enough for her family to visit .
" the journey in itself was quite difficult , even to liverpool , so a four or five hour journey to south wales ... it would be even worse , " she said .

and a report by the healthcare commission suggests that a lot of trusts have to do much more to adopt best practice .
this issue has been a key priority in the health service for several years .
scientists across the uk are looking at new ways of tackling the problem .
i went to northwick park hospital in north london to see how one idea has produced some promising results .
northwick park has the usual assortment of weapons in the battle to stem mrsa , c. difficile and the like , including alcohol gel rubs , hand washing sinks dotted around , and an overall emphasis on hygiene and cleanliness .
but now there is a new device being deployed in strategic spots across the hospital .
it looks like a small air conditioner unit , drawing in air and funnelling it past ultraviolet bulbs which kill bacteria that have been shaken around the room by the normal comings and goings of patients and staff .
dr peder nielsen is the man in charge of infection control here .
new front he believes this ultra-violet air-cleansing unit opens up an important new front in the battle with mrsa .
the great idea here is that you have an instant isolation room whenever you need it dr peder nielsen he said : " we have never believed that airborne transmission had such an importance in this issue . "
dr nielsen has been working on a study - as yet unpublished - looking at the impact of these units on environmental mrsa .
it compared two identical single-bed side rooms over three months - one with the uv cleaner , the other without .
the researchers regularly tested the rooms and the patients using them for mrsa .
during the trial nearly half these tests on patients in the " control room " were positive .
none was in the room with the uv cleaner .
dr nielsen says the results were outstanding .
" the great idea here is that you have an instant isolation room whenever you need it .
" you just take it , you wheel it into the room where it is needed , and then you have an isolation room . "

the great idea here is that you have an instant isolation room whenever you need it dr peder nielsen he said : " we have never believed that airborne transmission had such an importance in this issue . "
dr nielsen has been working on a study - as yet unpublished - looking at the impact of these units on environmental mrsa .
it compared two identical single-bed side rooms over three months - one with the uv cleaner , the other without .
the researchers regularly tested the rooms and the patients using them for mrsa .
during the trial nearly half these tests on patients in the " control room " were positive .
none was in the room with the uv cleaner .
dr nielsen says the results were outstanding .
" the great idea here is that you have an instant isolation room whenever you need it .
" you just take it , you wheel it into the room where it is needed , and then you have an isolation room . "
scepticism some experts are sceptical about the idea .
they are unconvinced about how readily mrsa can be passed on through the air .
the department of health has a rapid review panel which over the last three years has looked at getting on for 200 new products to tackle infections - including this one .
we need to do just a tiny bit more research and to continue to monitor the outcome fiona wise chief executive , northwick park hospital the department 's chief microbiologist , professor brian duerden , said it was important to keep an open mind .
" i hope we 're not missing a trick but there 's always more that we can do .
" and we ca n't ignore the fact that these organisms get out into the environment and can be transmitted to patients .
" so we do need to have surfaces that are readily cleaned , we have to have agents for use in the cleaning , we have to look at the air from the point of view of decontamination . "
investment northwick park has bought 20 of the uv units - which cost £ 1,000 each .
the trust 's chief executive fiona wise said she was ready to speak to colleagues across the health service about how well they 've worked .
" personally i think we need to do just a tiny bit more research and to continue to monitor the outcomes of it .
" but i do think what would be really important is to see if we can organise some other hospitals to see if the experience we had can be replicated , and that it is in fact this - in combination with other factors - which is really going to help us drive down infection levels . "
clearly it is very early days with this device .
but dr nielsen is excited about its potential - not just in helping to tackle mrsa , but also other infections including c. difficile , drug-resistant tb and even pandemic flu .

sussex bat group said it had rescued 30 weak and starving pipistrelles in the last month because the downpours have made their food scarce .
amanda millar , from the group , said : " we have never experienced anything like this before , it 's horrendous . "
she said young bats that were learning to fly could not catch enough insects at night because it had been so wet .
' not strong enough ' ms millar said : " as a result they are simply not strong enough , which is why they are being discovered on the ground .
" the ones we are rescuing are probably just the tip of the iceberg so we were very impressed at the lengths south east water and its contractors went to in order to help this poorly bat . "
south east water meter reader tim harfield helped rescue a starving bat from a house in ditchling , east sussex , on tuesday .
he said : " i did n't want to disturb the bat as i knew they were a protected species and also it may have been injured .
" i got onto the office and they eventually tracked down someone from the sussex bat group who put me in touch with a nearby volunteer . "
he added : " under their guidance , i used a spare high-vis work vest to gently pick up the bat before putting it in a spare cardboard box that i had in my van , which i 'd already punched with air holes , and then rushed it to the rescue centre . "
sussex bat group run three rescue centres in the county .

food co-operatives rely upon volunteers to receive a delivery of fruit and vegetables each week .
they then pack the produce ready for collection by the customers .

the environment agency said levels are peaking in abingdon , where 585 homes were flooded , and will peak in a few hours in wallingford and henley .
osney mead substation , which supplies oxford with electricity , had been under threat but fire crews using pumping equipment have managed to protect it .
two of the main roads in to the city , botley and abingdon roads , are closed . "
there 's now a whole-scale evacuation of homes in the area , hundreds of homes are being evacuated because they 've been flooded " dr evan harris , mp for oxford west and abingdon thames valley police said emergency services had begun to evacuate people from about 250 homes in the osney area of oxford overnight .
more than 90 people had left their homes by wednesday morning .
police were advising residents who needed shelter to make their way to oxford united 's kassam stadium .
over the weekend , the county council transformed the stadium into a makeshift centre ready to house up to 1,500 people .
the roads affected by flooding are botley road , in the vicinity of osney , east street , west street , south street , bridge street , riverside road and earl street .
dr evan harris , liberal democrat mp for oxford west and abingdon , has criticised the flood defences in the area , saying they were no longer able to cope with the climate .
" there 's now a whole-scale evacuation of homes in the area , hundreds of homes are being evacuated because they 've been flooded , and it 's not clear that the water levels have reached their peak , " he said .
" despite this area being flooded in 2000 and 2003 , both of which were described as a one-in-40-year event .
it 's clearly now a three-in-seven-year event . "
sandbags delivered severe flood warnings remain in force for the thames - from oxford to abingdon - and for the river ock - from charney bassett to abingdon .
the thames is expected to peak further downstream , at wallingford and henley , on wednesday afternoon .
it has already burst its banks there and some homes have been flooded .
john lloyd , of oxfordshire fire and rescue service , said : " we 've got a steady but constant rise of flood water levels within oxford city centre particularly on the western side of the city . "
in preparation for rivers bursting their banks , thousands of sandbags were delivered to households across the county .
oxfordshire fire chiefs have divided the county into 11 areas where firefighters will assess local situations .
an oxfordshire county council spokeswoman said : " strategic planning remains in place for oxford and abingdon and the fire and rescue service will recommit resources here if necessary .
" however , the police are leafleting an area of henley that may flood and the fire service is putting in resources to meet any potential life-threatening incidents from abingdon south to the henley area .
" they wo n't be able to start pumping water away from homes in the south of the county until after the water levels have subsided . "
keith wheal , head of the oxfordshire county council countryside service , said : " we would like to warn people to stay away from river and canal towpaths until water levels have significantly dropped . "
sandbags have been made available in bridge end car park in dorchester and kings road car park in henley , while a further delivery of 60 tons of sand is expected in henley .
many primary schools were forced to shut early for the summer holidays because of the threat of flooding and many roads were closed .
