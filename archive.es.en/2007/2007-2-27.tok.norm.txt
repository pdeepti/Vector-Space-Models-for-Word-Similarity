the company is closing its special shops aimed at women , and more than two-thirds of its german stores did worse in 2006 than the year before . performance anxiety has rarely been an issue at europe 's biggest sex-shop company beate uhse .
but media reports and store closings indicate that the once high-flying sex chain has lost some of its potency with both customers and stock analysts . while a full report on the company 's 2006 performance is not due out until the end of march , internal figures obtained by the online business site manager-magazin.de paint a picture of a very unsexy year for the company . of 61 sex shops in germany , 47 are reported to have done worse in 2006 than in 2005 ; 19 of those chalked up losses .
the chain 's operating results was 49 percent below target ; the mail order business did even worse . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women 's erotic lingerie in a beate uhse shop the christmas season turned out to be anything but jolly for the company , thanks in part to a defective sprinkler that flooded its primary mail-order warehouse in the netherlands .
the water damage cost the company 15 million euros -lrb- $ 20 million -rrb- . just after the holiday season , the company had to admit it would not be able to match its 2005 sales of 285 million euros . mae b. falls flat the company will close the last of its mae b. shops as their leases run out .
the beate uhse offshoot , geared towards the female market and featuring brightly lit stores with sexy lingerie and erotica instead of hardcore pornography , was opened in 2004 .
the idea was to pull the company out of its porn niche and reach a broader spectrum of customers . despite the tasteful decor , massage oils , erotic games and silver and gold vibrators , the concept , which beate uhse spokeswoman assia tschernookoff now calls an " experiment , " did n't fly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beate uhse stores are found in city centers , not relegated to the outskirts or industrial areas now the company is trying a new approach , and recently opened a flagship store in munich that will carry many of the items featured at mae b. in addition to the inventory found in the more traditional beate uhse stores . the company has experienced several buckets of cold water over the past few years , generally around its ambitious expansion plans .
a takeover of the condom manufacturer condomi failed , as did the purchase of the " penthouse " publishing house . an attempt to get into the world 's biggest pornography market , the united states , was not successful and beate uhse was forced to withdraw after suffering heavy losses . fantasy unfulfilled the company 's stock market flotation in 1999 was accompanied with much fanfare and its stock price reached a high of 29 euros .
but since then it has a long ride downhill until the price bottomed out at 3.95 euros last november . stock analysts are recommending selling beate uhse stock , worried by news that the company 's biggest stockholder and son of founder beate uhse , ulrich rotermund , is trying to find a buyer for his 29.5 percent stake . analysts have also been concerned about the unclear relationship between dutch pornography entrepreneur gerard cok and his consipio holding , which holds a 20.8 percent stake , and the flensburg , germany-based company . according to analyst matthias schrade of gsc research , the company is still overvalued .
the firm is now valued at 250 million euros , but he told manager-magazin.de that a more realistic figure is around 150 million euros .
but , he added , he currently would n't want to pay more than 100 million euros for the firm . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de beate uhse loses its world cup buzz bad news for german soccer fans : olli k. and michael b. will not be bringing pleasure to supporters during the world cup .

" he said such behavior was very difficult to define and that the proposed legislation allowed too much scope for personal interpretation on the part of individual civil servants . " the boundaries are very blurred , " lefringhausen told dw-world.de.
" it is very imprecise .
the world-view of individual civil servants could play a fateful role . " pressure counterproductive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lefringhausen said pressure on migrants is counterproductive lefringhausen also questioned whether the planned changes would have the effect intended . " i think it is a major political mistake to believe that attitudes can be changed by pressure from outside , " he said .
" whoever puts migrants under pressure will experience counter-pressure .
the politics of the iron fist is not an intelligent form of politics . " the changes are part of amendments to german immigration law to bring it into line with eu regulations . other proposals to give residence permits to illegal immigrants whose presence has been tolerated up to now are also creating differences of opinion within the government . uncertain future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many children live in germany without resident status there are around 200,000 people living in germany with this precarious status .
under the proposed plans , these migrants would be allowed to stay if they can demonstrate that they are able to support themselves financially , though there are disagreements on how long they should be given to find a job . state interior ministers decided at a meeting in november that the deadline should be set at september , but the federal government wants to give the migrants until 2009 . german interior minister wolfgang schäuble said he plans to set up a committee to resolve these differences . dw staff -lrb- jeg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de survey : brits most averse to european migrants britons are more averse to receiving european migrants in their country than residents of germany , france , italy or spain , according to a poll published in the financial times .

the richer , the faster großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's a correlation between income and speeding on the autobahn a new survey out shows motorists ' speeds on german freeways is largely in line with their bank balances .
those earning more tend to push the speedometer to the red line . if you 've got the cash , you 've got the speed .
that seems to be the lesson gleaned from a poll conducted by tns infratest which surveyed 1,002 german drivers .
more well-off drivers tended to race down germany 's famous autobahns while those who are economically challenged take their time . of those earning more than 2,500 euros -lrb- $ 3,310 -rrb- a month , 64 percent drove over the recommended speed of 130 km / h -lrb- 81 mph -rrb- and took little notice of fuel consumption and environmental pollution . for those who have direct experience on germany 's freeway system , the results will come as little surprise .
woe to the driver who stays in the passing lane as a late-model mercedes or bmw approaches .
if you do n't want to be run over , make a quick move to the right and watch in awe as a black blur whips past , apparently going after some new land-speed record . that leaves the rest of the pack - the cheaper fiats , skodas , renaults and ancient vw 's - in the dust .
only 37 percent of drivers with a net income under 1,500 euros a month drove over the recommended speed , the poll found . despite the high speeds of some , 87 percent of germans asked said they were in favor of a speed limit on german autobahns .
one in three called for a maximum speed of 140 km / h -lrb- 87 mph -rrb- .
the group least in favor of any speed restriction was in the over-50 group - only 82 percent of them thought a limit was a good idea . it might be wise to get out of grandpa 's way . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans propose autobahn speed limit to cut pollution some german politicians want to slow traffic on the country 's famously speedy autobahns and limit speeds to 120 kilometers per hour to help cut polluting co2 emissions .

the richer , the faster großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's a correlation between income and speeding on the autobahn a new survey out shows motorists ' speeds on german freeways is largely in line with their bank balances .
those earning more tend to push the speedometer to the red line . if you 've got the cash , you 've got the speed .
that seems to be the lesson gleaned from a poll conducted by tns infratest which surveyed 1,002 german drivers .
more well-off drivers tended to race down germany 's famous autobahns while those who are economically challenged take their time . of those earning more than 2,500 euros -lrb- $ 3,310 -rrb- a month , 64 percent drove over the recommended speed of 130 km / h -lrb- 81 mph -rrb- and took little notice of fuel consumption and environmental pollution . for those who have direct experience on germany 's freeway system , the results will come as little surprise .
woe to the driver who stays in the passing lane as a late-model mercedes or bmw approaches .
if you do n't want to be run over , make a quick move to the right and watch in awe as a black blur whips past , apparently going after some new land-speed record . that leaves the rest of the pack - the cheaper fiats , skodas , renaults and ancient vw 's - in the dust .
only 37 percent of drivers with a net income under 1,500 euros a month drove over the recommended speed , the poll found . despite the high speeds of some , 87 percent of germans asked said they were in favor of a speed limit on german autobahns .
one in three called for a maximum speed of 140 km / h -lrb- 87 mph -rrb- .
the group least in favor of any speed restriction was in the over-50 group - only 82 percent of them thought a limit was a good idea . it might be wise to get out of grandpa 's way . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans propose autobahn speed limit to cut pollution some german politicians want to slow traffic on the country 's famously speedy autobahns and limit speeds to 120 kilometers per hour to help cut polluting co2 emissions .

threat of action " no one wants this to happen .
but we are not ruling it out , " said peter scherrer , general secretary of the european metalworkers ' federation .
he said the closing down of entire plants , the one-sided distribution of cuts or the playing-off of different workforces could , for example , trigger industrial action . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the plans have already sparked union protests the broad outlines of the plan were first unveiled in october , sparking union protests .
in february , 20,000 members of the german metalworkers ' union ig metall took part in a day of action . airbus has 16 factories in britain , france , germany and spain , but the main tensions have arisen over job cuts in germany and france .
with presidential elections coming up in france , french politicians are particularly sensitive about domestic job cuts .
this sparked fears in germany that german workers would bear the brunt of the cutbacks .
french prime minister dominique de villepin referred last week to 10,000 job cuts - a figure later denied by the german government . a french newspaper also carried an unconfirmed report last week that airbus would seek to close four factories in france and four in germany . government concern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french and german leaders met last week to discuss overhaul the restructuring plan was high on the agenda at a meeting of french president jacques chirac and german chancellor angela merkel on friday , who were keen to defuse tensions sparked by the speculation . the two leaders agreed there should be an " equitable distribution " of the measures needed to reorganise the company . costly delays the franco-german company , whose headquarters are located in the french city of toulouse , has been hit by a string of production problems with the company 's a380 superjumbo airliner which have led to costly two-year delivery delays . eads said the so-called power8 rescue plan would enable airbus to " better face the challenge of the us dollar weakness , the financial burden related to the a380 delays as well as its future investment needs . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : production delays with the superjumbo have been costly in january , it was announced that airbus would report an operating loss for 2006 because of unexpected costs linked to the superjumbo programme . power8 is intended to save the company five billion euros by 2010 and two billion euros each year thereafter . airbus is also counting on savings from power8 to help fund the development of the new mid-sized long-haul jet , the a350 xwb . rivalry with boeing this ten billion euro project is seen as crucial for helping the european planemaker compete with boeing . the failure of the eads board to agree on the sharing of work on this project has delayed the announcement of the overhaul package . analysts have long said that the aircraft maker should spin off the less important production sites . dw staff -lrb- jeg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de for eads and airbus , 2006 was a year to forget the head of european aerospace giant eads said 2006 had been a very bad year indeed .

the case has raised questions about press freedom in germany . germany 's constitutional court in karlsruhe ruled tuesday that police violated the constitution by raiding the offices of the political online magazine cicero , based near berlin . judges said that the 2005 raid was a considerable violation of press freedom . in a 7-1 decision , the karlsruhe judges said the september 2005 search breached the constitition because the journalists themselves were not formally suspected of breaking the law . " searches and seizures against media people as part of a formal inquiry are unconstitutional if they are purely or mainly intended to detect the identity of an informant , " said presiding judge hans-jürgen papier . the court thus ruled in favor of cicero editor-in chief wolfram weimer , who had lodged a constitutional complaint against the search . a state court had ruled that the search , originally conducted under a warrant from a potsdam magistrate , was legal .
police seized disks and made a copy of a journalist 's hard-drive during the raid . national debate on press freedom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former interior minister schily the " cicero affair " gained momentum on sept .
12 , 2005 , when agents from germany ’ s federal criminal police office raided the magazine 's offices . they spent the whole day sifting through files and computer data .
at the end of the day , the german government came away with box-loads of material - and a massive public relations headache . yet the issue had started back in april 2005 .
the magazine ’ s authors published an article about a top al-qaeda leader , abu musab al-zarkawi , who has since been killed during a us air strike in iraq . as author bruno schirra reported his story , he cited information from a classified document which he obtained from a source within the federal criminal police office , or " bka . " former interior minister otto schily believed that was a major breach of security . " the government simply can not accept that documents from its innermost circles are passed on to the public by officers , because that creates dangers for such operations , " schily said . the journalists saw things differently .
cicero editor-in-chief wolfram weimar stood by his reporters ' conduct , and said their objectives are clear . " journalists are neither microphone-holders nor the king ’ s scribes : they are there to bring unpleasant truths to light , whether the powerful like it or not , and otto schily is no exception , " said weimar . in addition , more than 200 bka agents may have had access to the information , which shows that the data was n't highly-secretive , journalists pointed out . rumors also abound that the bka deliberately manipulates data in order to track down leaks . long-winded legal battle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cicero editor-in-chief weimer wants to reveal the truth the ensuing cicero legal battle , at any rate , has lasted almost two years . yet it has been more than an aggressive campaign to uncover a leak inside the bka .
the affair quickly became a high-profile battle of principles , pitching government secrecy against journalistic inquiry . while some officials have defended the cicero raid in the name of state secrets and national security , their arguments have largely fallen on deaf ears with the press , the public and almost every political party on the spectrum , including the social democrats - or " spd , " schily ’ s own party . dieter wiefelspütz , the interior affairs expert for the spd , said that while he understands the need to find leaks within the bka , journalists ' work must also be respected . " if the work of journalists - who deal with confidential information nearly every day - is generally criminalized , then we have a real problem with press freedom in germany , " wiefelspütz said . he added that the bka should perhaps focus on the culprits within its own ranks first , and not turn journalists into culprits . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a distinctly " political " magazine in february 2006 , the potsdam district court ruled that the police search of the cicero offices was lawful schirra 's article contained " secret information relevant to national security . " editor weimar then filed a complaint against the raids with the country 's highest court . echoes from the past for many germans , the cicero affair has raised the specter of the spiegel scandal that began in 1962 .
back then , the weekly newsmagazine der spiegel was accused of treason for an article criticizing the german armed forces . defense minister franz josef strauß had the spiegel offices searched and occupied by police , and spiegel ’ s editor-in-chief , publisher and the author of the article arrested . the scandal ended with strauß ’ s resignation and a victory for press freedom . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german high court reviews press freedom german constitutional judges on wednesday began hearing the complaint of the editor of a magazine , whose offices had been searched by investigators following publication of classified material .

" searches and seizures against media people as part of a formal inquiry are unconstitutional if they are purely or mainly intended to detect the identity of an informant , " said presiding judge hans-jürgen papier . the court thus ruled in favor of cicero editor-in chief wolfram weimer , who had lodged a constitutional complaint against the search . a state court had ruled that the search , originally conducted under a warrant from a potsdam magistrate , was legal .
police seized disks and made a copy of a journalist 's hard-drive during the raid . national debate on press freedom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former interior minister schily the " cicero affair " gained momentum on sept .
12 , 2005 , when agents from germany ’ s federal criminal police office raided the magazine 's offices . they spent the whole day sifting through files and computer data .
at the end of the day , the german government came away with box-loads of material - and a massive public relations headache . yet the issue had started back in april 2005 .
the magazine ’ s authors published an article about a top al-qaeda leader , abu musab al-zarkawi , who has since been killed during a us air strike in iraq . as author bruno schirra reported his story , he cited information from a classified document which he obtained from a source within the federal criminal police office , or " bka . " former interior minister otto schily believed that was a major breach of security . " the government simply can not accept that documents from its innermost circles are passed on to the public by officers , because that creates dangers for such operations , " schily said . the journalists saw things differently .
cicero editor-in-chief wolfram weimar stood by his reporters ' conduct , and said their objectives are clear . " journalists are neither microphone-holders nor the king ’ s scribes : they are there to bring unpleasant truths to light , whether the powerful like it or not , and otto schily is no exception , " said weimar . in addition , more than 200 bka agents may have had access to the information , which shows that the data was n't highly-secretive , journalists pointed out . rumors also abound that the bka deliberately manipulates data in order to track down leaks . long-winded legal battle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cicero editor-in-chief weimer wants to reveal the truth the ensuing cicero legal battle , at any rate , has lasted almost two years . yet it has been more than an aggressive campaign to uncover a leak inside the bka .
the affair quickly became a high-profile battle of principles , pitching government secrecy against journalistic inquiry . while some officials have defended the cicero raid in the name of state secrets and national security , their arguments have largely fallen on deaf ears with the press , the public and almost every political party on the spectrum , including the social democrats - or " spd , " schily ’ s own party . dieter wiefelspütz , the interior affairs expert for the spd , said that while he understands the need to find leaks within the bka , journalists ' work must also be respected . " if the work of journalists - who deal with confidential information nearly every day - is generally criminalized , then we have a real problem with press freedom in germany , " wiefelspütz said . he added that the bka should perhaps focus on the culprits within its own ranks first , and not turn journalists into culprits . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a distinctly " political " magazine in february 2006 , the potsdam district court ruled that the police search of the cicero offices was lawful schirra 's article contained " secret information relevant to national security . " editor weimar then filed a complaint against the raids with the country 's highest court . echoes from the past for many germans , the cicero affair has raised the specter of the spiegel scandal that began in 1962 .
back then , the weekly newsmagazine der spiegel was accused of treason for an article criticizing the german armed forces . defense minister franz josef strauß had the spiegel offices searched and occupied by police , and spiegel ’ s editor-in-chief , publisher and the author of the article arrested . the scandal ended with strauß ’ s resignation and a victory for press freedom . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german high court reviews press freedom german constitutional judges on wednesday began hearing the complaint of the editor of a magazine , whose offices had been searched by investigators following publication of classified material .

but the " third man " françois bayrou could upset the first round of voting on april 22 . the latest polls in france show that conservative presidential candidate nicolas sarkozy and socialist rival ségolène royal are running neck-and-neck .
but outside contenders in the vote could upset a clear outcome . the traditional centrist , pro-european politician françois bayrou and far-right leader jean-marie le pen have also thrown their hats into the ring . voters in france head to the polls on april 22 for a presidential election .
a second round of voting is scheduled for may 6 if none of the candidates win an outright majority . according to the latest survey by lh2 pollsters , sarkozy is slightly ahead in the first round of voting with 30 percent of votes while royal would get 27 percent .
bayrou is credited with 17 percent of votes while le pen is holding 13 percent .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 27.02.2007 opinion : ruling on serbia individualizes the blame großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un 's highest court on monday cleared serbia of direct responsibility for genocide in bosnia during the 1992-95 war .
dw 's benjamin pargan comments that serbia now has less excuses to hand over war crimes criminals . once again it was a clear " yes-and-no " and " as-well-as " solution by the so-called international community .
the disappointment of the predominantly muslim war victims in bosnia and herzegovina is understandable .
many of them were displaced , tortured , raped by reservists and guerrilla fighters from serbia and montenegro . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benjamin pargan relatives of those muslim bosniaks murdered in the bosnian city of bijeljina , for example , will never understand this verdict .
their family members became victims of special forces and killer commandos from serbia right in the first days of the war - with the blessing of the government in belgrade at the time . the like occurred in several cities in bosnia and herzegovina .
this was repeatedly proven in individual trials at the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia in the hague .
the president of the international court of justice , rosalyn higgins , indirectly confirmed this with her remark that serbia militarily and financially supported bosnian serbs to a considerable degree . where does this significant support give way to direct responsibility for the genocide ?
either this question could not be conclusively clarified or - more likely - the judges at the highest un court did n't have enough courage and endurance to do so , regardless of possible political consequences . nonetheless , the judgment by the international court also has a positive side .
up to now , a large part of the serbian political establishment has repeatedly spoken of a sweeping prejudgment of the serbs .
mostly nationalist-minded powers used these pre-fabricated formulas far too often to dish up stories for their population about alleged forced and unjust collective guilt of the serbs .
when it came to questioning their own role in the war , many serbs accepted these argumentation aids with thanks .
a conviction of serbia would have given such populist pied pipers even more impetus .

but the " third man " françois bayrou could upset the first round of voting on april 22 . the latest polls in france show that conservative presidential candidate nicolas sarkozy and socialist rival ségolène royal are running neck-and-neck .
but outside contenders in the vote could upset a clear outcome . the traditional centrist , pro-european politician françois bayrou and far-right leader jean-marie le pen have also thrown their hats into the ring . voters in france head to the polls on april 22 for a presidential election .
a second round of voting is scheduled for may 6 if none of the candidates win an outright majority . according to the latest survey by lh2 pollsters , sarkozy is slightly ahead in the first round of voting with 30 percent of votes while royal would get 27 percent .
bayrou is credited with 17 percent of votes while le pen is holding 13 percent .
in a runoff , sarkozy and royal could both win 50 percent , the survey said . front-runners turn on " the third man " centrist bayrou - dubbed " the third man " in the french press - has seen a recent surge in his ratings .
during a prime-time television performance on monday night , bayrou promised he would transcend the left-right divide in france .
analysts said this could explain his growing popularity . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : centrist candidate françois bayrou is calling for " a social economy " " the two front-runners , how much support do they have - 25 percent ? "
bayrou said on tf1 television .
" that 's not enough to run the country .
that 's why we are in the state we are in , because there has not been enough backing for reform . " but both royal and sarkozy have criticized his platform . " i think it 's very dangerous , " royal told france inter radio .
" it 's trying to stop the french choosing between two models of society , two opposing political visions . " sarkozy said bayrou 's policies would lead to chaos like that of france 's fourth republic , when makeshift coalition governments rose and fell repeatedly . " democracy is a majority and an opposition and the french have to choose , " sarkozy told rmc radio . le pen focuses on anti-immigrant , anti-europe platform le pen could prove to be a greater threat to the main candidates than bayrou , though .
the far-right leader is doing better in the race than he was before the 2002 elections .
at that time , he stunned the nation by qualifying for the second round of voting against jacques chirac .
with nearly 17 percent of votes , he beat out socialist candidate lionel jospin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : right-wing leader jean-marie le pen is promoting a " zero immigration " platform the 78-year-old launched his election program in lille over the weekend .
in his fifth and probably last bid for the presidency , le pen vowed to halt immigration and integration with europe , which he said was leading france to disaster . le pen told a convention of his national front party that he would cut off social benefits to immigrants and " restore france 's borders . "
amid cheers and chants of " le pen , president ! " the far-right leader said france was crumbling under poverty , unemployment , the dislocation of factories and " massive immigration . " but french reality has changed over the past five years .
in 2002 , security and crime topped the list of voters concerns .
this had fit well into le pen 's nationalist anti-immigration platform .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 27.02.2007 opinion : ruling on serbia individualizes the blame großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un 's highest court on monday cleared serbia of direct responsibility for genocide in bosnia during the 1992-95 war .
dw 's benjamin pargan comments that serbia now has less excuses to hand over war crimes criminals . once again it was a clear " yes-and-no " and " as-well-as " solution by the so-called international community .
the disappointment of the predominantly muslim war victims in bosnia and herzegovina is understandable .
many of them were displaced , tortured , raped by reservists and guerrilla fighters from serbia and montenegro . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benjamin pargan relatives of those muslim bosniaks murdered in the bosnian city of bijeljina , for example , will never understand this verdict .
their family members became victims of special forces and killer commandos from serbia right in the first days of the war - with the blessing of the government in belgrade at the time . the like occurred in several cities in bosnia and herzegovina .
this was repeatedly proven in individual trials at the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia in the hague .
the president of the international court of justice , rosalyn higgins , indirectly confirmed this with her remark that serbia militarily and financially supported bosnian serbs to a considerable degree . where does this significant support give way to direct responsibility for the genocide ?
either this question could not be conclusively clarified or - more likely - the judges at the highest un court did n't have enough courage and endurance to do so , regardless of possible political consequences . nonetheless , the judgment by the international court also has a positive side .
up to now , a large part of the serbian political establishment has repeatedly spoken of a sweeping prejudgment of the serbs .
mostly nationalist-minded powers used these pre-fabricated formulas far too often to dish up stories for their population about alleged forced and unjust collective guilt of the serbs .
when it came to questioning their own role in the war , many serbs accepted these argumentation aids with thanks .
a conviction of serbia would have given such populist pied pipers even more impetus .
it was , after all , the first time that a nation was formally accused of genocide . now , there is one excuse less for the up till now rejection of handing over serb generals accused of war crimes to the tribunal in the hague .
the verdict is a significant step in the direction of individualizing the blame - a demand also often made by serbia . the government in belgrade is more likely to interpret this judgment as a clean bill of health .
the international community and particularly the european union has to now make clear all the more that cooperating with the tribunal in the hague is still the requirement for approaching the transatlantic community .
otherwise , the rather meager efforts of the serbs so far to punish war criminals will peter out even more quickly and silently . benjamin pargan is an editor for dw-radio 's bosnian department -lrb- sac -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de un 's highest court clears serbia of genocide in the first ruling of its kind , the international court of justice monday cleared serbia of direct responsibility for genocide in bosnia , but said belgrade violated international law by failing to prevent the massacre .

those earning more tend to push the speedometer to the red line . if you 've got the cash , you 've got the speed .
that seems to be the lesson gleaned from a poll conducted by tns infratest which surveyed 1,002 german drivers .
more well-off drivers tended to race down germany 's famous autobahns while those who are economically challenged take their time . of those earning more than 2,500 euros -lrb- $ 3,310 -rrb- a month , 64 percent drove over the recommended speed of 130 km / h -lrb- 81 mph -rrb- and took little notice of fuel consumption and environmental pollution . for those who have direct experience on germany 's freeway system , the results will come as little surprise .
woe to the driver who stays in the passing lane as a late-model mercedes or bmw approaches .
if you do n't want to be run over , make a quick move to the right and watch in awe as a black blur whips past , apparently going after some new land-speed record . that leaves the rest of the pack - the cheaper fiats , skodas , renaults and ancient vw 's - in the dust .
only 37 percent of drivers with a net income under 1,500 euros a month drove over the recommended speed , the poll found . despite the high speeds of some , 87 percent of germans asked said they were in favor of a speed limit on german autobahns .
one in three called for a maximum speed of 140 km / h -lrb- 87 mph -rrb- .
the group least in favor of any speed restriction was in the over-50 group - only 82 percent of them thought a limit was a good idea . it might be wise to get out of grandpa 's way . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans propose autobahn speed limit to cut pollution some german politicians want to slow traffic on the country 's famously speedy autobahns and limit speeds to 120 kilometers per hour to help cut polluting co2 emissions .

26 of the inflation outlook in the 13 nations sharing the euro , despite risks of upward pressure from germany , europe 's biggest economy . although a recent increase in value added tax in germany from 16 percent to 19 percent has had less of an impact on inflation than originally feared , wage discussions between unions and employers are stirring fresh concerns about price pressures , and especially at the european central bank . " i think that inflation is developing quite well , " said luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker , who chairs regular meetings of euro zone finance ministers . " inflation , as far as the short-term is concerned , does seem under control , " he added . vat hike fears unproven many economists ' concerns the increase in german value added tax in january from 16 percent to 19 percent would nudge inflation higher in the euro zone have so far proven to be unfounded . the european union 's eurostat data agency estimated inflation held steady in january at 1.9 percent and is due to provide a clearer picture on wednesday with final figures , and an estimate for february on thursday . meanwhile , private economists are forecasting that inflation was stable in february at 1.9 percent , which would mark the fourth month in a row that price growth has been right in line with the european central bank 's preferred level of less than , but close to , two percent . the frankfurt-based central bank is widely expected to lift its benchmark interest rate to 3.75 percent at its next monetary-policy meeting on march 8 in order to keep a lid on inflation . productivity must support wage pressure german finance minister peer steinbrueck , whose country currently holds the rotating eu presidency , took a optimistic view of inflation prospects as long as productivity kept up with wage growth . " i do n't see any inflation risks as long as wage policy in europe is based on productivity , " he told reporters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trichet warned of wage hikes causing instability germany 's powerful ig metall labour union said monday it would call for wage increases of 6.5 percent for the 3.4 million workers in the german engineering and metal-working industry in upcoming wage talks next month . earlier monday , european central bank president jean-claude trichet had sounded the alarm about big wage increases , calling for constraint in an interview with german magazine focus . wage restraint crucial to competitive growth " wage moderation is and will remain important not just in germany , but all over europe , " he said . juncker said that the germany was bouncing back in part because constraint on wage increases had made german industry competitive again on the global stage . he said that to remain competitive wage increases would have to remain in line with productivity growth , which would cancel out the impact of higher salaries on inflation . " if wages continue to develop in line with productivity , wage increases will not give rise to any inflationary problems , nor will there be any loss in productivity , " he said . dw staff / afp -lrb- emw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu lifts euro-zone growth forecast on german , italian strength the european commission raised its forecast for euro-zone growth this year to 2.4 percent from 2.1 percent previously as the german and italian economies bounce back more strongly than expected .

" we understand the position of our european partners and chancellor merkel , " yanukovych said . " we also understand that only reforms of the economy , our legal system and judiciary , of the bureaucracy and improving the living standard of our citizens will move ukraine closer to the eu , " he added . thus , unlike his political rival president yushchenko , who expressed a clear desire to join the eu during his visit to germany two weeks ago , prime minister yanukovych has been more pragmatic . he stressed that more attention should be given to the new partnership and cooperation accord with the eu . " i believe this agreement will be the cornerstone for developing our relationship , " yanukovych said .
" the first step and most important component of this new treaty should be the creation of a free-trade zone .

a conflict last year between russia and ukraine over transit fees led to an interruption of supplies to western europe . yanukovych has said he wants to make ukraine a reliable energy partner and has proposed a number of joint pipeline projects with russia and the eu . " a lot depends on relations between ukraine and russia , " yanukovych said .
" we need to ensure that russia and the eu unite on the energy issue and that more sources of energy are available to the european market . " yanukovych sees ukraine 's future as being a bridge and mediator between a newly resurgent russia and an energy-vulnerable european union .

26 of the inflation outlook in the 13 nations sharing the euro , despite risks of upward pressure from germany , europe 's biggest economy . although a recent increase in value added tax in germany from 16 percent to 19 percent has had less of an impact on inflation than originally feared , wage discussions between unions and employers are stirring fresh concerns about price pressures , and especially at the european central bank . " i think that inflation is developing quite well , " said luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker , who chairs regular meetings of euro zone finance ministers . " inflation , as far as the short-term is concerned , does seem under control , " he added . vat hike fears unproven many economists ' concerns the increase in german value added tax in january from 16 percent to 19 percent would nudge inflation higher in the euro zone have so far proven to be unfounded . the european union 's eurostat data agency estimated inflation held steady in january at 1.9 percent and is due to provide a clearer picture on wednesday with final figures , and an estimate for february on thursday . meanwhile , private economists are forecasting that inflation was stable in february at 1.9 percent , which would mark the fourth month in a row that price growth has been right in line with the european central bank 's preferred level of less than , but close to , two percent . the frankfurt-based central bank is widely expected to lift its benchmark interest rate to 3.75 percent at its next monetary-policy meeting on march 8 in order to keep a lid on inflation . productivity must support wage pressure german finance minister peer steinbrueck , whose country currently holds the rotating eu presidency , took a optimistic view of inflation prospects as long as productivity kept up with wage growth . " i do n't see any inflation risks as long as wage policy in europe is based on productivity , " he told reporters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trichet warned of wage hikes causing instability germany 's powerful ig metall labour union said monday it would call for wage increases of 6.5 percent for the 3.4 million workers in the german engineering and metal-working industry in upcoming wage talks next month . earlier monday , european central bank president jean-claude trichet had sounded the alarm about big wage increases , calling for constraint in an interview with german magazine focus . wage restraint crucial to competitive growth " wage moderation is and will remain important not just in germany , but all over europe , " he said . juncker said that the germany was bouncing back in part because constraint on wage increases had made german industry competitive again on the global stage . he said that to remain competitive wage increases would have to remain in line with productivity growth , which would cancel out the impact of higher salaries on inflation . " if wages continue to develop in line with productivity , wage increases will not give rise to any inflationary problems , nor will there be any loss in productivity , " he said . dw staff / afp -lrb- emw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu lifts euro-zone growth forecast on german , italian strength the european commission raised its forecast for euro-zone growth this year to 2.4 percent from 2.1 percent previously as the german and italian economies bounce back more strongly than expected .

europeans are happier than ever before two eu reports released this week show most europeans are happy with their lives , despite social challenges facing the 27-nation bloc .
danes tops the happiness scale while bulgarians say they have little reason to smile . a eurobarometer poll published by the european commission this week said that 86 percent of europeans were relatively satisfied with their personal life and everyday environment .
the study said today 's europeans were happier , wealthier and living longer than their predecessors . " life satisfaction and happiness is higher in europe than in any other part of the world , " one of the study 's authors , frederic lerais , told reporters in brussels .
" life expectancy has increased and could increase a lot further , as could the possibilities of leading healthier , as well as longer lives . " however , a study of europe 's social reality published by the commission 's in-house think tank said although life satisfaction and happiness were higher in europe than in other parts of the world , eu societies were struggling to cope with immigration , ageing and a rapid shift to a " knowledge economy . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe 's future generations face many challenges " european societies face major social challenges , " the report said .
" the knowledge economy can seem threatening to those with low skills and low educational aspirations . " the report said unemployment and inactivity still blighted too many people 's lives , as did unresolved problems of widespread poverty .
it also pointed to new pressures facing europeans , including problems such as dysfunctional families and anti-social behavior , mental illness , as well as new diseases of affluence .
the integration of minorities was also a challenge , the report said . the two studies are part of a public consultation by the commission to assess europe 's current social realities and trends , dubbed a " social stocktaking exercise . " happiness is contagious the eurobarometer study said the most content in the bloc were the danes , 97 percent of whom declared themselves " happy . "
the dutch , belgians , irish and swedes , followed by respondents from luxembourg and finland , were not far behind in the happy stakes . the british , at 92 percent , were found to be happier than the french -lrb- 90 percent -rrb- and the germans -lrb- 82 percent -rrb- . the happiness indicator achieved a momentum of its own , lerais said . " if you realize that nine and a half out of every 10 citizens around you are happy , then it makes you happy yourself , " lerais said alongside his co-author , roger liddle . new eu members romania -lrb- 60 percent -rrb- and bulgaria -lrb- 39 percent -rrb- are shown as the most unhappy europeans , although the study was taken in november and december before they joined the bloc on jan .
1 , 2007 . europeans feel over-worked when it came to work , though , the figures changed .
the eurobarometer study showed that the most advanced eu member states were rapidly becoming post-industrial , with manufacturing accounting for less than a fifth of all jobs in the eu as a whole . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bulgaria joined the eu with a flourish in january these changes were leading to " new occupational divisions " according to the report , with at least half of existing jobs demanding a high level of skills while a third of the workforce had " very few skills . "
women were heavily represented in the low-skilled service sector , and gender pay-gap and career progression issues continued . in the study , 41 percent of people agreed that their work was " too demanding and stressful . "
just more than one in three disagreed . european commission president jose manuel barroso said the social stocktaking was necessary as a frame of reference for social policies . " the modern purpose of the european union is to enable europe 's citizens to enhance their prosperity , solidarity and security in a global age , " barroso said .
" we can not do this adequately without a common frame of reference for what is happening to our societies and a common understanding of the likely impact of the big social challenges we face . " the commission said the results may be fed into forthcoming policy initiatives . dw staff / afp / dpa -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de happiness is … love and vacation valentine 's day is the day of love .

europeans are happier than ever before two eu reports released this week show most europeans are happy with their lives , despite social challenges facing the 27-nation bloc .
danes tops the happiness scale while bulgarians say they have little reason to smile . a eurobarometer poll published by the european commission this week said that 86 percent of europeans were relatively satisfied with their personal life and everyday environment .
the study said today 's europeans were happier , wealthier and living longer than their predecessors . " life satisfaction and happiness is higher in europe than in any other part of the world , " one of the study 's authors , frederic lerais , told reporters in brussels .
" life expectancy has increased and could increase a lot further , as could the possibilities of leading healthier , as well as longer lives . " however , a study of europe 's social reality published by the commission 's in-house think tank said although life satisfaction and happiness were higher in europe than in other parts of the world , eu societies were struggling to cope with immigration , ageing and a rapid shift to a " knowledge economy . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe 's future generations face many challenges " european societies face major social challenges , " the report said .
" the knowledge economy can seem threatening to those with low skills and low educational aspirations . " the report said unemployment and inactivity still blighted too many people 's lives , as did unresolved problems of widespread poverty .
it also pointed to new pressures facing europeans , including problems such as dysfunctional families and anti-social behavior , mental illness , as well as new diseases of affluence .
the integration of minorities was also a challenge , the report said . the two studies are part of a public consultation by the commission to assess europe 's current social realities and trends , dubbed a " social stocktaking exercise . " happiness is contagious the eurobarometer study said the most content in the bloc were the danes , 97 percent of whom declared themselves " happy . "
the dutch , belgians , irish and swedes , followed by respondents from luxembourg and finland , were not far behind in the happy stakes . the british , at 92 percent , were found to be happier than the french -lrb- 90 percent -rrb- and the germans -lrb- 82 percent -rrb- . the happiness indicator achieved a momentum of its own , lerais said .

the firm is now valued at 250 million euros , but he told manager-magazin.de that a more realistic figure is around 150 million euros .

europeans are happier than ever before two eu reports released this week show most europeans are happy with their lives , despite social challenges facing the 27-nation bloc .
danes tops the happiness scale while bulgarians say they have little reason to smile . a eurobarometer poll published by the european commission this week said that 86 percent of europeans were relatively satisfied with their personal life and everyday environment .
the study said today 's europeans were happier , wealthier and living longer than their predecessors . " life satisfaction and happiness is higher in europe than in any other part of the world , " one of the study 's authors , frederic lerais , told reporters in brussels .
" life expectancy has increased and could increase a lot further , as could the possibilities of leading healthier , as well as longer lives . " however , a study of europe 's social reality published by the commission 's in-house think tank said although life satisfaction and happiness were higher in europe than in other parts of the world , eu societies were struggling to cope with immigration , ageing and a rapid shift to a " knowledge economy . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe 's future generations face many challenges " european societies face major social challenges , " the report said .
" the knowledge economy can seem threatening to those with low skills and low educational aspirations . " the report said unemployment and inactivity still blighted too many people 's lives , as did unresolved problems of widespread poverty .
it also pointed to new pressures facing europeans , including problems such as dysfunctional families and anti-social behavior , mental illness , as well as new diseases of affluence .
the integration of minorities was also a challenge , the report said . the two studies are part of a public consultation by the commission to assess europe 's current social realities and trends , dubbed a " social stocktaking exercise . " happiness is contagious the eurobarometer study said the most content in the bloc were the danes , 97 percent of whom declared themselves " happy . "
the dutch , belgians , irish and swedes , followed by respondents from luxembourg and finland , were not far behind in the happy stakes . the british , at 92 percent , were found to be happier than the french -lrb- 90 percent -rrb- and the germans -lrb- 82 percent -rrb- . the happiness indicator achieved a momentum of its own , lerais said . " if you realize that nine and a half out of every 10 citizens around you are happy , then it makes you happy yourself , " lerais said alongside his co-author , roger liddle . new eu members romania -lrb- 60 percent -rrb- and bulgaria -lrb- 39 percent -rrb- are shown as the most unhappy europeans , although the study was taken in november and december before they joined the bloc on jan .
1 , 2007 . europeans feel over-worked when it came to work , though , the figures changed .
the eurobarometer study showed that the most advanced eu member states were rapidly becoming post-industrial , with manufacturing accounting for less than a fifth of all jobs in the eu as a whole . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bulgaria joined the eu with a flourish in january these changes were leading to " new occupational divisions " according to the report , with at least half of existing jobs demanding a high level of skills while a third of the workforce had " very few skills . "
women were heavily represented in the low-skilled service sector , and gender pay-gap and career progression issues continued . in the study , 41 percent of people agreed that their work was " too demanding and stressful . "
just more than one in three disagreed . european commission president jose manuel barroso said the social stocktaking was necessary as a frame of reference for social policies . " the modern purpose of the european union is to enable europe 's citizens to enhance their prosperity , solidarity and security in a global age , " barroso said .
" we can not do this adequately without a common frame of reference for what is happening to our societies and a common understanding of the likely impact of the big social challenges we face .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 27.02.2007 opinion : ruling on serbia individualizes the blame großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un 's highest court on monday cleared serbia of direct responsibility for genocide in bosnia during the 1992-95 war .
dw 's benjamin pargan comments that serbia now has less excuses to hand over war crimes criminals . once again it was a clear " yes-and-no " and " as-well-as " solution by the so-called international community .
the disappointment of the predominantly muslim war victims in bosnia and herzegovina is understandable .
many of them were displaced , tortured , raped by reservists and guerrilla fighters from serbia and montenegro . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benjamin pargan relatives of those muslim bosniaks murdered in the bosnian city of bijeljina , for example , will never understand this verdict .
their family members became victims of special forces and killer commandos from serbia right in the first days of the war - with the blessing of the government in belgrade at the time . the like occurred in several cities in bosnia and herzegovina .
this was repeatedly proven in individual trials at the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia in the hague .
the president of the international court of justice , rosalyn higgins , indirectly confirmed this with her remark that serbia militarily and financially supported bosnian serbs to a considerable degree . where does this significant support give way to direct responsibility for the genocide ?
either this question could not be conclusively clarified or - more likely - the judges at the highest un court did n't have enough courage and endurance to do so , regardless of possible political consequences . nonetheless , the judgment by the international court also has a positive side .
up to now , a large part of the serbian political establishment has repeatedly spoken of a sweeping prejudgment of the serbs .
mostly nationalist-minded powers used these pre-fabricated formulas far too often to dish up stories for their population about alleged forced and unjust collective guilt of the serbs .
when it came to questioning their own role in the war , many serbs accepted these argumentation aids with thanks .
a conviction of serbia would have given such populist pied pipers even more impetus .
it was , after all , the first time that a nation was formally accused of genocide . now , there is one excuse less for the up till now rejection of handing over serb generals accused of war crimes to the tribunal in the hague .
the verdict is a significant step in the direction of individualizing the blame - a demand also often made by serbia . the government in belgrade is more likely to interpret this judgment as a clean bill of health .
the international community and particularly the european union has to now make clear all the more that cooperating with the tribunal in the hague is still the requirement for approaching the transatlantic community .
otherwise , the rather meager efforts of the serbs so far to punish war criminals will peter out even more quickly and silently . benjamin pargan is an editor for dw-radio 's bosnian department -lrb- sac -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de un 's highest court clears serbia of genocide in the first ruling of its kind , the international court of justice monday cleared serbia of direct responsibility for genocide in bosnia , but said belgrade violated international law by failing to prevent the massacre .

dw 's benjamin pargan comments that serbia now has less excuses to hand over war crimes criminals . once again it was a clear " yes-and-no " and " as-well-as " solution by the so-called international community .
the disappointment of the predominantly muslim war victims in bosnia and herzegovina is understandable .
many of them were displaced , tortured , raped by reservists and guerrilla fighters from serbia and montenegro . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benjamin pargan relatives of those muslim bosniaks murdered in the bosnian city of bijeljina , for example , will never understand this verdict .
their family members became victims of special forces and killer commandos from serbia right in the first days of the war - with the blessing of the government in belgrade at the time . the like occurred in several cities in bosnia and herzegovina .
this was repeatedly proven in individual trials at the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia in the hague .
the president of the international court of justice , rosalyn higgins , indirectly confirmed this with her remark that serbia militarily and financially supported bosnian serbs to a considerable degree . where does this significant support give way to direct responsibility for the genocide ?
either this question could not be conclusively clarified or - more likely - the judges at the highest un court did n't have enough courage and endurance to do so , regardless of possible political consequences . nonetheless , the judgment by the international court also has a positive side .
up to now , a large part of the serbian political establishment has repeatedly spoken of a sweeping prejudgment of the serbs .
mostly nationalist-minded powers used these pre-fabricated formulas far too often to dish up stories for their population about alleged forced and unjust collective guilt of the serbs .
when it came to questioning their own role in the war , many serbs accepted these argumentation aids with thanks .
a conviction of serbia would have given such populist pied pipers even more impetus .
it was , after all , the first time that a nation was formally accused of genocide . now , there is one excuse less for the up till now rejection of handing over serb generals accused of war crimes to the tribunal in the hague .
the verdict is a significant step in the direction of individualizing the blame - a demand also often made by serbia . the government in belgrade is more likely to interpret this judgment as a clean bill of health .
the international community and particularly the european union has to now make clear all the more that cooperating with the tribunal in the hague is still the requirement for approaching the transatlantic community .

the case has raised questions about press freedom in germany . germany 's constitutional court in karlsruhe ruled tuesday that police violated the constitution by raiding the offices of the political online magazine cicero , based near berlin . judges said that the 2005 raid was a considerable violation of press freedom . in a 7-1 decision , the karlsruhe judges said the september 2005 search breached the constitition because the journalists themselves were not formally suspected of breaking the law . " searches and seizures against media people as part of a formal inquiry are unconstitutional if they are purely or mainly intended to detect the identity of an informant , " said presiding judge hans-jürgen papier . the court thus ruled in favor of cicero editor-in chief wolfram weimer , who had lodged a constitutional complaint against the search . a state court had ruled that the search , originally conducted under a warrant from a potsdam magistrate , was legal .
police seized disks and made a copy of a journalist 's hard-drive during the raid . national debate on press freedom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former interior minister schily the " cicero affair " gained momentum on sept .
12 , 2005 , when agents from germany ’ s federal criminal police office raided the magazine 's offices . they spent the whole day sifting through files and computer data .
at the end of the day , the german government came away with box-loads of material - and a massive public relations headache . yet the issue had started back in april 2005 .
the magazine ’ s authors published an article about a top al-qaeda leader , abu musab al-zarkawi , who has since been killed during a us air strike in iraq . as author bruno schirra reported his story , he cited information from a classified document which he obtained from a source within the federal criminal police office , or " bka . " former interior minister otto schily believed that was a major breach of security . " the government simply can not accept that documents from its innermost circles are passed on to the public by officers , because that creates dangers for such operations , " schily said . the journalists saw things differently .
cicero editor-in-chief wolfram weimar stood by his reporters ' conduct , and said their objectives are clear . " journalists are neither microphone-holders nor the king ’ s scribes : they are there to bring unpleasant truths to light , whether the powerful like it or not , and otto schily is no exception , " said weimar . in addition , more than 200 bka agents may have had access to the information , which shows that the data was n't highly-secretive , journalists pointed out . rumors also abound that the bka deliberately manipulates data in order to track down leaks . long-winded legal battle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cicero editor-in-chief weimer wants to reveal the truth the ensuing cicero legal battle , at any rate , has lasted almost two years . yet it has been more than an aggressive campaign to uncover a leak inside the bka .
the affair quickly became a high-profile battle of principles , pitching government secrecy against journalistic inquiry . while some officials have defended the cicero raid in the name of state secrets and national security , their arguments have largely fallen on deaf ears with the press , the public and almost every political party on the spectrum , including the social democrats - or " spd , " schily ’ s own party . dieter wiefelspütz , the interior affairs expert for the spd , said that while he understands the need to find leaks within the bka , journalists ' work must also be respected . " if the work of journalists - who deal with confidential information nearly every day - is generally criminalized , then we have a real problem with press freedom in germany , " wiefelspütz said . he added that the bka should perhaps focus on the culprits within its own ranks first , and not turn journalists into culprits . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a distinctly " political " magazine in february 2006 , the potsdam district court ruled that the police search of the cicero offices was lawful schirra 's article contained " secret information relevant to national security . " editor weimar then filed a complaint against the raids with the country 's highest court . echoes from the past for many germans , the cicero affair has raised the specter of the spiegel scandal that began in 1962 .
back then , the weekly newsmagazine der spiegel was accused of treason for an article criticizing the german armed forces . defense minister franz josef strauß had the spiegel offices searched and occupied by police , and spiegel ’ s editor-in-chief , publisher and the author of the article arrested . the scandal ended with strauß ’ s resignation and a victory for press freedom . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german high court reviews press freedom german constitutional judges on wednesday began hearing the complaint of the editor of a magazine , whose offices had been searched by investigators following publication of classified material .

the case has raised questions about press freedom in germany . germany 's constitutional court in karlsruhe ruled tuesday that police violated the constitution by raiding the offices of the political online magazine cicero , based near berlin . judges said that the 2005 raid was a considerable violation of press freedom . in a 7-1 decision , the karlsruhe judges said the september 2005 search breached the constitition because the journalists themselves were not formally suspected of breaking the law . " searches and seizures against media people as part of a formal inquiry are unconstitutional if they are purely or mainly intended to detect the identity of an informant , " said presiding judge hans-jürgen papier . the court thus ruled in favor of cicero editor-in chief wolfram weimer , who had lodged a constitutional complaint against the search . a state court had ruled that the search , originally conducted under a warrant from a potsdam magistrate , was legal .
police seized disks and made a copy of a journalist 's hard-drive during the raid . national debate on press freedom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former interior minister schily the " cicero affair " gained momentum on sept .
12 , 2005 , when agents from germany ’ s federal criminal police office raided the magazine 's offices . they spent the whole day sifting through files and computer data .
at the end of the day , the german government came away with box-loads of material - and a massive public relations headache . yet the issue had started back in april 2005 .
the magazine ’ s authors published an article about a top al-qaeda leader , abu musab al-zarkawi , who has since been killed during a us air strike in iraq . as author bruno schirra reported his story , he cited information from a classified document which he obtained from a source within the federal criminal police office , or " bka . " former interior minister otto schily believed that was a major breach of security . " the government simply can not accept that documents from its innermost circles are passed on to the public by officers , because that creates dangers for such operations , " schily said . the journalists saw things differently .
cicero editor-in-chief wolfram weimar stood by his reporters ' conduct , and said their objectives are clear . " journalists are neither microphone-holders nor the king ’ s scribes : they are there to bring unpleasant truths to light , whether the powerful like it or not , and otto schily is no exception , " said weimar . in addition , more than 200 bka agents may have had access to the information , which shows that the data was n't highly-secretive , journalists pointed out . rumors also abound that the bka deliberately manipulates data in order to track down leaks . long-winded legal battle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cicero editor-in-chief weimer wants to reveal the truth the ensuing cicero legal battle , at any rate , has lasted almost two years . yet it has been more than an aggressive campaign to uncover a leak inside the bka .
the affair quickly became a high-profile battle of principles , pitching government secrecy against journalistic inquiry . while some officials have defended the cicero raid in the name of state secrets and national security , their arguments have largely fallen on deaf ears with the press , the public and almost every political party on the spectrum , including the social democrats - or " spd , " schily ’ s own party . dieter wiefelspütz , the interior affairs expert for the spd , said that while he understands the need to find leaks within the bka , journalists ' work must also be respected . " if the work of journalists - who deal with confidential information nearly every day - is generally criminalized , then we have a real problem with press freedom in germany , " wiefelspütz said . he added that the bka should perhaps focus on the culprits within its own ranks first , and not turn journalists into culprits . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a distinctly " political " magazine in february 2006 , the potsdam district court ruled that the police search of the cicero offices was lawful schirra 's article contained " secret information relevant to national security . " editor weimar then filed a complaint against the raids with the country 's highest court . echoes from the past for many germans , the cicero affair has raised the specter of the spiegel scandal that began in 1962 .
back then , the weekly newsmagazine der spiegel was accused of treason for an article criticizing the german armed forces . defense minister franz josef strauß had the spiegel offices searched and occupied by police , and spiegel ’ s editor-in-chief , publisher and the author of the article arrested . the scandal ended with strauß ’ s resignation and a victory for press freedom . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german high court reviews press freedom german constitutional judges on wednesday began hearing the complaint of the editor of a magazine , whose offices had been searched by investigators following publication of classified material .

but the " third man " françois bayrou could upset the first round of voting on april 22 . the latest polls in france show that conservative presidential candidate nicolas sarkozy and socialist rival ségolène royal are running neck-and-neck .
but outside contenders in the vote could upset a clear outcome . the traditional centrist , pro-european politician françois bayrou and far-right leader jean-marie le pen have also thrown their hats into the ring . voters in france head to the polls on april 22 for a presidential election .
a second round of voting is scheduled for may 6 if none of the candidates win an outright majority . according to the latest survey by lh2 pollsters , sarkozy is slightly ahead in the first round of voting with 30 percent of votes while royal would get 27 percent .
bayrou is credited with 17 percent of votes while le pen is holding 13 percent .
in a runoff , sarkozy and royal could both win 50 percent , the survey said . front-runners turn on " the third man " centrist bayrou - dubbed " the third man " in the french press - has seen a recent surge in his ratings .
during a prime-time television performance on monday night , bayrou promised he would transcend the left-right divide in france .
analysts said this could explain his growing popularity . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : centrist candidate françois bayrou is calling for " a social economy " " the two front-runners , how much support do they have - 25 percent ? "
bayrou said on tf1 television .
" that 's not enough to run the country .
that 's why we are in the state we are in , because there has not been enough backing for reform . " but both royal and sarkozy have criticized his platform . " i think it 's very dangerous , " royal told france inter radio .
" it 's trying to stop the french choosing between two models of society , two opposing political visions . " sarkozy said bayrou 's policies would lead to chaos like that of france 's fourth republic , when makeshift coalition governments rose and fell repeatedly . " democracy is a majority and an opposition and the french have to choose , " sarkozy told rmc radio . le pen focuses on anti-immigrant , anti-europe platform le pen could prove to be a greater threat to the main candidates than bayrou , though .
the far-right leader is doing better in the race than he was before the 2002 elections .
at that time , he stunned the nation by qualifying for the second round of voting against jacques chirac .
with nearly 17 percent of votes , he beat out socialist candidate lionel jospin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : right-wing leader jean-marie le pen is promoting a " zero immigration " platform the 78-year-old launched his election program in lille over the weekend .
in his fifth and probably last bid for the presidency , le pen vowed to halt immigration and integration with europe , which he said was leading france to disaster . le pen told a convention of his national front party that he would cut off social benefits to immigrants and " restore france 's borders . "
amid cheers and chants of " le pen , president ! " the far-right leader said france was crumbling under poverty , unemployment , the dislocation of factories and " massive immigration . " but french reality has changed over the past five years .
in 2002 , security and crime topped the list of voters concerns .
this had fit well into le pen 's nationalist anti-immigration platform .

but the " third man " françois bayrou could upset the first round of voting on april 22 . the latest polls in france show that conservative presidential candidate nicolas sarkozy and socialist rival ségolène royal are running neck-and-neck .
but outside contenders in the vote could upset a clear outcome . the traditional centrist , pro-european politician françois bayrou and far-right leader jean-marie le pen have also thrown their hats into the ring . voters in france head to the polls on april 22 for a presidential election .
a second round of voting is scheduled for may 6 if none of the candidates win an outright majority . according to the latest survey by lh2 pollsters , sarkozy is slightly ahead in the first round of voting with 30 percent of votes while royal would get 27 percent .
bayrou is credited with 17 percent of votes while le pen is holding 13 percent .
in a runoff , sarkozy and royal could both win 50 percent , the survey said . front-runners turn on " the third man " centrist bayrou - dubbed " the third man " in the french press - has seen a recent surge in his ratings .
during a prime-time television performance on monday night , bayrou promised he would transcend the left-right divide in france .
analysts said this could explain his growing popularity . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : centrist candidate françois bayrou is calling for " a social economy " " the two front-runners , how much support do they have - 25 percent ? "
bayrou said on tf1 television .

that 's why we are in the state we are in , because there has not been enough backing for reform . " but both royal and sarkozy have criticized his platform . " i think it 's very dangerous , " royal told france inter radio .
" it 's trying to stop the french choosing between two models of society , two opposing political visions . " sarkozy said bayrou 's policies would lead to chaos like that of france 's fourth republic , when makeshift coalition governments rose and fell repeatedly . " democracy is a majority and an opposition and the french have to choose , " sarkozy told rmc radio . le pen focuses on anti-immigrant , anti-europe platform le pen could prove to be a greater threat to the main candidates than bayrou , though .
the far-right leader is doing better in the race than he was before the 2002 elections .

amid cheers and chants of " le pen , president ! " the far-right leader said france was crumbling under poverty , unemployment , the dislocation of factories and " massive immigration . " but french reality has changed over the past five years .
in 2002 , security and crime topped the list of voters concerns .

" we understand the position of our european partners and chancellor merkel , " yanukovych said . " we also understand that only reforms of the economy , our legal system and judiciary , of the bureaucracy and improving the living standard of our citizens will move ukraine closer to the eu , " he added . thus , unlike his political rival president yushchenko , who expressed a clear desire to join the eu during his visit to germany two weeks ago , prime minister yanukovych has been more pragmatic . he stressed that more attention should be given to the new partnership and cooperation accord with the eu . " i believe this agreement will be the cornerstone for developing our relationship , " yanukovych said .
" the first step and most important component of this new treaty should be the creation of a free-trade zone .

europeans are happier than ever before two eu reports released this week show most europeans are happy with their lives , despite social challenges facing the 27-nation bloc .
danes tops the happiness scale while bulgarians say they have little reason to smile . a eurobarometer poll published by the european commission this week said that 86 percent of europeans were relatively satisfied with their personal life and everyday environment .
the study said today 's europeans were happier , wealthier and living longer than their predecessors . " life satisfaction and happiness is higher in europe than in any other part of the world , " one of the study 's authors , frederic lerais , told reporters in brussels .
" life expectancy has increased and could increase a lot further , as could the possibilities of leading healthier , as well as longer lives . " however , a study of europe 's social reality published by the commission 's in-house think tank said although life satisfaction and happiness were higher in europe than in other parts of the world , eu societies were struggling to cope with immigration , ageing and a rapid shift to a " knowledge economy . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe 's future generations face many challenges " european societies face major social challenges , " the report said .
" the knowledge economy can seem threatening to those with low skills and low educational aspirations . " the report said unemployment and inactivity still blighted too many people 's lives , as did unresolved problems of widespread poverty .
it also pointed to new pressures facing europeans , including problems such as dysfunctional families and anti-social behavior , mental illness , as well as new diseases of affluence .
the integration of minorities was also a challenge , the report said . the two studies are part of a public consultation by the commission to assess europe 's current social realities and trends , dubbed a " social stocktaking exercise . " happiness is contagious the eurobarometer study said the most content in the bloc were the danes , 97 percent of whom declared themselves " happy . "
the dutch , belgians , irish and swedes , followed by respondents from luxembourg and finland , were not far behind in the happy stakes . the british , at 92 percent , were found to be happier than the french -lrb- 90 percent -rrb- and the germans -lrb- 82 percent -rrb- . the happiness indicator achieved a momentum of its own , lerais said . " if you realize that nine and a half out of every 10 citizens around you are happy , then it makes you happy yourself , " lerais said alongside his co-author , roger liddle . new eu members romania -lrb- 60 percent -rrb- and bulgaria -lrb- 39 percent -rrb- are shown as the most unhappy europeans , although the study was taken in november and december before they joined the bloc on jan .
1 , 2007 . europeans feel over-worked when it came to work , though , the figures changed .
the eurobarometer study showed that the most advanced eu member states were rapidly becoming post-industrial , with manufacturing accounting for less than a fifth of all jobs in the eu as a whole . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bulgaria joined the eu with a flourish in january these changes were leading to " new occupational divisions " according to the report , with at least half of existing jobs demanding a high level of skills while a third of the workforce had " very few skills . "
women were heavily represented in the low-skilled service sector , and gender pay-gap and career progression issues continued . in the study , 41 percent of people agreed that their work was " too demanding and stressful . "
just more than one in three disagreed . european commission president jose manuel barroso said the social stocktaking was necessary as a frame of reference for social policies . " the modern purpose of the european union is to enable europe 's citizens to enhance their prosperity , solidarity and security in a global age , " barroso said .
" we can not do this adequately without a common frame of reference for what is happening to our societies and a common understanding of the likely impact of the big social challenges we face .

europeans are happier than ever before two eu reports released this week show most europeans are happy with their lives , despite social challenges facing the 27-nation bloc .
danes tops the happiness scale while bulgarians say they have little reason to smile . a eurobarometer poll published by the european commission this week said that 86 percent of europeans were relatively satisfied with their personal life and everyday environment .
the study said today 's europeans were happier , wealthier and living longer than their predecessors . " life satisfaction and happiness is higher in europe than in any other part of the world , " one of the study 's authors , frederic lerais , told reporters in brussels .
" life expectancy has increased and could increase a lot further , as could the possibilities of leading healthier , as well as longer lives . " however , a study of europe 's social reality published by the commission 's in-house think tank said although life satisfaction and happiness were higher in europe than in other parts of the world , eu societies were struggling to cope with immigration , ageing and a rapid shift to a " knowledge economy . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe 's future generations face many challenges " european societies face major social challenges , " the report said .
" the knowledge economy can seem threatening to those with low skills and low educational aspirations . " the report said unemployment and inactivity still blighted too many people 's lives , as did unresolved problems of widespread poverty .
it also pointed to new pressures facing europeans , including problems such as dysfunctional families and anti-social behavior , mental illness , as well as new diseases of affluence .
the integration of minorities was also a challenge , the report said . the two studies are part of a public consultation by the commission to assess europe 's current social realities and trends , dubbed a " social stocktaking exercise . " happiness is contagious the eurobarometer study said the most content in the bloc were the danes , 97 percent of whom declared themselves " happy . "
the dutch , belgians , irish and swedes , followed by respondents from luxembourg and finland , were not far behind in the happy stakes . the british , at 92 percent , were found to be happier than the french -lrb- 90 percent -rrb- and the germans -lrb- 82 percent -rrb- . the happiness indicator achieved a momentum of its own , lerais said . " if you realize that nine and a half out of every 10 citizens around you are happy , then it makes you happy yourself , " lerais said alongside his co-author , roger liddle . new eu members romania -lrb- 60 percent -rrb- and bulgaria -lrb- 39 percent -rrb- are shown as the most unhappy europeans , although the study was taken in november and december before they joined the bloc on jan .
1 , 2007 . europeans feel over-worked when it came to work , though , the figures changed .
the eurobarometer study showed that the most advanced eu member states were rapidly becoming post-industrial , with manufacturing accounting for less than a fifth of all jobs in the eu as a whole . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bulgaria joined the eu with a flourish in january these changes were leading to " new occupational divisions " according to the report , with at least half of existing jobs demanding a high level of skills while a third of the workforce had " very few skills . "
women were heavily represented in the low-skilled service sector , and gender pay-gap and career progression issues continued . in the study , 41 percent of people agreed that their work was " too demanding and stressful . "
just more than one in three disagreed . european commission president jose manuel barroso said the social stocktaking was necessary as a frame of reference for social policies . " the modern purpose of the european union is to enable europe 's citizens to enhance their prosperity , solidarity and security in a global age , " barroso said .
" we can not do this adequately without a common frame of reference for what is happening to our societies and a common understanding of the likely impact of the big social challenges we face . " the commission said the results may be fed into forthcoming policy initiatives . dw staff / afp / dpa -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de happiness is … love and vacation valentine 's day is the day of love .

the company is closing its special shops aimed at women , and more than two-thirds of its german stores did worse in 2006 than the year before . performance anxiety has rarely been an issue at europe 's biggest sex-shop company beate uhse .
but media reports and store closings indicate that the once high-flying sex chain has lost some of its potency with both customers and stock analysts . while a full report on the company 's 2006 performance is not due out until the end of march , internal figures obtained by the online business site manager-magazin.de paint a picture of a very unsexy year for the company . of 61 sex shops in germany , 47 are reported to have done worse in 2006 than in 2005 ; 19 of those chalked up losses .
the chain 's operating results was 49 percent below target ; the mail order business did even worse . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women 's erotic lingerie in a beate uhse shop the christmas season turned out to be anything but jolly for the company , thanks in part to a defective sprinkler that flooded its primary mail-order warehouse in the netherlands .

the company is closing its special shops aimed at women , and more than two-thirds of its german stores did worse in 2006 than the year before . performance anxiety has rarely been an issue at europe 's biggest sex-shop company beate uhse .
but media reports and store closings indicate that the once high-flying sex chain has lost some of its potency with both customers and stock analysts . while a full report on the company 's 2006 performance is not due out until the end of march , internal figures obtained by the online business site manager-magazin.de paint a picture of a very unsexy year for the company . of 61 sex shops in germany , 47 are reported to have done worse in 2006 than in 2005 ; 19 of those chalked up losses .
the chain 's operating results was 49 percent below target ; the mail order business did even worse . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women 's erotic lingerie in a beate uhse shop the christmas season turned out to be anything but jolly for the company , thanks in part to a defective sprinkler that flooded its primary mail-order warehouse in the netherlands .
the water damage cost the company 15 million euros -lrb- $ 20 million -rrb- . just after the holiday season , the company had to admit it would not be able to match its 2005 sales of 285 million euros . mae b. falls flat the company will close the last of its mae b. shops as their leases run out .
the beate uhse offshoot , geared towards the female market and featuring brightly lit stores with sexy lingerie and erotica instead of hardcore pornography , was opened in 2004 .
the idea was to pull the company out of its porn niche and reach a broader spectrum of customers . despite the tasteful decor , massage oils , erotic games and silver and gold vibrators , the concept , which beate uhse spokeswoman assia tschernookoff now calls an " experiment , " did n't fly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beate uhse stores are found in city centers , not relegated to the outskirts or industrial areas now the company is trying a new approach , and recently opened a flagship store in munich that will carry many of the items featured at mae b. in addition to the inventory found in the more traditional beate uhse stores . the company has experienced several buckets of cold water over the past few years , generally around its ambitious expansion plans .
a takeover of the condom manufacturer condomi failed , as did the purchase of the " penthouse " publishing house . an attempt to get into the world 's biggest pornography market , the united states , was not successful and beate uhse was forced to withdraw after suffering heavy losses . fantasy unfulfilled the company 's stock market flotation in 1999 was accompanied with much fanfare and its stock price reached a high of 29 euros .
but since then it has a long ride downhill until the price bottomed out at 3.95 euros last november . stock analysts are recommending selling beate uhse stock , worried by news that the company 's biggest stockholder and son of founder beate uhse , ulrich rotermund , is trying to find a buyer for his 29.5 percent stake . analysts have also been concerned about the unclear relationship between dutch pornography entrepreneur gerard cok and his consipio holding , which holds a 20.8 percent stake , and the flensburg , germany-based company . according to analyst matthias schrade of gsc research , the company is still overvalued .
the firm is now valued at 250 million euros , but he told manager-magazin.de that a more realistic figure is around 150 million euros .
but , he added , he currently would n't want to pay more than 100 million euros for the firm . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de beate uhse loses its world cup buzz bad news for german soccer fans : olli k. and michael b. will not be bringing pleasure to supporters during the world cup .

berlin will likely have to lower the bar . although chancellor angela merkel had hoped to use an upcoming summit in berlin to be a springboard toward a new discussion on an eu constitution , differences among members mean that will likely not happen .
german aspirations are being rolled back as member states remain on different pages regarding an eu charter . " quality is more important than speed , " czech deputy prime minister alexandr vondra said , following talks with german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier in berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany had hoped to revive the constitution process however , danish foreign minister per stig moller said after a separate meeting with steinmeier that denmark would back an initiative to be put forward by germany before it passes the eu presidency to portugal in july . " if all 27 members vote for it , we will be on board , " moller said , warning that the eu faced a difficult period if no solution to the impasse was found . uniting or dividing ? vondra said a solution to the problem , which arose after the french and the dutch rejected the proposed new constitution , had to be found .
but the solution had to bind europe together and not divide it , he added , pledging a constructive approach from the czech republic . steinmeier expressed confidence a new initiative backed by all eu members would be put forward by the end of june . " we need this if europe is to remain effective in the future , " he said , pointing to the need for institutional reform for the enlarged eu to keep functioning . although germany had hoped to use its six-month eu presidency to get the treaty discussions back firmly on track , it appears that that goal will not be reached . declaration dissention in a sign of the extent of the differences among eu countries , representatives can not agree on the language to be used in a declaration being drafted for march summit celebrating the 50th anniversary of the treaty of rome , which established the european economic community , the forerunner of the eu . diplomats are split on language describing the bloc 's achievements , values and challenges in a document , which one envoy described to reuters are likely to be " bland at best . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french and dutch " no 's " stalled the constitution - restarting it is difficult merkel 's goal is to get eu leaders on board by june to work towards the ratification of a new version of the eu constitution by 2009 's european parliament elections . " she wanted a clause at the end of the berlin declaration saying ' this is why we need to sign up to a new constitution to set up the june summit , " ' one diplomat told reuters .
" this is not going to happen . " instead , the document will likely try to set the mood for reviving talks rather than make firm commitments , since merkel does not want to start in internal eu fight .
opinions within the bloc differ widely on issues such as turkey 's potential membership , further expansion and the extent of eu 's social welfare system . the needs of an unwieldy bloc proponents of the constitution say it is needed to ease decision-making in the 27-member bloc .
it would give bigger nations more power through a reform of the voting system and appoint a foreign minister and an eu president who would serve for longer than the current six months . eighteen of the 27 eu members have ratified the new constitution .
the french and dutch rejected it by significant majorities in referenda held in mid-2005 , causing a crisis in the eu which can still be felt . the british government pledged to hold a referendum , but postponed it indefinitely after the rejection by france and the netherlands .
poland , portugal , denmark , sweden , the czech republic and ireland have yet to ratify it . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany faces " impossible task " with eu charter one of the main goals of the german eu presidency is to resurrect the european union constitution .
but some say that is not going to happen .

dw 's benjamin pargan comments that serbia now has less excuses to hand over war crimes criminals . once again it was a clear " yes-and-no " and " as-well-as " solution by the so-called international community .
the disappointment of the predominantly muslim war victims in bosnia and herzegovina is understandable .
many of them were displaced , tortured , raped by reservists and guerrilla fighters from serbia and montenegro . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benjamin pargan relatives of those muslim bosniaks murdered in the bosnian city of bijeljina , for example , will never understand this verdict .
their family members became victims of special forces and killer commandos from serbia right in the first days of the war - with the blessing of the government in belgrade at the time . the like occurred in several cities in bosnia and herzegovina .
this was repeatedly proven in individual trials at the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia in the hague .
the president of the international court of justice , rosalyn higgins , indirectly confirmed this with her remark that serbia militarily and financially supported bosnian serbs to a considerable degree . where does this significant support give way to direct responsibility for the genocide ?
either this question could not be conclusively clarified or - more likely - the judges at the highest un court did n't have enough courage and endurance to do so , regardless of possible political consequences . nonetheless , the judgment by the international court also has a positive side .
up to now , a large part of the serbian political establishment has repeatedly spoken of a sweeping prejudgment of the serbs .
mostly nationalist-minded powers used these pre-fabricated formulas far too often to dish up stories for their population about alleged forced and unjust collective guilt of the serbs .
when it came to questioning their own role in the war , many serbs accepted these argumentation aids with thanks .
a conviction of serbia would have given such populist pied pipers even more impetus .
it was , after all , the first time that a nation was formally accused of genocide . now , there is one excuse less for the up till now rejection of handing over serb generals accused of war crimes to the tribunal in the hague .
the verdict is a significant step in the direction of individualizing the blame - a demand also often made by serbia . the government in belgrade is more likely to interpret this judgment as a clean bill of health .
the international community and particularly the european union has to now make clear all the more that cooperating with the tribunal in the hague is still the requirement for approaching the transatlantic community .

threat of action " no one wants this to happen .
but we are not ruling it out , " said peter scherrer , general secretary of the european metalworkers ' federation .
he said the closing down of entire plants , the one-sided distribution of cuts or the playing-off of different workforces could , for example , trigger industrial action . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the plans have already sparked union protests the broad outlines of the plan were first unveiled in october , sparking union protests .
in february , 20,000 members of the german metalworkers ' union ig metall took part in a day of action . airbus has 16 factories in britain , france , germany and spain , but the main tensions have arisen over job cuts in germany and france .
with presidential elections coming up in france , french politicians are particularly sensitive about domestic job cuts .
this sparked fears in germany that german workers would bear the brunt of the cutbacks .
french prime minister dominique de villepin referred last week to 10,000 job cuts - a figure later denied by the german government . a french newspaper also carried an unconfirmed report last week that airbus would seek to close four factories in france and four in germany . government concern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french and german leaders met last week to discuss overhaul the restructuring plan was high on the agenda at a meeting of french president jacques chirac and german chancellor angela merkel on friday , who were keen to defuse tensions sparked by the speculation . the two leaders agreed there should be an " equitable distribution " of the measures needed to reorganise the company . costly delays the franco-german company , whose headquarters are located in the french city of toulouse , has been hit by a string of production problems with the company 's a380 superjumbo airliner which have led to costly two-year delivery delays . eads said the so-called power8 rescue plan would enable airbus to " better face the challenge of the us dollar weakness , the financial burden related to the a380 delays as well as its future investment needs . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : production delays with the superjumbo have been costly in january , it was announced that airbus would report an operating loss for 2006 because of unexpected costs linked to the superjumbo programme . power8 is intended to save the company five billion euros by 2010 and two billion euros each year thereafter . airbus is also counting on savings from power8 to help fund the development of the new mid-sized long-haul jet , the a350 xwb . rivalry with boeing this ten billion euro project is seen as crucial for helping the european planemaker compete with boeing . the failure of the eads board to agree on the sharing of work on this project has delayed the announcement of the overhaul package . analysts have long said that the aircraft maker should spin off the less important production sites . dw staff -lrb- jeg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de for eads and airbus , 2006 was a year to forget the head of european aerospace giant eads said 2006 had been a very bad year indeed .

but the " third man " françois bayrou could upset the first round of voting on april 22 . the latest polls in france show that conservative presidential candidate nicolas sarkozy and socialist rival ségolène royal are running neck-and-neck .
but outside contenders in the vote could upset a clear outcome . the traditional centrist , pro-european politician françois bayrou and far-right leader jean-marie le pen have also thrown their hats into the ring . voters in france head to the polls on april 22 for a presidential election .
a second round of voting is scheduled for may 6 if none of the candidates win an outright majority . according to the latest survey by lh2 pollsters , sarkozy is slightly ahead in the first round of voting with 30 percent of votes while royal would get 27 percent .
bayrou is credited with 17 percent of votes while le pen is holding 13 percent .
in a runoff , sarkozy and royal could both win 50 percent , the survey said . front-runners turn on " the third man " centrist bayrou - dubbed " the third man " in the french press - has seen a recent surge in his ratings .
during a prime-time television performance on monday night , bayrou promised he would transcend the left-right divide in france .
analysts said this could explain his growing popularity . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : centrist candidate françois bayrou is calling for " a social economy " " the two front-runners , how much support do they have - 25 percent ? "
bayrou said on tf1 television .
" that 's not enough to run the country .
that 's why we are in the state we are in , because there has not been enough backing for reform . " but both royal and sarkozy have criticized his platform . " i think it 's very dangerous , " royal told france inter radio .
" it 's trying to stop the french choosing between two models of society , two opposing political visions . " sarkozy said bayrou 's policies would lead to chaos like that of france 's fourth republic , when makeshift coalition governments rose and fell repeatedly . " democracy is a majority and an opposition and the french have to choose , " sarkozy told rmc radio . le pen focuses on anti-immigrant , anti-europe platform le pen could prove to be a greater threat to the main candidates than bayrou , though .
the far-right leader is doing better in the race than he was before the 2002 elections .
at that time , he stunned the nation by qualifying for the second round of voting against jacques chirac .
with nearly 17 percent of votes , he beat out socialist candidate lionel jospin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : right-wing leader jean-marie le pen is promoting a " zero immigration " platform the 78-year-old launched his election program in lille over the weekend .
in his fifth and probably last bid for the presidency , le pen vowed to halt immigration and integration with europe , which he said was leading france to disaster . le pen told a convention of his national front party that he would cut off social benefits to immigrants and " restore france 's borders . "
amid cheers and chants of " le pen , president ! " the far-right leader said france was crumbling under poverty , unemployment , the dislocation of factories and " massive immigration . " but french reality has changed over the past five years .
in 2002 , security and crime topped the list of voters concerns .
this had fit well into le pen 's nationalist anti-immigration platform .
now , sarkozy has moved into le pen 's traditional law-and-order territory .

threat of action " no one wants this to happen .
but we are not ruling it out , " said peter scherrer , general secretary of the european metalworkers ' federation .
he said the closing down of entire plants , the one-sided distribution of cuts or the playing-off of different workforces could , for example , trigger industrial action . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the plans have already sparked union protests the broad outlines of the plan were first unveiled in october , sparking union protests .

but the " third man " françois bayrou could upset the first round of voting on april 22 . the latest polls in france show that conservative presidential candidate nicolas sarkozy and socialist rival ségolène royal are running neck-and-neck .
but outside contenders in the vote could upset a clear outcome . the traditional centrist , pro-european politician françois bayrou and far-right leader jean-marie le pen have also thrown their hats into the ring . voters in france head to the polls on april 22 for a presidential election .
a second round of voting is scheduled for may 6 if none of the candidates win an outright majority . according to the latest survey by lh2 pollsters , sarkozy is slightly ahead in the first round of voting with 30 percent of votes while royal would get 27 percent .
bayrou is credited with 17 percent of votes while le pen is holding 13 percent .
in a runoff , sarkozy and royal could both win 50 percent , the survey said . front-runners turn on " the third man " centrist bayrou - dubbed " the third man " in the french press - has seen a recent surge in his ratings .
during a prime-time television performance on monday night , bayrou promised he would transcend the left-right divide in france .
analysts said this could explain his growing popularity . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : centrist candidate françois bayrou is calling for " a social economy " " the two front-runners , how much support do they have - 25 percent ? "
bayrou said on tf1 television .
" that 's not enough to run the country .
that 's why we are in the state we are in , because there has not been enough backing for reform . " but both royal and sarkozy have criticized his platform . " i think it 's very dangerous , " royal told france inter radio .
" it 's trying to stop the french choosing between two models of society , two opposing political visions . " sarkozy said bayrou 's policies would lead to chaos like that of france 's fourth republic , when makeshift coalition governments rose and fell repeatedly . " democracy is a majority and an opposition and the french have to choose , " sarkozy told rmc radio . le pen focuses on anti-immigrant , anti-europe platform le pen could prove to be a greater threat to the main candidates than bayrou , though .
the far-right leader is doing better in the race than he was before the 2002 elections .
at that time , he stunned the nation by qualifying for the second round of voting against jacques chirac .
with nearly 17 percent of votes , he beat out socialist candidate lionel jospin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : right-wing leader jean-marie le pen is promoting a " zero immigration " platform the 78-year-old launched his election program in lille over the weekend .
in his fifth and probably last bid for the presidency , le pen vowed to halt immigration and integration with europe , which he said was leading france to disaster . le pen told a convention of his national front party that he would cut off social benefits to immigrants and " restore france 's borders . "
amid cheers and chants of " le pen , president ! " the far-right leader said france was crumbling under poverty , unemployment , the dislocation of factories and " massive immigration . " but french reality has changed over the past five years .
in 2002 , security and crime topped the list of voters concerns .
this had fit well into le pen 's nationalist anti-immigration platform .
now , sarkozy has moved into le pen 's traditional law-and-order territory .
voters ' worries have also shifted to jobs and purchasing power , neither of them strong points for le pen . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sparks expected to fly whoever becomes france 's president as the frontrunners in the french presidential race , nicolas sarkozy and segolene royal , make their way to berlin , dw-world.de asks what the election result will mean for germany and the european union in general .

the case has raised questions about press freedom in germany . germany 's constitutional court in karlsruhe ruled tuesday that police violated the constitution by raiding the offices of the political online magazine cicero , based near berlin . judges said that the 2005 raid was a considerable violation of press freedom . in a 7-1 decision , the karlsruhe judges said the september 2005 search breached the constitition because the journalists themselves were not formally suspected of breaking the law . " searches and seizures against media people as part of a formal inquiry are unconstitutional if they are purely or mainly intended to detect the identity of an informant , " said presiding judge hans-jürgen papier . the court thus ruled in favor of cicero editor-in chief wolfram weimer , who had lodged a constitutional complaint against the search . a state court had ruled that the search , originally conducted under a warrant from a potsdam magistrate , was legal .
police seized disks and made a copy of a journalist 's hard-drive during the raid . national debate on press freedom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former interior minister schily the " cicero affair " gained momentum on sept .
12 , 2005 , when agents from germany ’ s federal criminal police office raided the magazine 's offices . they spent the whole day sifting through files and computer data .
at the end of the day , the german government came away with box-loads of material - and a massive public relations headache . yet the issue had started back in april 2005 .
the magazine ’ s authors published an article about a top al-qaeda leader , abu musab al-zarkawi , who has since been killed during a us air strike in iraq . as author bruno schirra reported his story , he cited information from a classified document which he obtained from a source within the federal criminal police office , or " bka . " former interior minister otto schily believed that was a major breach of security . " the government simply can not accept that documents from its innermost circles are passed on to the public by officers , because that creates dangers for such operations , " schily said . the journalists saw things differently .
cicero editor-in-chief wolfram weimar stood by his reporters ' conduct , and said their objectives are clear . " journalists are neither microphone-holders nor the king ’ s scribes : they are there to bring unpleasant truths to light , whether the powerful like it or not , and otto schily is no exception , " said weimar . in addition , more than 200 bka agents may have had access to the information , which shows that the data was n't highly-secretive , journalists pointed out . rumors also abound that the bka deliberately manipulates data in order to track down leaks . long-winded legal battle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cicero editor-in-chief weimer wants to reveal the truth the ensuing cicero legal battle , at any rate , has lasted almost two years . yet it has been more than an aggressive campaign to uncover a leak inside the bka .
the affair quickly became a high-profile battle of principles , pitching government secrecy against journalistic inquiry . while some officials have defended the cicero raid in the name of state secrets and national security , their arguments have largely fallen on deaf ears with the press , the public and almost every political party on the spectrum , including the social democrats - or " spd , " schily ’ s own party . dieter wiefelspütz , the interior affairs expert for the spd , said that while he understands the need to find leaks within the bka , journalists ' work must also be respected . " if the work of journalists - who deal with confidential information nearly every day - is generally criminalized , then we have a real problem with press freedom in germany , " wiefelspütz said . he added that the bka should perhaps focus on the culprits within its own ranks first , and not turn journalists into culprits . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a distinctly " political " magazine in february 2006 , the potsdam district court ruled that the police search of the cicero offices was lawful schirra 's article contained " secret information relevant to national security . " editor weimar then filed a complaint against the raids with the country 's highest court . echoes from the past for many germans , the cicero affair has raised the specter of the spiegel scandal that began in 1962 .
back then , the weekly newsmagazine der spiegel was accused of treason for an article criticizing the german armed forces . defense minister franz josef strauß had the spiegel offices searched and occupied by police , and spiegel ’ s editor-in-chief , publisher and the author of the article arrested . the scandal ended with strauß ’ s resignation and a victory for press freedom . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german high court reviews press freedom german constitutional judges on wednesday began hearing the complaint of the editor of a magazine , whose offices had been searched by investigators following publication of classified material .

berlin will likely have to lower the bar . although chancellor angela merkel had hoped to use an upcoming summit in berlin to be a springboard toward a new discussion on an eu constitution , differences among members mean that will likely not happen .
german aspirations are being rolled back as member states remain on different pages regarding an eu charter . " quality is more important than speed , " czech deputy prime minister alexandr vondra said , following talks with german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier in berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany had hoped to revive the constitution process however , danish foreign minister per stig moller said after a separate meeting with steinmeier that denmark would back an initiative to be put forward by germany before it passes the eu presidency to portugal in july . " if all 27 members vote for it , we will be on board , " moller said , warning that the eu faced a difficult period if no solution to the impasse was found . uniting or dividing ? vondra said a solution to the problem , which arose after the french and the dutch rejected the proposed new constitution , had to be found .
but the solution had to bind europe together and not divide it , he added , pledging a constructive approach from the czech republic . steinmeier expressed confidence a new initiative backed by all eu members would be put forward by the end of june . " we need this if europe is to remain effective in the future , " he said , pointing to the need for institutional reform for the enlarged eu to keep functioning . although germany had hoped to use its six-month eu presidency to get the treaty discussions back firmly on track , it appears that that goal will not be reached . declaration dissention in a sign of the extent of the differences among eu countries , representatives can not agree on the language to be used in a declaration being drafted for march summit celebrating the 50th anniversary of the treaty of rome , which established the european economic community , the forerunner of the eu . diplomats are split on language describing the bloc 's achievements , values and challenges in a document , which one envoy described to reuters are likely to be " bland at best . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french and dutch " no 's " stalled the constitution - restarting it is difficult merkel 's goal is to get eu leaders on board by june to work towards the ratification of a new version of the eu constitution by 2009 's european parliament elections . " she wanted a clause at the end of the berlin declaration saying ' this is why we need to sign up to a new constitution to set up the june summit , " ' one diplomat told reuters .
" this is not going to happen . " instead , the document will likely try to set the mood for reviving talks rather than make firm commitments , since merkel does not want to start in internal eu fight .
opinions within the bloc differ widely on issues such as turkey 's potential membership , further expansion and the extent of eu 's social welfare system . the needs of an unwieldy bloc proponents of the constitution say it is needed to ease decision-making in the 27-member bloc .
it would give bigger nations more power through a reform of the voting system and appoint a foreign minister and an eu president who would serve for longer than the current six months . eighteen of the 27 eu members have ratified the new constitution .
the french and dutch rejected it by significant majorities in referenda held in mid-2005 , causing a crisis in the eu which can still be felt . the british government pledged to hold a referendum , but postponed it indefinitely after the rejection by france and the netherlands .
poland , portugal , denmark , sweden , the czech republic and ireland have yet to ratify it . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany faces " impossible task " with eu charter one of the main goals of the german eu presidency is to resurrect the european union constitution .

" if all 27 members vote for it , we will be on board , " moller said , warning that the eu faced a difficult period if no solution to the impasse was found . uniting or dividing ? vondra said a solution to the problem , which arose after the french and the dutch rejected the proposed new constitution , had to be found .
but the solution had to bind europe together and not divide it , he added , pledging a constructive approach from the czech republic . steinmeier expressed confidence a new initiative backed by all eu members would be put forward by the end of june . " we need this if europe is to remain effective in the future , " he said , pointing to the need for institutional reform for the enlarged eu to keep functioning . although germany had hoped to use its six-month eu presidency to get the treaty discussions back firmly on track , it appears that that goal will not be reached . declaration dissention in a sign of the extent of the differences among eu countries , representatives can not agree on the language to be used in a declaration being drafted for march summit celebrating the 50th anniversary of the treaty of rome , which established the european economic community , the forerunner of the eu . diplomats are split on language describing the bloc 's achievements , values and challenges in a document , which one envoy described to reuters are likely to be " bland at best .

" she wanted a clause at the end of the berlin declaration saying ' this is why we need to sign up to a new constitution to set up the june summit , " ' one diplomat told reuters .
" this is not going to happen . " instead , the document will likely try to set the mood for reviving talks rather than make firm commitments , since merkel does not want to start in internal eu fight .
opinions within the bloc differ widely on issues such as turkey 's potential membership , further expansion and the extent of eu 's social welfare system . the needs of an unwieldy bloc proponents of the constitution say it is needed to ease decision-making in the 27-member bloc .
it would give bigger nations more power through a reform of the voting system and appoint a foreign minister and an eu president who would serve for longer than the current six months . eighteen of the 27 eu members have ratified the new constitution .
the french and dutch rejected it by significant majorities in referenda held in mid-2005 , causing a crisis in the eu which can still be felt . the british government pledged to hold a referendum , but postponed it indefinitely after the rejection by france and the netherlands .

but the " third man " françois bayrou could upset the first round of voting on april 22 . the latest polls in france show that conservative presidential candidate nicolas sarkozy and socialist rival ségolène royal are running neck-and-neck .
but outside contenders in the vote could upset a clear outcome . the traditional centrist , pro-european politician françois bayrou and far-right leader jean-marie le pen have also thrown their hats into the ring . voters in france head to the polls on april 22 for a presidential election .
a second round of voting is scheduled for may 6 if none of the candidates win an outright majority . according to the latest survey by lh2 pollsters , sarkozy is slightly ahead in the first round of voting with 30 percent of votes while royal would get 27 percent .
bayrou is credited with 17 percent of votes while le pen is holding 13 percent .
in a runoff , sarkozy and royal could both win 50 percent , the survey said . front-runners turn on " the third man " centrist bayrou - dubbed " the third man " in the french press - has seen a recent surge in his ratings .
during a prime-time television performance on monday night , bayrou promised he would transcend the left-right divide in france .
analysts said this could explain his growing popularity . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : centrist candidate françois bayrou is calling for " a social economy " " the two front-runners , how much support do they have - 25 percent ? "
bayrou said on tf1 television .
" that 's not enough to run the country .
that 's why we are in the state we are in , because there has not been enough backing for reform . " but both royal and sarkozy have criticized his platform . " i think it 's very dangerous , " royal told france inter radio .
" it 's trying to stop the french choosing between two models of society , two opposing political visions . " sarkozy said bayrou 's policies would lead to chaos like that of france 's fourth republic , when makeshift coalition governments rose and fell repeatedly . " democracy is a majority and an opposition and the french have to choose , " sarkozy told rmc radio . le pen focuses on anti-immigrant , anti-europe platform le pen could prove to be a greater threat to the main candidates than bayrou , though .
the far-right leader is doing better in the race than he was before the 2002 elections .
at that time , he stunned the nation by qualifying for the second round of voting against jacques chirac .
with nearly 17 percent of votes , he beat out socialist candidate lionel jospin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : right-wing leader jean-marie le pen is promoting a " zero immigration " platform the 78-year-old launched his election program in lille over the weekend .
in his fifth and probably last bid for the presidency , le pen vowed to halt immigration and integration with europe , which he said was leading france to disaster . le pen told a convention of his national front party that he would cut off social benefits to immigrants and " restore france 's borders . "
amid cheers and chants of " le pen , president ! " the far-right leader said france was crumbling under poverty , unemployment , the dislocation of factories and " massive immigration . " but french reality has changed over the past five years .
in 2002 , security and crime topped the list of voters concerns .
this had fit well into le pen 's nationalist anti-immigration platform .
now , sarkozy has moved into le pen 's traditional law-and-order territory .

berlin will likely have to lower the bar . although chancellor angela merkel had hoped to use an upcoming summit in berlin to be a springboard toward a new discussion on an eu constitution , differences among members mean that will likely not happen .

berlin will likely have to lower the bar . although chancellor angela merkel had hoped to use an upcoming summit in berlin to be a springboard toward a new discussion on an eu constitution , differences among members mean that will likely not happen .
german aspirations are being rolled back as member states remain on different pages regarding an eu charter . " quality is more important than speed , " czech deputy prime minister alexandr vondra said , following talks with german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier in berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany had hoped to revive the constitution process however , danish foreign minister per stig moller said after a separate meeting with steinmeier that denmark would back an initiative to be put forward by germany before it passes the eu presidency to portugal in july . " if all 27 members vote for it , we will be on board , " moller said , warning that the eu faced a difficult period if no solution to the impasse was found . uniting or dividing ? vondra said a solution to the problem , which arose after the french and the dutch rejected the proposed new constitution , had to be found .
but the solution had to bind europe together and not divide it , he added , pledging a constructive approach from the czech republic . steinmeier expressed confidence a new initiative backed by all eu members would be put forward by the end of june . " we need this if europe is to remain effective in the future , " he said , pointing to the need for institutional reform for the enlarged eu to keep functioning . although germany had hoped to use its six-month eu presidency to get the treaty discussions back firmly on track , it appears that that goal will not be reached . declaration dissention in a sign of the extent of the differences among eu countries , representatives can not agree on the language to be used in a declaration being drafted for march summit celebrating the 50th anniversary of the treaty of rome , which established the european economic community , the forerunner of the eu . diplomats are split on language describing the bloc 's achievements , values and challenges in a document , which one envoy described to reuters are likely to be " bland at best . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french and dutch " no 's " stalled the constitution - restarting it is difficult merkel 's goal is to get eu leaders on board by june to work towards the ratification of a new version of the eu constitution by 2009 's european parliament elections . " she wanted a clause at the end of the berlin declaration saying ' this is why we need to sign up to a new constitution to set up the june summit , " ' one diplomat told reuters .
" this is not going to happen . " instead , the document will likely try to set the mood for reviving talks rather than make firm commitments , since merkel does not want to start in internal eu fight .
opinions within the bloc differ widely on issues such as turkey 's potential membership , further expansion and the extent of eu 's social welfare system . the needs of an unwieldy bloc proponents of the constitution say it is needed to ease decision-making in the 27-member bloc .
it would give bigger nations more power through a reform of the voting system and appoint a foreign minister and an eu president who would serve for longer than the current six months . eighteen of the 27 eu members have ratified the new constitution .
the french and dutch rejected it by significant majorities in referenda held in mid-2005 , causing a crisis in the eu which can still be felt . the british government pledged to hold a referendum , but postponed it indefinitely after the rejection by france and the netherlands .
poland , portugal , denmark , sweden , the czech republic and ireland have yet to ratify it . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany faces " impossible task " with eu charter one of the main goals of the german eu presidency is to resurrect the european union constitution .

berlin will likely have to lower the bar . although chancellor angela merkel had hoped to use an upcoming summit in berlin to be a springboard toward a new discussion on an eu constitution , differences among members mean that will likely not happen .
german aspirations are being rolled back as member states remain on different pages regarding an eu charter . " quality is more important than speed , " czech deputy prime minister alexandr vondra said , following talks with german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier in berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany had hoped to revive the constitution process however , danish foreign minister per stig moller said after a separate meeting with steinmeier that denmark would back an initiative to be put forward by germany before it passes the eu presidency to portugal in july . " if all 27 members vote for it , we will be on board , " moller said , warning that the eu faced a difficult period if no solution to the impasse was found . uniting or dividing ? vondra said a solution to the problem , which arose after the french and the dutch rejected the proposed new constitution , had to be found .
but the solution had to bind europe together and not divide it , he added , pledging a constructive approach from the czech republic . steinmeier expressed confidence a new initiative backed by all eu members would be put forward by the end of june . " we need this if europe is to remain effective in the future , " he said , pointing to the need for institutional reform for the enlarged eu to keep functioning . although germany had hoped to use its six-month eu presidency to get the treaty discussions back firmly on track , it appears that that goal will not be reached . declaration dissention in a sign of the extent of the differences among eu countries , representatives can not agree on the language to be used in a declaration being drafted for march summit celebrating the 50th anniversary of the treaty of rome , which established the european economic community , the forerunner of the eu . diplomats are split on language describing the bloc 's achievements , values and challenges in a document , which one envoy described to reuters are likely to be " bland at best . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french and dutch " no 's " stalled the constitution - restarting it is difficult merkel 's goal is to get eu leaders on board by june to work towards the ratification of a new version of the eu constitution by 2009 's european parliament elections . " she wanted a clause at the end of the berlin declaration saying ' this is why we need to sign up to a new constitution to set up the june summit , " ' one diplomat told reuters .
" this is not going to happen . " instead , the document will likely try to set the mood for reviving talks rather than make firm commitments , since merkel does not want to start in internal eu fight .
opinions within the bloc differ widely on issues such as turkey 's potential membership , further expansion and the extent of eu 's social welfare system . the needs of an unwieldy bloc proponents of the constitution say it is needed to ease decision-making in the 27-member bloc .
it would give bigger nations more power through a reform of the voting system and appoint a foreign minister and an eu president who would serve for longer than the current six months . eighteen of the 27 eu members have ratified the new constitution .
the french and dutch rejected it by significant majorities in referenda held in mid-2005 , causing a crisis in the eu which can still be felt . the british government pledged to hold a referendum , but postponed it indefinitely after the rejection by france and the netherlands .
poland , portugal , denmark , sweden , the czech republic and ireland have yet to ratify it . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany faces " impossible task " with eu charter one of the main goals of the german eu presidency is to resurrect the european union constitution .

the case has raised questions about press freedom in germany . germany 's constitutional court in karlsruhe ruled tuesday that police violated the constitution by raiding the offices of the political online magazine cicero , based near berlin . judges said that the 2005 raid was a considerable violation of press freedom . in a 7-1 decision , the karlsruhe judges said the september 2005 search breached the constitition because the journalists themselves were not formally suspected of breaking the law . " searches and seizures against media people as part of a formal inquiry are unconstitutional if they are purely or mainly intended to detect the identity of an informant , " said presiding judge hans-jürgen papier . the court thus ruled in favor of cicero editor-in chief wolfram weimer , who had lodged a constitutional complaint against the search . a state court had ruled that the search , originally conducted under a warrant from a potsdam magistrate , was legal .
police seized disks and made a copy of a journalist 's hard-drive during the raid . national debate on press freedom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former interior minister schily the " cicero affair " gained momentum on sept .
12 , 2005 , when agents from germany ’ s federal criminal police office raided the magazine 's offices . they spent the whole day sifting through files and computer data .
at the end of the day , the german government came away with box-loads of material - and a massive public relations headache . yet the issue had started back in april 2005 .
the magazine ’ s authors published an article about a top al-qaeda leader , abu musab al-zarkawi , who has since been killed during a us air strike in iraq . as author bruno schirra reported his story , he cited information from a classified document which he obtained from a source within the federal criminal police office , or " bka . " former interior minister otto schily believed that was a major breach of security . " the government simply can not accept that documents from its innermost circles are passed on to the public by officers , because that creates dangers for such operations , " schily said . the journalists saw things differently .
cicero editor-in-chief wolfram weimar stood by his reporters ' conduct , and said their objectives are clear . " journalists are neither microphone-holders nor the king ’ s scribes : they are there to bring unpleasant truths to light , whether the powerful like it or not , and otto schily is no exception , " said weimar . in addition , more than 200 bka agents may have had access to the information , which shows that the data was n't highly-secretive , journalists pointed out . rumors also abound that the bka deliberately manipulates data in order to track down leaks . long-winded legal battle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cicero editor-in-chief weimer wants to reveal the truth the ensuing cicero legal battle , at any rate , has lasted almost two years . yet it has been more than an aggressive campaign to uncover a leak inside the bka .
the affair quickly became a high-profile battle of principles , pitching government secrecy against journalistic inquiry . while some officials have defended the cicero raid in the name of state secrets and national security , their arguments have largely fallen on deaf ears with the press , the public and almost every political party on the spectrum , including the social democrats - or " spd , " schily ’ s own party . dieter wiefelspütz , the interior affairs expert for the spd , said that while he understands the need to find leaks within the bka , journalists ' work must also be respected . " if the work of journalists - who deal with confidential information nearly every day - is generally criminalized , then we have a real problem with press freedom in germany , " wiefelspütz said . he added that the bka should perhaps focus on the culprits within its own ranks first , and not turn journalists into culprits . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a distinctly " political " magazine in february 2006 , the potsdam district court ruled that the police search of the cicero offices was lawful schirra 's article contained " secret information relevant to national security . " editor weimar then filed a complaint against the raids with the country 's highest court . echoes from the past for many germans , the cicero affair has raised the specter of the spiegel scandal that began in 1962 .
back then , the weekly newsmagazine der spiegel was accused of treason for an article criticizing the german armed forces . defense minister franz josef strauß had the spiegel offices searched and occupied by police , and spiegel ’ s editor-in-chief , publisher and the author of the article arrested . the scandal ended with strauß ’ s resignation and a victory for press freedom . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german high court reviews press freedom german constitutional judges on wednesday began hearing the complaint of the editor of a magazine , whose offices had been searched by investigators following publication of classified material .

the magazine ’ s authors published an article about a top al-qaeda leader , abu musab al-zarkawi , who has since been killed during a us air strike in iraq . as author bruno schirra reported his story , he cited information from a classified document which he obtained from a source within the federal criminal police office , or " bka . " former interior minister otto schily believed that was a major breach of security . " the government simply can not accept that documents from its innermost circles are passed on to the public by officers , because that creates dangers for such operations , " schily said . the journalists saw things differently .
cicero editor-in-chief wolfram weimar stood by his reporters ' conduct , and said their objectives are clear . " journalists are neither microphone-holders nor the king ’ s scribes : they are there to bring unpleasant truths to light , whether the powerful like it or not , and otto schily is no exception , " said weimar . in addition , more than 200 bka agents may have had access to the information , which shows that the data was n't highly-secretive , journalists pointed out . rumors also abound that the bka deliberately manipulates data in order to track down leaks . long-winded legal battle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cicero editor-in-chief weimer wants to reveal the truth the ensuing cicero legal battle , at any rate , has lasted almost two years . yet it has been more than an aggressive campaign to uncover a leak inside the bka .
the affair quickly became a high-profile battle of principles , pitching government secrecy against journalistic inquiry . while some officials have defended the cicero raid in the name of state secrets and national security , their arguments have largely fallen on deaf ears with the press , the public and almost every political party on the spectrum , including the social democrats - or " spd , " schily ’ s own party . dieter wiefelspütz , the interior affairs expert for the spd , said that while he understands the need to find leaks within the bka , journalists ' work must also be respected . " if the work of journalists - who deal with confidential information nearly every day - is generally criminalized , then we have a real problem with press freedom in germany , " wiefelspütz said . he added that the bka should perhaps focus on the culprits within its own ranks first , and not turn journalists into culprits . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a distinctly " political " magazine in february 2006 , the potsdam district court ruled that the police search of the cicero offices was lawful schirra 's article contained " secret information relevant to national security . " editor weimar then filed a complaint against the raids with the country 's highest court . echoes from the past for many germans , the cicero affair has raised the specter of the spiegel scandal that began in 1962 .
back then , the weekly newsmagazine der spiegel was accused of treason for an article criticizing the german armed forces . defense minister franz josef strauß had the spiegel offices searched and occupied by police , and spiegel ’ s editor-in-chief , publisher and the author of the article arrested . the scandal ended with strauß ’ s resignation and a victory for press freedom . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german high court reviews press freedom german constitutional judges on wednesday began hearing the complaint of the editor of a magazine , whose offices had been searched by investigators following publication of classified material .

europeans are happier than ever before two eu reports released this week show most europeans are happy with their lives , despite social challenges facing the 27-nation bloc .
danes tops the happiness scale while bulgarians say they have little reason to smile . a eurobarometer poll published by the european commission this week said that 86 percent of europeans were relatively satisfied with their personal life and everyday environment .
the study said today 's europeans were happier , wealthier and living longer than their predecessors . " life satisfaction and happiness is higher in europe than in any other part of the world , " one of the study 's authors , frederic lerais , told reporters in brussels .
" life expectancy has increased and could increase a lot further , as could the possibilities of leading healthier , as well as longer lives . " however , a study of europe 's social reality published by the commission 's in-house think tank said although life satisfaction and happiness were higher in europe than in other parts of the world , eu societies were struggling to cope with immigration , ageing and a rapid shift to a " knowledge economy . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe 's future generations face many challenges " european societies face major social challenges , " the report said .
" the knowledge economy can seem threatening to those with low skills and low educational aspirations . " the report said unemployment and inactivity still blighted too many people 's lives , as did unresolved problems of widespread poverty .
it also pointed to new pressures facing europeans , including problems such as dysfunctional families and anti-social behavior , mental illness , as well as new diseases of affluence .
the integration of minorities was also a challenge , the report said . the two studies are part of a public consultation by the commission to assess europe 's current social realities and trends , dubbed a " social stocktaking exercise . " happiness is contagious the eurobarometer study said the most content in the bloc were the danes , 97 percent of whom declared themselves " happy . "
the dutch , belgians , irish and swedes , followed by respondents from luxembourg and finland , were not far behind in the happy stakes . the british , at 92 percent , were found to be happier than the french -lrb- 90 percent -rrb- and the germans -lrb- 82 percent -rrb- . the happiness indicator achieved a momentum of its own , lerais said . " if you realize that nine and a half out of every 10 citizens around you are happy , then it makes you happy yourself , " lerais said alongside his co-author , roger liddle . new eu members romania -lrb- 60 percent -rrb- and bulgaria -lrb- 39 percent -rrb- are shown as the most unhappy europeans , although the study was taken in november and december before they joined the bloc on jan .
1 , 2007 . europeans feel over-worked when it came to work , though , the figures changed .
the eurobarometer study showed that the most advanced eu member states were rapidly becoming post-industrial , with manufacturing accounting for less than a fifth of all jobs in the eu as a whole . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bulgaria joined the eu with a flourish in january these changes were leading to " new occupational divisions " according to the report , with at least half of existing jobs demanding a high level of skills while a third of the workforce had " very few skills . "
women were heavily represented in the low-skilled service sector , and gender pay-gap and career progression issues continued . in the study , 41 percent of people agreed that their work was " too demanding and stressful . "
just more than one in three disagreed . european commission president jose manuel barroso said the social stocktaking was necessary as a frame of reference for social policies . " the modern purpose of the european union is to enable europe 's citizens to enhance their prosperity , solidarity and security in a global age , " barroso said .
" we can not do this adequately without a common frame of reference for what is happening to our societies and a common understanding of the likely impact of the big social challenges we face .

europeans are happier than ever before two eu reports released this week show most europeans are happy with their lives , despite social challenges facing the 27-nation bloc .
danes tops the happiness scale while bulgarians say they have little reason to smile . a eurobarometer poll published by the european commission this week said that 86 percent of europeans were relatively satisfied with their personal life and everyday environment .
the study said today 's europeans were happier , wealthier and living longer than their predecessors . " life satisfaction and happiness is higher in europe than in any other part of the world , " one of the study 's authors , frederic lerais , told reporters in brussels .
" life expectancy has increased and could increase a lot further , as could the possibilities of leading healthier , as well as longer lives . " however , a study of europe 's social reality published by the commission 's in-house think tank said although life satisfaction and happiness were higher in europe than in other parts of the world , eu societies were struggling to cope with immigration , ageing and a rapid shift to a " knowledge economy . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe 's future generations face many challenges " european societies face major social challenges , " the report said .
" the knowledge economy can seem threatening to those with low skills and low educational aspirations . " the report said unemployment and inactivity still blighted too many people 's lives , as did unresolved problems of widespread poverty .
it also pointed to new pressures facing europeans , including problems such as dysfunctional families and anti-social behavior , mental illness , as well as new diseases of affluence .
the integration of minorities was also a challenge , the report said . the two studies are part of a public consultation by the commission to assess europe 's current social realities and trends , dubbed a " social stocktaking exercise . " happiness is contagious the eurobarometer study said the most content in the bloc were the danes , 97 percent of whom declared themselves " happy . "
the dutch , belgians , irish and swedes , followed by respondents from luxembourg and finland , were not far behind in the happy stakes . the british , at 92 percent , were found to be happier than the french -lrb- 90 percent -rrb- and the germans -lrb- 82 percent -rrb- . the happiness indicator achieved a momentum of its own , lerais said . " if you realize that nine and a half out of every 10 citizens around you are happy , then it makes you happy yourself , " lerais said alongside his co-author , roger liddle . new eu members romania -lrb- 60 percent -rrb- and bulgaria -lrb- 39 percent -rrb- are shown as the most unhappy europeans , although the study was taken in november and december before they joined the bloc on jan .
1 , 2007 . europeans feel over-worked when it came to work , though , the figures changed .
the eurobarometer study showed that the most advanced eu member states were rapidly becoming post-industrial , with manufacturing accounting for less than a fifth of all jobs in the eu as a whole . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bulgaria joined the eu with a flourish in january these changes were leading to " new occupational divisions " according to the report , with at least half of existing jobs demanding a high level of skills while a third of the workforce had " very few skills . "
women were heavily represented in the low-skilled service sector , and gender pay-gap and career progression issues continued . in the study , 41 percent of people agreed that their work was " too demanding and stressful . "
just more than one in three disagreed . european commission president jose manuel barroso said the social stocktaking was necessary as a frame of reference for social policies . " the modern purpose of the european union is to enable europe 's citizens to enhance their prosperity , solidarity and security in a global age , " barroso said .
" we can not do this adequately without a common frame of reference for what is happening to our societies and a common understanding of the likely impact of the big social challenges we face . " the commission said the results may be fed into forthcoming policy initiatives . dw staff / afp / dpa -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de happiness is … love and vacation valentine 's day is the day of love .

26 of the inflation outlook in the 13 nations sharing the euro , despite risks of upward pressure from germany , europe 's biggest economy . although a recent increase in value added tax in germany from 16 percent to 19 percent has had less of an impact on inflation than originally feared , wage discussions between unions and employers are stirring fresh concerns about price pressures , and especially at the european central bank . " i think that inflation is developing quite well , " said luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker , who chairs regular meetings of euro zone finance ministers . " inflation , as far as the short-term is concerned , does seem under control , " he added . vat hike fears unproven many economists ' concerns the increase in german value added tax in january from 16 percent to 19 percent would nudge inflation higher in the euro zone have so far proven to be unfounded . the european union 's eurostat data agency estimated inflation held steady in january at 1.9 percent and is due to provide a clearer picture on wednesday with final figures , and an estimate for february on thursday . meanwhile , private economists are forecasting that inflation was stable in february at 1.9 percent , which would mark the fourth month in a row that price growth has been right in line with the european central bank 's preferred level of less than , but close to , two percent . the frankfurt-based central bank is widely expected to lift its benchmark interest rate to 3.75 percent at its next monetary-policy meeting on march 8 in order to keep a lid on inflation . productivity must support wage pressure german finance minister peer steinbrueck , whose country currently holds the rotating eu presidency , took a optimistic view of inflation prospects as long as productivity kept up with wage growth . " i do n't see any inflation risks as long as wage policy in europe is based on productivity , " he told reporters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trichet warned of wage hikes causing instability germany 's powerful ig metall labour union said monday it would call for wage increases of 6.5 percent for the 3.4 million workers in the german engineering and metal-working industry in upcoming wage talks next month . earlier monday , european central bank president jean-claude trichet had sounded the alarm about big wage increases , calling for constraint in an interview with german magazine focus . wage restraint crucial to competitive growth " wage moderation is and will remain important not just in germany , but all over europe , " he said . juncker said that the germany was bouncing back in part because constraint on wage increases had made german industry competitive again on the global stage . he said that to remain competitive wage increases would have to remain in line with productivity growth , which would cancel out the impact of higher salaries on inflation . " if wages continue to develop in line with productivity , wage increases will not give rise to any inflationary problems , nor will there be any loss in productivity , " he said . dw staff / afp -lrb- emw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu lifts euro-zone growth forecast on german , italian strength the european commission raised its forecast for euro-zone growth this year to 2.4 percent from 2.1 percent previously as the german and italian economies bounce back more strongly than expected .

dw 's benjamin pargan comments that serbia now has less excuses to hand over war crimes criminals . once again it was a clear " yes-and-no " and " as-well-as " solution by the so-called international community .
the disappointment of the predominantly muslim war victims in bosnia and herzegovina is understandable .
many of them were displaced , tortured , raped by reservists and guerrilla fighters from serbia and montenegro . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benjamin pargan relatives of those muslim bosniaks murdered in the bosnian city of bijeljina , for example , will never understand this verdict .
their family members became victims of special forces and killer commandos from serbia right in the first days of the war - with the blessing of the government in belgrade at the time . the like occurred in several cities in bosnia and herzegovina .
this was repeatedly proven in individual trials at the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia in the hague .
the president of the international court of justice , rosalyn higgins , indirectly confirmed this with her remark that serbia militarily and financially supported bosnian serbs to a considerable degree . where does this significant support give way to direct responsibility for the genocide ?
either this question could not be conclusively clarified or - more likely - the judges at the highest un court did n't have enough courage and endurance to do so , regardless of possible political consequences . nonetheless , the judgment by the international court also has a positive side .
up to now , a large part of the serbian political establishment has repeatedly spoken of a sweeping prejudgment of the serbs .
mostly nationalist-minded powers used these pre-fabricated formulas far too often to dish up stories for their population about alleged forced and unjust collective guilt of the serbs .
when it came to questioning their own role in the war , many serbs accepted these argumentation aids with thanks .
a conviction of serbia would have given such populist pied pipers even more impetus .
it was , after all , the first time that a nation was formally accused of genocide . now , there is one excuse less for the up till now rejection of handing over serb generals accused of war crimes to the tribunal in the hague .
the verdict is a significant step in the direction of individualizing the blame - a demand also often made by serbia . the government in belgrade is more likely to interpret this judgment as a clean bill of health .
the international community and particularly the european union has to now make clear all the more that cooperating with the tribunal in the hague is still the requirement for approaching the transatlantic community .

the case has raised questions about press freedom in germany . germany 's constitutional court in karlsruhe ruled tuesday that police violated the constitution by raiding the offices of the political online magazine cicero , based near berlin . judges said that the 2005 raid was a considerable violation of press freedom . in a 7-1 decision , the karlsruhe judges said the september 2005 search breached the constitition because the journalists themselves were not formally suspected of breaking the law . " searches and seizures against media people as part of a formal inquiry are unconstitutional if they are purely or mainly intended to detect the identity of an informant , " said presiding judge hans-jürgen papier . the court thus ruled in favor of cicero editor-in chief wolfram weimer , who had lodged a constitutional complaint against the search . a state court had ruled that the search , originally conducted under a warrant from a potsdam magistrate , was legal .
police seized disks and made a copy of a journalist 's hard-drive during the raid . national debate on press freedom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former interior minister schily the " cicero affair " gained momentum on sept .
12 , 2005 , when agents from germany ’ s federal criminal police office raided the magazine 's offices . they spent the whole day sifting through files and computer data .
at the end of the day , the german government came away with box-loads of material - and a massive public relations headache . yet the issue had started back in april 2005 .
the magazine ’ s authors published an article about a top al-qaeda leader , abu musab al-zarkawi , who has since been killed during a us air strike in iraq . as author bruno schirra reported his story , he cited information from a classified document which he obtained from a source within the federal criminal police office , or " bka . " former interior minister otto schily believed that was a major breach of security . " the government simply can not accept that documents from its innermost circles are passed on to the public by officers , because that creates dangers for such operations , " schily said . the journalists saw things differently .
cicero editor-in-chief wolfram weimar stood by his reporters ' conduct , and said their objectives are clear . " journalists are neither microphone-holders nor the king ’ s scribes : they are there to bring unpleasant truths to light , whether the powerful like it or not , and otto schily is no exception , " said weimar . in addition , more than 200 bka agents may have had access to the information , which shows that the data was n't highly-secretive , journalists pointed out . rumors also abound that the bka deliberately manipulates data in order to track down leaks . long-winded legal battle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cicero editor-in-chief weimer wants to reveal the truth the ensuing cicero legal battle , at any rate , has lasted almost two years . yet it has been more than an aggressive campaign to uncover a leak inside the bka .
the affair quickly became a high-profile battle of principles , pitching government secrecy against journalistic inquiry . while some officials have defended the cicero raid in the name of state secrets and national security , their arguments have largely fallen on deaf ears with the press , the public and almost every political party on the spectrum , including the social democrats - or " spd , " schily ’ s own party . dieter wiefelspütz , the interior affairs expert for the spd , said that while he understands the need to find leaks within the bka , journalists ' work must also be respected . " if the work of journalists - who deal with confidential information nearly every day - is generally criminalized , then we have a real problem with press freedom in germany , " wiefelspütz said . he added that the bka should perhaps focus on the culprits within its own ranks first , and not turn journalists into culprits . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a distinctly " political " magazine in february 2006 , the potsdam district court ruled that the police search of the cicero offices was lawful schirra 's article contained " secret information relevant to national security . " editor weimar then filed a complaint against the raids with the country 's highest court . echoes from the past for many germans , the cicero affair has raised the specter of the spiegel scandal that began in 1962 .
back then , the weekly newsmagazine der spiegel was accused of treason for an article criticizing the german armed forces . defense minister franz josef strauß had the spiegel offices searched and occupied by police , and spiegel ’ s editor-in-chief , publisher and the author of the article arrested . the scandal ended with strauß ’ s resignation and a victory for press freedom . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german high court reviews press freedom german constitutional judges on wednesday began hearing the complaint of the editor of a magazine , whose offices had been searched by investigators following publication of classified material .

the case has raised questions about press freedom in germany . germany 's constitutional court in karlsruhe ruled tuesday that police violated the constitution by raiding the offices of the political online magazine cicero , based near berlin . judges said that the 2005 raid was a considerable violation of press freedom . in a 7-1 decision , the karlsruhe judges said the september 2005 search breached the constitition because the journalists themselves were not formally suspected of breaking the law . " searches and seizures against media people as part of a formal inquiry are unconstitutional if they are purely or mainly intended to detect the identity of an informant , " said presiding judge hans-jürgen papier . the court thus ruled in favor of cicero editor-in chief wolfram weimer , who had lodged a constitutional complaint against the search . a state court had ruled that the search , originally conducted under a warrant from a potsdam magistrate , was legal .
police seized disks and made a copy of a journalist 's hard-drive during the raid . national debate on press freedom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former interior minister schily the " cicero affair " gained momentum on sept .
12 , 2005 , when agents from germany ’ s federal criminal police office raided the magazine 's offices . they spent the whole day sifting through files and computer data .
at the end of the day , the german government came away with box-loads of material - and a massive public relations headache . yet the issue had started back in april 2005 .
the magazine ’ s authors published an article about a top al-qaeda leader , abu musab al-zarkawi , who has since been killed during a us air strike in iraq . as author bruno schirra reported his story , he cited information from a classified document which he obtained from a source within the federal criminal police office , or " bka . " former interior minister otto schily believed that was a major breach of security . " the government simply can not accept that documents from its innermost circles are passed on to the public by officers , because that creates dangers for such operations , " schily said . the journalists saw things differently .
cicero editor-in-chief wolfram weimar stood by his reporters ' conduct , and said their objectives are clear . " journalists are neither microphone-holders nor the king ’ s scribes : they are there to bring unpleasant truths to light , whether the powerful like it or not , and otto schily is no exception , " said weimar . in addition , more than 200 bka agents may have had access to the information , which shows that the data was n't highly-secretive , journalists pointed out . rumors also abound that the bka deliberately manipulates data in order to track down leaks . long-winded legal battle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cicero editor-in-chief weimer wants to reveal the truth the ensuing cicero legal battle , at any rate , has lasted almost two years . yet it has been more than an aggressive campaign to uncover a leak inside the bka .
the affair quickly became a high-profile battle of principles , pitching government secrecy against journalistic inquiry . while some officials have defended the cicero raid in the name of state secrets and national security , their arguments have largely fallen on deaf ears with the press , the public and almost every political party on the spectrum , including the social democrats - or " spd , " schily ’ s own party . dieter wiefelspütz , the interior affairs expert for the spd , said that while he understands the need to find leaks within the bka , journalists ' work must also be respected . " if the work of journalists - who deal with confidential information nearly every day - is generally criminalized , then we have a real problem with press freedom in germany , " wiefelspütz said . he added that the bka should perhaps focus on the culprits within its own ranks first , and not turn journalists into culprits . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a distinctly " political " magazine in february 2006 , the potsdam district court ruled that the police search of the cicero offices was lawful schirra 's article contained " secret information relevant to national security . " editor weimar then filed a complaint against the raids with the country 's highest court . echoes from the past for many germans , the cicero affair has raised the specter of the spiegel scandal that began in 1962 .
back then , the weekly newsmagazine der spiegel was accused of treason for an article criticizing the german armed forces . defense minister franz josef strauß had the spiegel offices searched and occupied by police , and spiegel ’ s editor-in-chief , publisher and the author of the article arrested . the scandal ended with strauß ’ s resignation and a victory for press freedom . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german high court reviews press freedom german constitutional judges on wednesday began hearing the complaint of the editor of a magazine , whose offices had been searched by investigators following publication of classified material .

the case has raised questions about press freedom in germany . germany 's constitutional court in karlsruhe ruled tuesday that police violated the constitution by raiding the offices of the political online magazine cicero , based near berlin . judges said that the 2005 raid was a considerable violation of press freedom . in a 7-1 decision , the karlsruhe judges said the september 2005 search breached the constitition because the journalists themselves were not formally suspected of breaking the law . " searches and seizures against media people as part of a formal inquiry are unconstitutional if they are purely or mainly intended to detect the identity of an informant , " said presiding judge hans-jürgen papier . the court thus ruled in favor of cicero editor-in chief wolfram weimer , who had lodged a constitutional complaint against the search . a state court had ruled that the search , originally conducted under a warrant from a potsdam magistrate , was legal .
police seized disks and made a copy of a journalist 's hard-drive during the raid . national debate on press freedom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former interior minister schily the " cicero affair " gained momentum on sept .
12 , 2005 , when agents from germany ’ s federal criminal police office raided the magazine 's offices . they spent the whole day sifting through files and computer data .
at the end of the day , the german government came away with box-loads of material - and a massive public relations headache . yet the issue had started back in april 2005 .
the magazine ’ s authors published an article about a top al-qaeda leader , abu musab al-zarkawi , who has since been killed during a us air strike in iraq . as author bruno schirra reported his story , he cited information from a classified document which he obtained from a source within the federal criminal police office , or " bka . " former interior minister otto schily believed that was a major breach of security . " the government simply can not accept that documents from its innermost circles are passed on to the public by officers , because that creates dangers for such operations , " schily said . the journalists saw things differently .
cicero editor-in-chief wolfram weimar stood by his reporters ' conduct , and said their objectives are clear . " journalists are neither microphone-holders nor the king ’ s scribes : they are there to bring unpleasant truths to light , whether the powerful like it or not , and otto schily is no exception , " said weimar . in addition , more than 200 bka agents may have had access to the information , which shows that the data was n't highly-secretive , journalists pointed out . rumors also abound that the bka deliberately manipulates data in order to track down leaks . long-winded legal battle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cicero editor-in-chief weimer wants to reveal the truth the ensuing cicero legal battle , at any rate , has lasted almost two years . yet it has been more than an aggressive campaign to uncover a leak inside the bka .
the affair quickly became a high-profile battle of principles , pitching government secrecy against journalistic inquiry . while some officials have defended the cicero raid in the name of state secrets and national security , their arguments have largely fallen on deaf ears with the press , the public and almost every political party on the spectrum , including the social democrats - or " spd , " schily ’ s own party . dieter wiefelspütz , the interior affairs expert for the spd , said that while he understands the need to find leaks within the bka , journalists ' work must also be respected . " if the work of journalists - who deal with confidential information nearly every day - is generally criminalized , then we have a real problem with press freedom in germany , " wiefelspütz said . he added that the bka should perhaps focus on the culprits within its own ranks first , and not turn journalists into culprits . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a distinctly " political " magazine in february 2006 , the potsdam district court ruled that the police search of the cicero offices was lawful schirra 's article contained " secret information relevant to national security . " editor weimar then filed a complaint against the raids with the country 's highest court . echoes from the past for many germans , the cicero affair has raised the specter of the spiegel scandal that began in 1962 .
back then , the weekly newsmagazine der spiegel was accused of treason for an article criticizing the german armed forces . defense minister franz josef strauß had the spiegel offices searched and occupied by police , and spiegel ’ s editor-in-chief , publisher and the author of the article arrested . the scandal ended with strauß ’ s resignation and a victory for press freedom . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german high court reviews press freedom german constitutional judges on wednesday began hearing the complaint of the editor of a magazine , whose offices had been searched by investigators following publication of classified material .

dw 's benjamin pargan comments that serbia now has less excuses to hand over war crimes criminals . once again it was a clear " yes-and-no " and " as-well-as " solution by the so-called international community .
the disappointment of the predominantly muslim war victims in bosnia and herzegovina is understandable .
many of them were displaced , tortured , raped by reservists and guerrilla fighters from serbia and montenegro . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benjamin pargan relatives of those muslim bosniaks murdered in the bosnian city of bijeljina , for example , will never understand this verdict .
their family members became victims of special forces and killer commandos from serbia right in the first days of the war - with the blessing of the government in belgrade at the time . the like occurred in several cities in bosnia and herzegovina .
this was repeatedly proven in individual trials at the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia in the hague .
the president of the international court of justice , rosalyn higgins , indirectly confirmed this with her remark that serbia militarily and financially supported bosnian serbs to a considerable degree . where does this significant support give way to direct responsibility for the genocide ?
either this question could not be conclusively clarified or - more likely - the judges at the highest un court did n't have enough courage and endurance to do so , regardless of possible political consequences . nonetheless , the judgment by the international court also has a positive side .
up to now , a large part of the serbian political establishment has repeatedly spoken of a sweeping prejudgment of the serbs .
mostly nationalist-minded powers used these pre-fabricated formulas far too often to dish up stories for their population about alleged forced and unjust collective guilt of the serbs .
when it came to questioning their own role in the war , many serbs accepted these argumentation aids with thanks .
a conviction of serbia would have given such populist pied pipers even more impetus .
it was , after all , the first time that a nation was formally accused of genocide . now , there is one excuse less for the up till now rejection of handing over serb generals accused of war crimes to the tribunal in the hague .
the verdict is a significant step in the direction of individualizing the blame - a demand also often made by serbia . the government in belgrade is more likely to interpret this judgment as a clean bill of health .
the international community and particularly the european union has to now make clear all the more that cooperating with the tribunal in the hague is still the requirement for approaching the transatlantic community .

the water damage cost the company 15 million euros -lrb- $ 20 million -rrb- . just after the holiday season , the company had to admit it would not be able to match its 2005 sales of 285 million euros . mae b. falls flat the company will close the last of its mae b. shops as their leases run out .
the beate uhse offshoot , geared towards the female market and featuring brightly lit stores with sexy lingerie and erotica instead of hardcore pornography , was opened in 2004 .
the idea was to pull the company out of its porn niche and reach a broader spectrum of customers . despite the tasteful decor , massage oils , erotic games and silver and gold vibrators , the concept , which beate uhse spokeswoman assia tschernookoff now calls an " experiment , " did n't fly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beate uhse stores are found in city centers , not relegated to the outskirts or industrial areas now the company is trying a new approach , and recently opened a flagship store in munich that will carry many of the items featured at mae b. in addition to the inventory found in the more traditional beate uhse stores . the company has experienced several buckets of cold water over the past few years , generally around its ambitious expansion plans .
a takeover of the condom manufacturer condomi failed , as did the purchase of the " penthouse " publishing house . an attempt to get into the world 's biggest pornography market , the united states , was not successful and beate uhse was forced to withdraw after suffering heavy losses . fantasy unfulfilled the company 's stock market flotation in 1999 was accompanied with much fanfare and its stock price reached a high of 29 euros .
but since then it has a long ride downhill until the price bottomed out at 3.95 euros last november . stock analysts are recommending selling beate uhse stock , worried by news that the company 's biggest stockholder and son of founder beate uhse , ulrich rotermund , is trying to find a buyer for his 29.5 percent stake . analysts have also been concerned about the unclear relationship between dutch pornography entrepreneur gerard cok and his consipio holding , which holds a 20.8 percent stake , and the flensburg , germany-based company . according to analyst matthias schrade of gsc research , the company is still overvalued .
the firm is now valued at 250 million euros , but he told manager-magazin.de that a more realistic figure is around 150 million euros .
but , he added , he currently would n't want to pay more than 100 million euros for the firm . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de beate uhse loses its world cup buzz bad news for german soccer fans : olli k. and michael b. will not be bringing pleasure to supporters during the world cup .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the european union turns 50 the day the eu was born eu ponders more questions than answers amid celebrations founding fathers : europeans behind the union eu leaders adopt 50th anniversary berlin declaration european union -pipe- 27.02.2007 most europeans feel happy , surveys show großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smile !
europeans are happier than ever before two eu reports released this week show most europeans are happy with their lives , despite social challenges facing the 27-nation bloc .
danes tops the happiness scale while bulgarians say they have little reason to smile . a eurobarometer poll published by the european commission this week said that 86 percent of europeans were relatively satisfied with their personal life and everyday environment .
the study said today 's europeans were happier , wealthier and living longer than their predecessors . " life satisfaction and happiness is higher in europe than in any other part of the world , " one of the study 's authors , frederic lerais , told reporters in brussels .
" life expectancy has increased and could increase a lot further , as could the possibilities of leading healthier , as well as longer lives . " however , a study of europe 's social reality published by the commission 's in-house think tank said although life satisfaction and happiness were higher in europe than in other parts of the world , eu societies were struggling to cope with immigration , ageing and a rapid shift to a " knowledge economy . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe 's future generations face many challenges " european societies face major social challenges , " the report said .
" the knowledge economy can seem threatening to those with low skills and low educational aspirations . " the report said unemployment and inactivity still blighted too many people 's lives , as did unresolved problems of widespread poverty .
it also pointed to new pressures facing europeans , including problems such as dysfunctional families and anti-social behavior , mental illness , as well as new diseases of affluence .
the integration of minorities was also a challenge , the report said . the two studies are part of a public consultation by the commission to assess europe 's current social realities and trends , dubbed a " social stocktaking exercise . " happiness is contagious the eurobarometer study said the most content in the bloc were the danes , 97 percent of whom declared themselves " happy . "
the dutch , belgians , irish and swedes , followed by respondents from luxembourg and finland , were not far behind in the happy stakes . the british , at 92 percent , were found to be happier than the french -lrb- 90 percent -rrb- and the germans -lrb- 82 percent -rrb- . the happiness indicator achieved a momentum of its own , lerais said . " if you realize that nine and a half out of every 10 citizens around you are happy , then it makes you happy yourself , " lerais said alongside his co-author , roger liddle . new eu members romania -lrb- 60 percent -rrb- and bulgaria -lrb- 39 percent -rrb- are shown as the most unhappy europeans , although the study was taken in november and december before they joined the bloc on jan .
1 , 2007 . europeans feel over-worked when it came to work , though , the figures changed .
the eurobarometer study showed that the most advanced eu member states were rapidly becoming post-industrial , with manufacturing accounting for less than a fifth of all jobs in the eu as a whole . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bulgaria joined the eu with a flourish in january these changes were leading to " new occupational divisions " according to the report , with at least half of existing jobs demanding a high level of skills while a third of the workforce had " very few skills . "
women were heavily represented in the low-skilled service sector , and gender pay-gap and career progression issues continued . in the study , 41 percent of people agreed that their work was " too demanding and stressful . "
just more than one in three disagreed . european commission president jose manuel barroso said the social stocktaking was necessary as a frame of reference for social policies .

europeans are happier than ever before two eu reports released this week show most europeans are happy with their lives , despite social challenges facing the 27-nation bloc .
danes tops the happiness scale while bulgarians say they have little reason to smile . a eurobarometer poll published by the european commission this week said that 86 percent of europeans were relatively satisfied with their personal life and everyday environment .
the study said today 's europeans were happier , wealthier and living longer than their predecessors . " life satisfaction and happiness is higher in europe than in any other part of the world , " one of the study 's authors , frederic lerais , told reporters in brussels .
" life expectancy has increased and could increase a lot further , as could the possibilities of leading healthier , as well as longer lives . " however , a study of europe 's social reality published by the commission 's in-house think tank said although life satisfaction and happiness were higher in europe than in other parts of the world , eu societies were struggling to cope with immigration , ageing and a rapid shift to a " knowledge economy . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe 's future generations face many challenges " european societies face major social challenges , " the report said .
" the knowledge economy can seem threatening to those with low skills and low educational aspirations . " the report said unemployment and inactivity still blighted too many people 's lives , as did unresolved problems of widespread poverty .
it also pointed to new pressures facing europeans , including problems such as dysfunctional families and anti-social behavior , mental illness , as well as new diseases of affluence .
the integration of minorities was also a challenge , the report said . the two studies are part of a public consultation by the commission to assess europe 's current social realities and trends , dubbed a " social stocktaking exercise . " happiness is contagious the eurobarometer study said the most content in the bloc were the danes , 97 percent of whom declared themselves " happy . "
the dutch , belgians , irish and swedes , followed by respondents from luxembourg and finland , were not far behind in the happy stakes . the british , at 92 percent , were found to be happier than the french -lrb- 90 percent -rrb- and the germans -lrb- 82 percent -rrb- . the happiness indicator achieved a momentum of its own , lerais said . " if you realize that nine and a half out of every 10 citizens around you are happy , then it makes you happy yourself , " lerais said alongside his co-author , roger liddle . new eu members romania -lrb- 60 percent -rrb- and bulgaria -lrb- 39 percent -rrb- are shown as the most unhappy europeans , although the study was taken in november and december before they joined the bloc on jan .
1 , 2007 . europeans feel over-worked when it came to work , though , the figures changed .
the eurobarometer study showed that the most advanced eu member states were rapidly becoming post-industrial , with manufacturing accounting for less than a fifth of all jobs in the eu as a whole . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bulgaria joined the eu with a flourish in january these changes were leading to " new occupational divisions " according to the report , with at least half of existing jobs demanding a high level of skills while a third of the workforce had " very few skills . "
women were heavily represented in the low-skilled service sector , and gender pay-gap and career progression issues continued . in the study , 41 percent of people agreed that their work was " too demanding and stressful . "
just more than one in three disagreed . european commission president jose manuel barroso said the social stocktaking was necessary as a frame of reference for social policies . " the modern purpose of the european union is to enable europe 's citizens to enhance their prosperity , solidarity and security in a global age , " barroso said .

europeans are happier than ever before two eu reports released this week show most europeans are happy with their lives , despite social challenges facing the 27-nation bloc .
danes tops the happiness scale while bulgarians say they have little reason to smile . a eurobarometer poll published by the european commission this week said that 86 percent of europeans were relatively satisfied with their personal life and everyday environment .
the study said today 's europeans were happier , wealthier and living longer than their predecessors . " life satisfaction and happiness is higher in europe than in any other part of the world , " one of the study 's authors , frederic lerais , told reporters in brussels .
" life expectancy has increased and could increase a lot further , as could the possibilities of leading healthier , as well as longer lives . " however , a study of europe 's social reality published by the commission 's in-house think tank said although life satisfaction and happiness were higher in europe than in other parts of the world , eu societies were struggling to cope with immigration , ageing and a rapid shift to a " knowledge economy . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe 's future generations face many challenges " european societies face major social challenges , " the report said .
" the knowledge economy can seem threatening to those with low skills and low educational aspirations . " the report said unemployment and inactivity still blighted too many people 's lives , as did unresolved problems of widespread poverty .
it also pointed to new pressures facing europeans , including problems such as dysfunctional families and anti-social behavior , mental illness , as well as new diseases of affluence .
the integration of minorities was also a challenge , the report said . the two studies are part of a public consultation by the commission to assess europe 's current social realities and trends , dubbed a " social stocktaking exercise . " happiness is contagious the eurobarometer study said the most content in the bloc were the danes , 97 percent of whom declared themselves " happy . "
the dutch , belgians , irish and swedes , followed by respondents from luxembourg and finland , were not far behind in the happy stakes . the british , at 92 percent , were found to be happier than the french -lrb- 90 percent -rrb- and the germans -lrb- 82 percent -rrb- . the happiness indicator achieved a momentum of its own , lerais said . " if you realize that nine and a half out of every 10 citizens around you are happy , then it makes you happy yourself , " lerais said alongside his co-author , roger liddle . new eu members romania -lrb- 60 percent -rrb- and bulgaria -lrb- 39 percent -rrb- are shown as the most unhappy europeans , although the study was taken in november and december before they joined the bloc on jan .
1 , 2007 . europeans feel over-worked when it came to work , though , the figures changed .
the eurobarometer study showed that the most advanced eu member states were rapidly becoming post-industrial , with manufacturing accounting for less than a fifth of all jobs in the eu as a whole . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bulgaria joined the eu with a flourish in january these changes were leading to " new occupational divisions " according to the report , with at least half of existing jobs demanding a high level of skills while a third of the workforce had " very few skills . "
women were heavily represented in the low-skilled service sector , and gender pay-gap and career progression issues continued . in the study , 41 percent of people agreed that their work was " too demanding and stressful . "
just more than one in three disagreed . european commission president jose manuel barroso said the social stocktaking was necessary as a frame of reference for social policies . " the modern purpose of the european union is to enable europe 's citizens to enhance their prosperity , solidarity and security in a global age , " barroso said .
" we can not do this adequately without a common frame of reference for what is happening to our societies and a common understanding of the likely impact of the big social challenges we face . " the commission said the results may be fed into forthcoming policy initiatives . dw staff / afp / dpa -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de happiness is … love and vacation valentine 's day is the day of love .

but the " third man " françois bayrou could upset the first round of voting on april 22 . the latest polls in france show that conservative presidential candidate nicolas sarkozy and socialist rival ségolène royal are running neck-and-neck .
but outside contenders in the vote could upset a clear outcome . the traditional centrist , pro-european politician françois bayrou and far-right leader jean-marie le pen have also thrown their hats into the ring . voters in france head to the polls on april 22 for a presidential election .
a second round of voting is scheduled for may 6 if none of the candidates win an outright majority . according to the latest survey by lh2 pollsters , sarkozy is slightly ahead in the first round of voting with 30 percent of votes while royal would get 27 percent .
bayrou is credited with 17 percent of votes while le pen is holding 13 percent .
in a runoff , sarkozy and royal could both win 50 percent , the survey said . front-runners turn on " the third man " centrist bayrou - dubbed " the third man " in the french press - has seen a recent surge in his ratings .
during a prime-time television performance on monday night , bayrou promised he would transcend the left-right divide in france .
analysts said this could explain his growing popularity . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : centrist candidate françois bayrou is calling for " a social economy " " the two front-runners , how much support do they have - 25 percent ? "
bayrou said on tf1 television .
" that 's not enough to run the country .
that 's why we are in the state we are in , because there has not been enough backing for reform . " but both royal and sarkozy have criticized his platform . " i think it 's very dangerous , " royal told france inter radio .
" it 's trying to stop the french choosing between two models of society , two opposing political visions . " sarkozy said bayrou 's policies would lead to chaos like that of france 's fourth republic , when makeshift coalition governments rose and fell repeatedly . " democracy is a majority and an opposition and the french have to choose , " sarkozy told rmc radio . le pen focuses on anti-immigrant , anti-europe platform le pen could prove to be a greater threat to the main candidates than bayrou , though .
the far-right leader is doing better in the race than he was before the 2002 elections .
at that time , he stunned the nation by qualifying for the second round of voting against jacques chirac .
with nearly 17 percent of votes , he beat out socialist candidate lionel jospin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : right-wing leader jean-marie le pen is promoting a " zero immigration " platform the 78-year-old launched his election program in lille over the weekend .
in his fifth and probably last bid for the presidency , le pen vowed to halt immigration and integration with europe , which he said was leading france to disaster . le pen told a convention of his national front party that he would cut off social benefits to immigrants and " restore france 's borders . "
amid cheers and chants of " le pen , president ! " the far-right leader said france was crumbling under poverty , unemployment , the dislocation of factories and " massive immigration . " but french reality has changed over the past five years .
in 2002 , security and crime topped the list of voters concerns .
this had fit well into le pen 's nationalist anti-immigration platform .
now , sarkozy has moved into le pen 's traditional law-and-order territory .
voters ' worries have also shifted to jobs and purchasing power , neither of them strong points for le pen . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sparks expected to fly whoever becomes france 's president as the frontrunners in the french presidential race , nicolas sarkozy and segolene royal , make their way to berlin , dw-world.de asks what the election result will mean for germany and the european union in general .

but the " third man " françois bayrou could upset the first round of voting on april 22 . the latest polls in france show that conservative presidential candidate nicolas sarkozy and socialist rival ségolène royal are running neck-and-neck .
but outside contenders in the vote could upset a clear outcome . the traditional centrist , pro-european politician françois bayrou and far-right leader jean-marie le pen have also thrown their hats into the ring . voters in france head to the polls on april 22 for a presidential election .
a second round of voting is scheduled for may 6 if none of the candidates win an outright majority . according to the latest survey by lh2 pollsters , sarkozy is slightly ahead in the first round of voting with 30 percent of votes while royal would get 27 percent .
bayrou is credited with 17 percent of votes while le pen is holding 13 percent .
in a runoff , sarkozy and royal could both win 50 percent , the survey said . front-runners turn on " the third man " centrist bayrou - dubbed " the third man " in the french press - has seen a recent surge in his ratings .
during a prime-time television performance on monday night , bayrou promised he would transcend the left-right divide in france .
analysts said this could explain his growing popularity . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : centrist candidate françois bayrou is calling for " a social economy " " the two front-runners , how much support do they have - 25 percent ? "
bayrou said on tf1 television .
" that 's not enough to run the country .
that 's why we are in the state we are in , because there has not been enough backing for reform . " but both royal and sarkozy have criticized his platform . " i think it 's very dangerous , " royal told france inter radio .
" it 's trying to stop the french choosing between two models of society , two opposing political visions . " sarkozy said bayrou 's policies would lead to chaos like that of france 's fourth republic , when makeshift coalition governments rose and fell repeatedly . " democracy is a majority and an opposition and the french have to choose , " sarkozy told rmc radio . le pen focuses on anti-immigrant , anti-europe platform le pen could prove to be a greater threat to the main candidates than bayrou , though .
the far-right leader is doing better in the race than he was before the 2002 elections .
at that time , he stunned the nation by qualifying for the second round of voting against jacques chirac .
with nearly 17 percent of votes , he beat out socialist candidate lionel jospin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : right-wing leader jean-marie le pen is promoting a " zero immigration " platform the 78-year-old launched his election program in lille over the weekend .
in his fifth and probably last bid for the presidency , le pen vowed to halt immigration and integration with europe , which he said was leading france to disaster . le pen told a convention of his national front party that he would cut off social benefits to immigrants and " restore france 's borders . "
amid cheers and chants of " le pen , president ! " the far-right leader said france was crumbling under poverty , unemployment , the dislocation of factories and " massive immigration . " but french reality has changed over the past five years .
in 2002 , security and crime topped the list of voters concerns .
this had fit well into le pen 's nationalist anti-immigration platform .
now , sarkozy has moved into le pen 's traditional law-and-order territory .
voters ' worries have also shifted to jobs and purchasing power , neither of them strong points for le pen . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sparks expected to fly whoever becomes france 's president as the frontrunners in the french presidential race , nicolas sarkozy and segolene royal , make their way to berlin , dw-world.de asks what the election result will mean for germany and the european union in general .

the case has raised questions about press freedom in germany . germany 's constitutional court in karlsruhe ruled tuesday that police violated the constitution by raiding the offices of the political online magazine cicero , based near berlin . judges said that the 2005 raid was a considerable violation of press freedom . in a 7-1 decision , the karlsruhe judges said the september 2005 search breached the constitition because the journalists themselves were not formally suspected of breaking the law . " searches and seizures against media people as part of a formal inquiry are unconstitutional if they are purely or mainly intended to detect the identity of an informant , " said presiding judge hans-jürgen papier . the court thus ruled in favor of cicero editor-in chief wolfram weimer , who had lodged a constitutional complaint against the search . a state court had ruled that the search , originally conducted under a warrant from a potsdam magistrate , was legal .
police seized disks and made a copy of a journalist 's hard-drive during the raid . national debate on press freedom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former interior minister schily the " cicero affair " gained momentum on sept .
12 , 2005 , when agents from germany ’ s federal criminal police office raided the magazine 's offices . they spent the whole day sifting through files and computer data .
at the end of the day , the german government came away with box-loads of material - and a massive public relations headache . yet the issue had started back in april 2005 .
the magazine ’ s authors published an article about a top al-qaeda leader , abu musab al-zarkawi , who has since been killed during a us air strike in iraq . as author bruno schirra reported his story , he cited information from a classified document which he obtained from a source within the federal criminal police office , or " bka . " former interior minister otto schily believed that was a major breach of security . " the government simply can not accept that documents from its innermost circles are passed on to the public by officers , because that creates dangers for such operations , " schily said . the journalists saw things differently .
cicero editor-in-chief wolfram weimar stood by his reporters ' conduct , and said their objectives are clear . " journalists are neither microphone-holders nor the king ’ s scribes : they are there to bring unpleasant truths to light , whether the powerful like it or not , and otto schily is no exception , " said weimar . in addition , more than 200 bka agents may have had access to the information , which shows that the data was n't highly-secretive , journalists pointed out . rumors also abound that the bka deliberately manipulates data in order to track down leaks . long-winded legal battle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cicero editor-in-chief weimer wants to reveal the truth the ensuing cicero legal battle , at any rate , has lasted almost two years . yet it has been more than an aggressive campaign to uncover a leak inside the bka .
the affair quickly became a high-profile battle of principles , pitching government secrecy against journalistic inquiry . while some officials have defended the cicero raid in the name of state secrets and national security , their arguments have largely fallen on deaf ears with the press , the public and almost every political party on the spectrum , including the social democrats - or " spd , " schily ’ s own party . dieter wiefelspütz , the interior affairs expert for the spd , said that while he understands the need to find leaks within the bka , journalists ' work must also be respected . " if the work of journalists - who deal with confidential information nearly every day - is generally criminalized , then we have a real problem with press freedom in germany , " wiefelspütz said . he added that the bka should perhaps focus on the culprits within its own ranks first , and not turn journalists into culprits . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a distinctly " political " magazine in february 2006 , the potsdam district court ruled that the police search of the cicero offices was lawful schirra 's article contained " secret information relevant to national security . " editor weimar then filed a complaint against the raids with the country 's highest court . echoes from the past for many germans , the cicero affair has raised the specter of the spiegel scandal that began in 1962 .
back then , the weekly newsmagazine der spiegel was accused of treason for an article criticizing the german armed forces . defense minister franz josef strauß had the spiegel offices searched and occupied by police , and spiegel ’ s editor-in-chief , publisher and the author of the article arrested . the scandal ended with strauß ’ s resignation and a victory for press freedom . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german high court reviews press freedom german constitutional judges on wednesday began hearing the complaint of the editor of a magazine , whose offices had been searched by investigators following publication of classified material .

the richer , the faster großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's a correlation between income and speeding on the autobahn a new survey out shows motorists ' speeds on german freeways is largely in line with their bank balances .
those earning more tend to push the speedometer to the red line . if you 've got the cash , you 've got the speed .
that seems to be the lesson gleaned from a poll conducted by tns infratest which surveyed 1,002 german drivers .
more well-off drivers tended to race down germany 's famous autobahns while those who are economically challenged take their time . of those earning more than 2,500 euros -lrb- $ 3,310 -rrb- a month , 64 percent drove over the recommended speed of 130 km / h -lrb- 81 mph -rrb- and took little notice of fuel consumption and environmental pollution . for those who have direct experience on germany 's freeway system , the results will come as little surprise .
woe to the driver who stays in the passing lane as a late-model mercedes or bmw approaches .
if you do n't want to be run over , make a quick move to the right and watch in awe as a black blur whips past , apparently going after some new land-speed record . that leaves the rest of the pack - the cheaper fiats , skodas , renaults and ancient vw 's - in the dust .
only 37 percent of drivers with a net income under 1,500 euros a month drove over the recommended speed , the poll found . despite the high speeds of some , 87 percent of germans asked said they were in favor of a speed limit on german autobahns .
one in three called for a maximum speed of 140 km / h -lrb- 87 mph -rrb- .
the group least in favor of any speed restriction was in the over-50 group - only 82 percent of them thought a limit was a good idea . it might be wise to get out of grandpa 's way . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans propose autobahn speed limit to cut pollution some german politicians want to slow traffic on the country 's famously speedy autobahns and limit speeds to 120 kilometers per hour to help cut polluting co2 emissions .

" i think it is a major political mistake to believe that attitudes can be changed by pressure from outside , " he said .
" whoever puts migrants under pressure will experience counter-pressure .
the politics of the iron fist is not an intelligent form of politics .

the case has raised questions about press freedom in germany . germany 's constitutional court in karlsruhe ruled tuesday that police violated the constitution by raiding the offices of the political online magazine cicero , based near berlin . judges said that the 2005 raid was a considerable violation of press freedom . in a 7-1 decision , the karlsruhe judges said the september 2005 search breached the constitition because the journalists themselves were not formally suspected of breaking the law . " searches and seizures against media people as part of a formal inquiry are unconstitutional if they are purely or mainly intended to detect the identity of an informant , " said presiding judge hans-jürgen papier . the court thus ruled in favor of cicero editor-in chief wolfram weimer , who had lodged a constitutional complaint against the search . a state court had ruled that the search , originally conducted under a warrant from a potsdam magistrate , was legal .
police seized disks and made a copy of a journalist 's hard-drive during the raid . national debate on press freedom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former interior minister schily the " cicero affair " gained momentum on sept .
12 , 2005 , when agents from germany ’ s federal criminal police office raided the magazine 's offices . they spent the whole day sifting through files and computer data .
at the end of the day , the german government came away with box-loads of material - and a massive public relations headache . yet the issue had started back in april 2005 .
the magazine ’ s authors published an article about a top al-qaeda leader , abu musab al-zarkawi , who has since been killed during a us air strike in iraq . as author bruno schirra reported his story , he cited information from a classified document which he obtained from a source within the federal criminal police office , or " bka . " former interior minister otto schily believed that was a major breach of security . " the government simply can not accept that documents from its innermost circles are passed on to the public by officers , because that creates dangers for such operations , " schily said . the journalists saw things differently .
cicero editor-in-chief wolfram weimar stood by his reporters ' conduct , and said their objectives are clear . " journalists are neither microphone-holders nor the king ’ s scribes : they are there to bring unpleasant truths to light , whether the powerful like it or not , and otto schily is no exception , " said weimar . in addition , more than 200 bka agents may have had access to the information , which shows that the data was n't highly-secretive , journalists pointed out . rumors also abound that the bka deliberately manipulates data in order to track down leaks . long-winded legal battle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cicero editor-in-chief weimer wants to reveal the truth the ensuing cicero legal battle , at any rate , has lasted almost two years . yet it has been more than an aggressive campaign to uncover a leak inside the bka .
the affair quickly became a high-profile battle of principles , pitching government secrecy against journalistic inquiry . while some officials have defended the cicero raid in the name of state secrets and national security , their arguments have largely fallen on deaf ears with the press , the public and almost every political party on the spectrum , including the social democrats - or " spd , " schily ’ s own party . dieter wiefelspütz , the interior affairs expert for the spd , said that while he understands the need to find leaks within the bka , journalists ' work must also be respected . " if the work of journalists - who deal with confidential information nearly every day - is generally criminalized , then we have a real problem with press freedom in germany , " wiefelspütz said . he added that the bka should perhaps focus on the culprits within its own ranks first , and not turn journalists into culprits . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a distinctly " political " magazine in february 2006 , the potsdam district court ruled that the police search of the cicero offices was lawful schirra 's article contained " secret information relevant to national security . " editor weimar then filed a complaint against the raids with the country 's highest court . echoes from the past for many germans , the cicero affair has raised the specter of the spiegel scandal that began in 1962 .
back then , the weekly newsmagazine der spiegel was accused of treason for an article criticizing the german armed forces . defense minister franz josef strauß had the spiegel offices searched and occupied by police , and spiegel ’ s editor-in-chief , publisher and the author of the article arrested . the scandal ended with strauß ’ s resignation and a victory for press freedom . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german high court reviews press freedom german constitutional judges on wednesday began hearing the complaint of the editor of a magazine , whose offices had been searched by investigators following publication of classified material .

threat of action " no one wants this to happen .
but we are not ruling it out , " said peter scherrer , general secretary of the european metalworkers ' federation .
he said the closing down of entire plants , the one-sided distribution of cuts or the playing-off of different workforces could , for example , trigger industrial action . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the plans have already sparked union protests the broad outlines of the plan were first unveiled in october , sparking union protests .
in february , 20,000 members of the german metalworkers ' union ig metall took part in a day of action . airbus has 16 factories in britain , france , germany and spain , but the main tensions have arisen over job cuts in germany and france .
with presidential elections coming up in france , french politicians are particularly sensitive about domestic job cuts .
this sparked fears in germany that german workers would bear the brunt of the cutbacks .
french prime minister dominique de villepin referred last week to 10,000 job cuts - a figure later denied by the german government . a french newspaper also carried an unconfirmed report last week that airbus would seek to close four factories in france and four in germany . government concern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french and german leaders met last week to discuss overhaul the restructuring plan was high on the agenda at a meeting of french president jacques chirac and german chancellor angela merkel on friday , who were keen to defuse tensions sparked by the speculation . the two leaders agreed there should be an " equitable distribution " of the measures needed to reorganise the company . costly delays the franco-german company , whose headquarters are located in the french city of toulouse , has been hit by a string of production problems with the company 's a380 superjumbo airliner which have led to costly two-year delivery delays . eads said the so-called power8 rescue plan would enable airbus to " better face the challenge of the us dollar weakness , the financial burden related to the a380 delays as well as its future investment needs . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : production delays with the superjumbo have been costly in january , it was announced that airbus would report an operating loss for 2006 because of unexpected costs linked to the superjumbo programme . power8 is intended to save the company five billion euros by 2010 and two billion euros each year thereafter . airbus is also counting on savings from power8 to help fund the development of the new mid-sized long-haul jet , the a350 xwb . rivalry with boeing this ten billion euro project is seen as crucial for helping the european planemaker compete with boeing . the failure of the eads board to agree on the sharing of work on this project has delayed the announcement of the overhaul package . analysts have long said that the aircraft maker should spin off the less important production sites . dw staff -lrb- jeg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de for eads and airbus , 2006 was a year to forget the head of european aerospace giant eads said 2006 had been a very bad year indeed .

europeans are happier than ever before two eu reports released this week show most europeans are happy with their lives , despite social challenges facing the 27-nation bloc .
danes tops the happiness scale while bulgarians say they have little reason to smile . a eurobarometer poll published by the european commission this week said that 86 percent of europeans were relatively satisfied with their personal life and everyday environment .
the study said today 's europeans were happier , wealthier and living longer than their predecessors . " life satisfaction and happiness is higher in europe than in any other part of the world , " one of the study 's authors , frederic lerais , told reporters in brussels .
" life expectancy has increased and could increase a lot further , as could the possibilities of leading healthier , as well as longer lives . " however , a study of europe 's social reality published by the commission 's in-house think tank said although life satisfaction and happiness were higher in europe than in other parts of the world , eu societies were struggling to cope with immigration , ageing and a rapid shift to a " knowledge economy . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe 's future generations face many challenges " european societies face major social challenges , " the report said .
" the knowledge economy can seem threatening to those with low skills and low educational aspirations . " the report said unemployment and inactivity still blighted too many people 's lives , as did unresolved problems of widespread poverty .
it also pointed to new pressures facing europeans , including problems such as dysfunctional families and anti-social behavior , mental illness , as well as new diseases of affluence .
the integration of minorities was also a challenge , the report said . the two studies are part of a public consultation by the commission to assess europe 's current social realities and trends , dubbed a " social stocktaking exercise .

threat of action " no one wants this to happen .
but we are not ruling it out , " said peter scherrer , general secretary of the european metalworkers ' federation .
he said the closing down of entire plants , the one-sided distribution of cuts or the playing-off of different workforces could , for example , trigger industrial action . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the plans have already sparked union protests the broad outlines of the plan were first unveiled in october , sparking union protests .
in february , 20,000 members of the german metalworkers ' union ig metall took part in a day of action . airbus has 16 factories in britain , france , germany and spain , but the main tensions have arisen over job cuts in germany and france .
with presidential elections coming up in france , french politicians are particularly sensitive about domestic job cuts .
this sparked fears in germany that german workers would bear the brunt of the cutbacks .
french prime minister dominique de villepin referred last week to 10,000 job cuts - a figure later denied by the german government . a french newspaper also carried an unconfirmed report last week that airbus would seek to close four factories in france and four in germany . government concern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french and german leaders met last week to discuss overhaul the restructuring plan was high on the agenda at a meeting of french president jacques chirac and german chancellor angela merkel on friday , who were keen to defuse tensions sparked by the speculation . the two leaders agreed there should be an " equitable distribution " of the measures needed to reorganise the company . costly delays the franco-german company , whose headquarters are located in the french city of toulouse , has been hit by a string of production problems with the company 's a380 superjumbo airliner which have led to costly two-year delivery delays . eads said the so-called power8 rescue plan would enable airbus to " better face the challenge of the us dollar weakness , the financial burden related to the a380 delays as well as its future investment needs . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : production delays with the superjumbo have been costly in january , it was announced that airbus would report an operating loss for 2006 because of unexpected costs linked to the superjumbo programme . power8 is intended to save the company five billion euros by 2010 and two billion euros each year thereafter . airbus is also counting on savings from power8 to help fund the development of the new mid-sized long-haul jet , the a350 xwb . rivalry with boeing this ten billion euro project is seen as crucial for helping the european planemaker compete with boeing . the failure of the eads board to agree on the sharing of work on this project has delayed the announcement of the overhaul package . analysts have long said that the aircraft maker should spin off the less important production sites . dw staff -lrb- jeg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de for eads and airbus , 2006 was a year to forget the head of european aerospace giant eads said 2006 had been a very bad year indeed .

dw 's benjamin pargan comments that serbia now has less excuses to hand over war crimes criminals . once again it was a clear " yes-and-no " and " as-well-as " solution by the so-called international community .
the disappointment of the predominantly muslim war victims in bosnia and herzegovina is understandable .
many of them were displaced , tortured , raped by reservists and guerrilla fighters from serbia and montenegro . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benjamin pargan relatives of those muslim bosniaks murdered in the bosnian city of bijeljina , for example , will never understand this verdict .
their family members became victims of special forces and killer commandos from serbia right in the first days of the war - with the blessing of the government in belgrade at the time . the like occurred in several cities in bosnia and herzegovina .
this was repeatedly proven in individual trials at the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia in the hague .
the president of the international court of justice , rosalyn higgins , indirectly confirmed this with her remark that serbia militarily and financially supported bosnian serbs to a considerable degree . where does this significant support give way to direct responsibility for the genocide ?
either this question could not be conclusively clarified or - more likely - the judges at the highest un court did n't have enough courage and endurance to do so , regardless of possible political consequences . nonetheless , the judgment by the international court also has a positive side .
up to now , a large part of the serbian political establishment has repeatedly spoken of a sweeping prejudgment of the serbs .
mostly nationalist-minded powers used these pre-fabricated formulas far too often to dish up stories for their population about alleged forced and unjust collective guilt of the serbs .
when it came to questioning their own role in the war , many serbs accepted these argumentation aids with thanks .
a conviction of serbia would have given such populist pied pipers even more impetus .
it was , after all , the first time that a nation was formally accused of genocide . now , there is one excuse less for the up till now rejection of handing over serb generals accused of war crimes to the tribunal in the hague .
the verdict is a significant step in the direction of individualizing the blame - a demand also often made by serbia . the government in belgrade is more likely to interpret this judgment as a clean bill of health .
the international community and particularly the european union has to now make clear all the more that cooperating with the tribunal in the hague is still the requirement for approaching the transatlantic community .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 27.02.2007 opinion : ruling on serbia individualizes the blame großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un 's highest court on monday cleared serbia of direct responsibility for genocide in bosnia during the 1992-95 war .
dw 's benjamin pargan comments that serbia now has less excuses to hand over war crimes criminals . once again it was a clear " yes-and-no " and " as-well-as " solution by the so-called international community .
the disappointment of the predominantly muslim war victims in bosnia and herzegovina is understandable .
many of them were displaced , tortured , raped by reservists and guerrilla fighters from serbia and montenegro . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benjamin pargan relatives of those muslim bosniaks murdered in the bosnian city of bijeljina , for example , will never understand this verdict .
their family members became victims of special forces and killer commandos from serbia right in the first days of the war - with the blessing of the government in belgrade at the time . the like occurred in several cities in bosnia and herzegovina .
this was repeatedly proven in individual trials at the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia in the hague .
the president of the international court of justice , rosalyn higgins , indirectly confirmed this with her remark that serbia militarily and financially supported bosnian serbs to a considerable degree . where does this significant support give way to direct responsibility for the genocide ?
either this question could not be conclusively clarified or - more likely - the judges at the highest un court did n't have enough courage and endurance to do so , regardless of possible political consequences . nonetheless , the judgment by the international court also has a positive side .
up to now , a large part of the serbian political establishment has repeatedly spoken of a sweeping prejudgment of the serbs .
mostly nationalist-minded powers used these pre-fabricated formulas far too often to dish up stories for their population about alleged forced and unjust collective guilt of the serbs .
when it came to questioning their own role in the war , many serbs accepted these argumentation aids with thanks .
a conviction of serbia would have given such populist pied pipers even more impetus .
it was , after all , the first time that a nation was formally accused of genocide . now , there is one excuse less for the up till now rejection of handing over serb generals accused of war crimes to the tribunal in the hague .
the verdict is a significant step in the direction of individualizing the blame - a demand also often made by serbia . the government in belgrade is more likely to interpret this judgment as a clean bill of health .
the international community and particularly the european union has to now make clear all the more that cooperating with the tribunal in the hague is still the requirement for approaching the transatlantic community .
otherwise , the rather meager efforts of the serbs so far to punish war criminals will peter out even more quickly and silently . benjamin pargan is an editor for dw-radio 's bosnian department -lrb- sac -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de un 's highest court clears serbia of genocide in the first ruling of its kind , the international court of justice monday cleared serbia of direct responsibility for genocide in bosnia , but said belgrade violated international law by failing to prevent the massacre .

the case has raised questions about press freedom in germany . germany 's constitutional court in karlsruhe ruled tuesday that police violated the constitution by raiding the offices of the political online magazine cicero , based near berlin . judges said that the 2005 raid was a considerable violation of press freedom . in a 7-1 decision , the karlsruhe judges said the september 2005 search breached the constitition because the journalists themselves were not formally suspected of breaking the law . " searches and seizures against media people as part of a formal inquiry are unconstitutional if they are purely or mainly intended to detect the identity of an informant , " said presiding judge hans-jürgen papier . the court thus ruled in favor of cicero editor-in chief wolfram weimer , who had lodged a constitutional complaint against the search . a state court had ruled that the search , originally conducted under a warrant from a potsdam magistrate , was legal .
police seized disks and made a copy of a journalist 's hard-drive during the raid . national debate on press freedom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former interior minister schily the " cicero affair " gained momentum on sept .
12 , 2005 , when agents from germany ’ s federal criminal police office raided the magazine 's offices . they spent the whole day sifting through files and computer data .
at the end of the day , the german government came away with box-loads of material - and a massive public relations headache . yet the issue had started back in april 2005 .
the magazine ’ s authors published an article about a top al-qaeda leader , abu musab al-zarkawi , who has since been killed during a us air strike in iraq . as author bruno schirra reported his story , he cited information from a classified document which he obtained from a source within the federal criminal police office , or " bka . " former interior minister otto schily believed that was a major breach of security . " the government simply can not accept that documents from its innermost circles are passed on to the public by officers , because that creates dangers for such operations , " schily said . the journalists saw things differently .
cicero editor-in-chief wolfram weimar stood by his reporters ' conduct , and said their objectives are clear . " journalists are neither microphone-holders nor the king ’ s scribes : they are there to bring unpleasant truths to light , whether the powerful like it or not , and otto schily is no exception , " said weimar . in addition , more than 200 bka agents may have had access to the information , which shows that the data was n't highly-secretive , journalists pointed out . rumors also abound that the bka deliberately manipulates data in order to track down leaks . long-winded legal battle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cicero editor-in-chief weimer wants to reveal the truth the ensuing cicero legal battle , at any rate , has lasted almost two years . yet it has been more than an aggressive campaign to uncover a leak inside the bka .
the affair quickly became a high-profile battle of principles , pitching government secrecy against journalistic inquiry . while some officials have defended the cicero raid in the name of state secrets and national security , their arguments have largely fallen on deaf ears with the press , the public and almost every political party on the spectrum , including the social democrats - or " spd , " schily ’ s own party . dieter wiefelspütz , the interior affairs expert for the spd , said that while he understands the need to find leaks within the bka , journalists ' work must also be respected . " if the work of journalists - who deal with confidential information nearly every day - is generally criminalized , then we have a real problem with press freedom in germany , " wiefelspütz said . he added that the bka should perhaps focus on the culprits within its own ranks first , and not turn journalists into culprits . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a distinctly " political " magazine in february 2006 , the potsdam district court ruled that the police search of the cicero offices was lawful schirra 's article contained " secret information relevant to national security . " editor weimar then filed a complaint against the raids with the country 's highest court . echoes from the past for many germans , the cicero affair has raised the specter of the spiegel scandal that began in 1962 .
back then , the weekly newsmagazine der spiegel was accused of treason for an article criticizing the german armed forces . defense minister franz josef strauß had the spiegel offices searched and occupied by police , and spiegel ’ s editor-in-chief , publisher and the author of the article arrested . the scandal ended with strauß ’ s resignation and a victory for press freedom . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german high court reviews press freedom german constitutional judges on wednesday began hearing the complaint of the editor of a magazine , whose offices had been searched by investigators following publication of classified material .

" he said such behavior was very difficult to define and that the proposed legislation allowed too much scope for personal interpretation on the part of individual civil servants . " the boundaries are very blurred , " lefringhausen told dw-world.de.
" it is very imprecise .
the world-view of individual civil servants could play a fateful role . " pressure counterproductive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lefringhausen said pressure on migrants is counterproductive lefringhausen also questioned whether the planned changes would have the effect intended . " i think it is a major political mistake to believe that attitudes can be changed by pressure from outside , " he said .
" whoever puts migrants under pressure will experience counter-pressure .
the politics of the iron fist is not an intelligent form of politics . " the changes are part of amendments to german immigration law to bring it into line with eu regulations . other proposals to give residence permits to illegal immigrants whose presence has been tolerated up to now are also creating differences of opinion within the government . uncertain future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many children live in germany without resident status there are around 200,000 people living in germany with this precarious status .
under the proposed plans , these migrants would be allowed to stay if they can demonstrate that they are able to support themselves financially , though there are disagreements on how long they should be given to find a job . state interior ministers decided at a meeting in november that the deadline should be set at september , but the federal government wants to give the migrants until 2009 . german interior minister wolfgang schäuble said he plans to set up a committee to resolve these differences . dw staff -lrb- jeg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de survey : brits most averse to european migrants britons are more averse to receiving european migrants in their country than residents of germany , france , italy or spain , according to a poll published in the financial times .

but the " third man " françois bayrou could upset the first round of voting on april 22 . the latest polls in france show that conservative presidential candidate nicolas sarkozy and socialist rival ségolène royal are running neck-and-neck .
but outside contenders in the vote could upset a clear outcome . the traditional centrist , pro-european politician françois bayrou and far-right leader jean-marie le pen have also thrown their hats into the ring . voters in france head to the polls on april 22 for a presidential election .
a second round of voting is scheduled for may 6 if none of the candidates win an outright majority . according to the latest survey by lh2 pollsters , sarkozy is slightly ahead in the first round of voting with 30 percent of votes while royal would get 27 percent .
bayrou is credited with 17 percent of votes while le pen is holding 13 percent .
in a runoff , sarkozy and royal could both win 50 percent , the survey said . front-runners turn on " the third man " centrist bayrou - dubbed " the third man " in the french press - has seen a recent surge in his ratings .
during a prime-time television performance on monday night , bayrou promised he would transcend the left-right divide in france .
analysts said this could explain his growing popularity . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : centrist candidate françois bayrou is calling for " a social economy " " the two front-runners , how much support do they have - 25 percent ? "
bayrou said on tf1 television .
" that 's not enough to run the country .
that 's why we are in the state we are in , because there has not been enough backing for reform . " but both royal and sarkozy have criticized his platform . " i think it 's very dangerous , " royal told france inter radio .
" it 's trying to stop the french choosing between two models of society , two opposing political visions . " sarkozy said bayrou 's policies would lead to chaos like that of france 's fourth republic , when makeshift coalition governments rose and fell repeatedly . " democracy is a majority and an opposition and the french have to choose , " sarkozy told rmc radio . le pen focuses on anti-immigrant , anti-europe platform le pen could prove to be a greater threat to the main candidates than bayrou , though .
the far-right leader is doing better in the race than he was before the 2002 elections .
at that time , he stunned the nation by qualifying for the second round of voting against jacques chirac .
with nearly 17 percent of votes , he beat out socialist candidate lionel jospin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : right-wing leader jean-marie le pen is promoting a " zero immigration " platform the 78-year-old launched his election program in lille over the weekend .
in his fifth and probably last bid for the presidency , le pen vowed to halt immigration and integration with europe , which he said was leading france to disaster . le pen told a convention of his national front party that he would cut off social benefits to immigrants and " restore france 's borders . "
amid cheers and chants of " le pen , president ! " the far-right leader said france was crumbling under poverty , unemployment , the dislocation of factories and " massive immigration . " but french reality has changed over the past five years .
in 2002 , security and crime topped the list of voters concerns .
this had fit well into le pen 's nationalist anti-immigration platform .
now , sarkozy has moved into le pen 's traditional law-and-order territory .
voters ' worries have also shifted to jobs and purchasing power , neither of them strong points for le pen . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sparks expected to fly whoever becomes france 's president as the frontrunners in the french presidential race , nicolas sarkozy and segolene royal , make their way to berlin , dw-world.de asks what the election result will mean for germany and the european union in general .

but the " third man " françois bayrou could upset the first round of voting on april 22 . the latest polls in france show that conservative presidential candidate nicolas sarkozy and socialist rival ségolène royal are running neck-and-neck .
but outside contenders in the vote could upset a clear outcome . the traditional centrist , pro-european politician françois bayrou and far-right leader jean-marie le pen have also thrown their hats into the ring . voters in france head to the polls on april 22 for a presidential election .
a second round of voting is scheduled for may 6 if none of the candidates win an outright majority . according to the latest survey by lh2 pollsters , sarkozy is slightly ahead in the first round of voting with 30 percent of votes while royal would get 27 percent .
bayrou is credited with 17 percent of votes while le pen is holding 13 percent .
in a runoff , sarkozy and royal could both win 50 percent , the survey said . front-runners turn on " the third man " centrist bayrou - dubbed " the third man " in the french press - has seen a recent surge in his ratings .
during a prime-time television performance on monday night , bayrou promised he would transcend the left-right divide in france .
analysts said this could explain his growing popularity . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : centrist candidate françois bayrou is calling for " a social economy " " the two front-runners , how much support do they have - 25 percent ? "
bayrou said on tf1 television .
" that 's not enough to run the country .
that 's why we are in the state we are in , because there has not been enough backing for reform . " but both royal and sarkozy have criticized his platform . " i think it 's very dangerous , " royal told france inter radio .
" it 's trying to stop the french choosing between two models of society , two opposing political visions . " sarkozy said bayrou 's policies would lead to chaos like that of france 's fourth republic , when makeshift coalition governments rose and fell repeatedly . " democracy is a majority and an opposition and the french have to choose , " sarkozy told rmc radio . le pen focuses on anti-immigrant , anti-europe platform le pen could prove to be a greater threat to the main candidates than bayrou , though .
the far-right leader is doing better in the race than he was before the 2002 elections .
at that time , he stunned the nation by qualifying for the second round of voting against jacques chirac .
with nearly 17 percent of votes , he beat out socialist candidate lionel jospin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : right-wing leader jean-marie le pen is promoting a " zero immigration " platform the 78-year-old launched his election program in lille over the weekend .
in his fifth and probably last bid for the presidency , le pen vowed to halt immigration and integration with europe , which he said was leading france to disaster . le pen told a convention of his national front party that he would cut off social benefits to immigrants and " restore france 's borders . "
amid cheers and chants of " le pen , president ! " the far-right leader said france was crumbling under poverty , unemployment , the dislocation of factories and " massive immigration . " but french reality has changed over the past five years .
in 2002 , security and crime topped the list of voters concerns .
this had fit well into le pen 's nationalist anti-immigration platform .

but the " third man " françois bayrou could upset the first round of voting on april 22 . the latest polls in france show that conservative presidential candidate nicolas sarkozy and socialist rival ségolène royal are running neck-and-neck .
but outside contenders in the vote could upset a clear outcome . the traditional centrist , pro-european politician françois bayrou and far-right leader jean-marie le pen have also thrown their hats into the ring . voters in france head to the polls on april 22 for a presidential election .
a second round of voting is scheduled for may 6 if none of the candidates win an outright majority . according to the latest survey by lh2 pollsters , sarkozy is slightly ahead in the first round of voting with 30 percent of votes while royal would get 27 percent .
bayrou is credited with 17 percent of votes while le pen is holding 13 percent .
in a runoff , sarkozy and royal could both win 50 percent , the survey said . front-runners turn on " the third man " centrist bayrou - dubbed " the third man " in the french press - has seen a recent surge in his ratings .
during a prime-time television performance on monday night , bayrou promised he would transcend the left-right divide in france .
analysts said this could explain his growing popularity . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : centrist candidate françois bayrou is calling for " a social economy " " the two front-runners , how much support do they have - 25 percent ? "
bayrou said on tf1 television .
" that 's not enough to run the country .
that 's why we are in the state we are in , because there has not been enough backing for reform . " but both royal and sarkozy have criticized his platform . " i think it 's very dangerous , " royal told france inter radio .
" it 's trying to stop the french choosing between two models of society , two opposing political visions . " sarkozy said bayrou 's policies would lead to chaos like that of france 's fourth republic , when makeshift coalition governments rose and fell repeatedly . " democracy is a majority and an opposition and the french have to choose , " sarkozy told rmc radio . le pen focuses on anti-immigrant , anti-europe platform le pen could prove to be a greater threat to the main candidates than bayrou , though .
the far-right leader is doing better in the race than he was before the 2002 elections .
at that time , he stunned the nation by qualifying for the second round of voting against jacques chirac .
with nearly 17 percent of votes , he beat out socialist candidate lionel jospin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : right-wing leader jean-marie le pen is promoting a " zero immigration " platform the 78-year-old launched his election program in lille over the weekend .
in his fifth and probably last bid for the presidency , le pen vowed to halt immigration and integration with europe , which he said was leading france to disaster . le pen told a convention of his national front party that he would cut off social benefits to immigrants and " restore france 's borders . "
amid cheers and chants of " le pen , president ! " the far-right leader said france was crumbling under poverty , unemployment , the dislocation of factories and " massive immigration . " but french reality has changed over the past five years .
in 2002 , security and crime topped the list of voters concerns .
this had fit well into le pen 's nationalist anti-immigration platform .
now , sarkozy has moved into le pen 's traditional law-and-order territory .

the home side , chasing a league and cup double , join nuremberg , wolfsburg and frankfurt in the last four . stuttgart advanced to the semi-finals of the german cup with a 2-0 victory against hertha berlin on wednesday . in pouring rain , which made conditions for the players very difficult , brazilian striker cacau and german international thomas hitzlsperger scored the goals that gave the home side a place in the next round . cacau gave stuttgart the lead in the 38th minute with a header after swiss international ludovic magnin went around berlin defender arne friedrich and played a pin-point cross into the area for the brazilian . hertha hit be der hammer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitzlsperger scored the second to knock out berlin stuttgart , who are chasing the league and cup double , continued dominating for most of the remaining match and were rewarded for their efforts in the 77th minute when hitzlsperger 's long range effort from the edge of the area flew past the outstretched hands of diving goalkeeper christian fiedler . marco streller , who came on in the second half for german international mario gomez should have given stuttgart a third in the last minute after roberto hilbert played the ball across the empty berlin area , but streller could not reach the ball to push it into the empty net . nuremberg , wolfsburg and frankfurt won their german cup quarter-finals on tuesday , taking a big step toward the tournament 's championship match in the capital .

the case has raised questions about press freedom in germany . germany 's constitutional court in karlsruhe ruled tuesday that police violated the constitution by raiding the offices of the political online magazine cicero , based near berlin . judges said that the 2005 raid was a considerable violation of press freedom . in a 7-1 decision , the karlsruhe judges said the september 2005 search breached the constitition because the journalists themselves were not formally suspected of breaking the law . " searches and seizures against media people as part of a formal inquiry are unconstitutional if they are purely or mainly intended to detect the identity of an informant , " said presiding judge hans-jürgen papier . the court thus ruled in favor of cicero editor-in chief wolfram weimer , who had lodged a constitutional complaint against the search . a state court had ruled that the search , originally conducted under a warrant from a potsdam magistrate , was legal .
police seized disks and made a copy of a journalist 's hard-drive during the raid . national debate on press freedom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former interior minister schily the " cicero affair " gained momentum on sept .
12 , 2005 , when agents from germany ’ s federal criminal police office raided the magazine 's offices . they spent the whole day sifting through files and computer data .
at the end of the day , the german government came away with box-loads of material - and a massive public relations headache . yet the issue had started back in april 2005 .
the magazine ’ s authors published an article about a top al-qaeda leader , abu musab al-zarkawi , who has since been killed during a us air strike in iraq . as author bruno schirra reported his story , he cited information from a classified document which he obtained from a source within the federal criminal police office , or " bka . " former interior minister otto schily believed that was a major breach of security . " the government simply can not accept that documents from its innermost circles are passed on to the public by officers , because that creates dangers for such operations , " schily said . the journalists saw things differently .
cicero editor-in-chief wolfram weimar stood by his reporters ' conduct , and said their objectives are clear . " journalists are neither microphone-holders nor the king ’ s scribes : they are there to bring unpleasant truths to light , whether the powerful like it or not , and otto schily is no exception , " said weimar . in addition , more than 200 bka agents may have had access to the information , which shows that the data was n't highly-secretive , journalists pointed out . rumors also abound that the bka deliberately manipulates data in order to track down leaks . long-winded legal battle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cicero editor-in-chief weimer wants to reveal the truth the ensuing cicero legal battle , at any rate , has lasted almost two years . yet it has been more than an aggressive campaign to uncover a leak inside the bka .
the affair quickly became a high-profile battle of principles , pitching government secrecy against journalistic inquiry . while some officials have defended the cicero raid in the name of state secrets and national security , their arguments have largely fallen on deaf ears with the press , the public and almost every political party on the spectrum , including the social democrats - or " spd , " schily ’ s own party . dieter wiefelspütz , the interior affairs expert for the spd , said that while he understands the need to find leaks within the bka , journalists ' work must also be respected . " if the work of journalists - who deal with confidential information nearly every day - is generally criminalized , then we have a real problem with press freedom in germany , " wiefelspütz said . he added that the bka should perhaps focus on the culprits within its own ranks first , and not turn journalists into culprits . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a distinctly " political " magazine in february 2006 , the potsdam district court ruled that the police search of the cicero offices was lawful schirra 's article contained " secret information relevant to national security . " editor weimar then filed a complaint against the raids with the country 's highest court . echoes from the past for many germans , the cicero affair has raised the specter of the spiegel scandal that began in 1962 .
back then , the weekly newsmagazine der spiegel was accused of treason for an article criticizing the german armed forces . defense minister franz josef strauß had the spiegel offices searched and occupied by police , and spiegel ’ s editor-in-chief , publisher and the author of the article arrested . the scandal ended with strauß ’ s resignation and a victory for press freedom . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german high court reviews press freedom german constitutional judges on wednesday began hearing the complaint of the editor of a magazine , whose offices had been searched by investigators following publication of classified material .

europeans are happier than ever before two eu reports released this week show most europeans are happy with their lives , despite social challenges facing the 27-nation bloc .
danes tops the happiness scale while bulgarians say they have little reason to smile . a eurobarometer poll published by the european commission this week said that 86 percent of europeans were relatively satisfied with their personal life and everyday environment .
the study said today 's europeans were happier , wealthier and living longer than their predecessors . " life satisfaction and happiness is higher in europe than in any other part of the world , " one of the study 's authors , frederic lerais , told reporters in brussels .
" life expectancy has increased and could increase a lot further , as could the possibilities of leading healthier , as well as longer lives . " however , a study of europe 's social reality published by the commission 's in-house think tank said although life satisfaction and happiness were higher in europe than in other parts of the world , eu societies were struggling to cope with immigration , ageing and a rapid shift to a " knowledge economy . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe 's future generations face many challenges " european societies face major social challenges , " the report said .
" the knowledge economy can seem threatening to those with low skills and low educational aspirations . " the report said unemployment and inactivity still blighted too many people 's lives , as did unresolved problems of widespread poverty .
it also pointed to new pressures facing europeans , including problems such as dysfunctional families and anti-social behavior , mental illness , as well as new diseases of affluence .
the integration of minorities was also a challenge , the report said . the two studies are part of a public consultation by the commission to assess europe 's current social realities and trends , dubbed a " social stocktaking exercise . " happiness is contagious the eurobarometer study said the most content in the bloc were the danes , 97 percent of whom declared themselves " happy . "
the dutch , belgians , irish and swedes , followed by respondents from luxembourg and finland , were not far behind in the happy stakes . the british , at 92 percent , were found to be happier than the french -lrb- 90 percent -rrb- and the germans -lrb- 82 percent -rrb- . the happiness indicator achieved a momentum of its own , lerais said . " if you realize that nine and a half out of every 10 citizens around you are happy , then it makes you happy yourself , " lerais said alongside his co-author , roger liddle . new eu members romania -lrb- 60 percent -rrb- and bulgaria -lrb- 39 percent -rrb- are shown as the most unhappy europeans , although the study was taken in november and december before they joined the bloc on jan .
1 , 2007 . europeans feel over-worked when it came to work , though , the figures changed .
the eurobarometer study showed that the most advanced eu member states were rapidly becoming post-industrial , with manufacturing accounting for less than a fifth of all jobs in the eu as a whole . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bulgaria joined the eu with a flourish in january these changes were leading to " new occupational divisions " according to the report , with at least half of existing jobs demanding a high level of skills while a third of the workforce had " very few skills . "
women were heavily represented in the low-skilled service sector , and gender pay-gap and career progression issues continued . in the study , 41 percent of people agreed that their work was " too demanding and stressful . "
just more than one in three disagreed . european commission president jose manuel barroso said the social stocktaking was necessary as a frame of reference for social policies . " the modern purpose of the european union is to enable europe 's citizens to enhance their prosperity , solidarity and security in a global age , " barroso said .
" we can not do this adequately without a common frame of reference for what is happening to our societies and a common understanding of the likely impact of the big social challenges we face .

europeans are happier than ever before two eu reports released this week show most europeans are happy with their lives , despite social challenges facing the 27-nation bloc .
danes tops the happiness scale while bulgarians say they have little reason to smile . a eurobarometer poll published by the european commission this week said that 86 percent of europeans were relatively satisfied with their personal life and everyday environment .
the study said today 's europeans were happier , wealthier and living longer than their predecessors . " life satisfaction and happiness is higher in europe than in any other part of the world , " one of the study 's authors , frederic lerais , told reporters in brussels .
" life expectancy has increased and could increase a lot further , as could the possibilities of leading healthier , as well as longer lives . " however , a study of europe 's social reality published by the commission 's in-house think tank said although life satisfaction and happiness were higher in europe than in other parts of the world , eu societies were struggling to cope with immigration , ageing and a rapid shift to a " knowledge economy . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe 's future generations face many challenges " european societies face major social challenges , " the report said .
" the knowledge economy can seem threatening to those with low skills and low educational aspirations . " the report said unemployment and inactivity still blighted too many people 's lives , as did unresolved problems of widespread poverty .
it also pointed to new pressures facing europeans , including problems such as dysfunctional families and anti-social behavior , mental illness , as well as new diseases of affluence .
the integration of minorities was also a challenge , the report said . the two studies are part of a public consultation by the commission to assess europe 's current social realities and trends , dubbed a " social stocktaking exercise . " happiness is contagious the eurobarometer study said the most content in the bloc were the danes , 97 percent of whom declared themselves " happy . "
the dutch , belgians , irish and swedes , followed by respondents from luxembourg and finland , were not far behind in the happy stakes . the british , at 92 percent , were found to be happier than the french -lrb- 90 percent -rrb- and the germans -lrb- 82 percent -rrb- . the happiness indicator achieved a momentum of its own , lerais said . " if you realize that nine and a half out of every 10 citizens around you are happy , then it makes you happy yourself , " lerais said alongside his co-author , roger liddle . new eu members romania -lrb- 60 percent -rrb- and bulgaria -lrb- 39 percent -rrb- are shown as the most unhappy europeans , although the study was taken in november and december before they joined the bloc on jan .
1 , 2007 . europeans feel over-worked when it came to work , though , the figures changed .
the eurobarometer study showed that the most advanced eu member states were rapidly becoming post-industrial , with manufacturing accounting for less than a fifth of all jobs in the eu as a whole . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bulgaria joined the eu with a flourish in january these changes were leading to " new occupational divisions " according to the report , with at least half of existing jobs demanding a high level of skills while a third of the workforce had " very few skills . "
women were heavily represented in the low-skilled service sector , and gender pay-gap and career progression issues continued . in the study , 41 percent of people agreed that their work was " too demanding and stressful . "
just more than one in three disagreed . european commission president jose manuel barroso said the social stocktaking was necessary as a frame of reference for social policies . " the modern purpose of the european union is to enable europe 's citizens to enhance their prosperity , solidarity and security in a global age , " barroso said .

the case has raised questions about press freedom in germany . germany 's constitutional court in karlsruhe ruled tuesday that police violated the constitution by raiding the offices of the political online magazine cicero , based near berlin . judges said that the 2005 raid was a considerable violation of press freedom . in a 7-1 decision , the karlsruhe judges said the september 2005 search breached the constitition because the journalists themselves were not formally suspected of breaking the law . " searches and seizures against media people as part of a formal inquiry are unconstitutional if they are purely or mainly intended to detect the identity of an informant , " said presiding judge hans-jürgen papier . the court thus ruled in favor of cicero editor-in chief wolfram weimer , who had lodged a constitutional complaint against the search . a state court had ruled that the search , originally conducted under a warrant from a potsdam magistrate , was legal .
police seized disks and made a copy of a journalist 's hard-drive during the raid . national debate on press freedom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former interior minister schily the " cicero affair " gained momentum on sept .
12 , 2005 , when agents from germany ’ s federal criminal police office raided the magazine 's offices . they spent the whole day sifting through files and computer data .
at the end of the day , the german government came away with box-loads of material - and a massive public relations headache . yet the issue had started back in april 2005 .
the magazine ’ s authors published an article about a top al-qaeda leader , abu musab al-zarkawi , who has since been killed during a us air strike in iraq . as author bruno schirra reported his story , he cited information from a classified document which he obtained from a source within the federal criminal police office , or " bka . " former interior minister otto schily believed that was a major breach of security . " the government simply can not accept that documents from its innermost circles are passed on to the public by officers , because that creates dangers for such operations , " schily said . the journalists saw things differently .
cicero editor-in-chief wolfram weimar stood by his reporters ' conduct , and said their objectives are clear . " journalists are neither microphone-holders nor the king ’ s scribes : they are there to bring unpleasant truths to light , whether the powerful like it or not , and otto schily is no exception , " said weimar . in addition , more than 200 bka agents may have had access to the information , which shows that the data was n't highly-secretive , journalists pointed out . rumors also abound that the bka deliberately manipulates data in order to track down leaks . long-winded legal battle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cicero editor-in-chief weimer wants to reveal the truth the ensuing cicero legal battle , at any rate , has lasted almost two years . yet it has been more than an aggressive campaign to uncover a leak inside the bka .
the affair quickly became a high-profile battle of principles , pitching government secrecy against journalistic inquiry . while some officials have defended the cicero raid in the name of state secrets and national security , their arguments have largely fallen on deaf ears with the press , the public and almost every political party on the spectrum , including the social democrats - or " spd , " schily ’ s own party . dieter wiefelspütz , the interior affairs expert for the spd , said that while he understands the need to find leaks within the bka , journalists ' work must also be respected . " if the work of journalists - who deal with confidential information nearly every day - is generally criminalized , then we have a real problem with press freedom in germany , " wiefelspütz said . he added that the bka should perhaps focus on the culprits within its own ranks first , and not turn journalists into culprits . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a distinctly " political " magazine in february 2006 , the potsdam district court ruled that the police search of the cicero offices was lawful schirra 's article contained " secret information relevant to national security . " editor weimar then filed a complaint against the raids with the country 's highest court . echoes from the past for many germans , the cicero affair has raised the specter of the spiegel scandal that began in 1962 .
back then , the weekly newsmagazine der spiegel was accused of treason for an article criticizing the german armed forces . defense minister franz josef strauß had the spiegel offices searched and occupied by police , and spiegel ’ s editor-in-chief , publisher and the author of the article arrested . the scandal ended with strauß ’ s resignation and a victory for press freedom . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german high court reviews press freedom german constitutional judges on wednesday began hearing the complaint of the editor of a magazine , whose offices had been searched by investigators following publication of classified material .

threat of action " no one wants this to happen .
but we are not ruling it out , " said peter scherrer , general secretary of the european metalworkers ' federation .
he said the closing down of entire plants , the one-sided distribution of cuts or the playing-off of different workforces could , for example , trigger industrial action . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the plans have already sparked union protests the broad outlines of the plan were first unveiled in october , sparking union protests .
in february , 20,000 members of the german metalworkers ' union ig metall took part in a day of action . airbus has 16 factories in britain , france , germany and spain , but the main tensions have arisen over job cuts in germany and france .
with presidential elections coming up in france , french politicians are particularly sensitive about domestic job cuts .
this sparked fears in germany that german workers would bear the brunt of the cutbacks .
french prime minister dominique de villepin referred last week to 10,000 job cuts - a figure later denied by the german government . a french newspaper also carried an unconfirmed report last week that airbus would seek to close four factories in france and four in germany . government concern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french and german leaders met last week to discuss overhaul the restructuring plan was high on the agenda at a meeting of french president jacques chirac and german chancellor angela merkel on friday , who were keen to defuse tensions sparked by the speculation . the two leaders agreed there should be an " equitable distribution " of the measures needed to reorganise the company . costly delays the franco-german company , whose headquarters are located in the french city of toulouse , has been hit by a string of production problems with the company 's a380 superjumbo airliner which have led to costly two-year delivery delays . eads said the so-called power8 rescue plan would enable airbus to " better face the challenge of the us dollar weakness , the financial burden related to the a380 delays as well as its future investment needs . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : production delays with the superjumbo have been costly in january , it was announced that airbus would report an operating loss for 2006 because of unexpected costs linked to the superjumbo programme . power8 is intended to save the company five billion euros by 2010 and two billion euros each year thereafter . airbus is also counting on savings from power8 to help fund the development of the new mid-sized long-haul jet , the a350 xwb . rivalry with boeing this ten billion euro project is seen as crucial for helping the european planemaker compete with boeing . the failure of the eads board to agree on the sharing of work on this project has delayed the announcement of the overhaul package . analysts have long said that the aircraft maker should spin off the less important production sites . dw staff -lrb- jeg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de for eads and airbus , 2006 was a year to forget the head of european aerospace giant eads said 2006 had been a very bad year indeed .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 27.02.2007 proposed immigration laws come under fire großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : migrants could face fines if they refuse to take part in integration courses the german government 's proposals to crack down on immigrants seen as unwilling to integrate into german society have come under fire from a number of quarters . refugee welfare organizations , the german trade union federation , representatives of the turkish community , the opposition greens party and the left party are among the groups who have spoken out against possible changes to german immigration law . the proposed measures range from fines of up to 1,000 euros -lrb- $ 1,323 -rrb- for immigrants who do not attend obligatory integration courses to the deportation of people who stop members of their family integrating into german society . there are also plans to require wives or husbands joining their spouses in germany to demonstrate basic german language skills and to stop any children from entering germany as a spouse . dialogue threatened bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's turkish community has attacked the proposals the chairman of the turkish community in germany , kenan kolat , said the proposed legislation threatened to torpedo the dialogue on integration initiated by german chancellor angela merkel . north rhine-westphalia 's commissioner for integration , klaus lefringhausen , criticized plans to deport immigrants deemed to be acting in ways " antagonistic to the process of integration . " he said such behavior was very difficult to define and that the proposed legislation allowed too much scope for personal interpretation on the part of individual civil servants . " the boundaries are very blurred , " lefringhausen told dw-world.de.
" it is very imprecise .
the world-view of individual civil servants could play a fateful role . " pressure counterproductive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lefringhausen said pressure on migrants is counterproductive lefringhausen also questioned whether the planned changes would have the effect intended . " i think it is a major political mistake to believe that attitudes can be changed by pressure from outside , " he said .
" whoever puts migrants under pressure will experience counter-pressure .
the politics of the iron fist is not an intelligent form of politics . " the changes are part of amendments to german immigration law to bring it into line with eu regulations . other proposals to give residence permits to illegal immigrants whose presence has been tolerated up to now are also creating differences of opinion within the government . uncertain future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many children live in germany without resident status there are around 200,000 people living in germany with this precarious status .
under the proposed plans , these migrants would be allowed to stay if they can demonstrate that they are able to support themselves financially , though there are disagreements on how long they should be given to find a job . state interior ministers decided at a meeting in november that the deadline should be set at september , but the federal government wants to give the migrants until 2009 . german interior minister wolfgang schäuble said he plans to set up a committee to resolve these differences . dw staff -lrb- jeg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de survey : brits most averse to european migrants britons are more averse to receiving european migrants in their country than residents of germany , france , italy or spain , according to a poll published in the financial times .

europeans are happier than ever before two eu reports released this week show most europeans are happy with their lives , despite social challenges facing the 27-nation bloc .
danes tops the happiness scale while bulgarians say they have little reason to smile . a eurobarometer poll published by the european commission this week said that 86 percent of europeans were relatively satisfied with their personal life and everyday environment .
the study said today 's europeans were happier , wealthier and living longer than their predecessors . " life satisfaction and happiness is higher in europe than in any other part of the world , " one of the study 's authors , frederic lerais , told reporters in brussels .
" life expectancy has increased and could increase a lot further , as could the possibilities of leading healthier , as well as longer lives . " however , a study of europe 's social reality published by the commission 's in-house think tank said although life satisfaction and happiness were higher in europe than in other parts of the world , eu societies were struggling to cope with immigration , ageing and a rapid shift to a " knowledge economy . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe 's future generations face many challenges " european societies face major social challenges , " the report said .
" the knowledge economy can seem threatening to those with low skills and low educational aspirations . " the report said unemployment and inactivity still blighted too many people 's lives , as did unresolved problems of widespread poverty .
it also pointed to new pressures facing europeans , including problems such as dysfunctional families and anti-social behavior , mental illness , as well as new diseases of affluence .
the integration of minorities was also a challenge , the report said . the two studies are part of a public consultation by the commission to assess europe 's current social realities and trends , dubbed a " social stocktaking exercise . " happiness is contagious the eurobarometer study said the most content in the bloc were the danes , 97 percent of whom declared themselves " happy . "
the dutch , belgians , irish and swedes , followed by respondents from luxembourg and finland , were not far behind in the happy stakes . the british , at 92 percent , were found to be happier than the french -lrb- 90 percent -rrb- and the germans -lrb- 82 percent -rrb- . the happiness indicator achieved a momentum of its own , lerais said . " if you realize that nine and a half out of every 10 citizens around you are happy , then it makes you happy yourself , " lerais said alongside his co-author , roger liddle . new eu members romania -lrb- 60 percent -rrb- and bulgaria -lrb- 39 percent -rrb- are shown as the most unhappy europeans , although the study was taken in november and december before they joined the bloc on jan .
1 , 2007 . europeans feel over-worked when it came to work , though , the figures changed .
the eurobarometer study showed that the most advanced eu member states were rapidly becoming post-industrial , with manufacturing accounting for less than a fifth of all jobs in the eu as a whole . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bulgaria joined the eu with a flourish in january these changes were leading to " new occupational divisions " according to the report , with at least half of existing jobs demanding a high level of skills while a third of the workforce had " very few skills . "
women were heavily represented in the low-skilled service sector , and gender pay-gap and career progression issues continued . in the study , 41 percent of people agreed that their work was " too demanding and stressful . "
just more than one in three disagreed . european commission president jose manuel barroso said the social stocktaking was necessary as a frame of reference for social policies . " the modern purpose of the european union is to enable europe 's citizens to enhance their prosperity , solidarity and security in a global age , " barroso said .
" we can not do this adequately without a common frame of reference for what is happening to our societies and a common understanding of the likely impact of the big social challenges we face . " the commission said the results may be fed into forthcoming policy initiatives . dw staff / afp / dpa -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de happiness is … love and vacation valentine 's day is the day of love .

europeans are happier than ever before two eu reports released this week show most europeans are happy with their lives , despite social challenges facing the 27-nation bloc .
danes tops the happiness scale while bulgarians say they have little reason to smile . a eurobarometer poll published by the european commission this week said that 86 percent of europeans were relatively satisfied with their personal life and everyday environment .
the study said today 's europeans were happier , wealthier and living longer than their predecessors . " life satisfaction and happiness is higher in europe than in any other part of the world , " one of the study 's authors , frederic lerais , told reporters in brussels .
" life expectancy has increased and could increase a lot further , as could the possibilities of leading healthier , as well as longer lives . " however , a study of europe 's social reality published by the commission 's in-house think tank said although life satisfaction and happiness were higher in europe than in other parts of the world , eu societies were struggling to cope with immigration , ageing and a rapid shift to a " knowledge economy . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe 's future generations face many challenges " european societies face major social challenges , " the report said .
" the knowledge economy can seem threatening to those with low skills and low educational aspirations . " the report said unemployment and inactivity still blighted too many people 's lives , as did unresolved problems of widespread poverty .
it also pointed to new pressures facing europeans , including problems such as dysfunctional families and anti-social behavior , mental illness , as well as new diseases of affluence .
the integration of minorities was also a challenge , the report said . the two studies are part of a public consultation by the commission to assess europe 's current social realities and trends , dubbed a " social stocktaking exercise . " happiness is contagious the eurobarometer study said the most content in the bloc were the danes , 97 percent of whom declared themselves " happy . "
the dutch , belgians , irish and swedes , followed by respondents from luxembourg and finland , were not far behind in the happy stakes . the british , at 92 percent , were found to be happier than the french -lrb- 90 percent -rrb- and the germans -lrb- 82 percent -rrb- . the happiness indicator achieved a momentum of its own , lerais said . " if you realize that nine and a half out of every 10 citizens around you are happy , then it makes you happy yourself , " lerais said alongside his co-author , roger liddle . new eu members romania -lrb- 60 percent -rrb- and bulgaria -lrb- 39 percent -rrb- are shown as the most unhappy europeans , although the study was taken in november and december before they joined the bloc on jan .
1 , 2007 . europeans feel over-worked when it came to work , though , the figures changed .
the eurobarometer study showed that the most advanced eu member states were rapidly becoming post-industrial , with manufacturing accounting for less than a fifth of all jobs in the eu as a whole . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bulgaria joined the eu with a flourish in january these changes were leading to " new occupational divisions " according to the report , with at least half of existing jobs demanding a high level of skills while a third of the workforce had " very few skills . "
women were heavily represented in the low-skilled service sector , and gender pay-gap and career progression issues continued . in the study , 41 percent of people agreed that their work was " too demanding and stressful . "
just more than one in three disagreed . european commission president jose manuel barroso said the social stocktaking was necessary as a frame of reference for social policies . " the modern purpose of the european union is to enable europe 's citizens to enhance their prosperity , solidarity and security in a global age , " barroso said .

" we understand the position of our european partners and chancellor merkel , " yanukovych said . " we also understand that only reforms of the economy , our legal system and judiciary , of the bureaucracy and improving the living standard of our citizens will move ukraine closer to the eu , " he added . thus , unlike his political rival president yushchenko , who expressed a clear desire to join the eu during his visit to germany two weeks ago , prime minister yanukovych has been more pragmatic . he stressed that more attention should be given to the new partnership and cooperation accord with the eu . " i believe this agreement will be the cornerstone for developing our relationship , " yanukovych said .
" the first step and most important component of this new treaty should be the creation of a free-trade zone .

23 trade , in fact , is a major issue on chancellor angela merkel 's agenda . germany and the eu are deeply concerned about their energy security and the reliability of gas and oil deliveries from russia .
a conflict last year between russia and ukraine over transit fees led to an interruption of supplies to western europe . yanukovych has said he wants to make ukraine a reliable energy partner and has proposed a number of joint pipeline projects with russia and the eu . " a lot depends on relations between ukraine and russia , " yanukovych said .
" we need to ensure that russia and the eu unite on the energy issue and that more sources of energy are available to the european market . " yanukovych sees ukraine 's future as being a bridge and mediator between a newly resurgent russia and an energy-vulnerable european union .
but , he also hopes that positioning the country between the two big neighbors will make it less vulnerable to economic and political pressures from moscow . gregg benzow -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu , ukraine launch negotiations on bolstering ties the european union and ukraine have kicked off negotiations on a new partnership agreement .

but the " third man " françois bayrou could upset the first round of voting on april 22 . the latest polls in france show that conservative presidential candidate nicolas sarkozy and socialist rival ségolène royal are running neck-and-neck .
but outside contenders in the vote could upset a clear outcome . the traditional centrist , pro-european politician françois bayrou and far-right leader jean-marie le pen have also thrown their hats into the ring . voters in france head to the polls on april 22 for a presidential election .
a second round of voting is scheduled for may 6 if none of the candidates win an outright majority . according to the latest survey by lh2 pollsters , sarkozy is slightly ahead in the first round of voting with 30 percent of votes while royal would get 27 percent .
bayrou is credited with 17 percent of votes while le pen is holding 13 percent .
in a runoff , sarkozy and royal could both win 50 percent , the survey said . front-runners turn on " the third man " centrist bayrou - dubbed " the third man " in the french press - has seen a recent surge in his ratings .
during a prime-time television performance on monday night , bayrou promised he would transcend the left-right divide in france .
analysts said this could explain his growing popularity . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : centrist candidate françois bayrou is calling for " a social economy " " the two front-runners , how much support do they have - 25 percent ? "
bayrou said on tf1 television .
" that 's not enough to run the country .
that 's why we are in the state we are in , because there has not been enough backing for reform . " but both royal and sarkozy have criticized his platform . " i think it 's very dangerous , " royal told france inter radio .
" it 's trying to stop the french choosing between two models of society , two opposing political visions . " sarkozy said bayrou 's policies would lead to chaos like that of france 's fourth republic , when makeshift coalition governments rose and fell repeatedly . " democracy is a majority and an opposition and the french have to choose , " sarkozy told rmc radio . le pen focuses on anti-immigrant , anti-europe platform le pen could prove to be a greater threat to the main candidates than bayrou , though .
the far-right leader is doing better in the race than he was before the 2002 elections .
at that time , he stunned the nation by qualifying for the second round of voting against jacques chirac .
with nearly 17 percent of votes , he beat out socialist candidate lionel jospin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : right-wing leader jean-marie le pen is promoting a " zero immigration " platform the 78-year-old launched his election program in lille over the weekend .
in his fifth and probably last bid for the presidency , le pen vowed to halt immigration and integration with europe , which he said was leading france to disaster . le pen told a convention of his national front party that he would cut off social benefits to immigrants and " restore france 's borders . "
amid cheers and chants of " le pen , president ! " the far-right leader said france was crumbling under poverty , unemployment , the dislocation of factories and " massive immigration . " but french reality has changed over the past five years .
in 2002 , security and crime topped the list of voters concerns .
this had fit well into le pen 's nationalist anti-immigration platform .

but the " third man " françois bayrou could upset the first round of voting on april 22 . the latest polls in france show that conservative presidential candidate nicolas sarkozy and socialist rival ségolène royal are running neck-and-neck .
but outside contenders in the vote could upset a clear outcome . the traditional centrist , pro-european politician françois bayrou and far-right leader jean-marie le pen have also thrown their hats into the ring . voters in france head to the polls on april 22 for a presidential election .
a second round of voting is scheduled for may 6 if none of the candidates win an outright majority . according to the latest survey by lh2 pollsters , sarkozy is slightly ahead in the first round of voting with 30 percent of votes while royal would get 27 percent .
bayrou is credited with 17 percent of votes while le pen is holding 13 percent .
in a runoff , sarkozy and royal could both win 50 percent , the survey said . front-runners turn on " the third man " centrist bayrou - dubbed " the third man " in the french press - has seen a recent surge in his ratings .
during a prime-time television performance on monday night , bayrou promised he would transcend the left-right divide in france .
analysts said this could explain his growing popularity . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : centrist candidate françois bayrou is calling for " a social economy " " the two front-runners , how much support do they have - 25 percent ? "
bayrou said on tf1 television .
" that 's not enough to run the country .
that 's why we are in the state we are in , because there has not been enough backing for reform . " but both royal and sarkozy have criticized his platform . " i think it 's very dangerous , " royal told france inter radio .
" it 's trying to stop the french choosing between two models of society , two opposing political visions . " sarkozy said bayrou 's policies would lead to chaos like that of france 's fourth republic , when makeshift coalition governments rose and fell repeatedly . " democracy is a majority and an opposition and the french have to choose , " sarkozy told rmc radio . le pen focuses on anti-immigrant , anti-europe platform le pen could prove to be a greater threat to the main candidates than bayrou , though .
the far-right leader is doing better in the race than he was before the 2002 elections .
at that time , he stunned the nation by qualifying for the second round of voting against jacques chirac .
with nearly 17 percent of votes , he beat out socialist candidate lionel jospin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : right-wing leader jean-marie le pen is promoting a " zero immigration " platform the 78-year-old launched his election program in lille over the weekend .
in his fifth and probably last bid for the presidency , le pen vowed to halt immigration and integration with europe , which he said was leading france to disaster . le pen told a convention of his national front party that he would cut off social benefits to immigrants and " restore france 's borders . "
amid cheers and chants of " le pen , president ! " the far-right leader said france was crumbling under poverty , unemployment , the dislocation of factories and " massive immigration . " but french reality has changed over the past five years .
in 2002 , security and crime topped the list of voters concerns .
this had fit well into le pen 's nationalist anti-immigration platform .
now , sarkozy has moved into le pen 's traditional law-and-order territory .
voters ' worries have also shifted to jobs and purchasing power , neither of them strong points for le pen . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sparks expected to fly whoever becomes france 's president as the frontrunners in the french presidential race , nicolas sarkozy and segolene royal , make their way to berlin , dw-world.de asks what the election result will mean for germany and the european union in general .

threat of action " no one wants this to happen .
but we are not ruling it out , " said peter scherrer , general secretary of the european metalworkers ' federation .
he said the closing down of entire plants , the one-sided distribution of cuts or the playing-off of different workforces could , for example , trigger industrial action . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the plans have already sparked union protests the broad outlines of the plan were first unveiled in october , sparking union protests .
in february , 20,000 members of the german metalworkers ' union ig metall took part in a day of action . airbus has 16 factories in britain , france , germany and spain , but the main tensions have arisen over job cuts in germany and france .
with presidential elections coming up in france , french politicians are particularly sensitive about domestic job cuts .
this sparked fears in germany that german workers would bear the brunt of the cutbacks .

the case has raised questions about press freedom in germany . germany 's constitutional court in karlsruhe ruled tuesday that police violated the constitution by raiding the offices of the political online magazine cicero , based near berlin . judges said that the 2005 raid was a considerable violation of press freedom . in a 7-1 decision , the karlsruhe judges said the september 2005 search breached the constitition because the journalists themselves were not formally suspected of breaking the law . " searches and seizures against media people as part of a formal inquiry are unconstitutional if they are purely or mainly intended to detect the identity of an informant , " said presiding judge hans-jürgen papier . the court thus ruled in favor of cicero editor-in chief wolfram weimer , who had lodged a constitutional complaint against the search . a state court had ruled that the search , originally conducted under a warrant from a potsdam magistrate , was legal .
police seized disks and made a copy of a journalist 's hard-drive during the raid . national debate on press freedom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former interior minister schily the " cicero affair " gained momentum on sept .
12 , 2005 , when agents from germany ’ s federal criminal police office raided the magazine 's offices . they spent the whole day sifting through files and computer data .
at the end of the day , the german government came away with box-loads of material - and a massive public relations headache . yet the issue had started back in april 2005 .
the magazine ’ s authors published an article about a top al-qaeda leader , abu musab al-zarkawi , who has since been killed during a us air strike in iraq . as author bruno schirra reported his story , he cited information from a classified document which he obtained from a source within the federal criminal police office , or " bka . " former interior minister otto schily believed that was a major breach of security . " the government simply can not accept that documents from its innermost circles are passed on to the public by officers , because that creates dangers for such operations , " schily said . the journalists saw things differently .
cicero editor-in-chief wolfram weimar stood by his reporters ' conduct , and said their objectives are clear . " journalists are neither microphone-holders nor the king ’ s scribes : they are there to bring unpleasant truths to light , whether the powerful like it or not , and otto schily is no exception , " said weimar . in addition , more than 200 bka agents may have had access to the information , which shows that the data was n't highly-secretive , journalists pointed out . rumors also abound that the bka deliberately manipulates data in order to track down leaks . long-winded legal battle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cicero editor-in-chief weimer wants to reveal the truth the ensuing cicero legal battle , at any rate , has lasted almost two years . yet it has been more than an aggressive campaign to uncover a leak inside the bka .
the affair quickly became a high-profile battle of principles , pitching government secrecy against journalistic inquiry . while some officials have defended the cicero raid in the name of state secrets and national security , their arguments have largely fallen on deaf ears with the press , the public and almost every political party on the spectrum , including the social democrats - or " spd , " schily ’ s own party . dieter wiefelspütz , the interior affairs expert for the spd , said that while he understands the need to find leaks within the bka , journalists ' work must also be respected . " if the work of journalists - who deal with confidential information nearly every day - is generally criminalized , then we have a real problem with press freedom in germany , " wiefelspütz said . he added that the bka should perhaps focus on the culprits within its own ranks first , and not turn journalists into culprits . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a distinctly " political " magazine in february 2006 , the potsdam district court ruled that the police search of the cicero offices was lawful schirra 's article contained " secret information relevant to national security . " editor weimar then filed a complaint against the raids with the country 's highest court . echoes from the past for many germans , the cicero affair has raised the specter of the spiegel scandal that began in 1962 .
back then , the weekly newsmagazine der spiegel was accused of treason for an article criticizing the german armed forces . defense minister franz josef strauß had the spiegel offices searched and occupied by police , and spiegel ’ s editor-in-chief , publisher and the author of the article arrested . the scandal ended with strauß ’ s resignation and a victory for press freedom . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german high court reviews press freedom german constitutional judges on wednesday began hearing the complaint of the editor of a magazine , whose offices had been searched by investigators following publication of classified material .

the case has raised questions about press freedom in germany . germany 's constitutional court in karlsruhe ruled tuesday that police violated the constitution by raiding the offices of the political online magazine cicero , based near berlin . judges said that the 2005 raid was a considerable violation of press freedom . in a 7-1 decision , the karlsruhe judges said the september 2005 search breached the constitition because the journalists themselves were not formally suspected of breaking the law . " searches and seizures against media people as part of a formal inquiry are unconstitutional if they are purely or mainly intended to detect the identity of an informant , " said presiding judge hans-jürgen papier . the court thus ruled in favor of cicero editor-in chief wolfram weimer , who had lodged a constitutional complaint against the search . a state court had ruled that the search , originally conducted under a warrant from a potsdam magistrate , was legal .
police seized disks and made a copy of a journalist 's hard-drive during the raid . national debate on press freedom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former interior minister schily the " cicero affair " gained momentum on sept .
12 , 2005 , when agents from germany ’ s federal criminal police office raided the magazine 's offices . they spent the whole day sifting through files and computer data .
at the end of the day , the german government came away with box-loads of material - and a massive public relations headache . yet the issue had started back in april 2005 .
the magazine ’ s authors published an article about a top al-qaeda leader , abu musab al-zarkawi , who has since been killed during a us air strike in iraq . as author bruno schirra reported his story , he cited information from a classified document which he obtained from a source within the federal criminal police office , or " bka . " former interior minister otto schily believed that was a major breach of security . " the government simply can not accept that documents from its innermost circles are passed on to the public by officers , because that creates dangers for such operations , " schily said . the journalists saw things differently .
cicero editor-in-chief wolfram weimar stood by his reporters ' conduct , and said their objectives are clear . " journalists are neither microphone-holders nor the king ’ s scribes : they are there to bring unpleasant truths to light , whether the powerful like it or not , and otto schily is no exception , " said weimar . in addition , more than 200 bka agents may have had access to the information , which shows that the data was n't highly-secretive , journalists pointed out . rumors also abound that the bka deliberately manipulates data in order to track down leaks . long-winded legal battle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cicero editor-in-chief weimer wants to reveal the truth the ensuing cicero legal battle , at any rate , has lasted almost two years . yet it has been more than an aggressive campaign to uncover a leak inside the bka .
the affair quickly became a high-profile battle of principles , pitching government secrecy against journalistic inquiry . while some officials have defended the cicero raid in the name of state secrets and national security , their arguments have largely fallen on deaf ears with the press , the public and almost every political party on the spectrum , including the social democrats - or " spd , " schily ’ s own party . dieter wiefelspütz , the interior affairs expert for the spd , said that while he understands the need to find leaks within the bka , journalists ' work must also be respected . " if the work of journalists - who deal with confidential information nearly every day - is generally criminalized , then we have a real problem with press freedom in germany , " wiefelspütz said . he added that the bka should perhaps focus on the culprits within its own ranks first , and not turn journalists into culprits . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a distinctly " political " magazine in february 2006 , the potsdam district court ruled that the police search of the cicero offices was lawful schirra 's article contained " secret information relevant to national security .

26 of the inflation outlook in the 13 nations sharing the euro , despite risks of upward pressure from germany , europe 's biggest economy . although a recent increase in value added tax in germany from 16 percent to 19 percent has had less of an impact on inflation than originally feared , wage discussions between unions and employers are stirring fresh concerns about price pressures , and especially at the european central bank . " i think that inflation is developing quite well , " said luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker , who chairs regular meetings of euro zone finance ministers . " inflation , as far as the short-term is concerned , does seem under control , " he added . vat hike fears unproven many economists ' concerns the increase in german value added tax in january from 16 percent to 19 percent would nudge inflation higher in the euro zone have so far proven to be unfounded . the european union 's eurostat data agency estimated inflation held steady in january at 1.9 percent and is due to provide a clearer picture on wednesday with final figures , and an estimate for february on thursday . meanwhile , private economists are forecasting that inflation was stable in february at 1.9 percent , which would mark the fourth month in a row that price growth has been right in line with the european central bank 's preferred level of less than , but close to , two percent . the frankfurt-based central bank is widely expected to lift its benchmark interest rate to 3.75 percent at its next monetary-policy meeting on march 8 in order to keep a lid on inflation . productivity must support wage pressure german finance minister peer steinbrueck , whose country currently holds the rotating eu presidency , took a optimistic view of inflation prospects as long as productivity kept up with wage growth . " i do n't see any inflation risks as long as wage policy in europe is based on productivity , " he told reporters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trichet warned of wage hikes causing instability germany 's powerful ig metall labour union said monday it would call for wage increases of 6.5 percent for the 3.4 million workers in the german engineering and metal-working industry in upcoming wage talks next month . earlier monday , european central bank president jean-claude trichet had sounded the alarm about big wage increases , calling for constraint in an interview with german magazine focus . wage restraint crucial to competitive growth " wage moderation is and will remain important not just in germany , but all over europe , " he said . juncker said that the germany was bouncing back in part because constraint on wage increases had made german industry competitive again on the global stage . he said that to remain competitive wage increases would have to remain in line with productivity growth , which would cancel out the impact of higher salaries on inflation . " if wages continue to develop in line with productivity , wage increases will not give rise to any inflationary problems , nor will there be any loss in productivity , " he said . dw staff / afp -lrb- emw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu lifts euro-zone growth forecast on german , italian strength the european commission raised its forecast for euro-zone growth this year to 2.4 percent from 2.1 percent previously as the german and italian economies bounce back more strongly than expected .

dw 's benjamin pargan comments that serbia now has less excuses to hand over war crimes criminals . once again it was a clear " yes-and-no " and " as-well-as " solution by the so-called international community .
the disappointment of the predominantly muslim war victims in bosnia and herzegovina is understandable .
many of them were displaced , tortured , raped by reservists and guerrilla fighters from serbia and montenegro . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benjamin pargan relatives of those muslim bosniaks murdered in the bosnian city of bijeljina , for example , will never understand this verdict .
their family members became victims of special forces and killer commandos from serbia right in the first days of the war - with the blessing of the government in belgrade at the time . the like occurred in several cities in bosnia and herzegovina .
this was repeatedly proven in individual trials at the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia in the hague .
the president of the international court of justice , rosalyn higgins , indirectly confirmed this with her remark that serbia militarily and financially supported bosnian serbs to a considerable degree . where does this significant support give way to direct responsibility for the genocide ?
either this question could not be conclusively clarified or - more likely - the judges at the highest un court did n't have enough courage and endurance to do so , regardless of possible political consequences . nonetheless , the judgment by the international court also has a positive side .
up to now , a large part of the serbian political establishment has repeatedly spoken of a sweeping prejudgment of the serbs .
mostly nationalist-minded powers used these pre-fabricated formulas far too often to dish up stories for their population about alleged forced and unjust collective guilt of the serbs .
when it came to questioning their own role in the war , many serbs accepted these argumentation aids with thanks .
a conviction of serbia would have given such populist pied pipers even more impetus .
it was , after all , the first time that a nation was formally accused of genocide . now , there is one excuse less for the up till now rejection of handing over serb generals accused of war crimes to the tribunal in the hague .
the verdict is a significant step in the direction of individualizing the blame - a demand also often made by serbia . the government in belgrade is more likely to interpret this judgment as a clean bill of health .
the international community and particularly the european union has to now make clear all the more that cooperating with the tribunal in the hague is still the requirement for approaching the transatlantic community .
otherwise , the rather meager efforts of the serbs so far to punish war criminals will peter out even more quickly and silently . benjamin pargan is an editor for dw-radio 's bosnian department -lrb- sac -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : un 's highest court clears serbia of genocide in the first ruling of its kind , the international court of justice monday cleared serbia of direct responsibility for genocide in bosnia , but said belgrade violated international law by failing to prevent the massacre .

the 83 men were intercepted last week by the australian navy , after setting sail from indonesia .
sri lankan officials insist the men need not fear being repatriated .
the authorities in canberra have also been considering whether to send the boat people back to indonesia , or to an off-shore processing camp .
' nothing to fear ' for now , the 83 sri lankan men have been taken to a detention centre on australia 's remote indian ocean territory of christmas island .
what happens to them next is unclear , but the government in canberra is adamant the group will not be allowed onto the australian mainland .
keeping potential asylum seekers well away from the mainland is part of a long-standing policy aimed at deterring boat people .
immigration minister kevin andrews said the men , who are all tamils , would be dealt with under united nations rules .
mr andrews has insisted that they would not be repatriated if there was a danger they would face persecution .
sri lanka 's ambassador to indonesia , major-general janaka perera , has said the 83 boat people would have nothing to fear if they were sent home , and added that he would guarantee their safety .
sending the group back to indonesia does not seem to be an option for the australians .
the authorities in jakarta have indicated that the sri lankans would be deported immediately , regardless of any concerns for their well-being .
but australia does have some room to manoeuvre .
it still maintains camps for asylum seekers in papua new guinea and on the tiny south pacific island of nauru .
they were established in 2001 as part of a tougher border protection regime , and currently hold only a handful of detainees .
critics have insisted that conditions in these off-shore centres have been appalling and have demanded that they be closed down .

" hospice of the valleys saves our local nhs ... around £ 150 , 000 a year , " its chief executive , andy richards , told bbc wales ' week in week out programme .
" now if you extrapolate that to all the hospices in wales , that adds up to millions of pounds .
i think it is a disgrace to be honest with you freda millard " the nhs and the assembly needs to wake up to that and say that this is a service that needs to be properly funded , because we ca n't carry on . "
mr richards added the charitable hospice could not afford maternity cover for its palliative care consultant .
the hospice has identified 300 other terminally ill people in blaenau gwent with diseases other than cancer who they can not help through lack of funds .
freda millard , from ebbw vale , was helped by the hospice to care for her husband stuart at home until he died of lung cancer .
' failing ' " they provide such an essential service to a community to people , in a very vulnerable position , to think that they have got to rely on just the charity of others and not be funded from the national health service .
" i think it is a disgrace to be honest with you , " ms millard added .
another hospice which helps families across mid and north wales , is warning that outreach services for terminally ill children will have to be cut because of a funding shortfall of £ 128,000 a year .
david featherstone , chief executive of hope house in oswestry said : " we can only work so hard at fundraising ... and unless we can secure core-funding to make sure that we can go on delivering this service .

hospices in wales are concerned about long-term funding " everybody has budgetary commitments , but they are failing in their duty to terminally ill children in wales . "
in december , the charity help the hospices said the welsh assembly government funding commitments were not enough to solve long-term financial issues .
it said that the 12 charitable hospices in wales received only 15 % state funding on average , compared with 40 % in scotland in england , the government has said it hoped to provide half hospices ' core funding by 2008 .
in a statement dr gibbons told week in week out that local health boards needed to develop sustainable funding for palliative care .
but his department for the first time , will provide £ 2m in core funding each year .
" we recognise that those hospices providing high quality palliative care in order to help meet identified patient need will benefit from the security of long term sustainable funding arrangements , " the statement said .

the hospice of the valleys in tredegar , blaenau gwent which provides palliative care said it would have to cut services unless it was " properly funded " .
hope hospice serving north and mid wales also said it faced a shortfall .
but health minister , dr brian gibbons , has promised to provide £ 2m core funding annually for the 12 charitable hospices in wales .
" hospice of the valleys saves our local nhs ... around £ 150 , 000 a year , " its chief executive , andy richards , told bbc wales ' week in week out programme .
" now if you extrapolate that to all the hospices in wales , that adds up to millions of pounds .
i think it is a disgrace to be honest with you freda millard " the nhs and the assembly needs to wake up to that and say that this is a service that needs to be properly funded , because we ca n't carry on . "
mr richards added the charitable hospice could not afford maternity cover for its palliative care consultant .
the hospice has identified 300 other terminally ill people in blaenau gwent with diseases other than cancer who they can not help through lack of funds .
freda millard , from ebbw vale , was helped by the hospice to care for her husband stuart at home until he died of lung cancer .
' failing ' " they provide such an essential service to a community to people , in a very vulnerable position , to think that they have got to rely on just the charity of others and not be funded from the national health service .
" i think it is a disgrace to be honest with you , " ms millard added .
another hospice which helps families across mid and north wales , is warning that outreach services for terminally ill children will have to be cut because of a funding shortfall of £ 128,000 a year .
david featherstone , chief executive of hope house in oswestry said : " we can only work so hard at fundraising ... and unless we can secure core-funding to make sure that we can go on delivering this service .
" we think morally that the welsh assembly government should look very carefully at providing the money to do that .
hospices in wales are concerned about long-term funding " everybody has budgetary commitments , but they are failing in their duty to terminally ill children in wales . "
in december , the charity help the hospices said the welsh assembly government funding commitments were not enough to solve long-term financial issues .
it said that the 12 charitable hospices in wales received only 15 % state funding on average , compared with 40 % in scotland in england , the government has said it hoped to provide half hospices ' core funding by 2008 .
in a statement dr gibbons told week in week out that local health boards needed to develop sustainable funding for palliative care .
but his department for the first time , will provide £ 2m in core funding each year .
" we recognise that those hospices providing high quality palliative care in order to help meet identified patient need will benefit from the security of long term sustainable funding arrangements , " the statement said .

as the us house of representatives prepares to vote on recognising the 1915 massacres as genocide , journalist and historian bruce clark looks at how and why turkish attitudes have changed over the past 90 years .
wegner recorded scenes of refugee life such as a funeral rite in a camp " the more foreign parliaments insist that our forebears committed crimes against humanity , the less likely anybody in turkey is to face up to the hardest moments in history . "
that , roughly speaking , is the message being delivered by turkey 's hard-pressed intelligentsia as the legislators in one country after another vote for resolutions which insist that the killing of hundreds of thousands of ottoman armenians in 1915 amounted to genocide .
" will the adoption -lsb- of a resolution -rsb- help to inform the turkish public ... on the great tragedy which befell the ottoman armenians ?
" no , it can hardly be expected to ... broaden the debate on the history of the ottoman empire 's final period . "
so writes sahin alpay , a liberal-minded turkish academic , in a recent column in zaman newspaper .
what such appeals reflect , of course , is an elementary fact of human psychology : the phenomenon of individual and collective defensiveness .
when people feel completely secure , and among friends , they can be very frank about misdeeds which they , or people close to them , have committed .
but hackles will go up again as soon as they become insecure , because they feel their accusers are acting in bad faith , or that accepting their accusations will have bad consequences .
on the defensive in recent years , liberal turkish scholars have expressed the hope that membership , or even prospective membership of the european union , will give the country enough confidence to discuss the armenian tragedy without threatening those who use the " g-word " with prosecution .
sceptics may retort that in recent years , things have been moving in the opposite direction : the revised turkish penal code and its preamble , adopted in 2005 , make even more explicit the principle that people may be prosecuted if they " insult turkishness " - a crime which , as the preamble makes clear , includes the assertion that the ottoman armenians suffered genocide .
it is certainly true that turkish defensiveness - the sort of defensiveness which can treat open discussion as verging on treachery - has been running high since the 1960s when the armenians round the world began lobbying for an explicit acceptance , by governments and parliaments , that their people suffered genocide in 1915 .
a campaign of violence launched by armenian militants in the 1970s , who mainly attacked turkish diplomatic targets and claimed over 50 lives , raised hackles even higher .
all that raises a question : has there ever been a moment , since the events of 1915 , when the turkish authorities might , conceivably , have acknowledged or even freely discussed the view that almost every armenian regards as self-evident : the view that in addition to relocating the entire ethnic armenian population of eastern anatolia , the " committee of union and progress " -lrb- cup -rrb- which wielded effective power in the ottoman empire also gave secret orders to make sure that as few as possible of the deportees survived the experience ?
in fact , there was such a moment : the immediate aftermath of world war i. tried and executed at that time the ottoman government was intact but dependent for its survival on the good graces of the victorious british empire .
the sultan 's regime was desperately trying to distance itself from the actions of the cup , the " state within a state " which in 1915 had masterminded the deportation of hundreds of thousands of armenians - and is alleged to have given secret " extermination " orders at the same time .
during the early months of 1919 , few people in anatolia publicly doubted that armenians had suffered atrocities that were egregious even by the standards of a terrible war .
the sultan and his foreign minister were at pains to reassure the british of their determination to punish the perpetrators of these atrocities , and they held four big and revealing trials whose proceedings were published in the government gazette .
in april 1919 a local governor , mehmed kemal , was found guilty and hanged for the mass killing of armenians in the ankara district .
but the climate shifted rapidly after may 1919 , when greek troops were authorised by the victorious entente powers to occupy the aegean port of izmir and , in another part of anatolia , mustafa kemal - later known as ataturk - began his campaign to make the turks masters in their own land .
nationalist feeling turkish rage over the greek landing lent fuel to the kemalist cause , and discredited the ottoman government .
with every passing month , the british government 's leverage over the ottoman authorities waned , and so did british enthusiasm for the conduct of war crimes trials .
in 1921 , the british government made a pragmatic deal to release a group of turkish prisoners it had been holding in malta on suspicion -lrb- among other things -rrb- of crimes against the armenians .
they were freed in exchange for britons being held by the turks .
in turkish lore , this release is held up as proof that no serious evidence against the captives existed .
what it certainly proves is that british zeal for investigating the past was waning , even as the kemalist cause gained strength and the british-influenced ottoman regime faded into oblivion .
in any case , the officially cherished version of the turkish state 's beginnings now insists since the empire 's british adversaries and occupiers were the main promoters of war crimes trials , those trials themselves must have been worthless or malicious .
a new state but in the midst of all this nationalist discourse , something rather important is often obscured , and there are just a few turkish historians who dare to point this out .
the atrocities against the armenians were committed by an ottoman government , albeit a shadowy sub-section of that government .
there is no logical reason why a new republican administration , established in october 1923 in an act of revolutionary defiance of ottoman power , should consider itself responsible for things done under the previous regime .
in fact , when the nationalist movement was founded in 1919 , the climate of revulsion over the sufferings of the armenians was so general that even the neo-nationalists were keen to distinguish themselves from the cup .
some see significance in the fact that the nationalist movement chose to rally round an army officer , mustafa kemal , who had never been anywhere near the places where the armenians met their fate .
the very fact that the turkish republic bears no formal responsibility for eliminating the armenian presence in eastern anatolia -lrb- for the simple reason that the republic did not exist when the atrocities occurred -rrb- has given some turkish historians a flicker of hope : one day , the leaders of the republic will be able to face up to history 's toughest questions about the armenians , without feeling that to do so would undermine the very existence of their state .
fatma muge gocek , a turkish-born sociologist who now works as professor in america , has said there are - or will be - three phases in her country 's attitude to the fate of the armenians : a spirit of " investigation " in the final ottoman years , a spirit of defensiveness under the turkish republic , and a new , post-nationalist attitude to history that will prevail if and when turkey secures a places in europe .
that makes perfect psychological sense , even if the immediate prospects for a move from phase two to phase three do not look very bright .

as the us house of representatives prepares to vote on recognising the 1915 massacres as genocide , journalist and historian bruce clark looks at how and why turkish attitudes have changed over the past 90 years .
wegner recorded scenes of refugee life such as a funeral rite in a camp " the more foreign parliaments insist that our forebears committed crimes against humanity , the less likely anybody in turkey is to face up to the hardest moments in history . "
that , roughly speaking , is the message being delivered by turkey 's hard-pressed intelligentsia as the legislators in one country after another vote for resolutions which insist that the killing of hundreds of thousands of ottoman armenians in 1915 amounted to genocide .
" will the adoption -lsb- of a resolution -rsb- help to inform the turkish public ... on the great tragedy which befell the ottoman armenians ?
" no , it can hardly be expected to ... broaden the debate on the history of the ottoman empire 's final period . "
so writes sahin alpay , a liberal-minded turkish academic , in a recent column in zaman newspaper .
what such appeals reflect , of course , is an elementary fact of human psychology : the phenomenon of individual and collective defensiveness .
when people feel completely secure , and among friends , they can be very frank about misdeeds which they , or people close to them , have committed .
but hackles will go up again as soon as they become insecure , because they feel their accusers are acting in bad faith , or that accepting their accusations will have bad consequences .
on the defensive in recent years , liberal turkish scholars have expressed the hope that membership , or even prospective membership of the european union , will give the country enough confidence to discuss the armenian tragedy without threatening those who use the " g-word " with prosecution .
sceptics may retort that in recent years , things have been moving in the opposite direction : the revised turkish penal code and its preamble , adopted in 2005 , make even more explicit the principle that people may be prosecuted if they " insult turkishness " - a crime which , as the preamble makes clear , includes the assertion that the ottoman armenians suffered genocide .
it is certainly true that turkish defensiveness - the sort of defensiveness which can treat open discussion as verging on treachery - has been running high since the 1960s when the armenians round the world began lobbying for an explicit acceptance , by governments and parliaments , that their people suffered genocide in 1915 .
a campaign of violence launched by armenian militants in the 1970s , who mainly attacked turkish diplomatic targets and claimed over 50 lives , raised hackles even higher .
all that raises a question : has there ever been a moment , since the events of 1915 , when the turkish authorities might , conceivably , have acknowledged or even freely discussed the view that almost every armenian regards as self-evident : the view that in addition to relocating the entire ethnic armenian population of eastern anatolia , the " committee of union and progress " -lrb- cup -rrb- which wielded effective power in the ottoman empire also gave secret orders to make sure that as few as possible of the deportees survived the experience ?
in fact , there was such a moment : the immediate aftermath of world war i. tried and executed at that time the ottoman government was intact but dependent for its survival on the good graces of the victorious british empire .
the sultan 's regime was desperately trying to distance itself from the actions of the cup , the " state within a state " which in 1915 had masterminded the deportation of hundreds of thousands of armenians - and is alleged to have given secret " extermination " orders at the same time .
during the early months of 1919 , few people in anatolia publicly doubted that armenians had suffered atrocities that were egregious even by the standards of a terrible war .
the sultan and his foreign minister were at pains to reassure the british of their determination to punish the perpetrators of these atrocities , and they held four big and revealing trials whose proceedings were published in the government gazette .
in april 1919 a local governor , mehmed kemal , was found guilty and hanged for the mass killing of armenians in the ankara district .
but the climate shifted rapidly after may 1919 , when greek troops were authorised by the victorious entente powers to occupy the aegean port of izmir and , in another part of anatolia , mustafa kemal - later known as ataturk - began his campaign to make the turks masters in their own land .
nationalist feeling turkish rage over the greek landing lent fuel to the kemalist cause , and discredited the ottoman government .
with every passing month , the british government 's leverage over the ottoman authorities waned , and so did british enthusiasm for the conduct of war crimes trials .

sceptics may retort that in recent years , things have been moving in the opposite direction : the revised turkish penal code and its preamble , adopted in 2005 , make even more explicit the principle that people may be prosecuted if they " insult turkishness " - a crime which , as the preamble makes clear , includes the assertion that the ottoman armenians suffered genocide .
it is certainly true that turkish defensiveness - the sort of defensiveness which can treat open discussion as verging on treachery - has been running high since the 1960s when the armenians round the world began lobbying for an explicit acceptance , by governments and parliaments , that their people suffered genocide in 1915 .
a campaign of violence launched by armenian militants in the 1970s , who mainly attacked turkish diplomatic targets and claimed over 50 lives , raised hackles even higher .
all that raises a question : has there ever been a moment , since the events of 1915 , when the turkish authorities might , conceivably , have acknowledged or even freely discussed the view that almost every armenian regards as self-evident : the view that in addition to relocating the entire ethnic armenian population of eastern anatolia , the " committee of union and progress " -lrb- cup -rrb- which wielded effective power in the ottoman empire also gave secret orders to make sure that as few as possible of the deportees survived the experience ?
in fact , there was such a moment : the immediate aftermath of world war i. tried and executed at that time the ottoman government was intact but dependent for its survival on the good graces of the victorious british empire .
the sultan 's regime was desperately trying to distance itself from the actions of the cup , the " state within a state " which in 1915 had masterminded the deportation of hundreds of thousands of armenians - and is alleged to have given secret " extermination " orders at the same time .
during the early months of 1919 , few people in anatolia publicly doubted that armenians had suffered atrocities that were egregious even by the standards of a terrible war .
the sultan and his foreign minister were at pains to reassure the british of their determination to punish the perpetrators of these atrocities , and they held four big and revealing trials whose proceedings were published in the government gazette .
in april 1919 a local governor , mehmed kemal , was found guilty and hanged for the mass killing of armenians in the ankara district .
but the climate shifted rapidly after may 1919 , when greek troops were authorised by the victorious entente powers to occupy the aegean port of izmir and , in another part of anatolia , mustafa kemal - later known as ataturk - began his campaign to make the turks masters in their own land .
nationalist feeling turkish rage over the greek landing lent fuel to the kemalist cause , and discredited the ottoman government .
with every passing month , the british government 's leverage over the ottoman authorities waned , and so did british enthusiasm for the conduct of war crimes trials .
in 1921 , the british government made a pragmatic deal to release a group of turkish prisoners it had been holding in malta on suspicion -lrb- among other things -rrb- of crimes against the armenians .
they were freed in exchange for britons being held by the turks .
in turkish lore , this release is held up as proof that no serious evidence against the captives existed .
what it certainly proves is that british zeal for investigating the past was waning , even as the kemalist cause gained strength and the british-influenced ottoman regime faded into oblivion .
in any case , the officially cherished version of the turkish state 's beginnings now insists since the empire 's british adversaries and occupiers were the main promoters of war crimes trials , those trials themselves must have been worthless or malicious .
a new state but in the midst of all this nationalist discourse , something rather important is often obscured , and there are just a few turkish historians who dare to point this out .
the atrocities against the armenians were committed by an ottoman government , albeit a shadowy sub-section of that government .
there is no logical reason why a new republican administration , established in october 1923 in an act of revolutionary defiance of ottoman power , should consider itself responsible for things done under the previous regime .
in fact , when the nationalist movement was founded in 1919 , the climate of revulsion over the sufferings of the armenians was so general that even the neo-nationalists were keen to distinguish themselves from the cup .
some see significance in the fact that the nationalist movement chose to rally round an army officer , mustafa kemal , who had never been anywhere near the places where the armenians met their fate .
the very fact that the turkish republic bears no formal responsibility for eliminating the armenian presence in eastern anatolia -lrb- for the simple reason that the republic did not exist when the atrocities occurred -rrb- has given some turkish historians a flicker of hope : one day , the leaders of the republic will be able to face up to history 's toughest questions about the armenians , without feeling that to do so would undermine the very existence of their state .
fatma muge gocek , a turkish-born sociologist who now works as professor in america , has said there are - or will be - three phases in her country 's attitude to the fate of the armenians : a spirit of " investigation " in the final ottoman years , a spirit of defensiveness under the turkish republic , and a new , post-nationalist attitude to history that will prevail if and when turkey secures a places in europe .
that makes perfect psychological sense , even if the immediate prospects for a move from phase two to phase three do not look very bright .

as the us house of representatives prepares to vote on recognising the 1915 massacres as genocide , journalist and historian bruce clark looks at how and why turkish attitudes have changed over the past 90 years .
" the more foreign parliaments insist that our forebears committed crimes against humanity , the less likely anybody in turkey is to face up to the hardest moments in history . "
that , roughly speaking , is the message being delivered by turkey 's hard-pressed intelligentsia as the legislators in one country after another vote for resolutions which insist that the killing of hundreds of thousands of ottoman armenians in 1915 amounted to genocide .
" will the adoption -lsb- of a resolution -rsb- help to inform the turkish public ... on the great tragedy which befell the ottoman armenians ?
" no , it can hardly be expected to ... broaden the debate on the history of the ottoman empire 's final period . "
so writes sahin alpay , a liberal-minded turkish academic , in a recent column in zaman newspaper .
what such appeals reflect , of course , is an elementary fact of human psychology : the phenomenon of individual and collective defensiveness .
when people feel completely secure , and among friends , they can be very frank about misdeeds which they , or people close to them , have committed .
but hackles will go up again as soon as they become insecure , because they feel their accusers are acting in bad faith , or that accepting their accusations will have bad consequences .
on the defensive in recent years , liberal turkish scholars have expressed the hope that membership , or even prospective membership of the european union , will give the country enough confidence to discuss the armenian tragedy without threatening those who use the " g-word " with prosecution .
sceptics may retort that in recent years , things have been moving in the opposite direction : the revised turkish penal code and its preamble , adopted in 2005 , make even more explicit the principle that people may be prosecuted if they " insult turkishness " - a crime which , as the preamble makes clear , includes the assertion that the ottoman armenians suffered genocide .

there has been a belief that garlic could help , supported by positive lab and animal studies .
but a comparison of raw garlic and two garlic supplements in archives of internal medicine found none of the three had any effect .
british experts said a healthy diet combined with plenty of exercise was the best way to prevent heart disease . "
there were no statistically significant effects " stanford university researchers garlic has been used for thousands of years in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases - the first recorded use was in ancient egypt 3,500 years ago .
recently allicin , a compound in garlic has been shown to prevent the formation of cholesterol in over 90 animal studies and , in the early 1990s , studies in humans also suggested there could be benefits .
but the studies were poorly designed , and did not provide conclusive proof .
even so , garlic supplements are often promoted as cholesterol-lowering agents , the researchers carrying out this latest study say .
bad breath they monitored 170 people aged 30 to 65 who had moderately high ldl -lrb- bad -rrb- cholesterol levels for six months .
they were divided into four groups .
one was asked to eat a four-gram clove of garlic each day , the second were given a powdered garlic supplement , the third had aged garlic extract - which has been treated in alcohol for up to two years - while the fourth group had a dummy supplement .
all were advised to avoid foods known to contain garlic and to cut their intake of onions and chives , which are known to contain some of the same chemical compounds found in garlic .
blood cholesterol levels were assessed each month .
writing in archives of internal medicine , the researchers led by dr christopher gardner , said the findings had contradicted their expectations that garlic , particularly in its raw form , would be effective in lowering cholesterol .
they said : " there were no statistically significant effects of the three forms of garlic on ldl cholesterol concentrations . "
no serious side effects were seen - although half of those in the raw garlic group -lrb- 28 people -rrb- reported body odour and bad breath .
balanced diet however , the researchers say the results of this study should not be applied to everyone .
" garlic might lower ldl in specific subpopulations , such as those with higher ldl concentrations , or may have other beneficial health effects . "
judy o 'sullivan , of the british heart foundation , said : " this small study shows that eating raw cloves of garlic or taking garlic supplements has no benefit for the heart .
" however , eating garlic as part of a balanced diet will help to add variety and flavour , and it is a healthier alternative to salt , for example . "
she added : " in order to reduce your risk of developing coronary heart disease , it 's best to eat a diet rich in fruit and vegetables and low in fat , especially saturated fat , and keep physically active . "

there has been a belief that garlic could help , supported by positive lab and animal studies .

british experts said a healthy diet combined with plenty of exercise was the best way to prevent heart disease .

one was asked to eat a four-gram clove of garlic each day , the second were given a powdered garlic supplement , the third had aged garlic extract - which has been treated in alcohol for up to two years - while the fourth group had a dummy supplement .
all were advised to avoid foods known to contain garlic and to cut their intake of onions and chives , which are known to contain some of the same chemical compounds found in garlic .
blood cholesterol levels were assessed each month .
writing in archives of internal medicine , the researchers led by dr christopher gardner , said the findings had contradicted their expectations that garlic , particularly in its raw form , would be effective in lowering cholesterol .
they said : " there were no statistically significant effects of the three forms of garlic on ldl cholesterol concentrations . "
no serious side effects were seen - although half of those in the raw garlic group -lrb- 28 people -rrb- reported body odour and bad breath .
balanced diet however , the researchers say the results of this study should not be applied to everyone .
" garlic might lower ldl in specific subpopulations , such as those with higher ldl concentrations , or may have other beneficial health effects . "

announcing sony 's plans to enter the portable gaming market , he claimed the playstation portable -lrb- psp -rrb- would become " the walkman for the 21st century " .
at that time conventional wisdom dictated that any attempt to break into the handheld market , dominated for so long by nintendo , was doomed to failure .
to suggest that sony 's console would not only make an impact on the market , but also match the success of the 1980s cultural icon that was the walkman seemed to argue a self-confidence bordering on arrogance .
after all , sony shipped more than 50m walkman units in the first ten years of production , reaching a total of 150m units produced by 1995 .
the name walkman has even joined that select group of brands like hoover and xerox whose name defines the product .
so four years down the line has the psp lived up to " papa " kutaragi 's prediction ?
has it succeeded in breaking nintendo 's apparently unshakeable hold on the market ?
market domination since its release the psp has seen steady growth with global shipments increasing from just over half a million units in 2004 to a total of 24.7m units by the end of 2006 .
impressive figures , but still not enough to reverse nintendo 's market dominance .
nintendo has shipped more than 35m units of the ds and ds lite consoles worldwide since launching in 2004 , smashing european records for console sales on the way .
psp and ds specifications sony psp features : mp3 and video playback , web browser processor : 333mhz mips r4200 memory : 32 mb connectivity : 100ft -lrb- 30metres -rrb- local range , wi-fi nintendo ds features : touch screen , embedded chat software processor : one arm9 and one arm7 memory : 4mb connectivity : 100ft -lrb- 30metres -rrb- local range , wi-fi so why has the mighty psp failed to overtake its less powerful rival ?
margaret robertson , editor of edge gaming magazine , believes that one factor could be that the sheer power and versatility of the psp caused more confusion than sony expected when it first launched .
" sony thought it was a straightforward and compelling offer of a gadget that can do music , videos , films and gaming , " she says .
" but the problem with that is that consumers either fell into a category where they did n't really want all of that or they were technologically savvy enough to have commitments to other mediums , particularly memory formats . "
sony was not alone in finding the early market reluctant to embrace a new console ; nintendo also had problems when it first unveiled the ds .
" it was n't a great-looking gadget , " said ms robertson .
" in the west nobody was quite sure what the ds was trading on for its first year .
it did n't seem to be trading on that nintendo nostalgia feeling for the core fans . "
shock of the new consumers familiar with nintendo 's classic games were initially wary of the new and unknown aspects of the ds : the touch-screen game-play , the unconventional games .
but in the last two years prices have fallen and gamers have adapted to new concepts .
games like nintendogs have boosted sales of the ds console ds owners in particular have embraced new genres of games that seemed unlikely to succeed when they first appeared .
the popularity of nintendo 's so-called touch !
generations games such as dr kawashima 's brain training and nintendogs are cited by nintendo 's european marketing director laurent fischer as the major factor in driving console sales .
paul jackson , director general of the uk 's entertainment and leisure software publishers ' association -lrb- elspa -rrb- , suggests that the wide appeal of handheld games on all platforms has broadened the gaming demographic , making handheld consoles the uk 's biggest selling hardware systems of 2006 .
" many people who would perhaps not have considered gaming have got involved , " says mr jackson .
" and many people who are passionate have been able to change the way they game within a more social context . "
psp games are also overcoming initial difficulties .
while early psp titles may have once been viewed by some as the poor relations of successful play station 2 -lrb- ps2 -rrb- franchises more recent releases such as gta : liberty city stories have been strong enough to cross back over to ps2 .
more than a game so where next for portable devices ?
sony 's vision for the psp is based on connectivity and integration with the playstation 3 -lrb- ps3 -rrb- .
sony computer entertainment europe spokesman jonathan fargher says the psp will come into its own when connected wirelessly to the ps3 .
some commentators criticised the nintendo ds 's looks the remote play functionality in psp and ps3 currently allows the psp user to wirelessly access pictures , videos and audio content stored on the ps3 up to a range of around 25-30 metres .
but sony has big plans for connecting its devices .
" we 're hoping to incorporate that functionality in the very near future - from a local level at the moment to a global level probably within the next six months , " said mr fargher .
the idea is to use the psp to access the ps3 at home from anywhere in the world with a wireless hotspot .
" if i have my mp3 walkman or my ipod , or digital camera connected to ps3 then i can access those devices too , " said mr fargher .
with a psp camera and gps device in the pipeline , ken kutaragi must be a proud father , but has his prediction that the psp would become the walkman of the 21st century come true ?
apple 's steve jobs might have something to say about that .
the ipod has shipped more than 88m units since 2002 , with 21m of those manufactured in the first fiscal quarter of 2007 alone .
it looks like the psp still has some way to go if it is to live up to mr kutaragi 's promise .

to suggest that sony 's console would not only make an impact on the market , but also match the success of the 1980s cultural icon that was the walkman seemed to argue a self-confidence bordering on arrogance .
after all , sony shipped more than 50m walkman units in the first ten years of production , reaching a total of 150m units produced by 1995 .
the name walkman has even joined that select group of brands like hoover and xerox whose name defines the product .
so four years down the line has the psp lived up to " papa " kutaragi 's prediction ?
has it succeeded in breaking nintendo 's apparently unshakeable hold on the market ?
market domination since its release the psp has seen steady growth with global shipments increasing from just over half a million units in 2004 to a total of 24.7m units by the end of 2006 .
impressive figures , but still not enough to reverse nintendo 's market dominance .
nintendo has shipped more than 35m units of the ds and ds lite consoles worldwide since launching in 2004 , smashing european records for console sales on the way .
psp and ds specifications sony psp features : mp3 and video playback , web browser processor : 333mhz mips r4200 memory : 32 mb connectivity : 100ft -lrb- 30metres -rrb- local range , wi-fi nintendo ds features : touch screen , embedded chat software processor : one arm9 and one arm7 memory : 4mb connectivity : 100ft -lrb- 30metres -rrb- local range , wi-fi so why has the mighty psp failed to overtake its less powerful rival ?
margaret robertson , editor of edge gaming magazine , believes that one factor could be that the sheer power and versatility of the psp caused more confusion than sony expected when it first launched .
" sony thought it was a straightforward and compelling offer of a gadget that can do music , videos , films and gaming , " she says .
" but the problem with that is that consumers either fell into a category where they did n't really want all of that or they were technologically savvy enough to have commitments to other mediums , particularly memory formats . "
sony was not alone in finding the early market reluctant to embrace a new console ; nintendo also had problems when it first unveiled the ds .
" it was n't a great-looking gadget , " said ms robertson .
" in the west nobody was quite sure what the ds was trading on for its first year .
it did n't seem to be trading on that nintendo nostalgia feeling for the core fans . "
shock of the new consumers familiar with nintendo 's classic games were initially wary of the new and unknown aspects of the ds : the touch-screen game-play , the unconventional games .
but in the last two years prices have fallen and gamers have adapted to new concepts .
games like nintendogs have boosted sales of the ds console ds owners in particular have embraced new genres of games that seemed unlikely to succeed when they first appeared .
the popularity of nintendo 's so-called touch !
generations games such as dr kawashima 's brain training and nintendogs are cited by nintendo 's european marketing director laurent fischer as the major factor in driving console sales .
paul jackson , director general of the uk 's entertainment and leisure software publishers ' association -lrb- elspa -rrb- , suggests that the wide appeal of handheld games on all platforms has broadened the gaming demographic , making handheld consoles the uk 's biggest selling hardware systems of 2006 .
" many people who would perhaps not have considered gaming have got involved , " says mr jackson .
" and many people who are passionate have been able to change the way they game within a more social context . "
psp games are also overcoming initial difficulties .
while early psp titles may have once been viewed by some as the poor relations of successful play station 2 -lrb- ps2 -rrb- franchises more recent releases such as gta : liberty city stories have been strong enough to cross back over to ps2 .
more than a game so where next for portable devices ?
sony 's vision for the psp is based on connectivity and integration with the playstation 3 -lrb- ps3 -rrb- .
sony computer entertainment europe spokesman jonathan fargher says the psp will come into its own when connected wirelessly to the ps3 .
some commentators criticised the nintendo ds 's looks the remote play functionality in psp and ps3 currently allows the psp user to wirelessly access pictures , videos and audio content stored on the ps3 up to a range of around 25-30 metres .
but sony has big plans for connecting its devices .
" we 're hoping to incorporate that functionality in the very near future - from a local level at the moment to a global level probably within the next six months , " said mr fargher .
the idea is to use the psp to access the ps3 at home from anywhere in the world with a wireless hotspot .
" if i have my mp3 walkman or my ipod , or digital camera connected to ps3 then i can access those devices too , " said mr fargher .
with a psp camera and gps device in the pipeline , ken kutaragi must be a proud father , but has his prediction that the psp would become the walkman of the 21st century come true ?
apple 's steve jobs might have something to say about that .
the ipod has shipped more than 88m units since 2002 , with 21m of those manufactured in the first fiscal quarter of 2007 alone .
it looks like the psp still has some way to go if it is to live up to mr kutaragi 's promise .

nintendo has shipped more than 35m units of the ds and ds lite consoles worldwide since launching in 2004 , smashing european records for console sales on the way .
psp and ds specifications sony psp features : mp3 and video playback , web browser processor : 333mhz mips r4200 memory : 32 mb connectivity : 100ft -lrb- 30metres -rrb- local range , wi-fi nintendo ds features : touch screen , embedded chat software processor : one arm9 and one arm7 memory : 4mb connectivity : 100ft -lrb- 30metres -rrb- local range , wi-fi so why has the mighty psp failed to overtake its less powerful rival ?
margaret robertson , editor of edge gaming magazine , believes that one factor could be that the sheer power and versatility of the psp caused more confusion than sony expected when it first launched .
" sony thought it was a straightforward and compelling offer of a gadget that can do music , videos , films and gaming , " she says .
" but the problem with that is that consumers either fell into a category where they did n't really want all of that or they were technologically savvy enough to have commitments to other mediums , particularly memory formats . "
sony was not alone in finding the early market reluctant to embrace a new console ; nintendo also had problems when it first unveiled the ds .
" it was n't a great-looking gadget , " said ms robertson .
" in the west nobody was quite sure what the ds was trading on for its first year .
it did n't seem to be trading on that nintendo nostalgia feeling for the core fans . "
shock of the new consumers familiar with nintendo 's classic games were initially wary of the new and unknown aspects of the ds : the touch-screen game-play , the unconventional games .
but in the last two years prices have fallen and gamers have adapted to new concepts .
games like nintendogs have boosted sales of the ds console ds owners in particular have embraced new genres of games that seemed unlikely to succeed when they first appeared .
the popularity of nintendo 's so-called touch !
generations games such as dr kawashima 's brain training and nintendogs are cited by nintendo 's european marketing director laurent fischer as the major factor in driving console sales .
paul jackson , director general of the uk 's entertainment and leisure software publishers ' association -lrb- elspa -rrb- , suggests that the wide appeal of handheld games on all platforms has broadened the gaming demographic , making handheld consoles the uk 's biggest selling hardware systems of 2006 .
" many people who would perhaps not have considered gaming have got involved , " says mr jackson .
" and many people who are passionate have been able to change the way they game within a more social context . "
psp games are also overcoming initial difficulties .
while early psp titles may have once been viewed by some as the poor relations of successful play station 2 -lrb- ps2 -rrb- franchises more recent releases such as gta : liberty city stories have been strong enough to cross back over to ps2 .
more than a game so where next for portable devices ?
sony 's vision for the psp is based on connectivity and integration with the playstation 3 -lrb- ps3 -rrb- .
sony computer entertainment europe spokesman jonathan fargher says the psp will come into its own when connected wirelessly to the ps3 .
some commentators criticised the nintendo ds 's looks the remote play functionality in psp and ps3 currently allows the psp user to wirelessly access pictures , videos and audio content stored on the ps3 up to a range of around 25-30 metres .
but sony has big plans for connecting its devices .
" we 're hoping to incorporate that functionality in the very near future - from a local level at the moment to a global level probably within the next six months , " said mr fargher .
the idea is to use the psp to access the ps3 at home from anywhere in the world with a wireless hotspot .
" if i have my mp3 walkman or my ipod , or digital camera connected to ps3 then i can access those devices too , " said mr fargher .
with a psp camera and gps device in the pipeline , ken kutaragi must be a proud father , but has his prediction that the psp would become the walkman of the 21st century come true ?
apple 's steve jobs might have something to say about that .
the ipod has shipped more than 88m units since 2002 , with 21m of those manufactured in the first fiscal quarter of 2007 alone .
it looks like the psp still has some way to go if it is to live up to mr kutaragi 's promise .

" sony thought it was a straightforward and compelling offer of a gadget that can do music , videos , films and gaming , " she says .
" but the problem with that is that consumers either fell into a category where they did n't really want all of that or they were technologically savvy enough to have commitments to other mediums , particularly memory formats . "
sony was not alone in finding the early market reluctant to embrace a new console ; nintendo also had problems when it first unveiled the ds .
" it was n't a great-looking gadget , " said ms robertson .
" in the west nobody was quite sure what the ds was trading on for its first year .
it did n't seem to be trading on that nintendo nostalgia feeling for the core fans . "
shock of the new consumers familiar with nintendo 's classic games were initially wary of the new and unknown aspects of the ds : the touch-screen game-play , the unconventional games .
but in the last two years prices have fallen and gamers have adapted to new concepts .
ds owners in particular have embraced new genres of games that seemed unlikely to succeed when they first appeared .
the popularity of nintendo 's so-called touch !
generations games such as dr kawashima 's brain training and nintendogs are cited by nintendo 's european marketing director laurent fischer as the major factor in driving console sales .
paul jackson , director general of the uk 's entertainment and leisure software publishers ' association -lrb- elspa -rrb- , suggests that the wide appeal of handheld games on all platforms has broadened the gaming demographic , making handheld consoles the uk 's biggest selling hardware systems of 2006 .
" many people who would perhaps not have considered gaming have got involved , " says mr jackson .
" and many people who are passionate have been able to change the way they game within a more social context . "
psp games are also overcoming initial difficulties .
while early psp titles may have once been viewed by some as the poor relations of successful play station 2 -lrb- ps2 -rrb- franchises more recent releases such as gta : liberty city stories have been strong enough to cross back over to ps2 .
more than a game so where next for portable devices ?
sony 's vision for the psp is based on connectivity and integration with the playstation 3 -lrb- ps3 -rrb- .
sony computer entertainment europe spokesman jonathan fargher says the psp will come into its own when connected wirelessly to the ps3 .
the remote play functionality in psp and ps3 currently allows the psp user to wirelessly access pictures , videos and audio content stored on the ps3 up to a range of around 25-30 metres .
but sony has big plans for connecting its devices .
" we 're hoping to incorporate that functionality in the very near future - from a local level at the moment to a global level probably within the next six months , " said mr fargher .
the idea is to use the psp to access the ps3 at home from anywhere in the world with a wireless hotspot .
" if i have my mp3 walkman or my ipod , or digital camera connected to ps3 then i can access those devices too , " said mr fargher .
with a psp camera and gps device in the pipeline , ken kutaragi must be a proud father , but has his prediction that the psp would become the walkman of the 21st century come true ?
apple 's steve jobs might have something to say about that .
the ipod has shipped more than 88m units since 2002 , with 21m of those manufactured in the first fiscal quarter of 2007 alone .
it looks like the psp still has some way to go if it is to live up to mr kutaragi 's promise .

police forces across scotland have pledged to adopt a zero tolerance approach to drivers who break new legislation now in force .
research shows that drivers are four times more likely to crash when they are chatting on mobiles .
if a case progresses to court , guilty drivers could now be hit with a maximum fine of £ 1,000 .
that amount has increased to £ 2,500 for drivers of vans lorries , buses and coaches , while employers that require employees to make or receive calls while driving can be prosecuted .
drivers who are not in proper control of their vehicle while talking on a hands-free mobile can also be prosecuted .
the number of accidents involving the use of mobile phones is on the increase michael mcdonnell road safety scotland driving carelessly and dangerously when using any phone can lead to disqualification , a large fine and up to two years imprisonment .
it is now illegal to use a hand-held phone while stopped at traffic lights or in a queue of traffic .
michael mcdonnell , director of road safety scotland , urged drivers to switch off their phones or divert them to answer machines before setting off on a journey .
" the number of accidents involving the use of mobile phones is on the increase , " he added .
" it is unnecessary to use a mobile phone while driving - not only are you putting yourself at risk , but you are putting other road users at risk . "
over just three weeks in lothian and the borders , officers observing more than 5,500 drivers found an average of one driver every five minutes using a phone .
van and lorry drivers were the worst offenders - one in 22 of them was caught talking on a mobile .

health secretary patricia hewitt has expressed concern about the case of connor mccreaddie .
his mother , nicola mckeown , has been called to a child protection conference with the local authority .
connor , from wallsend , north tyneside , has lost some weight , but still prefers processed food to fruit and vegetables .
family support may be offered , but the last resort would be for north tyneside officials to place connor into care .
i ca n't starve him nicola mckeown , connor 's mother mr hewitt backed the involvement of local services in connor 's case .
she said it was vital that parents encouraged children to adopt a healthy lifestyle from an early age .
she said : " we have got a boy whose life and health have already been shockingly damaged because he is quite clearly eating the wrong food , and not able to take enough exercise .
" as i understand it social services and children 's services are rightly very , very concerned about this boy , and are trying to make sure that they give him and his family every possible support in dealing with what is quite clearly a growing threat to this chld 's health and happiness . "
connor 's pre-christmas weight of 15 stones and eight pounds -lrb- 98.8kg -rrb- is four times the weight of a healthy child of his age .
he has lost weight after beginning an intensive exercise regime and introducing some healthy food into his diet .
the eight-year-old does have a bike and a trampoline which he uses , but he has to stop after around 10 minutes because he becomes out of breath and can vomit .
he has difficulty dressing and washing himself , misses school regularly because of poor health and is a target for bullies .
confident ms mckeown , 35 , told the bbc : " connor had a mouthful of apple once and he did n't like it .
" he refuses to eat fruit , vegetables and salads - he has processed foods .
" when connor wo n't eat anything else , i 've got to give him the foods he likes .
" i ca n't starve him .
" but i 'm confident i can get his weight down with a bit of help . "
his life expectancy is severely prejudiced .
dr colin waine , national obesity forum ms mckeown denied she is neglecting her son , and said he would be " skinny " if she had been .
she said she had seen doctors , but no-one had actually stepped in to offer her help .
she said that taking connor into care would be " disastrous " .
his story was due to be featured in itv 's tonight with trevor mcdonald , which followed connor and his mother for a month .
child 's interests ' paramount ' dr colin waine , chairman of the national obesity forum , said that removing a child from their family could be justified .
" the long-term impacts of this child 's gross obesity are frightening .
" he has great risk of diabetes and coronary illness .
" his life expectancy is severely prejudiced .
so action is required if his health is to be safeguarded . "
a spokeswoman for north tyneside council and north tyneside primary care trust , said : " we share the concerns over the child 's health and well-being .
" we have been working with the family over a prolonged period of time and will continue to do so .
" the child 's interests are paramount . "

health secretary patricia hewitt has expressed concern about the case of connor mccreaddie .
his mother , nicola mckeown , has been called to a child protection conference with the local authority .
connor , from wallsend , north tyneside , has lost some weight , but still prefers processed food to fruit and vegetables .
family support may be offered , but the last resort would be for north tyneside officials to place connor into care .
i ca n't starve him nicola mckeown , connor 's mother mr hewitt backed the involvement of local services in connor 's case .
she said it was vital that parents encouraged children to adopt a healthy lifestyle from an early age .
she said : " we have got a boy whose life and health have already been shockingly damaged because he is quite clearly eating the wrong food , and not able to take enough exercise .
" as i understand it social services and children 's services are rightly very , very concerned about this boy , and are trying to make sure that they give him and his family every possible support in dealing with what is quite clearly a growing threat to this chld 's health and happiness . "
connor 's pre-christmas weight of 15 stones and eight pounds -lrb- 98.8kg -rrb- is four times the weight of a healthy child of his age .
he has lost weight after beginning an intensive exercise regime and introducing some healthy food into his diet .
the eight-year-old does have a bike and a trampoline which he uses , but he has to stop after around 10 minutes because he becomes out of breath and can vomit .
he has difficulty dressing and washing himself , misses school regularly because of poor health and is a target for bullies .
confident ms mckeown , 35 , told the bbc : " connor had a mouthful of apple once and he did n't like it .
" he refuses to eat fruit , vegetables and salads - he has processed foods .
" when connor wo n't eat anything else , i 've got to give him the foods he likes .
" i ca n't starve him .
" but i 'm confident i can get his weight down with a bit of help . "

she said she had seen doctors , but no-one had actually stepped in to offer her help .
she said that taking connor into care would be " disastrous " .

widow amina haji mumin sells khat to support her five children he was the sole breadwinner of the family and after his death , ms mumin was left without an income .
at first her relatives would help , providing food for her family , but after some time they stopped making payments .
as times became harder she started selling khat , a mild stimulant that is banned in many countries .
gunfights and bandits ms mumin , 35 , uses most of what she earns from the trade to purchase food for her five children and pay rent .
she concedes that selling khat in mogadishu is at times very dangerous and exhausting .
the demands of the trade also keep her away from her children , since she has to work long hours at her kiosk .
men spend all the money they get to purchase khat regardless of the needs of their children and wives - and the thought of this makes me feel guilty amina haji mumin most khat traders in mogadishu are women and many are widows .
safety is a big concern , since most of their customers are rogue militiamen , most of whom are addicted to khat .
gunfights at the market have , on occasion , been caused by a row over the stimulant - especially when supplies are scarce .
a lot of khat sold at the market in mogadishu is imported from kenya .
on some occasions the women have lost their supplies and money to gunmen .
" once they stole my khat and money , " ms mumin said .
" they threatened to kill me and my driver with pistols unless we gave them all we had and surrendered the minibus we drove in . "
market forces when islamists banned the sale and consumption of khat , whilst they ran mogadishu during the second-half of last year , her life was shattered .
" i felt as if my whole life and that of my family had again been destroyed , " she said .
but business went back to normal when government forces backed by ethiopia ended the islamists ' rule .
photo gallery in pictures : growing khat trading in khat is often a big gamble ; sometimes profits are high , other times you lose out .
" customers like their khat fresh and the latest batch to arrive from kenya is always in great demand , " ms mumin said .
" when you are selling stock flown in from the morning and other business men bring fresh supplies in the afternoon you lose out in the competition . "
and with the interim government stepping into the trade , small-scale dealers such as ms mumin fear they may be thrown out of business if taxes are imposed .
ms mumin hopes to leave the khat trade .
she feels guilty because she knows her business may have a negative impact on other families in mogadishu .

the maximum fixed penalty fine has doubled to £ 60 , and three points can be added to offenders ' licences .
motorists will also be prosecuted for using a hands-free phone if they are not in control of their vehicle .
transport minister dr stephen ladyman said those who flouted the law were " selfishly " endangering others , but a drivers ' group criticised the move .
in 2005 , 13 deaths and 400 injuries were blamed on drivers using hand-held mobile phones .
have your say " if only they could be as tough on burglars , muggers and rapists as they are on drivers " tim hothersall , accrington random breath tests planned send us your comments the department for transport says 21 % of drivers admit breaking the law , introduced in december 2003 .
road safety minister dr ladyman said the new penalties would be combined with a " hard-hitting " television campaign .
he told gmtv : " we have been working with the constabularies around the country , we chose the timing of today with them , so that they are ready to help us enforce it . "
he added it was just as dangerous for people to use mobiles while " wobbling " around roundabouts as it was on motorways .
a recent survey commissioned by direct line suggested one million people in the uk were flouting the law at any one time , with drivers in cardiff , newcastle and southampton the worst offenders . "
there are quite a lot of people out there who are perfectly capable of holding a conversation on a mobile phone " nigel humphries association of british drivers careless talk mourning families speak out inspector douglas kirkham , from lothian and borders road policing branch , warned drivers could be prosecuted if they were using a hands-free or bluetooth kit .
he said : " if while making or having a conversation , even if you 're using a bluetooth , you are not in proper control of your vehicle , then an offence has still been committed . "
aa public affairs head of road safety andrew howard said : " police can trace back on phone call records to establish use during a journey that ended in a crash . "
dr vivienne nathanson , head of science and ethics at the british medical association -lrb- bma -rrb- , said a bma report in 2001 had warned of the dangers of mobile use .
" drivers must get into the habit of switching off before they set off on their journey .
" there is also a responsibility on employers not to call their staff if they know they are driving and not to pressurise their staff to keep their mobiles on . "
jools townsend , head of education at road safety charity brake , welcomed the new penalties but said hands-free phones should also be banned .
nigel humphries , from the association of british drivers , argued those who could use a phone in a responsible way should be free to do so .
he said : " there are quite a lot of people out there who are perfectly capable of holding a conversation on a mobile phone while the driving comes first . "
the maximum fine rises to £ 1,000 if the police or the driver choose to take a case to court rather than use a fixed-penalty notice , rising to £ 2,500 for drivers of vans , lorries , buses and coaches .
