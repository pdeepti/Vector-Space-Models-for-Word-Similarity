opinions polls are unanimous in predicting sarkozy 's center-right union for a popular movement -lrb- ump -rrb- a big victory over the socialist party , and the only doubt is likely to be over the extent of its majority in the new assembly .
both parties urged voters to turn out in force in order to bring down the record abstention rate - 39.6 percent - of june 10 .
by noon 22.9 percent of the electorate had gone to the polls , a small increase over last sunday , when 22.65 percent had voted by the same point .
it is france 's fourth national poll in less than two months , and the country is showing clear signs of election weariness .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french are weary of going to the polls among early voters at his constituency at tulle in southern france was socialist leader francois hollande who said , " in 80 seats it 's a question of a few hundred votes either way , so a strong turn-out for us can make all the difference . "
elected on may 6 over the socialist candidate segolene royal , sarkozy wants a large majority in the legislature in order to maintain the political momentum behind his promised reforms .
he has pledged to summon a special session of the national assembly in july in order to push through the first stage of his program , which will include key changes to the tax system meant to encourage the french to work harder .
socialists demoralized demoralized and deeply divided over royal 's defeat , the socialist party seems resigned to another five years in opposition and its campaign has focused mainly on warning against a too large ump majority .
opinion polls suggested the ump and its ally the new center will win between 405 and 435 seats in the 577-member assembly , with the socialists getting at most 170 .
of the 110 seats decided in round one , all but one were for the ump or its allies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : royal is not running for parliament this time as the ump already controls the legislature , it would be the first time since 1978 that a ruling party has retained its majority - a sure sign that sarkozy 's claim to represent a " clean break " from the past is widely accepted .
the socialist party currently has 149 seats and will regard it as a success if it can retain all these or take some more .
if it falls to below 100 , there are likely to be immediate calls for heads to roll .
either way , bitter arguments lie ahead over the party 's future .
biggest losers the biggest losers in the election are likely to be the small parties , as the new assembly looks set to be dominated by the ump-socialist divide .
the communist party is set to lose several of its current 21 seats and will not have enough to form a parliamentary bloc .
the greens will have three at most , and the far-right national front once again none , according to polls .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayrou 's party is not expected to fare well in the poll the third-placed presidential candidate francois bayrou also looks set to lose the gamble he took when he created a new center party , modem , last month and broke with sarkozy 's ump .
he may well be the only modem deputy to win a seat .
all but one of sunday 's 467 races are two-way challenges between left and right .
the other is a " triangular " contest between candidates from the ump , socialist party and modem .
ministers could go constituencies to watch include bordeaux , where the powerful environment minister , alain juppe , faces a tight race .
prime minister francois fillon has said that ministers who are rejected by the electorate will lose their cabinet posts .
several socialist heavyweights are also at risk of losing their seats , including julien dray , dominique strauss-kahn and arnaud montebourg .

all told , the shopping mall covers 35,000 square-meters -lrb- 115,000 square feet -rrb- of space . alexa , designed by american architects , is just one of a series of new projects now emerging in and around alexanderplatz - a city square in eastern berlin that has experienced its fair share of convulsive highs and lows over the past 200 years . by the mid-1960s , the east berlin 's communist authorities began reconstructing the dilapidated square with new prefabricated apartment buildings , a soaring hotel complex and supermarkets . bildunterschrift : its soaring tv tower became a landmark in the 1970s - and remains one today .
but despite its designers ' wish to make it the showplace of the german communist state , by the time the berlin wall fell in late 1989 , the square had little to commend it anymore .
its drab architecture was a constant reminder of a failed era . ugly vacant lots around alexanderplatz robbed the square of any potential elegance , although it did get at least a retail boost when the kaufhof department store replaced the former state-run " centrum , " and the nationwide chain saturn opened an outlet there in the 1990s . getting a face-lift bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world time clock at alex more recently , after renewed investment activity , many of the scars of the past have been erased .
the square 's sole remaining empty plot opposite the kaufhof galleria is now being filled .
there is a constant rumble as cranes , excavators and dump trucks go about their work . the us property giant hines is to build a six-story building on the site titled " die mitte " -lrb- the middle -rrb- .
due to be completed early in 2009 , it will occupy an area of 17,500 square meters and house a new saturn flagship store on four of its floors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a labyrinth for people passing by the square " our sales area will double in the new premises , " said reiner schemel , saturn 's local business manager .
its current premises are near the lofty park inn hotel .
reinvention in the wildly optimistic years after berlin 's reunification , city planners had originally intended on reinventing alexanderplatz , studding it with a dozen or so new york-style skyscrapers . star german architects hans kolhoff and helga timmermann came up with a master plan , envisaging a cluster of 150-meter-high skyscrapers .
at the time , berlin was the biggest building site in europe , and officials felt the capital would soon be the " engine room " of a united europe . in the early part of the 20th century , alexanderplatz had been a busy trade and commercial center .
city officials felt it was destined to become one again .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : writer döblin , who penned the classic " berlin alexanderplatz " urban planners predicted towering structures would bring dramatic changes in the city , long renowned for its strict rules governing the heights of new buildings . construction of the 45-story skyscrapers was scheduled to start in 2006 and to be completed by 2015 .
new york 's multi-millionaire developer donald trump was among the personalities whose names were linked to the project . major debt but , by the late 1990s , with the berlin city government billions of euros in debt following the high cost of reunification , the loss of subsidized industry , and a slowdown in foreign investment , city planners had to shelve the skyscraper plans . now the mood is more upbeat .
the long-depressed property market offers signs that berlin 's economy may have turned the corner .
foreign investors have arrived to take advantage of berlin 's remarkably low-priced residential , office and commercial markets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fassbinder filmed " berlin alexanderplatz " opposite the park inn hotel , a printed message adorns the facade of a white-painted building .
it reads : " welcome to alex .
the weather 's freezing .
next year - 1929 - it will be even colder . " the citation from alfred döblin , the german novelist who wrote the famous " berlin alexanderplatz " novel , referred to the global depression and political unrest that reigned at the time .
in the berlin of 2007 , the words seem less appropriate . for one , alexanderplatz is sweltering in a heat wave , and the german economy is roaring ahead .
even struggling berlin is slowly emerging for its economic malaise . " there is a fresh spring wind , " observes wolfgang hummel , who heads the local government 's investor relations office .

opinions polls are unanimous in predicting sarkozy 's center-right union for a popular movement -lrb- ump -rrb- a big victory over the socialist party , and the only doubt is likely to be over the extent of its majority in the new assembly .
both parties urged voters to turn out in force in order to bring down the record abstention rate - 39.6 percent - of june 10 .
by noon 22.9 percent of the electorate had gone to the polls , a small increase over last sunday , when 22.65 percent had voted by the same point .
it is france 's fourth national poll in less than two months , and the country is showing clear signs of election weariness .

opinion polls suggested the ump and its ally the new center will win between 405 and 435 seats in the 577-member assembly , with the socialists getting at most 170 .
of the 110 seats decided in round one , all but one were for the ump or its allies .

the socialist party currently has 149 seats and will regard it as a success if it can retain all these or take some more .
if it falls to below 100 , there are likely to be immediate calls for heads to roll .
either way , bitter arguments lie ahead over the party 's future .

opinions polls are unanimous in predicting sarkozy 's center-right union for a popular movement -lrb- ump -rrb- a big victory over the socialist party , and the only doubt is likely to be over the extent of its majority in the new assembly .
both parties urged voters to turn out in force in order to bring down the record abstention rate - 39.6 percent - of june 10 .
by noon 22.9 percent of the electorate had gone to the polls , a small increase over last sunday , when 22.65 percent had voted by the same point .
it is france 's fourth national poll in less than two months , and the country is showing clear signs of election weariness .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french are weary of going to the polls among early voters at his constituency at tulle in southern france was socialist leader francois hollande who said , " in 80 seats it 's a question of a few hundred votes either way , so a strong turn-out for us can make all the difference . "
elected on may 6 over the socialist candidate segolene royal , sarkozy wants a large majority in the legislature in order to maintain the political momentum behind his promised reforms .
he has pledged to summon a special session of the national assembly in july in order to push through the first stage of his program , which will include key changes to the tax system meant to encourage the french to work harder .
socialists demoralized demoralized and deeply divided over royal 's defeat , the socialist party seems resigned to another five years in opposition and its campaign has focused mainly on warning against a too large ump majority .
opinion polls suggested the ump and its ally the new center will win between 405 and 435 seats in the 577-member assembly , with the socialists getting at most 170 .
of the 110 seats decided in round one , all but one were for the ump or its allies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : royal is not running for parliament this time as the ump already controls the legislature , it would be the first time since 1978 that a ruling party has retained its majority - a sure sign that sarkozy 's claim to represent a " clean break " from the past is widely accepted .
the socialist party currently has 149 seats and will regard it as a success if it can retain all these or take some more .
if it falls to below 100 , there are likely to be immediate calls for heads to roll .
either way , bitter arguments lie ahead over the party 's future .
biggest losers the biggest losers in the election are likely to be the small parties , as the new assembly looks set to be dominated by the ump-socialist divide .
the communist party is set to lose several of its current 21 seats and will not have enough to form a parliamentary bloc .
the greens will have three at most , and the far-right national front once again none , according to polls .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayrou 's party is not expected to fare well in the poll the third-placed presidential candidate francois bayrou also looks set to lose the gamble he took when he created a new center party , modem , last month and broke with sarkozy 's ump .
he may well be the only modem deputy to win a seat .
all but one of sunday 's 467 races are two-way challenges between left and right .
the other is a " triangular " contest between candidates from the ump , socialist party and modem .
ministers could go constituencies to watch include bordeaux , where the powerful environment minister , alain juppe , faces a tight race .
prime minister francois fillon has said that ministers who are rejected by the electorate will lose their cabinet posts .
several socialist heavyweights are also at risk of losing their seats , including julien dray , dominique strauss-kahn and arnaud montebourg .
royal herself is not running for the assembly .

opinions polls are unanimous in predicting sarkozy 's center-right union for a popular movement -lrb- ump -rrb- a big victory over the socialist party , and the only doubt is likely to be over the extent of its majority in the new assembly .
both parties urged voters to turn out in force in order to bring down the record abstention rate - 39.6 percent - of june 10 .
by noon 22.9 percent of the electorate had gone to the polls , a small increase over last sunday , when 22.65 percent had voted by the same point .
it is france 's fourth national poll in less than two months , and the country is showing clear signs of election weariness .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french are weary of going to the polls among early voters at his constituency at tulle in southern france was socialist leader francois hollande who said , " in 80 seats it 's a question of a few hundred votes either way , so a strong turn-out for us can make all the difference . "
elected on may 6 over the socialist candidate segolene royal , sarkozy wants a large majority in the legislature in order to maintain the political momentum behind his promised reforms .
he has pledged to summon a special session of the national assembly in july in order to push through the first stage of his program , which will include key changes to the tax system meant to encourage the french to work harder .
socialists demoralized demoralized and deeply divided over royal 's defeat , the socialist party seems resigned to another five years in opposition and its campaign has focused mainly on warning against a too large ump majority .
opinion polls suggested the ump and its ally the new center will win between 405 and 435 seats in the 577-member assembly , with the socialists getting at most 170 .
of the 110 seats decided in round one , all but one were for the ump or its allies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : royal is not running for parliament this time as the ump already controls the legislature , it would be the first time since 1978 that a ruling party has retained its majority - a sure sign that sarkozy 's claim to represent a " clean break " from the past is widely accepted .
the socialist party currently has 149 seats and will regard it as a success if it can retain all these or take some more .
if it falls to below 100 , there are likely to be immediate calls for heads to roll .
either way , bitter arguments lie ahead over the party 's future .
biggest losers the biggest losers in the election are likely to be the small parties , as the new assembly looks set to be dominated by the ump-socialist divide .
the communist party is set to lose several of its current 21 seats and will not have enough to form a parliamentary bloc .
the greens will have three at most , and the far-right national front once again none , according to polls .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayrou 's party is not expected to fare well in the poll the third-placed presidential candidate francois bayrou also looks set to lose the gamble he took when he created a new center party , modem , last month and broke with sarkozy 's ump .
he may well be the only modem deputy to win a seat .
all but one of sunday 's 467 races are two-way challenges between left and right .
the other is a " triangular " contest between candidates from the ump , socialist party and modem .
ministers could go constituencies to watch include bordeaux , where the powerful environment minister , alain juppe , faces a tight race .
prime minister francois fillon has said that ministers who are rejected by the electorate will lose their cabinet posts .

all told , the shopping mall covers 35,000 square-meters -lrb- 115,000 square feet -rrb- of space . alexa , designed by american architects , is just one of a series of new projects now emerging in and around alexanderplatz - a city square in eastern berlin that has experienced its fair share of convulsive highs and lows over the past 200 years . by the mid-1960s , the east berlin 's communist authorities began reconstructing the dilapidated square with new prefabricated apartment buildings , a soaring hotel complex and supermarkets . bildunterschrift : its soaring tv tower became a landmark in the 1970s - and remains one today .
but despite its designers ' wish to make it the showplace of the german communist state , by the time the berlin wall fell in late 1989 , the square had little to commend it anymore .
its drab architecture was a constant reminder of a failed era . ugly vacant lots around alexanderplatz robbed the square of any potential elegance , although it did get at least a retail boost when the kaufhof department store replaced the former state-run " centrum , " and the nationwide chain saturn opened an outlet there in the 1990s . getting a face-lift bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world time clock at alex more recently , after renewed investment activity , many of the scars of the past have been erased .
the square 's sole remaining empty plot opposite the kaufhof galleria is now being filled .
there is a constant rumble as cranes , excavators and dump trucks go about their work . the us property giant hines is to build a six-story building on the site titled " die mitte " -lrb- the middle -rrb- .
due to be completed early in 2009 , it will occupy an area of 17,500 square meters and house a new saturn flagship store on four of its floors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a labyrinth for people passing by the square " our sales area will double in the new premises , " said reiner schemel , saturn 's local business manager .
its current premises are near the lofty park inn hotel .
reinvention in the wildly optimistic years after berlin 's reunification , city planners had originally intended on reinventing alexanderplatz , studding it with a dozen or so new york-style skyscrapers . star german architects hans kolhoff and helga timmermann came up with a master plan , envisaging a cluster of 150-meter-high skyscrapers .
at the time , berlin was the biggest building site in europe , and officials felt the capital would soon be the " engine room " of a united europe . in the early part of the 20th century , alexanderplatz had been a busy trade and commercial center .
city officials felt it was destined to become one again .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : writer döblin , who penned the classic " berlin alexanderplatz " urban planners predicted towering structures would bring dramatic changes in the city , long renowned for its strict rules governing the heights of new buildings . construction of the 45-story skyscrapers was scheduled to start in 2006 and to be completed by 2015 .
new york 's multi-millionaire developer donald trump was among the personalities whose names were linked to the project . major debt but , by the late 1990s , with the berlin city government billions of euros in debt following the high cost of reunification , the loss of subsidized industry , and a slowdown in foreign investment , city planners had to shelve the skyscraper plans . now the mood is more upbeat .
the long-depressed property market offers signs that berlin 's economy may have turned the corner .
foreign investors have arrived to take advantage of berlin 's remarkably low-priced residential , office and commercial markets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fassbinder filmed " berlin alexanderplatz " opposite the park inn hotel , a printed message adorns the facade of a white-painted building .
it reads : " welcome to alex .
the weather 's freezing .

opinions polls are unanimous in predicting sarkozy 's center-right union for a popular movement -lrb- ump -rrb- a big victory over the socialist party , and the only doubt is likely to be over the extent of its majority in the new assembly .
both parties urged voters to turn out in force in order to bring down the record abstention rate - 39.6 percent - of june 10 .
by noon 22.9 percent of the electorate had gone to the polls , a small increase over last sunday , when 22.65 percent had voted by the same point .
it is france 's fourth national poll in less than two months , and the country is showing clear signs of election weariness .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french are weary of going to the polls among early voters at his constituency at tulle in southern france was socialist leader francois hollande who said , " in 80 seats it 's a question of a few hundred votes either way , so a strong turn-out for us can make all the difference . "
elected on may 6 over the socialist candidate segolene royal , sarkozy wants a large majority in the legislature in order to maintain the political momentum behind his promised reforms .
he has pledged to summon a special session of the national assembly in july in order to push through the first stage of his program , which will include key changes to the tax system meant to encourage the french to work harder .
socialists demoralized demoralized and deeply divided over royal 's defeat , the socialist party seems resigned to another five years in opposition and its campaign has focused mainly on warning against a too large ump majority .
opinion polls suggested the ump and its ally the new center will win between 405 and 435 seats in the 577-member assembly , with the socialists getting at most 170 .
of the 110 seats decided in round one , all but one were for the ump or its allies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : royal is not running for parliament this time as the ump already controls the legislature , it would be the first time since 1978 that a ruling party has retained its majority - a sure sign that sarkozy 's claim to represent a " clean break " from the past is widely accepted .
the socialist party currently has 149 seats and will regard it as a success if it can retain all these or take some more .
if it falls to below 100 , there are likely to be immediate calls for heads to roll .
either way , bitter arguments lie ahead over the party 's future .
biggest losers the biggest losers in the election are likely to be the small parties , as the new assembly looks set to be dominated by the ump-socialist divide .
the communist party is set to lose several of its current 21 seats and will not have enough to form a parliamentary bloc .
the greens will have three at most , and the far-right national front once again none , according to polls .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayrou 's party is not expected to fare well in the poll the third-placed presidential candidate francois bayrou also looks set to lose the gamble he took when he created a new center party , modem , last month and broke with sarkozy 's ump .
he may well be the only modem deputy to win a seat .
all but one of sunday 's 467 races are two-way challenges between left and right .
the other is a " triangular " contest between candidates from the ump , socialist party and modem .
ministers could go constituencies to watch include bordeaux , where the powerful environment minister , alain juppe , faces a tight race .
prime minister francois fillon has said that ministers who are rejected by the electorate will lose their cabinet posts .
several socialist heavyweights are also at risk of losing their seats , including julien dray , dominique strauss-kahn and arnaud montebourg .
royal herself is not running for the assembly .
voting ends at 8:00 p.m.
-lrb- 1800 gmt -rrb- , with reliable estimates of the results due immediately after . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the french right 's power gain has some worried the political " blue wave " that is rolling over france is wiping out the country 's multiparty system , some fear .
after legislative elections on sunday , president sarkozy 's bloc is expected to have a huge majority .
-lrb- 16.06.2007 -rrb- opinion : sarkozy 's win means european uncertainty in electing nicolas sarkozy on sunday , the french voted for national reform .
but dw 's anke hagedorn says france 's european partners may have little reason to cheer a nationalistically inclined leader in paris .
-lrb- 07.05.2007 -rrb- new french leadership promises better trans-atlantic ties differences between presidential candidates nicolas sarkozy and segolene royal are strategic rather than substantive in foreign affairs .
neither is beholden to the anti-american gaullist or socialist legacies .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 17.06.2007 sarkozy set for big mandate as french vote in new assembly großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy looks likely to get the firm mandate he needs to push through reforms french president nicolas sarkozy looked set to win a sweeping mandate for his ambitious program of reforms sunday , as french voters went back to the polls to elect a new national assembly , the lower house of parliament . in the second round of legislative elections , some 35 million registered voters are choosing deputies in the 467 constituencies where there was no winner in the first round a week ago .
opinions polls are unanimous in predicting sarkozy 's center-right union for a popular movement -lrb- ump -rrb- a big victory over the socialist party , and the only doubt is likely to be over the extent of its majority in the new assembly .
both parties urged voters to turn out in force in order to bring down the record abstention rate - 39.6 percent - of june 10 .
by noon 22.9 percent of the electorate had gone to the polls , a small increase over last sunday , when 22.65 percent had voted by the same point .
it is france 's fourth national poll in less than two months , and the country is showing clear signs of election weariness .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french are weary of going to the polls among early voters at his constituency at tulle in southern france was socialist leader francois hollande who said , " in 80 seats it 's a question of a few hundred votes either way , so a strong turn-out for us can make all the difference . "
elected on may 6 over the socialist candidate segolene royal , sarkozy wants a large majority in the legislature in order to maintain the political momentum behind his promised reforms .
he has pledged to summon a special session of the national assembly in july in order to push through the first stage of his program , which will include key changes to the tax system meant to encourage the french to work harder .
socialists demoralized demoralized and deeply divided over royal 's defeat , the socialist party seems resigned to another five years in opposition and its campaign has focused mainly on warning against a too large ump majority .
opinion polls suggested the ump and its ally the new center will win between 405 and 435 seats in the 577-member assembly , with the socialists getting at most 170 .
of the 110 seats decided in round one , all but one were for the ump or its allies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : royal is not running for parliament this time as the ump already controls the legislature , it would be the first time since 1978 that a ruling party has retained its majority - a sure sign that sarkozy 's claim to represent a " clean break " from the past is widely accepted .
the socialist party currently has 149 seats and will regard it as a success if it can retain all these or take some more .
if it falls to below 100 , there are likely to be immediate calls for heads to roll .
either way , bitter arguments lie ahead over the party 's future .
biggest losers the biggest losers in the election are likely to be the small parties , as the new assembly looks set to be dominated by the ump-socialist divide .
the communist party is set to lose several of its current 21 seats and will not have enough to form a parliamentary bloc .
the greens will have three at most , and the far-right national front once again none , according to polls .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayrou 's party is not expected to fare well in the poll the third-placed presidential candidate francois bayrou also looks set to lose the gamble he took when he created a new center party , modem , last month and broke with sarkozy 's ump .
he may well be the only modem deputy to win a seat .
all but one of sunday 's 467 races are two-way challenges between left and right .
the other is a " triangular " contest between candidates from the ump , socialist party and modem .
ministers could go constituencies to watch include bordeaux , where the powerful environment minister , alain juppe , faces a tight race .
prime minister francois fillon has said that ministers who are rejected by the electorate will lose their cabinet posts .
several socialist heavyweights are also at risk of losing their seats , including julien dray , dominique strauss-kahn and arnaud montebourg .
royal herself is not running for the assembly .
voting ends at 8:00 p.m.

opinions polls are unanimous in predicting sarkozy 's center-right union for a popular movement -lrb- ump -rrb- a big victory over the socialist party , and the only doubt is likely to be over the extent of its majority in the new assembly .
both parties urged voters to turn out in force in order to bring down the record abstention rate - 39.6 percent - of june 10 .
by noon 22.9 percent of the electorate had gone to the polls , a small increase over last sunday , when 22.65 percent had voted by the same point .
it is france 's fourth national poll in less than two months , and the country is showing clear signs of election weariness .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french are weary of going to the polls among early voters at his constituency at tulle in southern france was socialist leader francois hollande who said , " in 80 seats it 's a question of a few hundred votes either way , so a strong turn-out for us can make all the difference . "
elected on may 6 over the socialist candidate segolene royal , sarkozy wants a large majority in the legislature in order to maintain the political momentum behind his promised reforms .
he has pledged to summon a special session of the national assembly in july in order to push through the first stage of his program , which will include key changes to the tax system meant to encourage the french to work harder .
socialists demoralized demoralized and deeply divided over royal 's defeat , the socialist party seems resigned to another five years in opposition and its campaign has focused mainly on warning against a too large ump majority .
opinion polls suggested the ump and its ally the new center will win between 405 and 435 seats in the 577-member assembly , with the socialists getting at most 170 .
of the 110 seats decided in round one , all but one were for the ump or its allies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : royal is not running for parliament this time as the ump already controls the legislature , it would be the first time since 1978 that a ruling party has retained its majority - a sure sign that sarkozy 's claim to represent a " clean break " from the past is widely accepted .
the socialist party currently has 149 seats and will regard it as a success if it can retain all these or take some more .
if it falls to below 100 , there are likely to be immediate calls for heads to roll .
either way , bitter arguments lie ahead over the party 's future .
biggest losers the biggest losers in the election are likely to be the small parties , as the new assembly looks set to be dominated by the ump-socialist divide .
the communist party is set to lose several of its current 21 seats and will not have enough to form a parliamentary bloc .
the greens will have three at most , and the far-right national front once again none , according to polls .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayrou 's party is not expected to fare well in the poll the third-placed presidential candidate francois bayrou also looks set to lose the gamble he took when he created a new center party , modem , last month and broke with sarkozy 's ump .
he may well be the only modem deputy to win a seat .
all but one of sunday 's 467 races are two-way challenges between left and right .
the other is a " triangular " contest between candidates from the ump , socialist party and modem .
ministers could go constituencies to watch include bordeaux , where the powerful environment minister , alain juppe , faces a tight race .
prime minister francois fillon has said that ministers who are rejected by the electorate will lose their cabinet posts .
several socialist heavyweights are also at risk of losing their seats , including julien dray , dominique strauss-kahn and arnaud montebourg .

germany , which holds the six-month rotating eu presidency , is determined to use the summit to put the bloc on the road to a new treaty to replace the draft constitution that was rejected two years ago by voters in france and the netherlands .
on saturday , merkel held talks at meseberg with conservative polish president lech kaczynski , who has threatened to veto talks on a new text because poland believes it will lose clout under the proposed new voting system .
" only cosmetic changes " the czechs are also unhappy , as their euroskeptic president , vaclav klaus , underlined last week when he complained that prague 's concerns about the new treaty have not been addressed and " only cosmetic changes " made to the original text .

he is the seventh european leader with whom she has met this week in a bid to stitch up a deal that will see a new treaty in place before the european parliament elections in 2009 .
wheels in motion merkel will head to luxembourg later sunday to meet with prime minister jean-claude juncker .
the czech premier is conducting his own diplomatic tour ahead of the brussels summit on june 21 and 22 and is due to meet with his hungarian , polish and slovak counterparts in the visegrad group in bratislava on monday .
poland and the czech republic , who joined the european union in 2004 , are among nine countries who did not ratify the original draft constitution . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's merkel meets eu treaty opponent poland polish president lech kaczynski held talks on saturday with german chancellor angela merkel to address his country 's deep reservations about a new institutional treaty for the eu .

opinions polls are unanimous in predicting sarkozy 's center-right union for a popular movement -lrb- ump -rrb- a big victory over the socialist party , and the only doubt is likely to be over the extent of its majority in the new assembly .

by noon 22.9 percent of the electorate had gone to the polls , a small increase over last sunday , when 22.65 percent had voted by the same point .

germany , which holds the six-month rotating eu presidency , is determined to use the summit to put the bloc on the road to a new treaty to replace the draft constitution that was rejected two years ago by voters in france and the netherlands .
on saturday , merkel held talks at meseberg with conservative polish president lech kaczynski , who has threatened to veto talks on a new text because poland believes it will lose clout under the proposed new voting system .
" only cosmetic changes " the czechs are also unhappy , as their euroskeptic president , vaclav klaus , underlined last week when he complained that prague 's concerns about the new treaty have not been addressed and " only cosmetic changes " made to the original text .

he is the seventh european leader with whom she has met this week in a bid to stitch up a deal that will see a new treaty in place before the european parliament elections in 2009 .
wheels in motion merkel will head to luxembourg later sunday to meet with prime minister jean-claude juncker .
the czech premier is conducting his own diplomatic tour ahead of the brussels summit on june 21 and 22 and is due to meet with his hungarian , polish and slovak counterparts in the visegrad group in bratislava on monday .

opinions polls are unanimous in predicting sarkozy 's center-right union for a popular movement -lrb- ump -rrb- a big victory over the socialist party , and the only doubt is likely to be over the extent of its majority in the new assembly .
both parties urged voters to turn out in force in order to bring down the record abstention rate - 39.6 percent - of june 10 .
by noon 22.9 percent of the electorate had gone to the polls , a small increase over last sunday , when 22.65 percent had voted by the same point .
it is france 's fourth national poll in less than two months , and the country is showing clear signs of election weariness .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french are weary of going to the polls among early voters at his constituency at tulle in southern france was socialist leader francois hollande who said , " in 80 seats it 's a question of a few hundred votes either way , so a strong turn-out for us can make all the difference . "
elected on may 6 over the socialist candidate segolene royal , sarkozy wants a large majority in the legislature in order to maintain the political momentum behind his promised reforms .
he has pledged to summon a special session of the national assembly in july in order to push through the first stage of his program , which will include key changes to the tax system meant to encourage the french to work harder .
socialists demoralized demoralized and deeply divided over royal 's defeat , the socialist party seems resigned to another five years in opposition and its campaign has focused mainly on warning against a too large ump majority .
opinion polls suggested the ump and its ally the new center will win between 405 and 435 seats in the 577-member assembly , with the socialists getting at most 170 .
of the 110 seats decided in round one , all but one were for the ump or its allies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : royal is not running for parliament this time as the ump already controls the legislature , it would be the first time since 1978 that a ruling party has retained its majority - a sure sign that sarkozy 's claim to represent a " clean break " from the past is widely accepted .
the socialist party currently has 149 seats and will regard it as a success if it can retain all these or take some more .
if it falls to below 100 , there are likely to be immediate calls for heads to roll .

germany , which holds the six-month rotating eu presidency , is determined to use the summit to put the bloc on the road to a new treaty to replace the draft constitution that was rejected two years ago by voters in france and the netherlands .
on saturday , merkel held talks at meseberg with conservative polish president lech kaczynski , who has threatened to veto talks on a new text because poland believes it will lose clout under the proposed new voting system .
" only cosmetic changes " the czechs are also unhappy , as their euroskeptic president , vaclav klaus , underlined last week when he complained that prague 's concerns about the new treaty have not been addressed and " only cosmetic changes " made to the original text .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and topolanek are working hard in preparation for the eu summit topolanek on friday called for a clear procedure to be established for handing powers back to member states from brussels in any new agreement and signaled that he would take this up with merkel .
he is the seventh european leader with whom she has met this week in a bid to stitch up a deal that will see a new treaty in place before the european parliament elections in 2009 .
wheels in motion merkel will head to luxembourg later sunday to meet with prime minister jean-claude juncker .
the czech premier is conducting his own diplomatic tour ahead of the brussels summit on june 21 and 22 and is due to meet with his hungarian , polish and slovak counterparts in the visegrad group in bratislava on monday .
poland and the czech republic , who joined the european union in 2004 , are among nine countries who did not ratify the original draft constitution . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's merkel meets eu treaty opponent poland polish president lech kaczynski held talks on saturday with german chancellor angela merkel to address his country 's deep reservations about a new institutional treaty for the eu .

opinions polls are unanimous in predicting sarkozy 's center-right union for a popular movement -lrb- ump -rrb- a big victory over the socialist party , and the only doubt is likely to be over the extent of its majority in the new assembly .
both parties urged voters to turn out in force in order to bring down the record abstention rate - 39.6 percent - of june 10 .
by noon 22.9 percent of the electorate had gone to the polls , a small increase over last sunday , when 22.65 percent had voted by the same point .
it is france 's fourth national poll in less than two months , and the country is showing clear signs of election weariness .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french are weary of going to the polls among early voters at his constituency at tulle in southern france was socialist leader francois hollande who said , " in 80 seats it 's a question of a few hundred votes either way , so a strong turn-out for us can make all the difference . "
elected on may 6 over the socialist candidate segolene royal , sarkozy wants a large majority in the legislature in order to maintain the political momentum behind his promised reforms .
he has pledged to summon a special session of the national assembly in july in order to push through the first stage of his program , which will include key changes to the tax system meant to encourage the french to work harder .
socialists demoralized demoralized and deeply divided over royal 's defeat , the socialist party seems resigned to another five years in opposition and its campaign has focused mainly on warning against a too large ump majority .
opinion polls suggested the ump and its ally the new center will win between 405 and 435 seats in the 577-member assembly , with the socialists getting at most 170 .
of the 110 seats decided in round one , all but one were for the ump or its allies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : royal is not running for parliament this time as the ump already controls the legislature , it would be the first time since 1978 that a ruling party has retained its majority - a sure sign that sarkozy 's claim to represent a " clean break " from the past is widely accepted .
the socialist party currently has 149 seats and will regard it as a success if it can retain all these or take some more .
if it falls to below 100 , there are likely to be immediate calls for heads to roll .
either way , bitter arguments lie ahead over the party 's future .
biggest losers the biggest losers in the election are likely to be the small parties , as the new assembly looks set to be dominated by the ump-socialist divide .
the communist party is set to lose several of its current 21 seats and will not have enough to form a parliamentary bloc .
the greens will have three at most , and the far-right national front once again none , according to polls .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayrou 's party is not expected to fare well in the poll the third-placed presidential candidate francois bayrou also looks set to lose the gamble he took when he created a new center party , modem , last month and broke with sarkozy 's ump .
he may well be the only modem deputy to win a seat .
all but one of sunday 's 467 races are two-way challenges between left and right .
the other is a " triangular " contest between candidates from the ump , socialist party and modem .
ministers could go constituencies to watch include bordeaux , where the powerful environment minister , alain juppe , faces a tight race .
prime minister francois fillon has said that ministers who are rejected by the electorate will lose their cabinet posts .
several socialist heavyweights are also at risk of losing their seats , including julien dray , dominique strauss-kahn and arnaud montebourg .
royal herself is not running for the assembly .

germany , which holds the six-month rotating eu presidency , is determined to use the summit to put the bloc on the road to a new treaty to replace the draft constitution that was rejected two years ago by voters in france and the netherlands .
on saturday , merkel held talks at meseberg with conservative polish president lech kaczynski , who has threatened to veto talks on a new text because poland believes it will lose clout under the proposed new voting system .
" only cosmetic changes " the czechs are also unhappy , as their euroskeptic president , vaclav klaus , underlined last week when he complained that prague 's concerns about the new treaty have not been addressed and " only cosmetic changes " made to the original text .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and topolanek are working hard in preparation for the eu summit topolanek on friday called for a clear procedure to be established for handing powers back to member states from brussels in any new agreement and signaled that he would take this up with merkel .
he is the seventh european leader with whom she has met this week in a bid to stitch up a deal that will see a new treaty in place before the european parliament elections in 2009 .

all told , the shopping mall covers 35,000 square-meters -lrb- 115,000 square feet -rrb- of space . alexa , designed by american architects , is just one of a series of new projects now emerging in and around alexanderplatz - a city square in eastern berlin that has experienced its fair share of convulsive highs and lows over the past 200 years . by the mid-1960s , the east berlin 's communist authorities began reconstructing the dilapidated square with new prefabricated apartment buildings , a soaring hotel complex and supermarkets . bildunterschrift : its soaring tv tower became a landmark in the 1970s - and remains one today .
but despite its designers ' wish to make it the showplace of the german communist state , by the time the berlin wall fell in late 1989 , the square had little to commend it anymore .
its drab architecture was a constant reminder of a failed era . ugly vacant lots around alexanderplatz robbed the square of any potential elegance , although it did get at least a retail boost when the kaufhof department store replaced the former state-run " centrum , " and the nationwide chain saturn opened an outlet there in the 1990s . getting a face-lift bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world time clock at alex more recently , after renewed investment activity , many of the scars of the past have been erased .
the square 's sole remaining empty plot opposite the kaufhof galleria is now being filled .
there is a constant rumble as cranes , excavators and dump trucks go about their work . the us property giant hines is to build a six-story building on the site titled " die mitte " -lrb- the middle -rrb- .
due to be completed early in 2009 , it will occupy an area of 17,500 square meters and house a new saturn flagship store on four of its floors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a labyrinth for people passing by the square " our sales area will double in the new premises , " said reiner schemel , saturn 's local business manager .
its current premises are near the lofty park inn hotel .
reinvention in the wildly optimistic years after berlin 's reunification , city planners had originally intended on reinventing alexanderplatz , studding it with a dozen or so new york-style skyscrapers . star german architects hans kolhoff and helga timmermann came up with a master plan , envisaging a cluster of 150-meter-high skyscrapers .
at the time , berlin was the biggest building site in europe , and officials felt the capital would soon be the " engine room " of a united europe . in the early part of the 20th century , alexanderplatz had been a busy trade and commercial center .
city officials felt it was destined to become one again .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : writer döblin , who penned the classic " berlin alexanderplatz " urban planners predicted towering structures would bring dramatic changes in the city , long renowned for its strict rules governing the heights of new buildings . construction of the 45-story skyscrapers was scheduled to start in 2006 and to be completed by 2015 .
new york 's multi-millionaire developer donald trump was among the personalities whose names were linked to the project . major debt but , by the late 1990s , with the berlin city government billions of euros in debt following the high cost of reunification , the loss of subsidized industry , and a slowdown in foreign investment , city planners had to shelve the skyscraper plans . now the mood is more upbeat .
the long-depressed property market offers signs that berlin 's economy may have turned the corner .
foreign investors have arrived to take advantage of berlin 's remarkably low-priced residential , office and commercial markets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fassbinder filmed " berlin alexanderplatz " opposite the park inn hotel , a printed message adorns the facade of a white-painted building .
it reads : " welcome to alex .
the weather 's freezing .
next year - 1929 - it will be even colder . " the citation from alfred döblin , the german novelist who wrote the famous " berlin alexanderplatz " novel , referred to the global depression and political unrest that reigned at the time .
in the berlin of 2007 , the words seem less appropriate . for one , alexanderplatz is sweltering in a heat wave , and the german economy is roaring ahead .
even struggling berlin is slowly emerging for its economic malaise . " there is a fresh spring wind , " observes wolfgang hummel , who heads the local government 's investor relations office .

opinions polls are unanimous in predicting sarkozy 's center-right union for a popular movement -lrb- ump -rrb- a big victory over the socialist party , and the only doubt is likely to be over the extent of its majority in the new assembly .
both parties urged voters to turn out in force in order to bring down the record abstention rate - 39.6 percent - of june 10 .
by noon 22.9 percent of the electorate had gone to the polls , a small increase over last sunday , when 22.65 percent had voted by the same point .
it is france 's fourth national poll in less than two months , and the country is showing clear signs of election weariness .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french are weary of going to the polls among early voters at his constituency at tulle in southern france was socialist leader francois hollande who said , " in 80 seats it 's a question of a few hundred votes either way , so a strong turn-out for us can make all the difference . "
elected on may 6 over the socialist candidate segolene royal , sarkozy wants a large majority in the legislature in order to maintain the political momentum behind his promised reforms .
he has pledged to summon a special session of the national assembly in july in order to push through the first stage of his program , which will include key changes to the tax system meant to encourage the french to work harder .
socialists demoralized demoralized and deeply divided over royal 's defeat , the socialist party seems resigned to another five years in opposition and its campaign has focused mainly on warning against a too large ump majority .
opinion polls suggested the ump and its ally the new center will win between 405 and 435 seats in the 577-member assembly , with the socialists getting at most 170 .
of the 110 seats decided in round one , all but one were for the ump or its allies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : royal is not running for parliament this time as the ump already controls the legislature , it would be the first time since 1978 that a ruling party has retained its majority - a sure sign that sarkozy 's claim to represent a " clean break " from the past is widely accepted .
the socialist party currently has 149 seats and will regard it as a success if it can retain all these or take some more .
if it falls to below 100 , there are likely to be immediate calls for heads to roll .
either way , bitter arguments lie ahead over the party 's future .
biggest losers the biggest losers in the election are likely to be the small parties , as the new assembly looks set to be dominated by the ump-socialist divide .
the communist party is set to lose several of its current 21 seats and will not have enough to form a parliamentary bloc .
the greens will have three at most , and the far-right national front once again none , according to polls .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayrou 's party is not expected to fare well in the poll the third-placed presidential candidate francois bayrou also looks set to lose the gamble he took when he created a new center party , modem , last month and broke with sarkozy 's ump .
he may well be the only modem deputy to win a seat .
all but one of sunday 's 467 races are two-way challenges between left and right .
the other is a " triangular " contest between candidates from the ump , socialist party and modem .
ministers could go constituencies to watch include bordeaux , where the powerful environment minister , alain juppe , faces a tight race .
prime minister francois fillon has said that ministers who are rejected by the electorate will lose their cabinet posts .
several socialist heavyweights are also at risk of losing their seats , including julien dray , dominique strauss-kahn and arnaud montebourg .
royal herself is not running for the assembly .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 17.06.2007 berlin 's famous alexanderplatz reinvents itself großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's alexanderplatz has become a huge construction site in a rash of building activity , new life is being breathed into alexanderplatz , the berlin square immortalized in alfred döblin 's classic 1920s novel . a huge new maroon-colored media market shopping and recreation center is nearing completion across the way from the city 's soaring tv and radio tower , which prides itself on being only marginally shorter than the empire state building . berlin 's new mall , alexa , is a vast , oblong , four-story building which runs for almost a quarter of a mile down a side street off alexanderplatz . the multi-million-euro project , due to open in september , will contain 17 restaurants and 180 different shopping units , in addition to a 1,600 car parking facility .
all told , the shopping mall covers 35,000 square-meters -lrb- 115,000 square feet -rrb- of space . alexa , designed by american architects , is just one of a series of new projects now emerging in and around alexanderplatz - a city square in eastern berlin that has experienced its fair share of convulsive highs and lows over the past 200 years . by the mid-1960s , the east berlin 's communist authorities began reconstructing the dilapidated square with new prefabricated apartment buildings , a soaring hotel complex and supermarkets . bildunterschrift : its soaring tv tower became a landmark in the 1970s - and remains one today .
but despite its designers ' wish to make it the showplace of the german communist state , by the time the berlin wall fell in late 1989 , the square had little to commend it anymore .
its drab architecture was a constant reminder of a failed era . ugly vacant lots around alexanderplatz robbed the square of any potential elegance , although it did get at least a retail boost when the kaufhof department store replaced the former state-run " centrum , " and the nationwide chain saturn opened an outlet there in the 1990s . getting a face-lift bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world time clock at alex more recently , after renewed investment activity , many of the scars of the past have been erased .
the square 's sole remaining empty plot opposite the kaufhof galleria is now being filled .
there is a constant rumble as cranes , excavators and dump trucks go about their work . the us property giant hines is to build a six-story building on the site titled " die mitte " -lrb- the middle -rrb- .
due to be completed early in 2009 , it will occupy an area of 17,500 square meters and house a new saturn flagship store on four of its floors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a labyrinth for people passing by the square " our sales area will double in the new premises , " said reiner schemel , saturn 's local business manager .
its current premises are near the lofty park inn hotel .
reinvention in the wildly optimistic years after berlin 's reunification , city planners had originally intended on reinventing alexanderplatz , studding it with a dozen or so new york-style skyscrapers . star german architects hans kolhoff and helga timmermann came up with a master plan , envisaging a cluster of 150-meter-high skyscrapers .

opinions polls are unanimous in predicting sarkozy 's center-right union for a popular movement -lrb- ump -rrb- a big victory over the socialist party , and the only doubt is likely to be over the extent of its majority in the new assembly .
both parties urged voters to turn out in force in order to bring down the record abstention rate - 39.6 percent - of june 10 .
by noon 22.9 percent of the electorate had gone to the polls , a small increase over last sunday , when 22.65 percent had voted by the same point .
it is france 's fourth national poll in less than two months , and the country is showing clear signs of election weariness .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french are weary of going to the polls among early voters at his constituency at tulle in southern france was socialist leader francois hollande who said , " in 80 seats it 's a question of a few hundred votes either way , so a strong turn-out for us can make all the difference . "
elected on may 6 over the socialist candidate segolene royal , sarkozy wants a large majority in the legislature in order to maintain the political momentum behind his promised reforms .
he has pledged to summon a special session of the national assembly in july in order to push through the first stage of his program , which will include key changes to the tax system meant to encourage the french to work harder .
socialists demoralized demoralized and deeply divided over royal 's defeat , the socialist party seems resigned to another five years in opposition and its campaign has focused mainly on warning against a too large ump majority .
opinion polls suggested the ump and its ally the new center will win between 405 and 435 seats in the 577-member assembly , with the socialists getting at most 170 .
of the 110 seats decided in round one , all but one were for the ump or its allies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : royal is not running for parliament this time as the ump already controls the legislature , it would be the first time since 1978 that a ruling party has retained its majority - a sure sign that sarkozy 's claim to represent a " clean break " from the past is widely accepted .
the socialist party currently has 149 seats and will regard it as a success if it can retain all these or take some more .
if it falls to below 100 , there are likely to be immediate calls for heads to roll .
either way , bitter arguments lie ahead over the party 's future .
biggest losers the biggest losers in the election are likely to be the small parties , as the new assembly looks set to be dominated by the ump-socialist divide .
the communist party is set to lose several of its current 21 seats and will not have enough to form a parliamentary bloc .
the greens will have three at most , and the far-right national front once again none , according to polls .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayrou 's party is not expected to fare well in the poll the third-placed presidential candidate francois bayrou also looks set to lose the gamble he took when he created a new center party , modem , last month and broke with sarkozy 's ump .
he may well be the only modem deputy to win a seat .
all but one of sunday 's 467 races are two-way challenges between left and right .
the other is a " triangular " contest between candidates from the ump , socialist party and modem .
ministers could go constituencies to watch include bordeaux , where the powerful environment minister , alain juppe , faces a tight race .
prime minister francois fillon has said that ministers who are rejected by the electorate will lose their cabinet posts .
several socialist heavyweights are also at risk of losing their seats , including julien dray , dominique strauss-kahn and arnaud montebourg .

germany , which holds the six-month rotating eu presidency , is determined to use the summit to put the bloc on the road to a new treaty to replace the draft constitution that was rejected two years ago by voters in france and the netherlands .
on saturday , merkel held talks at meseberg with conservative polish president lech kaczynski , who has threatened to veto talks on a new text because poland believes it will lose clout under the proposed new voting system .
" only cosmetic changes " the czechs are also unhappy , as their euroskeptic president , vaclav klaus , underlined last week when he complained that prague 's concerns about the new treaty have not been addressed and " only cosmetic changes " made to the original text .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and topolanek are working hard in preparation for the eu summit topolanek on friday called for a clear procedure to be established for handing powers back to member states from brussels in any new agreement and signaled that he would take this up with merkel .
he is the seventh european leader with whom she has met this week in a bid to stitch up a deal that will see a new treaty in place before the european parliament elections in 2009 .
wheels in motion merkel will head to luxembourg later sunday to meet with prime minister jean-claude juncker .
the czech premier is conducting his own diplomatic tour ahead of the brussels summit on june 21 and 22 and is due to meet with his hungarian , polish and slovak counterparts in the visegrad group in bratislava on monday .
poland and the czech republic , who joined the european union in 2004 , are among nine countries who did not ratify the original draft constitution . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's merkel meets eu treaty opponent poland polish president lech kaczynski held talks on saturday with german chancellor angela merkel to address his country 's deep reservations about a new institutional treaty for the eu .

opinions polls are unanimous in predicting sarkozy 's center-right union for a popular movement -lrb- ump -rrb- a big victory over the socialist party , and the only doubt is likely to be over the extent of its majority in the new assembly .
both parties urged voters to turn out in force in order to bring down the record abstention rate - 39.6 percent - of june 10 .
by noon 22.9 percent of the electorate had gone to the polls , a small increase over last sunday , when 22.65 percent had voted by the same point .
it is france 's fourth national poll in less than two months , and the country is showing clear signs of election weariness .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french are weary of going to the polls among early voters at his constituency at tulle in southern france was socialist leader francois hollande who said , " in 80 seats it 's a question of a few hundred votes either way , so a strong turn-out for us can make all the difference . "
elected on may 6 over the socialist candidate segolene royal , sarkozy wants a large majority in the legislature in order to maintain the political momentum behind his promised reforms .
he has pledged to summon a special session of the national assembly in july in order to push through the first stage of his program , which will include key changes to the tax system meant to encourage the french to work harder .
socialists demoralized demoralized and deeply divided over royal 's defeat , the socialist party seems resigned to another five years in opposition and its campaign has focused mainly on warning against a too large ump majority .
opinion polls suggested the ump and its ally the new center will win between 405 and 435 seats in the 577-member assembly , with the socialists getting at most 170 .
of the 110 seats decided in round one , all but one were for the ump or its allies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : royal is not running for parliament this time as the ump already controls the legislature , it would be the first time since 1978 that a ruling party has retained its majority - a sure sign that sarkozy 's claim to represent a " clean break " from the past is widely accepted .
the socialist party currently has 149 seats and will regard it as a success if it can retain all these or take some more .
if it falls to below 100 , there are likely to be immediate calls for heads to roll .
either way , bitter arguments lie ahead over the party 's future .
biggest losers the biggest losers in the election are likely to be the small parties , as the new assembly looks set to be dominated by the ump-socialist divide .

opinions polls are unanimous in predicting sarkozy 's center-right union for a popular movement -lrb- ump -rrb- a big victory over the socialist party , and the only doubt is likely to be over the extent of its majority in the new assembly .
both parties urged voters to turn out in force in order to bring down the record abstention rate - 39.6 percent - of june 10 .
by noon 22.9 percent of the electorate had gone to the polls , a small increase over last sunday , when 22.65 percent had voted by the same point .

elton john played a free concert in the capital kiev to raise awareness about hiv / aids .
but his show attracted some critics as there is widespread homophobia in ukraine .
this former soviet republic has one of the fastest growing infection rates in europe .
there is a new case every 10 minutes , according to ukraine 's anti-aids foundation .
mega-stars do not often come to kiev , so thousands were expected at the event on saturday night .
' religious hatred ' a religious group had urged ukrainians to boycott the event , describing it as blasphemous .
we live with stigma , discrimination and homophobia petro polyantsev gay rights activist " we believe that gay people are responsible for spreading aids , " says svyatoslav domalevsky from the union of orthodox citizens of ukraine .
" elton john is gay and we do n't want him promoting that kind of lifestyle here . "
despite the western outlook of ukraine 's leader , it is a conservative and predominantly orthodox christian country .
" religion is responsible for a lot of the hatred people feel towards people like me , " says petro polyantsev , an hiv-positive gay rights activist .
" we live with stigma , discrimination and homophobia .
we constantly fear that we may be attacked just for being gay . "
soviet legacy petro became hiv-positive at the age of 19 when he was a student in southern ukraine .
photographs from elton john 's collection are on show in kiev he moved to kiev as it is relatively more tolerant .
but even in the capital , very few men are openly gay while lesbians are virtually invisible .
many blame the legacy of the soviet union .
back then being gay was a crime and those found guilty faced being sent to the gulag .
ukraine decriminalised homosexuality in 1991 but prejudices persist .
" many of the older generation still think that homosexuals should be prosecuted , " says petro polyantsev of the all ukrainian network of people living with hiv / aids .
an estimated 400,000 people are hiv-positive in ukraine .
it is believed that gay men make up only a small percentage of that figure .
disease spreading experts say that the disease was initially spread by drug-users but now that is changing .
" the situation is very bad - nobody really knows how many people are ill , " says oleg , a kiev businessman who was diagnosed as being hiv-positive two years ago " the virus hits ordinary ukrainians now , it 's not just the problem of drug-users anymore , and it 's affecting everyone . "
it is feared that within the next decade , one in 50 people in ukraine could be hiv-positive .
considering the scale of the problem , there is little funding on offer from the authorities .
this year the government is reported to have allocated $ 20m -lrb- £ 10m -rrb- .
most of the money to tackle the disease comes from international donors and charities .
elton john 's aids foundation is spending more than $ 5m on projects in ukraine .
this weekend 's events were organised to try to change people attitudes .
an exhibition of photographs from elton john 's collection is on display at kiev 's modern art gallery .
as the sun goes down over kiev , the british entertainer will perform an open-air concert in the city 's main square .

the decision was taken unanimously by the party 's national executive committee at a meeting in aberystwyth .
first minister rhodri morgan has offered a deal to plaid to support his minority assembly government .
plaid could still opt for a rainbow coalition with the tories and lib dems , but this was not discussed on saturday .
a plaid spokesman said a rainbow deal was not considered by the executive committee , as no request was made to do so by the party 's group of ams , which had met earlier in the day .
when asked if the rainbow coalition was dead , plaid leader ieuan wyn jones said that it was not .
how the assembly stands labour - 26 seats plaid cymru - 15 conservatives - 12 liberal democrats - 6 independent - 1 plaid will now concentrate on discussions with labour , and mr jones predicted that the discussions will now take days and not weeks .
both labour and plaid are set to hold special conferences in july in which the wider party memberships would have their say on any coalition deals .
a spokesperson for welsh labour leader and first minister rhodri morgan said plaid 's decision to continue talks was " a positive outcome in both parties " .
" meetings will now resume on monday so that a specific fully worked-up set of proposals are available for the respective party conferences to consider , " said the spokesperson .
reacting to the news , a spokesperson for the lib dem assembly leader mike german said plaid can not " keep two balls in the air indefinitely " .
" i hope the party will move swiftly to make a firm recommendation as rapidly as possible .
the people of wales want certainty . "
and welsh tory leader nick bourne said he believed the rainbow alliance was still a possibility .
" i remain confident that we can secure the necessary support across all three opposition parties for a non-labour coalition government in cardiff bay , " he said .
earlier , plaid chair john dixon had said saturday 's meeting was the first opportunity for the party 's national executive to look at all the options since the election .
" to date , the only decision that plaid cymru has taken since the election has been to talk to everybody and see what might be possible , " he said .
" there has to come a point ... at which you start looking at these options and start saying ' well , which actually represents the best way forward for wales ? " '
labour on friday , welsh labour 's party national executive decided to hold a special conference on 6 july .
labour party 's chairman , tecwyn thomas , said the executive thought it was " right and proper that the wider party be consulted in the fairest and most open way possible " .
the latest round of discussions came after labour fell five seats short of an outright majority in last month 's election .
although mr morgan was reinstalled in the top job , he could be forced out if plaid team up with the conservatives and the lib dems .

the decision was taken unanimously by the party 's national executive committee at a meeting in aberystwyth .
first minister rhodri morgan has offered a deal to plaid to support his minority assembly government .
plaid could still opt for a rainbow coalition with the tories and lib dems , but this was not discussed on saturday .
a plaid spokesman said a rainbow deal was not considered by the executive committee , as no request was made to do so by the party 's group of ams , which had met earlier in the day .
when asked if the rainbow coalition was dead , plaid leader ieuan wyn jones said that it was not .
how the assembly stands labour - 26 seats plaid cymru - 15 conservatives - 12 liberal democrats - 6 independent - 1 plaid will now concentrate on discussions with labour , and mr jones predicted that the discussions will now take days and not weeks .
both labour and plaid are set to hold special conferences in july in which the wider party memberships would have their say on any coalition deals .
a spokesperson for welsh labour leader and first minister rhodri morgan said plaid 's decision to continue talks was " a positive outcome in both parties " .
" meetings will now resume on monday so that a specific fully worked-up set of proposals are available for the respective party conferences to consider , " said the spokesperson .
reacting to the news , a spokesperson for the lib dem assembly leader mike german said plaid can not " keep two balls in the air indefinitely " .
" i hope the party will move swiftly to make a firm recommendation as rapidly as possible .
the people of wales want certainty . "
and welsh tory leader nick bourne said he believed the rainbow alliance was still a possibility .
" i remain confident that we can secure the necessary support across all three opposition parties for a non-labour coalition government in cardiff bay , " he said .
earlier , plaid chair john dixon had said saturday 's meeting was the first opportunity for the party 's national executive to look at all the options since the election .
" to date , the only decision that plaid cymru has taken since the election has been to talk to everybody and see what might be possible , " he said .
" there has to come a point ... at which you start looking at these options and start saying ' well , which actually represents the best way forward for wales ? " '
labour on friday , welsh labour 's party national executive decided to hold a special conference on 6 july .
labour party 's chairman , tecwyn thomas , said the executive thought it was " right and proper that the wider party be consulted in the fairest and most open way possible " .
the latest round of discussions came after labour fell five seats short of an outright majority in last month 's election .
although mr morgan was reinstalled in the top job , he could be forced out if plaid team up with the conservatives and the lib dems .

ofsted says that in england , which it covers , re is being taught better .
' standard responses ' in many schools , religion is linked with contemporary religious and moral issues , such as whether the war in iraq was morally justified .

one of the most radical suggestions in ofsted 's report is that religion should be taught warts and all .

' solve issues themselves ' angus dawson , re teacher at royal manor arts college in portland , has long found that pupils enjoy the ambiguity of religion , enjoying the " struggle between ideas " where there are often no right answers .

" we agree that the potential of re to contribute to children 's education and understanding in these areas should be fully realised . "
re has long suffered a lack of specialist teachers , but ofsted focuses on weakness in how progress is assessed , and the way the curriculum is planned , for the inadequacies in the subject .
it says that lessons often fail to build on prior learning .
there is no national curriculum in re .
instead , all 151 local authorities are responsible for developing their own locally agreed syllabus .
ofsted says that hinders attempts to raise standards in re , and consistency , across the country .

after a five-year inspection of re classes which began in the year of the attacks on the us , ofsted says rote learning of re is no longer adequate .
it says teachers should include ways in which religion is not always a force for good .
increasingly pupils have been opting to study re for gcse and a-level exams .
ofsted says that in england , which it covers , re is being taught better .
' standard responses ' in many schools , religion is linked with contemporary religious and moral issues , such as whether the war in iraq was morally justified .
but all too often , say the inspectors , the exam system encourages " standard , mechanistic responses " running the risk of " trivialising significant religious issues " .
it says students are often denied the profound understanding they need of the impact of religion on society .
this has raised people 's awareness of religion and raised the importance of considering religion 's role in society miriam rosen , ofsted " religion is much more in the media than it has been in recent years " says ofsted 's director of education , miriam rosen , " and this is , of course , because of events like the bombings in london in july 2005 and the new york incident back in 2001 .
" this has raised people 's awareness of religion and raised the importance of considering religion 's role in society , and the impact of it . "
one of the most radical suggestions in ofsted 's report is that religion should be taught warts and all .
the inspectors called on teachers not to shy away from controversy , but to accept in their classes that religion could be a force for bad as well as for good .
" pupils should be taught that religion is complex , " says the report , " and should be given the opportunity to explore that ambiguity . "
' solve issues themselves ' angus dawson , re teacher at royal manor arts college in portland , has long found that pupils enjoy the ambiguity of religion , enjoying the " struggle between ideas " where there are often no right answers .
" we embrace the idea that religious ideas lead to conflict , " said mr dawson .
" the skills we teach -lrb- pupils -rrb- allow them to unpack the ambiguity and tension between ideas in a clear and straightforward way and to solve the issues for themselves . "
but that level of achievement is too rare says ofsted .
miriam rosen said : " they 're not really concentrating on teaching about the role of religion in society and its contribution towards community cohesion .
the very best are , but this is not consistently done . "
ofsted says attempts to raise standards are hindered by no curriculum schools minister andrew adonis said re can help educate children about issues surrounding community , diversity and tolerance .
he said : " religious education is an important academic subject in its own right but it can also make a positive contribution to pupils ' broad personal development and well-being , as well as bringing in issues of community cohesion , diversity , tolerance and respect .
" we agree that the potential of re to contribute to children 's education and understanding in these areas should be fully realised . "
re has long suffered a lack of specialist teachers , but ofsted focuses on weakness in how progress is assessed , and the way the curriculum is planned , for the inadequacies in the subject .
it says that lessons often fail to build on prior learning .
there is no national curriculum in re .
instead , all 151 local authorities are responsible for developing their own locally agreed syllabus .
ofsted says that hinders attempts to raise standards in re , and consistency , across the country .
and those improvements are overdue .
ofsted says only a quarter of schools - albeit on its fairly small sample - were recorded as producing " good " achievement or better in pupils .
one in eight were failing to produce even " adequate " achievement .
