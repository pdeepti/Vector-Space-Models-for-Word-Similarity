" we are carefully watching how state-controlled corporate entities from russia , china and the middle east are taking a stake in or buying companies , " deputy finance minister thomas mirow told the handelsblatt daily on monday . it often remains unclear what motivates the state-controlled funds which are increasingly looking to german companies , said mirow , who added that more and more foreign financial institutes want to invest in germany . protective measures coming ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ackermann said germany needs to decide what sectors it wants to keep its own high-ranking german officials are also considering if and how the country should implement measures to protect the country 's core business from foreign takeovers , government spokesman ulrich wilhelm said monday in berlin . " considerations over whether we should come to a particular balance have been going on here for a series of months , " he said . deutsche bank ceo josef ackermann said last week that the government needed to decide if it wanted to defend domestic business from state-run foreign investment funds . " i say we need to define strategic core areas and business sectors where we have the feeling that we need to have control as a country , " he said .
" in any case , we definitely should be doing it . " precursor of protectionism ? economics minister michael glos has also said that his department was looking at how other european nations protected their domestic industries , though he added that he did not want germany to be a forerunner when it came to protectionism . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a small portion of chinese or russian reserves could buy out several german companies state-owned investment funds are estimated to have a combined wealth of $ 2.5 trillion , according to morgan stanley . russia is reported currently to have foreign currency reserves of over $ 400 billion while china 's are estimated to be $ 1.2 trillion .
both countries are putting a large portion of the money in state-run funds that then buy shares in western companies . german finance minister peer steinbrück has said if china were to spend just part of its reserves it would be able to swallow several " big , fat , lovely " german companies .
he also added that the german cabinet was likely to address possible protective market measures this august . but not everyone in germany is happy to see the european union 's largest economy considering protective market measures . " this is a precursor of a new protectionism debate , and i 'd warn against that , " bert rürup , who heads germany 's panel of " five economic wise men , " said friday in an interview with the reuters news agency . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

1 to submit an alternative to a modern bridge planned for the park-like elbe valley near dresden , or the area may lose its world heritage status , the united nation 's world heritage committee announced on monday .
" if present plans for a bridge were replaced by a solution that respected the outstanding universal value of the cultural landscape , the site would remain on the world heritage list , " a statement on the organization 's web site said .
after evaluating the alternative plans for the the waldschlösschen bridge , the unesco committee will decide if the ensemble of gardens , palaces , woods and meadows along 20 kilometers -lrb- 12.4 miles -rrb- of the valley on both sides of the elbe will continue to qualify for world heritage status .
new deadline for dresden bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dresden will remain on the unesco watch list until at least october " by october we have to present something that can not be presented , " jan mücke , one of dresden 's representatives in germany 's national parliament , told dpa news service .
" basically , we just have a new deadline . "
the valley was designated as one of 830 sites currently on the world heritage list in 2004 , but plans for building a bridge across the elbe river have threatened its listing for the past two years .
the committee decided monday to leave it on the list of endangered places .
it has never before struck a heritage site off its list , and the eastern german city 's tourist officials are working to make sure the elbe valley is n't the first place to be de-listed .
city officials , however , have said the growing traffic has forced them to build a new bridge , estimated to cost 160 million euros -lrb- $ 215 million -rrb- .
residents , in a 2005 referendum , voted in favor of the bridge , and the german constitutional court ruled earlier this month that the people 's voice should have priority over retaining international honors .
tunnel a possibility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2005 , residents voted for an additional way to get across the elbe a tunnel connecting both sides of the elbe could represent a compromise that would meet the unesco committee 's demands as well as fulfill the public 's will , according to ralf weber , a dresden architecture professor who traveled to christchurch , new zealand , where the committee met .
" in their speeches , almost every delegate country identified a tunnel as the preferred solution , " he told dpa .
according to unesco , the bridge design is too " heavy " and would degrade the landscape .
the committee meetings , which run until july 2 and are closed to the public , will consider new site nominations , sites in danger , site management and protection .
they will also draw up lists for possible future world heritage sites . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

officials urge caution , but say there is no need to panic . veterinary experts confirmed on sunday that six wild birds found dead in two lakes near the southeastern german city nuremberg were infected with the deadly h5n1 virus . a health official at the friedrich loeffler institute said that tests were still being carried out on another five dead birds which tested positive for h5n1 , but it was still unclear whether they were infected with the deadly asian strain , which claimed nearly 200 lives since 2003 according to the world health organization . scientists fear that the virus could mutate into a form that makes human-to-human transmission possible , thereby setting off a global epidemic .
in order to contain the spread of the deadly virus , hundreds of millions of birds have been slaughtered worldwide since the first cases were discovered . no present danger to humans , but caution necessary germany 's agriculture minister horst seehofer told the newspaper münchner merkur , that there was no need to panic , but warned against contact with infected animals .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 25.06.2007 spd rejects left 's offer to help take over chancellery großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spd could head the german government if it met four left party demands , lafontaine said the social democratic party could leave its current ratings rut and head up the german government if it worked with the left party and met a few conditions , the opposition party 's head said .
the spd has refused the deal . social democratic party chairman kurt beck could " be the chancellor tomorrow " if he accepted the left party 's demands for changes to germany 's labor , social and foreign policies , oskar lafontaine , a former spd party head and current left party chair , said in an interview published monday . " when -lrb- beck -rrb- asks , ' are you ready to push through a minimum wage , reinstate the old pension system , revise hartz iv -lrb- social welfare reforms -rrb- and pull troops out of afghanistan ? ' then beck can be chancellor tomorrow , " lafontaine told german news magazine der spiegel . a coalition of the spd , the left and the greens would represent a majority of parliamentary seats .
but beck , along with other high-ranking spd party members , flatly refused lafontaine 's offer at a weekend conference to determine the spd 's future direction . general rejection among spd bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few in the spd are interested in hearing lafontaine 's suggestions " the offer is ludicrous , " spd parliamentary group leader peter struck told sunday 's bild am sonntag newspaper .
" the left party will be in the opposition forever . " made up of disgruntled , left-leaning ex-social democrats and members of the former east german communists , the left party won its first seats in a western state government last month and has risen in political polls to 10 percent , putting it on equal footing with the green party and a point ahead of the free-market liberal fdp , according to a dimap survey conducted for the ard public broadcasting network . currently trailing the cdu by 9 percent , beck worked over the weekend to separate his party from both the left and the cdu by concentrating on domestic labor issues while chancellor angela merkel continues making a name for herself on the international stage . social and economic responsibility " we want economic goals to be inseparably connected to social justice and ecological rationality , " beck said in a speech broken up several times by applause .
" we will seek a very clear position on putting people first in the economy , contrasting neo-liberal developments in the cdu . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beck is hoping things will start looking up for his party soon beck said part of the spd 's strategy would include continuing to push for a national minimum wage , a topic of conflict in the grand coalition of spd and christian conservatives , after the cabinet reached a compromise on extending wage protections to a dozen industrial sectors . " we want social economics to be protected in the future , " he said .
" whoever works full-time has to be able to live from it . " the cdu has strongly opposed a national minimum wage . more common ground with the left ? that , however , is one of the spd 's goals that could be reached if it would leave the grand coalition and agree to working with the left , according to dietmar bartsch , the left 's general manager . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : left members said the spd needs their help to make germany more social " the spd will book success on neither the minimum wage nor the inheritance tax with the cdu or fdp , " he told monday 's leipziger volkszeitung .
" it will only work with us .

the spd has refused the deal . social democratic party chairman kurt beck could " be the chancellor tomorrow " if he accepted the left party 's demands for changes to germany 's labor , social and foreign policies , oskar lafontaine , a former spd party head and current left party chair , said in an interview published monday .

the central council of muslims in germany -lrb- zmd -rrb- harshly criticized the christian churches after high-ranking german clergyman cardinal karl lehmann last week spoke out against islam enjoying equal status to christianity . " the -lrb- christian -rrb- churches would like to ban islam to the lower leagues , " aiman mazyek , general secretary of the central council of muslims in germany , told the sunday edition of berlin 's tagesspiegel .
mazyek also pointed out that germany 's basic law ascribes equality to all religions , saying that there were no legal grounds for granting christianity special legal status .
neutrality or indifference ?
the council 's criticism came in response to comments made last week by cardinal karl lehmann , head of the german conference of bishops , who had warned against interpreting the state 's religious neutrality as " uncritical tolerance . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cardinal karl lehmann lehmann also expressed concern about all faiths being treated equally , regardless of their historical significance in europe .
" cardinal lehmann is mistaken if he thinks that the fact that europe and germany were undeniably shaped by christianity justifies the legal discrimination of other religions , " said volker beck , head of germany 's green party .
however , germany 's numerous muslim organizations have to fulfill the country 's legal requirements for becoming a religious group if they are to enjoy the same rights , added beck .
germany 's 3.2 million muslims are not represented by a single umbrella organization , but by many smaller ones . cultural roots ronald pofalla , general secretary of the conservative christian democratic union , agreed with lehmann that islam should not be granted the same legal standing as christianity .
" unlike christianity , islam is not in europe 's cultural center and is not reflected in everyday life in the same way , " pofalla said in a statement .
" only those who are conscious of their cultural and social roots can freely and openly stand up for the rights of people of different faiths , " he added . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the central council of muslims in germany -lrb- zmd -rrb- harshly criticized the christian churches after high-ranking german clergyman cardinal karl lehmann last week spoke out against islam enjoying equal status to christianity . " the -lrb- christian -rrb- churches would like to ban islam to the lower leagues , " aiman mazyek , general secretary of the central council of muslims in germany , told the sunday edition of berlin 's tagesspiegel .
mazyek also pointed out that germany 's basic law ascribes equality to all religions , saying that there were no legal grounds for granting christianity special legal status .
neutrality or indifference ?
the council 's criticism came in response to comments made last week by cardinal karl lehmann , head of the german conference of bishops , who had warned against interpreting the state 's religious neutrality as " uncritical tolerance . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cardinal karl lehmann lehmann also expressed concern about all faiths being treated equally , regardless of their historical significance in europe .
" cardinal lehmann is mistaken if he thinks that the fact that europe and germany were undeniably shaped by christianity justifies the legal discrimination of other religions , " said volker beck , head of germany 's green party .
however , germany 's numerous muslim organizations have to fulfill the country 's legal requirements for becoming a religious group if they are to enjoy the same rights , added beck .
germany 's 3.2 million muslims are not represented by a single umbrella organization , but by many smaller ones . cultural roots ronald pofalla , general secretary of the conservative christian democratic union , agreed with lehmann that islam should not be granted the same legal standing as christianity .
" unlike christianity , islam is not in europe 's cultural center and is not reflected in everyday life in the same way , " pofalla said in a statement .
" only those who are conscious of their cultural and social roots can freely and openly stand up for the rights of people of different faiths , " he added . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the spd has refused the deal . social democratic party chairman kurt beck could " be the chancellor tomorrow " if he accepted the left party 's demands for changes to germany 's labor , social and foreign policies , oskar lafontaine , a former spd party head and current left party chair , said in an interview published monday . " when -lrb- beck -rrb- asks , ' are you ready to push through a minimum wage , reinstate the old pension system , revise hartz iv -lrb- social welfare reforms -rrb- and pull troops out of afghanistan ? ' then beck can be chancellor tomorrow , " lafontaine told german news magazine der spiegel . a coalition of the spd , the left and the greens would represent a majority of parliamentary seats .
but beck , along with other high-ranking spd party members , flatly refused lafontaine 's offer at a weekend conference to determine the spd 's future direction . general rejection among spd bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few in the spd are interested in hearing lafontaine 's suggestions " the offer is ludicrous , " spd parliamentary group leader peter struck told sunday 's bild am sonntag newspaper .
" the left party will be in the opposition forever . " made up of disgruntled , left-leaning ex-social democrats and members of the former east german communists , the left party won its first seats in a western state government last month and has risen in political polls to 10 percent , putting it on equal footing with the green party and a point ahead of the free-market liberal fdp , according to a dimap survey conducted for the ard public broadcasting network . currently trailing the cdu by 9 percent , beck worked over the weekend to separate his party from both the left and the cdu by concentrating on domestic labor issues while chancellor angela merkel continues making a name for herself on the international stage . social and economic responsibility " we want economic goals to be inseparably connected to social justice and ecological rationality , " beck said in a speech broken up several times by applause .
" we will seek a very clear position on putting people first in the economy , contrasting neo-liberal developments in the cdu . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beck is hoping things will start looking up for his party soon beck said part of the spd 's strategy would include continuing to push for a national minimum wage , a topic of conflict in the grand coalition of spd and christian conservatives , after the cabinet reached a compromise on extending wage protections to a dozen industrial sectors . " we want social economics to be protected in the future , " he said .
" whoever works full-time has to be able to live from it . " the cdu has strongly opposed a national minimum wage . more common ground with the left ? that , however , is one of the spd 's goals that could be reached if it would leave the grand coalition and agree to working with the left , according to dietmar bartsch , the left 's general manager . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : left members said the spd needs their help to make germany more social " the spd will book success on neither the minimum wage nor the inheritance tax with the cdu or fdp , " he told monday 's leipziger volkszeitung .
" it will only work with us . " but even though the spd would be able to push through a national minimum wage with lafontaine 's help , a coalition would cost the social democrats more than they would gain , according to environment minister sigmar gabriel . " we could probably reach a minimum wage decision with him , but the price would be to isolate germany , " gabriel told the daily süddeutsche zeitung on monday . gabriel also said he doubted the sincerity of lafontaine 's offer , saying it had more to do with presenting himself in the media than with political decision making . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the -lrb- christian -rrb- churches would like to ban islam to the lower leagues , " aiman mazyek , general secretary of the central council of muslims in germany , told the sunday edition of berlin 's tagesspiegel .
mazyek also pointed out that germany 's basic law ascribes equality to all religions , saying that there were no legal grounds for granting christianity special legal status .
neutrality or indifference ?
the council 's criticism came in response to comments made last week by cardinal karl lehmann , head of the german conference of bishops , who had warned against interpreting the state 's religious neutrality as " uncritical tolerance . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cardinal karl lehmann lehmann also expressed concern about all faiths being treated equally , regardless of their historical significance in europe .
" cardinal lehmann is mistaken if he thinks that the fact that europe and germany were undeniably shaped by christianity justifies the legal discrimination of other religions , " said volker beck , head of germany 's green party .
however , germany 's numerous muslim organizations have to fulfill the country 's legal requirements for becoming a religious group if they are to enjoy the same rights , added beck .
germany 's 3.2 million muslims are not represented by a single umbrella organization , but by many smaller ones . cultural roots ronald pofalla , general secretary of the conservative christian democratic union , agreed with lehmann that islam should not be granted the same legal standing as christianity .
" unlike christianity , islam is not in europe 's cultural center and is not reflected in everyday life in the same way , " pofalla said in a statement .

the central council of muslims in germany -lrb- zmd -rrb- harshly criticized the christian churches after high-ranking german clergyman cardinal karl lehmann last week spoke out against islam enjoying equal status to christianity . " the -lrb- christian -rrb- churches would like to ban islam to the lower leagues , " aiman mazyek , general secretary of the central council of muslims in germany , told the sunday edition of berlin 's tagesspiegel .
mazyek also pointed out that germany 's basic law ascribes equality to all religions , saying that there were no legal grounds for granting christianity special legal status .
neutrality or indifference ?
the council 's criticism came in response to comments made last week by cardinal karl lehmann , head of the german conference of bishops , who had warned against interpreting the state 's religious neutrality as " uncritical tolerance . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cardinal karl lehmann lehmann also expressed concern about all faiths being treated equally , regardless of their historical significance in europe .
" cardinal lehmann is mistaken if he thinks that the fact that europe and germany were undeniably shaped by christianity justifies the legal discrimination of other religions , " said volker beck , head of germany 's green party .
however , germany 's numerous muslim organizations have to fulfill the country 's legal requirements for becoming a religious group if they are to enjoy the same rights , added beck .
germany 's 3.2 million muslims are not represented by a single umbrella organization , but by many smaller ones . cultural roots ronald pofalla , general secretary of the conservative christian democratic union , agreed with lehmann that islam should not be granted the same legal standing as christianity .
" unlike christianity , islam is not in europe 's cultural center and is not reflected in everyday life in the same way , " pofalla said in a statement .
" only those who are conscious of their cultural and social roots can freely and openly stand up for the rights of people of different faiths , " he added . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the spd has refused the deal . social democratic party chairman kurt beck could " be the chancellor tomorrow " if he accepted the left party 's demands for changes to germany 's labor , social and foreign policies , oskar lafontaine , a former spd party head and current left party chair , said in an interview published monday . " when -lrb- beck -rrb- asks , ' are you ready to push through a minimum wage , reinstate the old pension system , revise hartz iv -lrb- social welfare reforms -rrb- and pull troops out of afghanistan ? ' then beck can be chancellor tomorrow , " lafontaine told german news magazine der spiegel . a coalition of the spd , the left and the greens would represent a majority of parliamentary seats .
but beck , along with other high-ranking spd party members , flatly refused lafontaine 's offer at a weekend conference to determine the spd 's future direction . general rejection among spd bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few in the spd are interested in hearing lafontaine 's suggestions " the offer is ludicrous , " spd parliamentary group leader peter struck told sunday 's bild am sonntag newspaper .
" the left party will be in the opposition forever . " made up of disgruntled , left-leaning ex-social democrats and members of the former east german communists , the left party won its first seats in a western state government last month and has risen in political polls to 10 percent , putting it on equal footing with the green party and a point ahead of the free-market liberal fdp , according to a dimap survey conducted for the ard public broadcasting network . currently trailing the cdu by 9 percent , beck worked over the weekend to separate his party from both the left and the cdu by concentrating on domestic labor issues while chancellor angela merkel continues making a name for herself on the international stage . social and economic responsibility " we want economic goals to be inseparably connected to social justice and ecological rationality , " beck said in a speech broken up several times by applause .
" we will seek a very clear position on putting people first in the economy , contrasting neo-liberal developments in the cdu . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beck is hoping things will start looking up for his party soon beck said part of the spd 's strategy would include continuing to push for a national minimum wage , a topic of conflict in the grand coalition of spd and christian conservatives , after the cabinet reached a compromise on extending wage protections to a dozen industrial sectors . " we want social economics to be protected in the future , " he said .
" whoever works full-time has to be able to live from it . " the cdu has strongly opposed a national minimum wage . more common ground with the left ? that , however , is one of the spd 's goals that could be reached if it would leave the grand coalition and agree to working with the left , according to dietmar bartsch , the left 's general manager . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : left members said the spd needs their help to make germany more social " the spd will book success on neither the minimum wage nor the inheritance tax with the cdu or fdp , " he told monday 's leipziger volkszeitung .
" it will only work with us . " but even though the spd would be able to push through a national minimum wage with lafontaine 's help , a coalition would cost the social democrats more than they would gain , according to environment minister sigmar gabriel . " we could probably reach a minimum wage decision with him , but the price would be to isolate germany , " gabriel told the daily süddeutsche zeitung on monday . gabriel also said he doubted the sincerity of lafontaine 's offer , saying it had more to do with presenting himself in the media than with political decision making . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 25.06.2007 readers assess eu treaty summit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : should poland take a lower profile ?
readers had mixed opinions readers weighed in on last week 's eu summit to revise the bloc 's constitutional draft . the following comments reflect the views of dw-world.de readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . the tension between less populated states and states with large populations , such as california where i live , is a fact of life in the united states and is a reality with which the eu will always have to contend .
the problem in the us has been more or less solved by allowing power to be shared based on population -lrb- the house of representatives in the us congress -rrb- and by allowing power to be shared based on individual state representation -lrb- the senate in the us congress -rrb- .
poland is not accustomed to having to work with other nations in the manner expected by the eu .
smaller nations like poland must develop their diplomatic skills and must learn to make strategic alliances within the eu to advance their agenda . - g. randel , us the countries in europe that are serious about their membership within the eu may want to form closer integration and cooperation , while countries like britain , poland and others may want to stay in the outer group .
of course this may eventually lead to a change in financial contributions for the ones that pay and the ones that receive .
it sounds fairer than the present system . - adam , canada i want to express my deep concern and disappointment of angela merkel 's behavior during the summit .
isolating poland during the summit and continuing the session without poland had nothing to do with common values and solidarity .
it was an example either of brutal pressure or a lack of the solidarity that germany talks so much about .
other members like portugal or slovenia understand more about freedom of opinions , negotiations and consensus within the eu than the powerful presidency of germany .
this is what eu means for me as a pole : solidarity , freedom and common understanding . - l. wojtowicz , poland as a new member of the eu , poland would be wise to try to fit in .
a backlash would hurt poland like in the past .
a lot of europeans want to move forward and have no time for such backward thinking . - d. noack , canada bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solidary , freedom and understanding are the eu ideals , wrote one polish reader british and poles were right .
german domination must be stopped .
comments about britain and poland from the german press are sickening . - maria , australia from the articles i have read -lrb- i do n't know the whole scope of the new agreement but -rrb- , it appears to say " to hell with what the people of europe want , we socialists know best . "
it could be a very disturbing trend toward less power by the people and a rise of a socialist aristocracy . - l. thrash , usa why should the european union pay much attention to what britain and poland say ?
poland is still stuck in the time warp of world war two , and britain is working as an agent provocateur for the us .
both poland and britain do not serve the interests of the european union , but have their own agendas .
blair has been the cause of a lot of disruption in the eu and now has a partner in poland .
if poland is complaining about its population that was decimated in world war two , why did it open hidden concentration camps on its own territory ?
poland has been wrong and will continue to be wrong as long as it digs up the recent past . - k. t. tellis , canada i can not believe that the two brothers represent the opinion of the polish people .
maybe they should go and get a life , if you know what i mean ! - hans , us this is no way to build trust and friendship in this rather unfriendly atmosphere .
but the big brother in the us allows the polish premier to say unfriendly words on the eu voting reform without having to fear economic consequences . - g. gosau , canada yes , for me it 's thumbs up !
the almost impossible was accomplished through skillful diplomacy .
britain with blair put the road blocks , but was outsmarted .
poland can not distinguish between patriotism and nationalism .
maybe future leaders will realize that if they are not prepared to give and take , they 'll isolate themselves . - e. heptner , usa the eu is better off without countries like poland , which not just hold the eu back , but increase the likelihood of its disintegration .
the eu has to be a union of like-minded nations .
poland is not one of those , and nor is england for that matter . - c. ranaweera , canada compiled by dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german press slams poland and britain after summit the german press on sunday slammed poland and britain for putting obstacles on the road to the deal reached on guidelines for a new european union treaty at the bloc 's summit this week .
-lrb- 24.06.2007 -rrb- readers weigh in on poland 's stance in treaty discussions as the european union entered discussion this week on revising the draft of its constitutional treaty , poland expressed discontentment with the existing voting system .
readers responded to this week 's discussion .
-lrb- 22.06.2007 -rrb- readers respond to conflict over eu treaty just prior to this week 's eu constitutional treaty summit , poland insisted that changes be made to the treaty 's voting system .
can and should the document be rescued ?

readers had mixed opinions readers weighed in on last week 's eu summit to revise the bloc 's constitutional draft . the following comments reflect the views of dw-world.de readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . the tension between less populated states and states with large populations , such as california where i live , is a fact of life in the united states and is a reality with which the eu will always have to contend .
the problem in the us has been more or less solved by allowing power to be shared based on population -lrb- the house of representatives in the us congress -rrb- and by allowing power to be shared based on individual state representation -lrb- the senate in the us congress -rrb- .
poland is not accustomed to having to work with other nations in the manner expected by the eu .
smaller nations like poland must develop their diplomatic skills and must learn to make strategic alliances within the eu to advance their agenda . - g. randel , us the countries in europe that are serious about their membership within the eu may want to form closer integration and cooperation , while countries like britain , poland and others may want to stay in the outer group .
of course this may eventually lead to a change in financial contributions for the ones that pay and the ones that receive .
it sounds fairer than the present system . - adam , canada i want to express my deep concern and disappointment of angela merkel 's behavior during the summit .
isolating poland during the summit and continuing the session without poland had nothing to do with common values and solidarity .
it was an example either of brutal pressure or a lack of the solidarity that germany talks so much about .
other members like portugal or slovenia understand more about freedom of opinions , negotiations and consensus within the eu than the powerful presidency of germany .
this is what eu means for me as a pole : solidarity , freedom and common understanding . - l. wojtowicz , poland as a new member of the eu , poland would be wise to try to fit in .
a backlash would hurt poland like in the past .
a lot of europeans want to move forward and have no time for such backward thinking . - d. noack , canada bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solidary , freedom and understanding are the eu ideals , wrote one polish reader british and poles were right .
german domination must be stopped .
comments about britain and poland from the german press are sickening . - maria , australia from the articles i have read -lrb- i do n't know the whole scope of the new agreement but -rrb- , it appears to say " to hell with what the people of europe want , we socialists know best . "
it could be a very disturbing trend toward less power by the people and a rise of a socialist aristocracy . - l. thrash , usa why should the european union pay much attention to what britain and poland say ?
poland is still stuck in the time warp of world war two , and britain is working as an agent provocateur for the us .
both poland and britain do not serve the interests of the european union , but have their own agendas .
blair has been the cause of a lot of disruption in the eu and now has a partner in poland .
if poland is complaining about its population that was decimated in world war two , why did it open hidden concentration camps on its own territory ?
poland has been wrong and will continue to be wrong as long as it digs up the recent past . - k. t. tellis , canada i can not believe that the two brothers represent the opinion of the polish people .
maybe they should go and get a life , if you know what i mean ! - hans , us this is no way to build trust and friendship in this rather unfriendly atmosphere .
but the big brother in the us allows the polish premier to say unfriendly words on the eu voting reform without having to fear economic consequences . - g. gosau , canada yes , for me it 's thumbs up !
the almost impossible was accomplished through skillful diplomacy .
britain with blair put the road blocks , but was outsmarted .
poland can not distinguish between patriotism and nationalism .
maybe future leaders will realize that if they are not prepared to give and take , they 'll isolate themselves . - e. heptner , usa the eu is better off without countries like poland , which not just hold the eu back , but increase the likelihood of its disintegration .
the eu has to be a union of like-minded nations .
poland is not one of those , and nor is england for that matter . - c. ranaweera , canada compiled by dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german press slams poland and britain after summit the german press on sunday slammed poland and britain for putting obstacles on the road to the deal reached on guidelines for a new european union treaty at the bloc 's summit this week .
-lrb- 24.06.2007 -rrb- readers weigh in on poland 's stance in treaty discussions as the european union entered discussion this week on revising the draft of its constitutional treaty , poland expressed discontentment with the existing voting system .

readers had mixed opinions readers weighed in on last week 's eu summit to revise the bloc 's constitutional draft . the following comments reflect the views of dw-world.de readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . the tension between less populated states and states with large populations , such as california where i live , is a fact of life in the united states and is a reality with which the eu will always have to contend .
the problem in the us has been more or less solved by allowing power to be shared based on population -lrb- the house of representatives in the us congress -rrb- and by allowing power to be shared based on individual state representation -lrb- the senate in the us congress -rrb- .
poland is not accustomed to having to work with other nations in the manner expected by the eu .
smaller nations like poland must develop their diplomatic skills and must learn to make strategic alliances within the eu to advance their agenda . - g. randel , us the countries in europe that are serious about their membership within the eu may want to form closer integration and cooperation , while countries like britain , poland and others may want to stay in the outer group .
of course this may eventually lead to a change in financial contributions for the ones that pay and the ones that receive .
it sounds fairer than the present system . - adam , canada i want to express my deep concern and disappointment of angela merkel 's behavior during the summit .
isolating poland during the summit and continuing the session without poland had nothing to do with common values and solidarity .
it was an example either of brutal pressure or a lack of the solidarity that germany talks so much about .
other members like portugal or slovenia understand more about freedom of opinions , negotiations and consensus within the eu than the powerful presidency of germany .
this is what eu means for me as a pole : solidarity , freedom and common understanding . - l. wojtowicz , poland as a new member of the eu , poland would be wise to try to fit in .
a backlash would hurt poland like in the past .
a lot of europeans want to move forward and have no time for such backward thinking . - d. noack , canada bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solidary , freedom and understanding are the eu ideals , wrote one polish reader british and poles were right .

in order to contain the spread of the deadly virus , hundreds of millions of birds have been slaughtered worldwide since the first cases were discovered . no present danger to humans , but caution necessary germany 's agriculture minister horst seehofer told the newspaper münchner merkur , that there was no need to panic , but warned against contact with infected animals .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de architecture -pipe- 25.06.2007 unesco demands alternatives to dresden bridge großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a narrower bridge or tunnel could be presented as alternatives in three months though the dresden-elbe river valley will remain an official world heritage site for now , unesco threatened to remove it from the list of sites if a bridge near dresden is built across the river as planned . germany has until oct .
1 to submit an alternative to a modern bridge planned for the park-like elbe valley near dresden , or the area may lose its world heritage status , the united nation 's world heritage committee announced on monday .
" if present plans for a bridge were replaced by a solution that respected the outstanding universal value of the cultural landscape , the site would remain on the world heritage list , " a statement on the organization 's web site said .
after evaluating the alternative plans for the the waldschlösschen bridge , the unesco committee will decide if the ensemble of gardens , palaces , woods and meadows along 20 kilometers -lrb- 12.4 miles -rrb- of the valley on both sides of the elbe will continue to qualify for world heritage status .
new deadline for dresden bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dresden will remain on the unesco watch list until at least october " by october we have to present something that can not be presented , " jan mücke , one of dresden 's representatives in germany 's national parliament , told dpa news service .
" basically , we just have a new deadline . "
the valley was designated as one of 830 sites currently on the world heritage list in 2004 , but plans for building a bridge across the elbe river have threatened its listing for the past two years .
the committee decided monday to leave it on the list of endangered places .
it has never before struck a heritage site off its list , and the eastern german city 's tourist officials are working to make sure the elbe valley is n't the first place to be de-listed .
city officials , however , have said the growing traffic has forced them to build a new bridge , estimated to cost 160 million euros -lrb- $ 215 million -rrb- .
residents , in a 2005 referendum , voted in favor of the bridge , and the german constitutional court ruled earlier this month that the people 's voice should have priority over retaining international honors .
tunnel a possibility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2005 , residents voted for an additional way to get across the elbe a tunnel connecting both sides of the elbe could represent a compromise that would meet the unesco committee 's demands as well as fulfill the public 's will , according to ralf weber , a dresden architecture professor who traveled to christchurch , new zealand , where the committee met .
" in their speeches , almost every delegate country identified a tunnel as the preferred solution , " he told dpa .
according to unesco , the bridge design is too " heavy " and would degrade the landscape .
the committee meetings , which run until july 2 and are closed to the public , will consider new site nominations , sites in danger , site management and protection .
they will also draw up lists for possible future world heritage sites . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de dresden changes bridge plan in bid to placate unesco unesco has threatened to strip dresden of its world cultural heritage site status , if the city builds a new bridge over the elbe river .
but municipal leaders now hope a revised design will solve the conflict .
-lrb- 13.06.2007 -rrb- new bridge could cost dresden its unesco title a saxon state court has ruled that a bridge project in dresden , approved by referendum in 2005 , should go ahead despite warnings that the modern structure would disqualify dresden from unesco 's world heritage list .

since the mice had been genetically engineered not to respond to cannabinoids , either thc or its natural equivalents generated in the brain , the researchers realized that they hit upon a discovery . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rash disappear when scientists dabbed a bit of granny 's ointment on mouse ears they realized that cannabinoids operate like the brakes of a car , and prevent the body ’ s immune system from triggering inflammatory red sores . for two decades , scientists have known that the brain produces cannabinoids naturally , but they are still trying to figure out how thc regulates the immune system . the bonn scientists then started dabbing a bit of granny ’ s concoction on the skin of the poor little mice , and bingo — the swelling and redness disappeared . professor thomas tuting , a member of the team , said : " if we dabbed thc solution onto the animals ' skin shortly before and after applying the allergen -lrb- the ear clips -rrb- , a lot less swelling occurred than normal . ” tuting added that the amount of thc required to treat skin allergies wouldn ’ t be enough to induce a high though .
in other words , cannabis skin lotion could make a comeback , but just don ’ t count on it as a recreational drug . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it has never before struck a heritage site off its list , and the eastern german city 's tourist officials are working to make sure the elbe valley is n't the first place to be de-listed .
city officials , however , have said the growing traffic has forced them to build a new bridge , estimated to cost 160 million euros -lrb- $ 215 million -rrb- .
residents , in a 2005 referendum , voted in favor of the bridge , and the german constitutional court ruled earlier this month that the people 's voice should have priority over retaining international honors .
tunnel a possibility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2005 , residents voted for an additional way to get across the elbe a tunnel connecting both sides of the elbe could represent a compromise that would meet the unesco committee 's demands as well as fulfill the public 's will , according to ralf weber , a dresden architecture professor who traveled to christchurch , new zealand , where the committee met .
" in their speeches , almost every delegate country identified a tunnel as the preferred solution , " he told dpa .
according to unesco , the bridge design is too " heavy " and would degrade the landscape .
the committee meetings , which run until july 2 and are closed to the public , will consider new site nominations , sites in danger , site management and protection .
they will also draw up lists for possible future world heritage sites . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the central council of muslims in germany -lrb- zmd -rrb- harshly criticized the christian churches after high-ranking german clergyman cardinal karl lehmann last week spoke out against islam enjoying equal status to christianity . " the -lrb- christian -rrb- churches would like to ban islam to the lower leagues , " aiman mazyek , general secretary of the central council of muslims in germany , told the sunday edition of berlin 's tagesspiegel .
mazyek also pointed out that germany 's basic law ascribes equality to all religions , saying that there were no legal grounds for granting christianity special legal status .
neutrality or indifference ?
the council 's criticism came in response to comments made last week by cardinal karl lehmann , head of the german conference of bishops , who had warned against interpreting the state 's religious neutrality as " uncritical tolerance . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cardinal karl lehmann lehmann also expressed concern about all faiths being treated equally , regardless of their historical significance in europe .
" cardinal lehmann is mistaken if he thinks that the fact that europe and germany were undeniably shaped by christianity justifies the legal discrimination of other religions , " said volker beck , head of germany 's green party .
however , germany 's numerous muslim organizations have to fulfill the country 's legal requirements for becoming a religious group if they are to enjoy the same rights , added beck .
germany 's 3.2 million muslims are not represented by a single umbrella organization , but by many smaller ones . cultural roots ronald pofalla , general secretary of the conservative christian democratic union , agreed with lehmann that islam should not be granted the same legal standing as christianity .
" unlike christianity , islam is not in europe 's cultural center and is not reflected in everyday life in the same way , " pofalla said in a statement .

" we are carefully watching how state-controlled corporate entities from russia , china and the middle east are taking a stake in or buying companies , " deputy finance minister thomas mirow told the handelsblatt daily on monday . it often remains unclear what motivates the state-controlled funds which are increasingly looking to german companies , said mirow , who added that more and more foreign financial institutes want to invest in germany . protective measures coming ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ackermann said germany needs to decide what sectors it wants to keep its own high-ranking german officials are also considering if and how the country should implement measures to protect the country 's core business from foreign takeovers , government spokesman ulrich wilhelm said monday in berlin . " considerations over whether we should come to a particular balance have been going on here for a series of months , " he said . deutsche bank ceo josef ackermann said last week that the government needed to decide if it wanted to defend domestic business from state-run foreign investment funds . " i say we need to define strategic core areas and business sectors where we have the feeling that we need to have control as a country , " he said .
" in any case , we definitely should be doing it . " precursor of protectionism ? economics minister michael glos has also said that his department was looking at how other european nations protected their domestic industries , though he added that he did not want germany to be a forerunner when it came to protectionism . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a small portion of chinese or russian reserves could buy out several german companies state-owned investment funds are estimated to have a combined wealth of $ 2.5 trillion , according to morgan stanley . russia is reported currently to have foreign currency reserves of over $ 400 billion while china 's are estimated to be $ 1.2 trillion .
both countries are putting a large portion of the money in state-run funds that then buy shares in western companies . german finance minister peer steinbrück has said if china were to spend just part of its reserves it would be able to swallow several " big , fat , lovely " german companies .
he also added that the german cabinet was likely to address possible protective market measures this august . but not everyone in germany is happy to see the european union 's largest economy considering protective market measures . " this is a precursor of a new protectionism debate , and i 'd warn against that , " bert rürup , who heads germany 's panel of " five economic wise men , " said friday in an interview with the reuters news agency . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

officials urge caution , but say there is no need to panic . veterinary experts confirmed on sunday that six wild birds found dead in two lakes near the southeastern german city nuremberg were infected with the deadly h5n1 virus . a health official at the friedrich loeffler institute said that tests were still being carried out on another five dead birds which tested positive for h5n1 , but it was still unclear whether they were infected with the deadly asian strain , which claimed nearly 200 lives since 2003 according to the world health organization . scientists fear that the virus could mutate into a form that makes human-to-human transmission possible , thereby setting off a global epidemic .
in order to contain the spread of the deadly virus , hundreds of millions of birds have been slaughtered worldwide since the first cases were discovered . no present danger to humans , but caution necessary germany 's agriculture minister horst seehofer told the newspaper münchner merkur , that there was no need to panic , but warned against contact with infected animals . " one thing is clear : the virus has not disappeared , " he said . a bird flu outbreak at the end of june is unusual said werner schnappauf , the regional minister of consumer affairs in bavaria in an interview with dpa wire services . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the infected area will be quaranteined for the next three weeks " with such warm temperatures , the virus can barely survive for a week - in cooler weather , four weeks , " he said , adding that there is no present danger for transmission of the virus to humans . local authorities had cordoned off the infected area where the diseased birds were found , which covers a radius of four kilometers -lrb- 2.5 miles -rrb- .
the area will remain quarantined for the next three weeks . over the next few days the city of nuremberg will be supported by a federal epidemiological team which will scientifically investigate the causes and background of the infection cases , city officials said .
they also warned cat and dog owners to keep their pets from straying into the quarantine zone .
possible link to last week 's outbreak in czech republic the new bird flu cases , which killed five swans and one goose , could be related to an outbreak of the same viral strain in the czech republic , which borders germany to the west and is 120 kilometers away from nuremberg .
last week , birds infected with h5n1 were found on a poultry farm in the central part of the czech republic , prompting authorities there to slaughter some 6,000 turkeys . last year in the spring , a bird flu epidemic had also broken out on the island of rügen on the baltic sea and had spread to several other regional states in germany , including bavaria .
the virus had infected other mammals , but did not spread to humans . the last case of bird flu in germany was reported last august in dresden , which is close to the czech border .

after evaluating the alternative plans for the the waldschlösschen bridge , the unesco committee will decide if the ensemble of gardens , palaces , woods and meadows along 20 kilometers -lrb- 12.4 miles -rrb- of the valley on both sides of the elbe will continue to qualify for world heritage status .

" in their speeches , almost every delegate country identified a tunnel as the preferred solution , " he told dpa .
according to unesco , the bridge design is too " heavy " and would degrade the landscape .

not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . the tension between less populated states and states with large populations , such as california where i live , is a fact of life in the united states and is a reality with which the eu will always have to contend .
the problem in the us has been more or less solved by allowing power to be shared based on population -lrb- the house of representatives in the us congress -rrb- and by allowing power to be shared based on individual state representation -lrb- the senate in the us congress -rrb- .
poland is not accustomed to having to work with other nations in the manner expected by the eu .
smaller nations like poland must develop their diplomatic skills and must learn to make strategic alliances within the eu to advance their agenda . - g. randel , us the countries in europe that are serious about their membership within the eu may want to form closer integration and cooperation , while countries like britain , poland and others may want to stay in the outer group .
of course this may eventually lead to a change in financial contributions for the ones that pay and the ones that receive .
it sounds fairer than the present system . - adam , canada i want to express my deep concern and disappointment of angela merkel 's behavior during the summit .
isolating poland during the summit and continuing the session without poland had nothing to do with common values and solidarity .
it was an example either of brutal pressure or a lack of the solidarity that germany talks so much about .
other members like portugal or slovenia understand more about freedom of opinions , negotiations and consensus within the eu than the powerful presidency of germany .
this is what eu means for me as a pole : solidarity , freedom and common understanding . - l. wojtowicz , poland as a new member of the eu , poland would be wise to try to fit in .
a backlash would hurt poland like in the past .
a lot of europeans want to move forward and have no time for such backward thinking . - d. noack , canada bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solidary , freedom and understanding are the eu ideals , wrote one polish reader british and poles were right .

poland is still stuck in the time warp of world war two , and britain is working as an agent provocateur for the us .
both poland and britain do not serve the interests of the european union , but have their own agendas .
blair has been the cause of a lot of disruption in the eu and now has a partner in poland .
if poland is complaining about its population that was decimated in world war two , why did it open hidden concentration camps on its own territory ?
poland has been wrong and will continue to be wrong as long as it digs up the recent past . - k. t. tellis , canada i can not believe that the two brothers represent the opinion of the polish people .
maybe they should go and get a life , if you know what i mean ! - hans , us this is no way to build trust and friendship in this rather unfriendly atmosphere .
but the big brother in the us allows the polish premier to say unfriendly words on the eu voting reform without having to fear economic consequences . - g. gosau , canada yes , for me it 's thumbs up !
the almost impossible was accomplished through skillful diplomacy .
britain with blair put the road blocks , but was outsmarted .
poland can not distinguish between patriotism and nationalism .

" we are carefully watching how state-controlled corporate entities from russia , china and the middle east are taking a stake in or buying companies , " deputy finance minister thomas mirow told the handelsblatt daily on monday . it often remains unclear what motivates the state-controlled funds which are increasingly looking to german companies , said mirow , who added that more and more foreign financial institutes want to invest in germany . protective measures coming ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ackermann said germany needs to decide what sectors it wants to keep its own high-ranking german officials are also considering if and how the country should implement measures to protect the country 's core business from foreign takeovers , government spokesman ulrich wilhelm said monday in berlin . " considerations over whether we should come to a particular balance have been going on here for a series of months , " he said . deutsche bank ceo josef ackermann said last week that the government needed to decide if it wanted to defend domestic business from state-run foreign investment funds . " i say we need to define strategic core areas and business sectors where we have the feeling that we need to have control as a country , " he said .
" in any case , we definitely should be doing it . " precursor of protectionism ? economics minister michael glos has also said that his department was looking at how other european nations protected their domestic industries , though he added that he did not want germany to be a forerunner when it came to protectionism . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a small portion of chinese or russian reserves could buy out several german companies state-owned investment funds are estimated to have a combined wealth of $ 2.5 trillion , according to morgan stanley . russia is reported currently to have foreign currency reserves of over $ 400 billion while china 's are estimated to be $ 1.2 trillion .
both countries are putting a large portion of the money in state-run funds that then buy shares in western companies . german finance minister peer steinbrück has said if china were to spend just part of its reserves it would be able to swallow several " big , fat , lovely " german companies .
he also added that the german cabinet was likely to address possible protective market measures this august . but not everyone in germany is happy to see the european union 's largest economy considering protective market measures . " this is a precursor of a new protectionism debate , and i 'd warn against that , " bert rürup , who heads germany 's panel of " five economic wise men , " said friday in an interview with the reuters news agency . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the central council of muslims in germany -lrb- zmd -rrb- harshly criticized the christian churches after high-ranking german clergyman cardinal karl lehmann last week spoke out against islam enjoying equal status to christianity . " the -lrb- christian -rrb- churches would like to ban islam to the lower leagues , " aiman mazyek , general secretary of the central council of muslims in germany , told the sunday edition of berlin 's tagesspiegel .
mazyek also pointed out that germany 's basic law ascribes equality to all religions , saying that there were no legal grounds for granting christianity special legal status .
neutrality or indifference ?
the council 's criticism came in response to comments made last week by cardinal karl lehmann , head of the german conference of bishops , who had warned against interpreting the state 's religious neutrality as " uncritical tolerance . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cardinal karl lehmann lehmann also expressed concern about all faiths being treated equally , regardless of their historical significance in europe .
" cardinal lehmann is mistaken if he thinks that the fact that europe and germany were undeniably shaped by christianity justifies the legal discrimination of other religions , " said volker beck , head of germany 's green party .
however , germany 's numerous muslim organizations have to fulfill the country 's legal requirements for becoming a religious group if they are to enjoy the same rights , added beck .
germany 's 3.2 million muslims are not represented by a single umbrella organization , but by many smaller ones . cultural roots ronald pofalla , general secretary of the conservative christian democratic union , agreed with lehmann that islam should not be granted the same legal standing as christianity .
" unlike christianity , islam is not in europe 's cultural center and is not reflected in everyday life in the same way , " pofalla said in a statement .

the central council of muslims in germany -lrb- zmd -rrb- harshly criticized the christian churches after high-ranking german clergyman cardinal karl lehmann last week spoke out against islam enjoying equal status to christianity . " the -lrb- christian -rrb- churches would like to ban islam to the lower leagues , " aiman mazyek , general secretary of the central council of muslims in germany , told the sunday edition of berlin 's tagesspiegel .
mazyek also pointed out that germany 's basic law ascribes equality to all religions , saying that there were no legal grounds for granting christianity special legal status .
neutrality or indifference ?
the council 's criticism came in response to comments made last week by cardinal karl lehmann , head of the german conference of bishops , who had warned against interpreting the state 's religious neutrality as " uncritical tolerance . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cardinal karl lehmann lehmann also expressed concern about all faiths being treated equally , regardless of their historical significance in europe .
" cardinal lehmann is mistaken if he thinks that the fact that europe and germany were undeniably shaped by christianity justifies the legal discrimination of other religions , " said volker beck , head of germany 's green party .
however , germany 's numerous muslim organizations have to fulfill the country 's legal requirements for becoming a religious group if they are to enjoy the same rights , added beck .
germany 's 3.2 million muslims are not represented by a single umbrella organization , but by many smaller ones . cultural roots ronald pofalla , general secretary of the conservative christian democratic union , agreed with lehmann that islam should not be granted the same legal standing as christianity .
" unlike christianity , islam is not in europe 's cultural center and is not reflected in everyday life in the same way , " pofalla said in a statement .
" only those who are conscious of their cultural and social roots can freely and openly stand up for the rights of people of different faiths , " he added . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the spd has refused the deal . social democratic party chairman kurt beck could " be the chancellor tomorrow " if he accepted the left party 's demands for changes to germany 's labor , social and foreign policies , oskar lafontaine , a former spd party head and current left party chair , said in an interview published monday . " when -lrb- beck -rrb- asks , ' are you ready to push through a minimum wage , reinstate the old pension system , revise hartz iv -lrb- social welfare reforms -rrb- and pull troops out of afghanistan ? ' then beck can be chancellor tomorrow , " lafontaine told german news magazine der spiegel . a coalition of the spd , the left and the greens would represent a majority of parliamentary seats .
but beck , along with other high-ranking spd party members , flatly refused lafontaine 's offer at a weekend conference to determine the spd 's future direction . general rejection among spd bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few in the spd are interested in hearing lafontaine 's suggestions " the offer is ludicrous , " spd parliamentary group leader peter struck told sunday 's bild am sonntag newspaper .
" the left party will be in the opposition forever . " made up of disgruntled , left-leaning ex-social democrats and members of the former east german communists , the left party won its first seats in a western state government last month and has risen in political polls to 10 percent , putting it on equal footing with the green party and a point ahead of the free-market liberal fdp , according to a dimap survey conducted for the ard public broadcasting network . currently trailing the cdu by 9 percent , beck worked over the weekend to separate his party from both the left and the cdu by concentrating on domestic labor issues while chancellor angela merkel continues making a name for herself on the international stage . social and economic responsibility " we want economic goals to be inseparably connected to social justice and ecological rationality , " beck said in a speech broken up several times by applause .
" we will seek a very clear position on putting people first in the economy , contrasting neo-liberal developments in the cdu . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beck is hoping things will start looking up for his party soon beck said part of the spd 's strategy would include continuing to push for a national minimum wage , a topic of conflict in the grand coalition of spd and christian conservatives , after the cabinet reached a compromise on extending wage protections to a dozen industrial sectors . " we want social economics to be protected in the future , " he said .
" whoever works full-time has to be able to live from it . " the cdu has strongly opposed a national minimum wage . more common ground with the left ? that , however , is one of the spd 's goals that could be reached if it would leave the grand coalition and agree to working with the left , according to dietmar bartsch , the left 's general manager . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : left members said the spd needs their help to make germany more social " the spd will book success on neither the minimum wage nor the inheritance tax with the cdu or fdp , " he told monday 's leipziger volkszeitung .
" it will only work with us . " but even though the spd would be able to push through a national minimum wage with lafontaine 's help , a coalition would cost the social democrats more than they would gain , according to environment minister sigmar gabriel . " we could probably reach a minimum wage decision with him , but the price would be to isolate germany , " gabriel told the daily süddeutsche zeitung on monday . gabriel also said he doubted the sincerity of lafontaine 's offer , saying it had more to do with presenting himself in the media than with political decision making . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the spd has refused the deal . social democratic party chairman kurt beck could " be the chancellor tomorrow " if he accepted the left party 's demands for changes to germany 's labor , social and foreign policies , oskar lafontaine , a former spd party head and current left party chair , said in an interview published monday . " when -lrb- beck -rrb- asks , ' are you ready to push through a minimum wage , reinstate the old pension system , revise hartz iv -lrb- social welfare reforms -rrb- and pull troops out of afghanistan ? ' then beck can be chancellor tomorrow , " lafontaine told german news magazine der spiegel . a coalition of the spd , the left and the greens would represent a majority of parliamentary seats .
but beck , along with other high-ranking spd party members , flatly refused lafontaine 's offer at a weekend conference to determine the spd 's future direction . general rejection among spd bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few in the spd are interested in hearing lafontaine 's suggestions " the offer is ludicrous , " spd parliamentary group leader peter struck told sunday 's bild am sonntag newspaper .
" the left party will be in the opposition forever . " made up of disgruntled , left-leaning ex-social democrats and members of the former east german communists , the left party won its first seats in a western state government last month and has risen in political polls to 10 percent , putting it on equal footing with the green party and a point ahead of the free-market liberal fdp , according to a dimap survey conducted for the ard public broadcasting network . currently trailing the cdu by 9 percent , beck worked over the weekend to separate his party from both the left and the cdu by concentrating on domestic labor issues while chancellor angela merkel continues making a name for herself on the international stage . social and economic responsibility " we want economic goals to be inseparably connected to social justice and ecological rationality , " beck said in a speech broken up several times by applause .
" we will seek a very clear position on putting people first in the economy , contrasting neo-liberal developments in the cdu . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beck is hoping things will start looking up for his party soon beck said part of the spd 's strategy would include continuing to push for a national minimum wage , a topic of conflict in the grand coalition of spd and christian conservatives , after the cabinet reached a compromise on extending wage protections to a dozen industrial sectors . " we want social economics to be protected in the future , " he said .
" whoever works full-time has to be able to live from it . " the cdu has strongly opposed a national minimum wage . more common ground with the left ? that , however , is one of the spd 's goals that could be reached if it would leave the grand coalition and agree to working with the left , according to dietmar bartsch , the left 's general manager . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : left members said the spd needs their help to make germany more social " the spd will book success on neither the minimum wage nor the inheritance tax with the cdu or fdp , " he told monday 's leipziger volkszeitung .
" it will only work with us . " but even though the spd would be able to push through a national minimum wage with lafontaine 's help , a coalition would cost the social democrats more than they would gain , according to environment minister sigmar gabriel . " we could probably reach a minimum wage decision with him , but the price would be to isolate germany , " gabriel told the daily süddeutsche zeitung on monday . gabriel also said he doubted the sincerity of lafontaine 's offer , saying it had more to do with presenting himself in the media than with political decision making . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they dabbed a bit of a cannabis extract on the little ears , and the allergic reaction went away . teenagers looking for a good excuse to experiment with marijuana - in its topical form that is - may have one now .
it turns out that granny ’ s over-the-counter cannabis ointment sold one hundred years ago to treat eczema , hives and other skin allergies , has a scientific basis after all . in the 1930s , the household remedy was dismissed as a quack product and banned due to the intoxicating effects of its active ingredient , tetrahydrocannabinol -lrb- thc -rrb- , which induces the marijuana high . now a research team from the university of bonn has resurrected granny ’ s old herbal extract . it turns out that thc does in fact reduce the ugly zits and swelling from skin allergies .
the bonn team stumbled on thc ’ s anti-inflammatory benefits while doing a brain study on mice wearing ear clips . mice ear clips the clips were originally used as id tags to differentiate the little rodents from one another , but had unexpectedly caused an allergic reaction around the ears .
since the mice had been genetically engineered not to respond to cannabinoids , either thc or its natural equivalents generated in the brain , the researchers realized that they hit upon a discovery . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rash disappear when scientists dabbed a bit of granny 's ointment on mouse ears they realized that cannabinoids operate like the brakes of a car , and prevent the body ’ s immune system from triggering inflammatory red sores . for two decades , scientists have known that the brain produces cannabinoids naturally , but they are still trying to figure out how thc regulates the immune system . the bonn scientists then started dabbing a bit of granny ’ s concoction on the skin of the poor little mice , and bingo — the swelling and redness disappeared . professor thomas tuting , a member of the team , said : " if we dabbed thc solution onto the animals ' skin shortly before and after applying the allergen -lrb- the ear clips -rrb- , a lot less swelling occurred than normal . ” tuting added that the amount of thc required to treat skin allergies wouldn ’ t be enough to induce a high though .
in other words , cannabis skin lotion could make a comeback , but just don ’ t count on it as a recreational drug . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

readers had mixed opinions readers weighed in on last week 's eu summit to revise the bloc 's constitutional draft . the following comments reflect the views of dw-world.de readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . the tension between less populated states and states with large populations , such as california where i live , is a fact of life in the united states and is a reality with which the eu will always have to contend .
the problem in the us has been more or less solved by allowing power to be shared based on population -lrb- the house of representatives in the us congress -rrb- and by allowing power to be shared based on individual state representation -lrb- the senate in the us congress -rrb- .
poland is not accustomed to having to work with other nations in the manner expected by the eu .
smaller nations like poland must develop their diplomatic skills and must learn to make strategic alliances within the eu to advance their agenda . - g. randel , us the countries in europe that are serious about their membership within the eu may want to form closer integration and cooperation , while countries like britain , poland and others may want to stay in the outer group .
of course this may eventually lead to a change in financial contributions for the ones that pay and the ones that receive .
it sounds fairer than the present system . - adam , canada i want to express my deep concern and disappointment of angela merkel 's behavior during the summit .
isolating poland during the summit and continuing the session without poland had nothing to do with common values and solidarity .
it was an example either of brutal pressure or a lack of the solidarity that germany talks so much about .
other members like portugal or slovenia understand more about freedom of opinions , negotiations and consensus within the eu than the powerful presidency of germany .
this is what eu means for me as a pole : solidarity , freedom and common understanding . - l. wojtowicz , poland as a new member of the eu , poland would be wise to try to fit in .
a backlash would hurt poland like in the past .
a lot of europeans want to move forward and have no time for such backward thinking . - d. noack , canada bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solidary , freedom and understanding are the eu ideals , wrote one polish reader british and poles were right .
german domination must be stopped .
comments about britain and poland from the german press are sickening . - maria , australia from the articles i have read -lrb- i do n't know the whole scope of the new agreement but -rrb- , it appears to say " to hell with what the people of europe want , we socialists know best . "
it could be a very disturbing trend toward less power by the people and a rise of a socialist aristocracy . - l. thrash , usa why should the european union pay much attention to what britain and poland say ?
poland is still stuck in the time warp of world war two , and britain is working as an agent provocateur for the us .
both poland and britain do not serve the interests of the european union , but have their own agendas .
blair has been the cause of a lot of disruption in the eu and now has a partner in poland .
if poland is complaining about its population that was decimated in world war two , why did it open hidden concentration camps on its own territory ?
poland has been wrong and will continue to be wrong as long as it digs up the recent past . - k. t. tellis , canada i can not believe that the two brothers represent the opinion of the polish people .
maybe they should go and get a life , if you know what i mean ! - hans , us this is no way to build trust and friendship in this rather unfriendly atmosphere .
but the big brother in the us allows the polish premier to say unfriendly words on the eu voting reform without having to fear economic consequences . - g. gosau , canada yes , for me it 's thumbs up !
the almost impossible was accomplished through skillful diplomacy .
britain with blair put the road blocks , but was outsmarted .
poland can not distinguish between patriotism and nationalism .
maybe future leaders will realize that if they are not prepared to give and take , they 'll isolate themselves . - e. heptner , usa the eu is better off without countries like poland , which not just hold the eu back , but increase the likelihood of its disintegration .
the eu has to be a union of like-minded nations .
poland is not one of those , and nor is england for that matter . - c. ranaweera , canada compiled by dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german press slams poland and britain after summit the german press on sunday slammed poland and britain for putting obstacles on the road to the deal reached on guidelines for a new european union treaty at the bloc 's summit this week .
-lrb- 24.06.2007 -rrb- readers weigh in on poland 's stance in treaty discussions as the european union entered discussion this week on revising the draft of its constitutional treaty , poland expressed discontentment with the existing voting system .
readers responded to this week 's discussion .
-lrb- 22.06.2007 -rrb- readers respond to conflict over eu treaty just prior to this week 's eu constitutional treaty summit , poland insisted that changes be made to the treaty 's voting system .
can and should the document be rescued ?

officials urge caution , but say there is no need to panic . veterinary experts confirmed on sunday that six wild birds found dead in two lakes near the southeastern german city nuremberg were infected with the deadly h5n1 virus . a health official at the friedrich loeffler institute said that tests were still being carried out on another five dead birds which tested positive for h5n1 , but it was still unclear whether they were infected with the deadly asian strain , which claimed nearly 200 lives since 2003 according to the world health organization . scientists fear that the virus could mutate into a form that makes human-to-human transmission possible , thereby setting off a global epidemic .
in order to contain the spread of the deadly virus , hundreds of millions of birds have been slaughtered worldwide since the first cases were discovered . no present danger to humans , but caution necessary germany 's agriculture minister horst seehofer told the newspaper münchner merkur , that there was no need to panic , but warned against contact with infected animals . " one thing is clear : the virus has not disappeared , " he said . a bird flu outbreak at the end of june is unusual said werner schnappauf , the regional minister of consumer affairs in bavaria in an interview with dpa wire services . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the infected area will be quaranteined for the next three weeks " with such warm temperatures , the virus can barely survive for a week - in cooler weather , four weeks , " he said , adding that there is no present danger for transmission of the virus to humans . local authorities had cordoned off the infected area where the diseased birds were found , which covers a radius of four kilometers -lrb- 2.5 miles -rrb- .
the area will remain quarantined for the next three weeks . over the next few days the city of nuremberg will be supported by a federal epidemiological team which will scientifically investigate the causes and background of the infection cases , city officials said .
they also warned cat and dog owners to keep their pets from straying into the quarantine zone .
possible link to last week 's outbreak in czech republic the new bird flu cases , which killed five swans and one goose , could be related to an outbreak of the same viral strain in the czech republic , which borders germany to the west and is 120 kilometers away from nuremberg .
last week , birds infected with h5n1 were found on a poultry farm in the central part of the czech republic , prompting authorities there to slaughter some 6,000 turkeys . last year in the spring , a bird flu epidemic had also broken out on the island of rügen on the baltic sea and had spread to several other regional states in germany , including bavaria .
the virus had infected other mammals , but did not spread to humans . the last case of bird flu in germany was reported last august in dresden , which is close to the czech border .
an infected swan in the eastern city 's zoo died . dw staff based on wire reports -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de bird flu cases confirmed in southern germany the deadly strain of the bird flu virus has resurfaced in germany in at least three birds the state of bavaria .

the central council of muslims in germany -lrb- zmd -rrb- harshly criticized the christian churches after high-ranking german clergyman cardinal karl lehmann last week spoke out against islam enjoying equal status to christianity . " the -lrb- christian -rrb- churches would like to ban islam to the lower leagues , " aiman mazyek , general secretary of the central council of muslims in germany , told the sunday edition of berlin 's tagesspiegel .
mazyek also pointed out that germany 's basic law ascribes equality to all religions , saying that there were no legal grounds for granting christianity special legal status .
neutrality or indifference ?
the council 's criticism came in response to comments made last week by cardinal karl lehmann , head of the german conference of bishops , who had warned against interpreting the state 's religious neutrality as " uncritical tolerance . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cardinal karl lehmann lehmann also expressed concern about all faiths being treated equally , regardless of their historical significance in europe .
" cardinal lehmann is mistaken if he thinks that the fact that europe and germany were undeniably shaped by christianity justifies the legal discrimination of other religions , " said volker beck , head of germany 's green party .
however , germany 's numerous muslim organizations have to fulfill the country 's legal requirements for becoming a religious group if they are to enjoy the same rights , added beck .
germany 's 3.2 million muslims are not represented by a single umbrella organization , but by many smaller ones . cultural roots ronald pofalla , general secretary of the conservative christian democratic union , agreed with lehmann that islam should not be granted the same legal standing as christianity .
" unlike christianity , islam is not in europe 's cultural center and is not reflected in everyday life in the same way , " pofalla said in a statement .
" only those who are conscious of their cultural and social roots can freely and openly stand up for the rights of people of different faiths , " he added . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

now the german foreign minister is demanding the boy 's release . the flirtations of a 17-year-old german schoolboy are now headed towards a diplomatic confrontation between germany and turkey . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said monday that he would seek release of the teenager , marco weiss , who has been held for 10 weeks in a turkish jail over allegations that he had sexually molested a 13-year-old british girl , referred to as charlotte m. , while vacationing in a popular turkish resort on the antalyan coast . the girl 's mother had demanded that turkish police arrest and prosecute weiss for sexually molesting her daughter , according to germany 's der spiegel online .
the teenager claimed that he had only flirted with and kissed the girl , who said she was 15 years old . harsh prison conditions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there was no response from turkey to germany 's demands weiss has been held in a cell with a single lavatory and toilet that he shares with 30 other prisoners since early april .
his parents , who were in antalya , told the german press that they were allowed to see their son only once a week and were separated from him by a glass screen . " he is in very bad shape physically and psychologically , " said the family lawyer jürgen schmidt at a press conference in the small town of ülzen in lower saxony , where the parents live .
" marco sees himself as completely innocent and is baffled by what is going on . " the weiss family had already appealed to the turkish justice authorities to release their son , but their pleas went unheeded . marco weiss was supposed to be freed on bail until a court hearing scheduled for july 6 , which has been postponed , according to a spokesman from the foreign ministry .
but a turkish judge had denied his release . german appeal now the german government has issued an appeal for the schoolboy 's immediate release from prison at the highest level . " this is a tragic case that does not leave us unmoved , " said steinmeier at a human rights conference in southern germany .
" we are giving as much support to the family as we can .
our embassy is taking action .
i 'll be meeting the turkish ambassador tomorrow and will demand the release of the 17-year-old . " there was no immediate response from the turkish government to germany 's demands .
an editorial in the turkish newspaper hurriyet however strongly criticized the german government for " insulting the turkish justice system . " unfair criticism ? " it would be unthinkable for the turkish government to ask the german government in such a manner to free a turkish citizen imprisoned in germany , " the newspaper wrote . marco 's mother is back in turkey to give support to her son .
his father is undergoing chemotherapy treatment for leukemia in germany . in the last few weeks , marco was supposed to sit for his high school exams and had already applied for admission to a technical school .

the central council of muslims in germany -lrb- zmd -rrb- harshly criticized the christian churches after high-ranking german clergyman cardinal karl lehmann last week spoke out against islam enjoying equal status to christianity . " the -lrb- christian -rrb- churches would like to ban islam to the lower leagues , " aiman mazyek , general secretary of the central council of muslims in germany , told the sunday edition of berlin 's tagesspiegel .
mazyek also pointed out that germany 's basic law ascribes equality to all religions , saying that there were no legal grounds for granting christianity special legal status .
neutrality or indifference ?
the council 's criticism came in response to comments made last week by cardinal karl lehmann , head of the german conference of bishops , who had warned against interpreting the state 's religious neutrality as " uncritical tolerance . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cardinal karl lehmann lehmann also expressed concern about all faiths being treated equally , regardless of their historical significance in europe .
" cardinal lehmann is mistaken if he thinks that the fact that europe and germany were undeniably shaped by christianity justifies the legal discrimination of other religions , " said volker beck , head of germany 's green party .
however , germany 's numerous muslim organizations have to fulfill the country 's legal requirements for becoming a religious group if they are to enjoy the same rights , added beck .
germany 's 3.2 million muslims are not represented by a single umbrella organization , but by many smaller ones . cultural roots ronald pofalla , general secretary of the conservative christian democratic union , agreed with lehmann that islam should not be granted the same legal standing as christianity .
" unlike christianity , islam is not in europe 's cultural center and is not reflected in everyday life in the same way , " pofalla said in a statement .
" only those who are conscious of their cultural and social roots can freely and openly stand up for the rights of people of different faiths , " he added . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the spd has refused the deal . social democratic party chairman kurt beck could " be the chancellor tomorrow " if he accepted the left party 's demands for changes to germany 's labor , social and foreign policies , oskar lafontaine , a former spd party head and current left party chair , said in an interview published monday . " when -lrb- beck -rrb- asks , ' are you ready to push through a minimum wage , reinstate the old pension system , revise hartz iv -lrb- social welfare reforms -rrb- and pull troops out of afghanistan ? ' then beck can be chancellor tomorrow , " lafontaine told german news magazine der spiegel . a coalition of the spd , the left and the greens would represent a majority of parliamentary seats .
but beck , along with other high-ranking spd party members , flatly refused lafontaine 's offer at a weekend conference to determine the spd 's future direction . general rejection among spd bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few in the spd are interested in hearing lafontaine 's suggestions " the offer is ludicrous , " spd parliamentary group leader peter struck told sunday 's bild am sonntag newspaper .
" the left party will be in the opposition forever . " made up of disgruntled , left-leaning ex-social democrats and members of the former east german communists , the left party won its first seats in a western state government last month and has risen in political polls to 10 percent , putting it on equal footing with the green party and a point ahead of the free-market liberal fdp , according to a dimap survey conducted for the ard public broadcasting network . currently trailing the cdu by 9 percent , beck worked over the weekend to separate his party from both the left and the cdu by concentrating on domestic labor issues while chancellor angela merkel continues making a name for herself on the international stage . social and economic responsibility " we want economic goals to be inseparably connected to social justice and ecological rationality , " beck said in a speech broken up several times by applause .
" we will seek a very clear position on putting people first in the economy , contrasting neo-liberal developments in the cdu . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beck is hoping things will start looking up for his party soon beck said part of the spd 's strategy would include continuing to push for a national minimum wage , a topic of conflict in the grand coalition of spd and christian conservatives , after the cabinet reached a compromise on extending wage protections to a dozen industrial sectors . " we want social economics to be protected in the future , " he said .
" whoever works full-time has to be able to live from it . " the cdu has strongly opposed a national minimum wage . more common ground with the left ? that , however , is one of the spd 's goals that could be reached if it would leave the grand coalition and agree to working with the left , according to dietmar bartsch , the left 's general manager . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : left members said the spd needs their help to make germany more social " the spd will book success on neither the minimum wage nor the inheritance tax with the cdu or fdp , " he told monday 's leipziger volkszeitung .
" it will only work with us . " but even though the spd would be able to push through a national minimum wage with lafontaine 's help , a coalition would cost the social democrats more than they would gain , according to environment minister sigmar gabriel . " we could probably reach a minimum wage decision with him , but the price would be to isolate germany , " gabriel told the daily süddeutsche zeitung on monday . gabriel also said he doubted the sincerity of lafontaine 's offer , saying it had more to do with presenting himself in the media than with political decision making . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the spd has refused the deal . social democratic party chairman kurt beck could " be the chancellor tomorrow " if he accepted the left party 's demands for changes to germany 's labor , social and foreign policies , oskar lafontaine , a former spd party head and current left party chair , said in an interview published monday . " when -lrb- beck -rrb- asks , ' are you ready to push through a minimum wage , reinstate the old pension system , revise hartz iv -lrb- social welfare reforms -rrb- and pull troops out of afghanistan ? ' then beck can be chancellor tomorrow , " lafontaine told german news magazine der spiegel . a coalition of the spd , the left and the greens would represent a majority of parliamentary seats .
but beck , along with other high-ranking spd party members , flatly refused lafontaine 's offer at a weekend conference to determine the spd 's future direction . general rejection among spd bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few in the spd are interested in hearing lafontaine 's suggestions " the offer is ludicrous , " spd parliamentary group leader peter struck told sunday 's bild am sonntag newspaper .
" the left party will be in the opposition forever . " made up of disgruntled , left-leaning ex-social democrats and members of the former east german communists , the left party won its first seats in a western state government last month and has risen in political polls to 10 percent , putting it on equal footing with the green party and a point ahead of the free-market liberal fdp , according to a dimap survey conducted for the ard public broadcasting network . currently trailing the cdu by 9 percent , beck worked over the weekend to separate his party from both the left and the cdu by concentrating on domestic labor issues while chancellor angela merkel continues making a name for herself on the international stage . social and economic responsibility " we want economic goals to be inseparably connected to social justice and ecological rationality , " beck said in a speech broken up several times by applause .
" we will seek a very clear position on putting people first in the economy , contrasting neo-liberal developments in the cdu . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beck is hoping things will start looking up for his party soon beck said part of the spd 's strategy would include continuing to push for a national minimum wage , a topic of conflict in the grand coalition of spd and christian conservatives , after the cabinet reached a compromise on extending wage protections to a dozen industrial sectors . " we want social economics to be protected in the future , " he said .
" whoever works full-time has to be able to live from it . " the cdu has strongly opposed a national minimum wage . more common ground with the left ? that , however , is one of the spd 's goals that could be reached if it would leave the grand coalition and agree to working with the left , according to dietmar bartsch , the left 's general manager . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : left members said the spd needs their help to make germany more social " the spd will book success on neither the minimum wage nor the inheritance tax with the cdu or fdp , " he told monday 's leipziger volkszeitung .

1 to submit an alternative to a modern bridge planned for the park-like elbe valley near dresden , or the area may lose its world heritage status , the united nation 's world heritage committee announced on monday .
" if present plans for a bridge were replaced by a solution that respected the outstanding universal value of the cultural landscape , the site would remain on the world heritage list , " a statement on the organization 's web site said .
after evaluating the alternative plans for the the waldschlösschen bridge , the unesco committee will decide if the ensemble of gardens , palaces , woods and meadows along 20 kilometers -lrb- 12.4 miles -rrb- of the valley on both sides of the elbe will continue to qualify for world heritage status .

" in their speeches , almost every delegate country identified a tunnel as the preferred solution , " he told dpa .
according to unesco , the bridge design is too " heavy " and would degrade the landscape .

officials urge caution , but say there is no need to panic . veterinary experts confirmed on sunday that six wild birds found dead in two lakes near the southeastern german city nuremberg were infected with the deadly h5n1 virus . a health official at the friedrich loeffler institute said that tests were still being carried out on another five dead birds which tested positive for h5n1 , but it was still unclear whether they were infected with the deadly asian strain , which claimed nearly 200 lives since 2003 according to the world health organization . scientists fear that the virus could mutate into a form that makes human-to-human transmission possible , thereby setting off a global epidemic .
in order to contain the spread of the deadly virus , hundreds of millions of birds have been slaughtered worldwide since the first cases were discovered . no present danger to humans , but caution necessary germany 's agriculture minister horst seehofer told the newspaper münchner merkur , that there was no need to panic , but warned against contact with infected animals .

the area will remain quarantined for the next three weeks . over the next few days the city of nuremberg will be supported by a federal epidemiological team which will scientifically investigate the causes and background of the infection cases , city officials said .
they also warned cat and dog owners to keep their pets from straying into the quarantine zone .
possible link to last week 's outbreak in czech republic the new bird flu cases , which killed five swans and one goose , could be related to an outbreak of the same viral strain in the czech republic , which borders germany to the west and is 120 kilometers away from nuremberg .
last week , birds infected with h5n1 were found on a poultry farm in the central part of the czech republic , prompting authorities there to slaughter some 6,000 turkeys . last year in the spring , a bird flu epidemic had also broken out on the island of rügen on the baltic sea and had spread to several other regional states in germany , including bavaria .

officials urge caution , but say there is no need to panic . veterinary experts confirmed on sunday that six wild birds found dead in two lakes near the southeastern german city nuremberg were infected with the deadly h5n1 virus . a health official at the friedrich loeffler institute said that tests were still being carried out on another five dead birds which tested positive for h5n1 , but it was still unclear whether they were infected with the deadly asian strain , which claimed nearly 200 lives since 2003 according to the world health organization . scientists fear that the virus could mutate into a form that makes human-to-human transmission possible , thereby setting off a global epidemic .

the central council of muslims in germany -lrb- zmd -rrb- harshly criticized the christian churches after high-ranking german clergyman cardinal karl lehmann last week spoke out against islam enjoying equal status to christianity . " the -lrb- christian -rrb- churches would like to ban islam to the lower leagues , " aiman mazyek , general secretary of the central council of muslims in germany , told the sunday edition of berlin 's tagesspiegel .
mazyek also pointed out that germany 's basic law ascribes equality to all religions , saying that there were no legal grounds for granting christianity special legal status .
neutrality or indifference ?
the council 's criticism came in response to comments made last week by cardinal karl lehmann , head of the german conference of bishops , who had warned against interpreting the state 's religious neutrality as " uncritical tolerance . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cardinal karl lehmann lehmann also expressed concern about all faiths being treated equally , regardless of their historical significance in europe .
" cardinal lehmann is mistaken if he thinks that the fact that europe and germany were undeniably shaped by christianity justifies the legal discrimination of other religions , " said volker beck , head of germany 's green party .
however , germany 's numerous muslim organizations have to fulfill the country 's legal requirements for becoming a religious group if they are to enjoy the same rights , added beck .
germany 's 3.2 million muslims are not represented by a single umbrella organization , but by many smaller ones . cultural roots ronald pofalla , general secretary of the conservative christian democratic union , agreed with lehmann that islam should not be granted the same legal standing as christianity .
" unlike christianity , islam is not in europe 's cultural center and is not reflected in everyday life in the same way , " pofalla said in a statement .

" the -lrb- christian -rrb- churches would like to ban islam to the lower leagues , " aiman mazyek , general secretary of the central council of muslims in germany , told the sunday edition of berlin 's tagesspiegel .
mazyek also pointed out that germany 's basic law ascribes equality to all religions , saying that there were no legal grounds for granting christianity special legal status .
neutrality or indifference ?
the council 's criticism came in response to comments made last week by cardinal karl lehmann , head of the german conference of bishops , who had warned against interpreting the state 's religious neutrality as " uncritical tolerance . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cardinal karl lehmann lehmann also expressed concern about all faiths being treated equally , regardless of their historical significance in europe .
" cardinal lehmann is mistaken if he thinks that the fact that europe and germany were undeniably shaped by christianity justifies the legal discrimination of other religions , " said volker beck , head of germany 's green party .
however , germany 's numerous muslim organizations have to fulfill the country 's legal requirements for becoming a religious group if they are to enjoy the same rights , added beck .
germany 's 3.2 million muslims are not represented by a single umbrella organization , but by many smaller ones . cultural roots ronald pofalla , general secretary of the conservative christian democratic union , agreed with lehmann that islam should not be granted the same legal standing as christianity .
" unlike christianity , islam is not in europe 's cultural center and is not reflected in everyday life in the same way , " pofalla said in a statement .
" only those who are conscious of their cultural and social roots can freely and openly stand up for the rights of people of different faiths , " he added . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the spd has refused the deal . social democratic party chairman kurt beck could " be the chancellor tomorrow " if he accepted the left party 's demands for changes to germany 's labor , social and foreign policies , oskar lafontaine , a former spd party head and current left party chair , said in an interview published monday . " when -lrb- beck -rrb- asks , ' are you ready to push through a minimum wage , reinstate the old pension system , revise hartz iv -lrb- social welfare reforms -rrb- and pull troops out of afghanistan ? ' then beck can be chancellor tomorrow , " lafontaine told german news magazine der spiegel . a coalition of the spd , the left and the greens would represent a majority of parliamentary seats .
but beck , along with other high-ranking spd party members , flatly refused lafontaine 's offer at a weekend conference to determine the spd 's future direction . general rejection among spd bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few in the spd are interested in hearing lafontaine 's suggestions " the offer is ludicrous , " spd parliamentary group leader peter struck told sunday 's bild am sonntag newspaper .
" the left party will be in the opposition forever . " made up of disgruntled , left-leaning ex-social democrats and members of the former east german communists , the left party won its first seats in a western state government last month and has risen in political polls to 10 percent , putting it on equal footing with the green party and a point ahead of the free-market liberal fdp , according to a dimap survey conducted for the ard public broadcasting network . currently trailing the cdu by 9 percent , beck worked over the weekend to separate his party from both the left and the cdu by concentrating on domestic labor issues while chancellor angela merkel continues making a name for herself on the international stage . social and economic responsibility " we want economic goals to be inseparably connected to social justice and ecological rationality , " beck said in a speech broken up several times by applause .
" we will seek a very clear position on putting people first in the economy , contrasting neo-liberal developments in the cdu . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beck is hoping things will start looking up for his party soon beck said part of the spd 's strategy would include continuing to push for a national minimum wage , a topic of conflict in the grand coalition of spd and christian conservatives , after the cabinet reached a compromise on extending wage protections to a dozen industrial sectors . " we want social economics to be protected in the future , " he said .
" whoever works full-time has to be able to live from it . " the cdu has strongly opposed a national minimum wage . more common ground with the left ? that , however , is one of the spd 's goals that could be reached if it would leave the grand coalition and agree to working with the left , according to dietmar bartsch , the left 's general manager . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : left members said the spd needs their help to make germany more social " the spd will book success on neither the minimum wage nor the inheritance tax with the cdu or fdp , " he told monday 's leipziger volkszeitung .

the spd has refused the deal . social democratic party chairman kurt beck could " be the chancellor tomorrow " if he accepted the left party 's demands for changes to germany 's labor , social and foreign policies , oskar lafontaine , a former spd party head and current left party chair , said in an interview published monday . " when -lrb- beck -rrb- asks , ' are you ready to push through a minimum wage , reinstate the old pension system , revise hartz iv -lrb- social welfare reforms -rrb- and pull troops out of afghanistan ? ' then beck can be chancellor tomorrow , " lafontaine told german news magazine der spiegel . a coalition of the spd , the left and the greens would represent a majority of parliamentary seats .
but beck , along with other high-ranking spd party members , flatly refused lafontaine 's offer at a weekend conference to determine the spd 's future direction . general rejection among spd bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few in the spd are interested in hearing lafontaine 's suggestions " the offer is ludicrous , " spd parliamentary group leader peter struck told sunday 's bild am sonntag newspaper .
" the left party will be in the opposition forever . " made up of disgruntled , left-leaning ex-social democrats and members of the former east german communists , the left party won its first seats in a western state government last month and has risen in political polls to 10 percent , putting it on equal footing with the green party and a point ahead of the free-market liberal fdp , according to a dimap survey conducted for the ard public broadcasting network . currently trailing the cdu by 9 percent , beck worked over the weekend to separate his party from both the left and the cdu by concentrating on domestic labor issues while chancellor angela merkel continues making a name for herself on the international stage . social and economic responsibility " we want economic goals to be inseparably connected to social justice and ecological rationality , " beck said in a speech broken up several times by applause .
" we will seek a very clear position on putting people first in the economy , contrasting neo-liberal developments in the cdu . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beck is hoping things will start looking up for his party soon beck said part of the spd 's strategy would include continuing to push for a national minimum wage , a topic of conflict in the grand coalition of spd and christian conservatives , after the cabinet reached a compromise on extending wage protections to a dozen industrial sectors .

officials urge caution , but say there is no need to panic . veterinary experts confirmed on sunday that six wild birds found dead in two lakes near the southeastern german city nuremberg were infected with the deadly h5n1 virus . a health official at the friedrich loeffler institute said that tests were still being carried out on another five dead birds which tested positive for h5n1 , but it was still unclear whether they were infected with the deadly asian strain , which claimed nearly 200 lives since 2003 according to the world health organization . scientists fear that the virus could mutate into a form that makes human-to-human transmission possible , thereby setting off a global epidemic .
in order to contain the spread of the deadly virus , hundreds of millions of birds have been slaughtered worldwide since the first cases were discovered . no present danger to humans , but caution necessary germany 's agriculture minister horst seehofer told the newspaper münchner merkur , that there was no need to panic , but warned against contact with infected animals .

they also warned cat and dog owners to keep their pets from straying into the quarantine zone .
possible link to last week 's outbreak in czech republic the new bird flu cases , which killed five swans and one goose , could be related to an outbreak of the same viral strain in the czech republic , which borders germany to the west and is 120 kilometers away from nuremberg .
last week , birds infected with h5n1 were found on a poultry farm in the central part of the czech republic , prompting authorities there to slaughter some 6,000 turkeys . last year in the spring , a bird flu epidemic had also broken out on the island of rügen on the baltic sea and had spread to several other regional states in germany , including bavaria .
the virus had infected other mammals , but did not spread to humans . the last case of bird flu in germany was reported last august in dresden , which is close to the czech border .

1 to submit an alternative to a modern bridge planned for the park-like elbe valley near dresden , or the area may lose its world heritage status , the united nation 's world heritage committee announced on monday .
" if present plans for a bridge were replaced by a solution that respected the outstanding universal value of the cultural landscape , the site would remain on the world heritage list , " a statement on the organization 's web site said .
after evaluating the alternative plans for the the waldschlösschen bridge , the unesco committee will decide if the ensemble of gardens , palaces , woods and meadows along 20 kilometers -lrb- 12.4 miles -rrb- of the valley on both sides of the elbe will continue to qualify for world heritage status .
new deadline for dresden bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dresden will remain on the unesco watch list until at least october " by october we have to present something that can not be presented , " jan mücke , one of dresden 's representatives in germany 's national parliament , told dpa news service .
" basically , we just have a new deadline . "
the valley was designated as one of 830 sites currently on the world heritage list in 2004 , but plans for building a bridge across the elbe river have threatened its listing for the past two years .
the committee decided monday to leave it on the list of endangered places .
it has never before struck a heritage site off its list , and the eastern german city 's tourist officials are working to make sure the elbe valley is n't the first place to be de-listed .
city officials , however , have said the growing traffic has forced them to build a new bridge , estimated to cost 160 million euros -lrb- $ 215 million -rrb- .

tunnel a possibility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2005 , residents voted for an additional way to get across the elbe a tunnel connecting both sides of the elbe could represent a compromise that would meet the unesco committee 's demands as well as fulfill the public 's will , according to ralf weber , a dresden architecture professor who traveled to christchurch , new zealand , where the committee met .
" in their speeches , almost every delegate country identified a tunnel as the preferred solution , " he told dpa .
according to unesco , the bridge design is too " heavy " and would degrade the landscape .
the committee meetings , which run until july 2 and are closed to the public , will consider new site nominations , sites in danger , site management and protection .
they will also draw up lists for possible future world heritage sites . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

1 to submit an alternative to a modern bridge planned for the park-like elbe valley near dresden , or the area may lose its world heritage status , the united nation 's world heritage committee announced on monday .
" if present plans for a bridge were replaced by a solution that respected the outstanding universal value of the cultural landscape , the site would remain on the world heritage list , " a statement on the organization 's web site said .
after evaluating the alternative plans for the the waldschlösschen bridge , the unesco committee will decide if the ensemble of gardens , palaces , woods and meadows along 20 kilometers -lrb- 12.4 miles -rrb- of the valley on both sides of the elbe will continue to qualify for world heritage status .
new deadline for dresden bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dresden will remain on the unesco watch list until at least october " by october we have to present something that can not be presented , " jan mücke , one of dresden 's representatives in germany 's national parliament , told dpa news service .
" basically , we just have a new deadline . "
the valley was designated as one of 830 sites currently on the world heritage list in 2004 , but plans for building a bridge across the elbe river have threatened its listing for the past two years .
the committee decided monday to leave it on the list of endangered places .
it has never before struck a heritage site off its list , and the eastern german city 's tourist officials are working to make sure the elbe valley is n't the first place to be de-listed .
city officials , however , have said the growing traffic has forced them to build a new bridge , estimated to cost 160 million euros -lrb- $ 215 million -rrb- .
residents , in a 2005 referendum , voted in favor of the bridge , and the german constitutional court ruled earlier this month that the people 's voice should have priority over retaining international honors .
tunnel a possibility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2005 , residents voted for an additional way to get across the elbe a tunnel connecting both sides of the elbe could represent a compromise that would meet the unesco committee 's demands as well as fulfill the public 's will , according to ralf weber , a dresden architecture professor who traveled to christchurch , new zealand , where the committee met .
" in their speeches , almost every delegate country identified a tunnel as the preferred solution , " he told dpa .
according to unesco , the bridge design is too " heavy " and would degrade the landscape .
the committee meetings , which run until july 2 and are closed to the public , will consider new site nominations , sites in danger , site management and protection .
they will also draw up lists for possible future world heritage sites . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

after evaluating the alternative plans for the the waldschlösschen bridge , the unesco committee will decide if the ensemble of gardens , palaces , woods and meadows along 20 kilometers -lrb- 12.4 miles -rrb- of the valley on both sides of the elbe will continue to qualify for world heritage status .
new deadline for dresden bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dresden will remain on the unesco watch list until at least october " by october we have to present something that can not be presented , " jan mücke , one of dresden 's representatives in germany 's national parliament , told dpa news service .
" basically , we just have a new deadline . "
the valley was designated as one of 830 sites currently on the world heritage list in 2004 , but plans for building a bridge across the elbe river have threatened its listing for the past two years .
the committee decided monday to leave it on the list of endangered places .
it has never before struck a heritage site off its list , and the eastern german city 's tourist officials are working to make sure the elbe valley is n't the first place to be de-listed .
city officials , however , have said the growing traffic has forced them to build a new bridge , estimated to cost 160 million euros -lrb- $ 215 million -rrb- .
residents , in a 2005 referendum , voted in favor of the bridge , and the german constitutional court ruled earlier this month that the people 's voice should have priority over retaining international honors .
tunnel a possibility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2005 , residents voted for an additional way to get across the elbe a tunnel connecting both sides of the elbe could represent a compromise that would meet the unesco committee 's demands as well as fulfill the public 's will , according to ralf weber , a dresden architecture professor who traveled to christchurch , new zealand , where the committee met .
" in their speeches , almost every delegate country identified a tunnel as the preferred solution , " he told dpa .
according to unesco , the bridge design is too " heavy " and would degrade the landscape .
the committee meetings , which run until july 2 and are closed to the public , will consider new site nominations , sites in danger , site management and protection .
they will also draw up lists for possible future world heritage sites . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

readers had mixed opinions readers weighed in on last week 's eu summit to revise the bloc 's constitutional draft . the following comments reflect the views of dw-world.de readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . the tension between less populated states and states with large populations , such as california where i live , is a fact of life in the united states and is a reality with which the eu will always have to contend .
the problem in the us has been more or less solved by allowing power to be shared based on population -lrb- the house of representatives in the us congress -rrb- and by allowing power to be shared based on individual state representation -lrb- the senate in the us congress -rrb- .
poland is not accustomed to having to work with other nations in the manner expected by the eu .
smaller nations like poland must develop their diplomatic skills and must learn to make strategic alliances within the eu to advance their agenda . - g. randel , us the countries in europe that are serious about their membership within the eu may want to form closer integration and cooperation , while countries like britain , poland and others may want to stay in the outer group .
of course this may eventually lead to a change in financial contributions for the ones that pay and the ones that receive .
it sounds fairer than the present system . - adam , canada i want to express my deep concern and disappointment of angela merkel 's behavior during the summit .
isolating poland during the summit and continuing the session without poland had nothing to do with common values and solidarity .
it was an example either of brutal pressure or a lack of the solidarity that germany talks so much about .
other members like portugal or slovenia understand more about freedom of opinions , negotiations and consensus within the eu than the powerful presidency of germany .
this is what eu means for me as a pole : solidarity , freedom and common understanding . - l. wojtowicz , poland as a new member of the eu , poland would be wise to try to fit in .
a backlash would hurt poland like in the past .
a lot of europeans want to move forward and have no time for such backward thinking . - d. noack , canada bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solidary , freedom and understanding are the eu ideals , wrote one polish reader british and poles were right .
german domination must be stopped .
comments about britain and poland from the german press are sickening . - maria , australia from the articles i have read -lrb- i do n't know the whole scope of the new agreement but -rrb- , it appears to say " to hell with what the people of europe want , we socialists know best . "
it could be a very disturbing trend toward less power by the people and a rise of a socialist aristocracy . - l. thrash , usa why should the european union pay much attention to what britain and poland say ?
poland is still stuck in the time warp of world war two , and britain is working as an agent provocateur for the us .
both poland and britain do not serve the interests of the european union , but have their own agendas .
blair has been the cause of a lot of disruption in the eu and now has a partner in poland .
if poland is complaining about its population that was decimated in world war two , why did it open hidden concentration camps on its own territory ?
poland has been wrong and will continue to be wrong as long as it digs up the recent past . - k. t. tellis , canada i can not believe that the two brothers represent the opinion of the polish people .
maybe they should go and get a life , if you know what i mean ! - hans , us this is no way to build trust and friendship in this rather unfriendly atmosphere .
but the big brother in the us allows the polish premier to say unfriendly words on the eu voting reform without having to fear economic consequences . - g. gosau , canada yes , for me it 's thumbs up !
the almost impossible was accomplished through skillful diplomacy .
britain with blair put the road blocks , but was outsmarted .
poland can not distinguish between patriotism and nationalism .
maybe future leaders will realize that if they are not prepared to give and take , they 'll isolate themselves . - e. heptner , usa the eu is better off without countries like poland , which not just hold the eu back , but increase the likelihood of its disintegration .
the eu has to be a union of like-minded nations .
poland is not one of those , and nor is england for that matter . - c. ranaweera , canada compiled by dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german press slams poland and britain after summit the german press on sunday slammed poland and britain for putting obstacles on the road to the deal reached on guidelines for a new european union treaty at the bloc 's summit this week .

not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . the tension between less populated states and states with large populations , such as california where i live , is a fact of life in the united states and is a reality with which the eu will always have to contend .
the problem in the us has been more or less solved by allowing power to be shared based on population -lrb- the house of representatives in the us congress -rrb- and by allowing power to be shared based on individual state representation -lrb- the senate in the us congress -rrb- .
poland is not accustomed to having to work with other nations in the manner expected by the eu .
smaller nations like poland must develop their diplomatic skills and must learn to make strategic alliances within the eu to advance their agenda . - g. randel , us the countries in europe that are serious about their membership within the eu may want to form closer integration and cooperation , while countries like britain , poland and others may want to stay in the outer group .
of course this may eventually lead to a change in financial contributions for the ones that pay and the ones that receive .
it sounds fairer than the present system . - adam , canada i want to express my deep concern and disappointment of angela merkel 's behavior during the summit .
isolating poland during the summit and continuing the session without poland had nothing to do with common values and solidarity .
it was an example either of brutal pressure or a lack of the solidarity that germany talks so much about .
other members like portugal or slovenia understand more about freedom of opinions , negotiations and consensus within the eu than the powerful presidency of germany .
this is what eu means for me as a pole : solidarity , freedom and common understanding . - l. wojtowicz , poland as a new member of the eu , poland would be wise to try to fit in .
a backlash would hurt poland like in the past .
a lot of europeans want to move forward and have no time for such backward thinking . - d. noack , canada bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solidary , freedom and understanding are the eu ideals , wrote one polish reader british and poles were right .
german domination must be stopped .

it could be a very disturbing trend toward less power by the people and a rise of a socialist aristocracy . - l. thrash , usa why should the european union pay much attention to what britain and poland say ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 25.06.2007 readers assess eu treaty summit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : should poland take a lower profile ?
readers had mixed opinions readers weighed in on last week 's eu summit to revise the bloc 's constitutional draft . the following comments reflect the views of dw-world.de readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . the tension between less populated states and states with large populations , such as california where i live , is a fact of life in the united states and is a reality with which the eu will always have to contend .
the problem in the us has been more or less solved by allowing power to be shared based on population -lrb- the house of representatives in the us congress -rrb- and by allowing power to be shared based on individual state representation -lrb- the senate in the us congress -rrb- .
poland is not accustomed to having to work with other nations in the manner expected by the eu .
smaller nations like poland must develop their diplomatic skills and must learn to make strategic alliances within the eu to advance their agenda . - g. randel , us the countries in europe that are serious about their membership within the eu may want to form closer integration and cooperation , while countries like britain , poland and others may want to stay in the outer group .
of course this may eventually lead to a change in financial contributions for the ones that pay and the ones that receive .
it sounds fairer than the present system . - adam , canada i want to express my deep concern and disappointment of angela merkel 's behavior during the summit .
isolating poland during the summit and continuing the session without poland had nothing to do with common values and solidarity .
it was an example either of brutal pressure or a lack of the solidarity that germany talks so much about .
other members like portugal or slovenia understand more about freedom of opinions , negotiations and consensus within the eu than the powerful presidency of germany .
this is what eu means for me as a pole : solidarity , freedom and common understanding . - l. wojtowicz , poland as a new member of the eu , poland would be wise to try to fit in .
a backlash would hurt poland like in the past .
a lot of europeans want to move forward and have no time for such backward thinking . - d. noack , canada bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solidary , freedom and understanding are the eu ideals , wrote one polish reader british and poles were right .
german domination must be stopped .
comments about britain and poland from the german press are sickening . - maria , australia from the articles i have read -lrb- i do n't know the whole scope of the new agreement but -rrb- , it appears to say " to hell with what the people of europe want , we socialists know best . "
it could be a very disturbing trend toward less power by the people and a rise of a socialist aristocracy . - l. thrash , usa why should the european union pay much attention to what britain and poland say ?
poland is still stuck in the time warp of world war two , and britain is working as an agent provocateur for the us .
both poland and britain do not serve the interests of the european union , but have their own agendas .
blair has been the cause of a lot of disruption in the eu and now has a partner in poland .
if poland is complaining about its population that was decimated in world war two , why did it open hidden concentration camps on its own territory ?
poland has been wrong and will continue to be wrong as long as it digs up the recent past . - k. t. tellis , canada i can not believe that the two brothers represent the opinion of the polish people .
maybe they should go and get a life , if you know what i mean ! - hans , us this is no way to build trust and friendship in this rather unfriendly atmosphere .
but the big brother in the us allows the polish premier to say unfriendly words on the eu voting reform without having to fear economic consequences . - g. gosau , canada yes , for me it 's thumbs up !
the almost impossible was accomplished through skillful diplomacy .
britain with blair put the road blocks , but was outsmarted .
poland can not distinguish between patriotism and nationalism .
maybe future leaders will realize that if they are not prepared to give and take , they 'll isolate themselves . - e. heptner , usa the eu is better off without countries like poland , which not just hold the eu back , but increase the likelihood of its disintegration .
the eu has to be a union of like-minded nations .
poland is not one of those , and nor is england for that matter . - c. ranaweera , canada compiled by dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german press slams poland and britain after summit the german press on sunday slammed poland and britain for putting obstacles on the road to the deal reached on guidelines for a new european union treaty at the bloc 's summit this week .
-lrb- 24.06.2007 -rrb- readers weigh in on poland 's stance in treaty discussions as the european union entered discussion this week on revising the draft of its constitutional treaty , poland expressed discontentment with the existing voting system .
readers responded to this week 's discussion .
-lrb- 22.06.2007 -rrb- readers respond to conflict over eu treaty just prior to this week 's eu constitutional treaty summit , poland insisted that changes be made to the treaty 's voting system .
can and should the document be rescued ?
readers gave their two cents .
-lrb- 20.06.2007 -rrb- feedback would you like to add to the discussion ?

1 to submit an alternative to a modern bridge planned for the park-like elbe valley near dresden , or the area may lose its world heritage status , the united nation 's world heritage committee announced on monday .
" if present plans for a bridge were replaced by a solution that respected the outstanding universal value of the cultural landscape , the site would remain on the world heritage list , " a statement on the organization 's web site said .
after evaluating the alternative plans for the the waldschlösschen bridge , the unesco committee will decide if the ensemble of gardens , palaces , woods and meadows along 20 kilometers -lrb- 12.4 miles -rrb- of the valley on both sides of the elbe will continue to qualify for world heritage status .
new deadline for dresden bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dresden will remain on the unesco watch list until at least october " by october we have to present something that can not be presented , " jan mücke , one of dresden 's representatives in germany 's national parliament , told dpa news service .
" basically , we just have a new deadline . "
the valley was designated as one of 830 sites currently on the world heritage list in 2004 , but plans for building a bridge across the elbe river have threatened its listing for the past two years .
the committee decided monday to leave it on the list of endangered places .
it has never before struck a heritage site off its list , and the eastern german city 's tourist officials are working to make sure the elbe valley is n't the first place to be de-listed .
city officials , however , have said the growing traffic has forced them to build a new bridge , estimated to cost 160 million euros -lrb- $ 215 million -rrb- .
residents , in a 2005 referendum , voted in favor of the bridge , and the german constitutional court ruled earlier this month that the people 's voice should have priority over retaining international honors .
tunnel a possibility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2005 , residents voted for an additional way to get across the elbe a tunnel connecting both sides of the elbe could represent a compromise that would meet the unesco committee 's demands as well as fulfill the public 's will , according to ralf weber , a dresden architecture professor who traveled to christchurch , new zealand , where the committee met .
" in their speeches , almost every delegate country identified a tunnel as the preferred solution , " he told dpa .
according to unesco , the bridge design is too " heavy " and would degrade the landscape .
the committee meetings , which run until july 2 and are closed to the public , will consider new site nominations , sites in danger , site management and protection .
they will also draw up lists for possible future world heritage sites . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the spd has refused the deal . social democratic party chairman kurt beck could " be the chancellor tomorrow " if he accepted the left party 's demands for changes to germany 's labor , social and foreign policies , oskar lafontaine , a former spd party head and current left party chair , said in an interview published monday . " when -lrb- beck -rrb- asks , ' are you ready to push through a minimum wage , reinstate the old pension system , revise hartz iv -lrb- social welfare reforms -rrb- and pull troops out of afghanistan ? ' then beck can be chancellor tomorrow , " lafontaine told german news magazine der spiegel . a coalition of the spd , the left and the greens would represent a majority of parliamentary seats .
but beck , along with other high-ranking spd party members , flatly refused lafontaine 's offer at a weekend conference to determine the spd 's future direction . general rejection among spd bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few in the spd are interested in hearing lafontaine 's suggestions " the offer is ludicrous , " spd parliamentary group leader peter struck told sunday 's bild am sonntag newspaper .
" the left party will be in the opposition forever . " made up of disgruntled , left-leaning ex-social democrats and members of the former east german communists , the left party won its first seats in a western state government last month and has risen in political polls to 10 percent , putting it on equal footing with the green party and a point ahead of the free-market liberal fdp , according to a dimap survey conducted for the ard public broadcasting network . currently trailing the cdu by 9 percent , beck worked over the weekend to separate his party from both the left and the cdu by concentrating on domestic labor issues while chancellor angela merkel continues making a name for herself on the international stage . social and economic responsibility " we want economic goals to be inseparably connected to social justice and ecological rationality , " beck said in a speech broken up several times by applause .
" we will seek a very clear position on putting people first in the economy , contrasting neo-liberal developments in the cdu . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beck is hoping things will start looking up for his party soon beck said part of the spd 's strategy would include continuing to push for a national minimum wage , a topic of conflict in the grand coalition of spd and christian conservatives , after the cabinet reached a compromise on extending wage protections to a dozen industrial sectors . " we want social economics to be protected in the future , " he said .
" whoever works full-time has to be able to live from it . " the cdu has strongly opposed a national minimum wage . more common ground with the left ? that , however , is one of the spd 's goals that could be reached if it would leave the grand coalition and agree to working with the left , according to dietmar bartsch , the left 's general manager . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : left members said the spd needs their help to make germany more social " the spd will book success on neither the minimum wage nor the inheritance tax with the cdu or fdp , " he told monday 's leipziger volkszeitung .
" it will only work with us . " but even though the spd would be able to push through a national minimum wage with lafontaine 's help , a coalition would cost the social democrats more than they would gain , according to environment minister sigmar gabriel . " we could probably reach a minimum wage decision with him , but the price would be to isolate germany , " gabriel told the daily süddeutsche zeitung on monday . gabriel also said he doubted the sincerity of lafontaine 's offer , saying it had more to do with presenting himself in the media than with political decision making . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the spd has refused the deal . social democratic party chairman kurt beck could " be the chancellor tomorrow " if he accepted the left party 's demands for changes to germany 's labor , social and foreign policies , oskar lafontaine , a former spd party head and current left party chair , said in an interview published monday . " when -lrb- beck -rrb- asks , ' are you ready to push through a minimum wage , reinstate the old pension system , revise hartz iv -lrb- social welfare reforms -rrb- and pull troops out of afghanistan ? ' then beck can be chancellor tomorrow , " lafontaine told german news magazine der spiegel . a coalition of the spd , the left and the greens would represent a majority of parliamentary seats .
but beck , along with other high-ranking spd party members , flatly refused lafontaine 's offer at a weekend conference to determine the spd 's future direction . general rejection among spd bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few in the spd are interested in hearing lafontaine 's suggestions " the offer is ludicrous , " spd parliamentary group leader peter struck told sunday 's bild am sonntag newspaper .
" the left party will be in the opposition forever . " made up of disgruntled , left-leaning ex-social democrats and members of the former east german communists , the left party won its first seats in a western state government last month and has risen in political polls to 10 percent , putting it on equal footing with the green party and a point ahead of the free-market liberal fdp , according to a dimap survey conducted for the ard public broadcasting network . currently trailing the cdu by 9 percent , beck worked over the weekend to separate his party from both the left and the cdu by concentrating on domestic labor issues while chancellor angela merkel continues making a name for herself on the international stage . social and economic responsibility " we want economic goals to be inseparably connected to social justice and ecological rationality , " beck said in a speech broken up several times by applause .
" we will seek a very clear position on putting people first in the economy , contrasting neo-liberal developments in the cdu . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beck is hoping things will start looking up for his party soon beck said part of the spd 's strategy would include continuing to push for a national minimum wage , a topic of conflict in the grand coalition of spd and christian conservatives , after the cabinet reached a compromise on extending wage protections to a dozen industrial sectors . " we want social economics to be protected in the future , " he said .
" whoever works full-time has to be able to live from it . " the cdu has strongly opposed a national minimum wage . more common ground with the left ? that , however , is one of the spd 's goals that could be reached if it would leave the grand coalition and agree to working with the left , according to dietmar bartsch , the left 's general manager . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : left members said the spd needs their help to make germany more social " the spd will book success on neither the minimum wage nor the inheritance tax with the cdu or fdp , " he told monday 's leipziger volkszeitung .
" it will only work with us . " but even though the spd would be able to push through a national minimum wage with lafontaine 's help , a coalition would cost the social democrats more than they would gain , according to environment minister sigmar gabriel . " we could probably reach a minimum wage decision with him , but the price would be to isolate germany , " gabriel told the daily süddeutsche zeitung on monday . gabriel also said he doubted the sincerity of lafontaine 's offer , saying it had more to do with presenting himself in the media than with political decision making . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the central council of muslims in germany -lrb- zmd -rrb- harshly criticized the christian churches after high-ranking german clergyman cardinal karl lehmann last week spoke out against islam enjoying equal status to christianity . " the -lrb- christian -rrb- churches would like to ban islam to the lower leagues , " aiman mazyek , general secretary of the central council of muslims in germany , told the sunday edition of berlin 's tagesspiegel .
mazyek also pointed out that germany 's basic law ascribes equality to all religions , saying that there were no legal grounds for granting christianity special legal status .
neutrality or indifference ?
the council 's criticism came in response to comments made last week by cardinal karl lehmann , head of the german conference of bishops , who had warned against interpreting the state 's religious neutrality as " uncritical tolerance . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cardinal karl lehmann lehmann also expressed concern about all faiths being treated equally , regardless of their historical significance in europe .
" cardinal lehmann is mistaken if he thinks that the fact that europe and germany were undeniably shaped by christianity justifies the legal discrimination of other religions , " said volker beck , head of germany 's green party .
however , germany 's numerous muslim organizations have to fulfill the country 's legal requirements for becoming a religious group if they are to enjoy the same rights , added beck .
germany 's 3.2 million muslims are not represented by a single umbrella organization , but by many smaller ones . cultural roots ronald pofalla , general secretary of the conservative christian democratic union , agreed with lehmann that islam should not be granted the same legal standing as christianity .
" unlike christianity , islam is not in europe 's cultural center and is not reflected in everyday life in the same way , " pofalla said in a statement .

the central council of muslims in germany -lrb- zmd -rrb- harshly criticized the christian churches after high-ranking german clergyman cardinal karl lehmann last week spoke out against islam enjoying equal status to christianity . " the -lrb- christian -rrb- churches would like to ban islam to the lower leagues , " aiman mazyek , general secretary of the central council of muslims in germany , told the sunday edition of berlin 's tagesspiegel .
mazyek also pointed out that germany 's basic law ascribes equality to all religions , saying that there were no legal grounds for granting christianity special legal status .
neutrality or indifference ?
the council 's criticism came in response to comments made last week by cardinal karl lehmann , head of the german conference of bishops , who had warned against interpreting the state 's religious neutrality as " uncritical tolerance . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cardinal karl lehmann lehmann also expressed concern about all faiths being treated equally , regardless of their historical significance in europe .

now the german foreign minister is demanding the boy 's release . the flirtations of a 17-year-old german schoolboy are now headed towards a diplomatic confrontation between germany and turkey . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said monday that he would seek release of the teenager , marco weiss , who has been held for 10 weeks in a turkish jail over allegations that he had sexually molested a 13-year-old british girl , referred to as charlotte m. , while vacationing in a popular turkish resort on the antalyan coast . the girl 's mother had demanded that turkish police arrest and prosecute weiss for sexually molesting her daughter , according to germany 's der spiegel online .
the teenager claimed that he had only flirted with and kissed the girl , who said she was 15 years old . harsh prison conditions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there was no response from turkey to germany 's demands weiss has been held in a cell with a single lavatory and toilet that he shares with 30 other prisoners since early april .
his parents , who were in antalya , told the german press that they were allowed to see their son only once a week and were separated from him by a glass screen . " he is in very bad shape physically and psychologically , " said the family lawyer jürgen schmidt at a press conference in the small town of ülzen in lower saxony , where the parents live .
" marco sees himself as completely innocent and is baffled by what is going on . " the weiss family had already appealed to the turkish justice authorities to release their son , but their pleas went unheeded . marco weiss was supposed to be freed on bail until a court hearing scheduled for july 6 , which has been postponed , according to a spokesman from the foreign ministry .
but a turkish judge had denied his release . german appeal now the german government has issued an appeal for the schoolboy 's immediate release from prison at the highest level . " this is a tragic case that does not leave us unmoved , " said steinmeier at a human rights conference in southern germany .
" we are giving as much support to the family as we can .
our embassy is taking action .
i 'll be meeting the turkish ambassador tomorrow and will demand the release of the 17-year-old . " there was no immediate response from the turkish government to germany 's demands .
an editorial in the turkish newspaper hurriyet however strongly criticized the german government for " insulting the turkish justice system . " unfair criticism ? " it would be unthinkable for the turkish government to ask the german government in such a manner to free a turkish citizen imprisoned in germany , " the newspaper wrote . marco 's mother is back in turkey to give support to her son .
his father is undergoing chemotherapy treatment for leukemia in germany . in the last few weeks , marco was supposed to sit for his high school exams and had already applied for admission to a technical school .
if convicted , he would face up to eight years in jail . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

1 to submit an alternative to a modern bridge planned for the park-like elbe valley near dresden , or the area may lose its world heritage status , the united nation 's world heritage committee announced on monday .
" if present plans for a bridge were replaced by a solution that respected the outstanding universal value of the cultural landscape , the site would remain on the world heritage list , " a statement on the organization 's web site said .
after evaluating the alternative plans for the the waldschlösschen bridge , the unesco committee will decide if the ensemble of gardens , palaces , woods and meadows along 20 kilometers -lrb- 12.4 miles -rrb- of the valley on both sides of the elbe will continue to qualify for world heritage status .
new deadline for dresden bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dresden will remain on the unesco watch list until at least october " by october we have to present something that can not be presented , " jan mücke , one of dresden 's representatives in germany 's national parliament , told dpa news service .
" basically , we just have a new deadline . "
the valley was designated as one of 830 sites currently on the world heritage list in 2004 , but plans for building a bridge across the elbe river have threatened its listing for the past two years .
the committee decided monday to leave it on the list of endangered places .
it has never before struck a heritage site off its list , and the eastern german city 's tourist officials are working to make sure the elbe valley is n't the first place to be de-listed .
city officials , however , have said the growing traffic has forced them to build a new bridge , estimated to cost 160 million euros -lrb- $ 215 million -rrb- .
residents , in a 2005 referendum , voted in favor of the bridge , and the german constitutional court ruled earlier this month that the people 's voice should have priority over retaining international honors .
tunnel a possibility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2005 , residents voted for an additional way to get across the elbe a tunnel connecting both sides of the elbe could represent a compromise that would meet the unesco committee 's demands as well as fulfill the public 's will , according to ralf weber , a dresden architecture professor who traveled to christchurch , new zealand , where the committee met .
" in their speeches , almost every delegate country identified a tunnel as the preferred solution , " he told dpa .
according to unesco , the bridge design is too " heavy " and would degrade the landscape .
the committee meetings , which run until july 2 and are closed to the public , will consider new site nominations , sites in danger , site management and protection .
they will also draw up lists for possible future world heritage sites . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

1 to submit an alternative to a modern bridge planned for the park-like elbe valley near dresden , or the area may lose its world heritage status , the united nation 's world heritage committee announced on monday .

after evaluating the alternative plans for the the waldschlösschen bridge , the unesco committee will decide if the ensemble of gardens , palaces , woods and meadows along 20 kilometers -lrb- 12.4 miles -rrb- of the valley on both sides of the elbe will continue to qualify for world heritage status .

" basically , we just have a new deadline . "
the valley was designated as one of 830 sites currently on the world heritage list in 2004 , but plans for building a bridge across the elbe river have threatened its listing for the past two years .
the committee decided monday to leave it on the list of endangered places .
it has never before struck a heritage site off its list , and the eastern german city 's tourist officials are working to make sure the elbe valley is n't the first place to be de-listed .
city officials , however , have said the growing traffic has forced them to build a new bridge , estimated to cost 160 million euros -lrb- $ 215 million -rrb- .

" in their speeches , almost every delegate country identified a tunnel as the preferred solution , " he told dpa .
according to unesco , the bridge design is too " heavy " and would degrade the landscape .
the committee meetings , which run until july 2 and are closed to the public , will consider new site nominations , sites in danger , site management and protection .
they will also draw up lists for possible future world heritage sites . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

officials urge caution , but say there is no need to panic . veterinary experts confirmed on sunday that six wild birds found dead in two lakes near the southeastern german city nuremberg were infected with the deadly h5n1 virus . a health official at the friedrich loeffler institute said that tests were still being carried out on another five dead birds which tested positive for h5n1 , but it was still unclear whether they were infected with the deadly asian strain , which claimed nearly 200 lives since 2003 according to the world health organization . scientists fear that the virus could mutate into a form that makes human-to-human transmission possible , thereby setting off a global epidemic .
in order to contain the spread of the deadly virus , hundreds of millions of birds have been slaughtered worldwide since the first cases were discovered . no present danger to humans , but caution necessary germany 's agriculture minister horst seehofer told the newspaper münchner merkur , that there was no need to panic , but warned against contact with infected animals . " one thing is clear : the virus has not disappeared , " he said . a bird flu outbreak at the end of june is unusual said werner schnappauf , the regional minister of consumer affairs in bavaria in an interview with dpa wire services . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the infected area will be quaranteined for the next three weeks " with such warm temperatures , the virus can barely survive for a week - in cooler weather , four weeks , " he said , adding that there is no present danger for transmission of the virus to humans . local authorities had cordoned off the infected area where the diseased birds were found , which covers a radius of four kilometers -lrb- 2.5 miles -rrb- .
the area will remain quarantined for the next three weeks . over the next few days the city of nuremberg will be supported by a federal epidemiological team which will scientifically investigate the causes and background of the infection cases , city officials said .
they also warned cat and dog owners to keep their pets from straying into the quarantine zone .
possible link to last week 's outbreak in czech republic the new bird flu cases , which killed five swans and one goose , could be related to an outbreak of the same viral strain in the czech republic , which borders germany to the west and is 120 kilometers away from nuremberg .
last week , birds infected with h5n1 were found on a poultry farm in the central part of the czech republic , prompting authorities there to slaughter some 6,000 turkeys . last year in the spring , a bird flu epidemic had also broken out on the island of rügen on the baltic sea and had spread to several other regional states in germany , including bavaria .
the virus had infected other mammals , but did not spread to humans . the last case of bird flu in germany was reported last august in dresden , which is close to the czech border .

dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . the tension between less populated states and states with large populations , such as california where i live , is a fact of life in the united states and is a reality with which the eu will always have to contend .
the problem in the us has been more or less solved by allowing power to be shared based on population -lrb- the house of representatives in the us congress -rrb- and by allowing power to be shared based on individual state representation -lrb- the senate in the us congress -rrb- .
poland is not accustomed to having to work with other nations in the manner expected by the eu .
smaller nations like poland must develop their diplomatic skills and must learn to make strategic alliances within the eu to advance their agenda . - g. randel , us the countries in europe that are serious about their membership within the eu may want to form closer integration and cooperation , while countries like britain , poland and others may want to stay in the outer group .
of course this may eventually lead to a change in financial contributions for the ones that pay and the ones that receive .
it sounds fairer than the present system . - adam , canada i want to express my deep concern and disappointment of angela merkel 's behavior during the summit .
isolating poland during the summit and continuing the session without poland had nothing to do with common values and solidarity .
it was an example either of brutal pressure or a lack of the solidarity that germany talks so much about .
other members like portugal or slovenia understand more about freedom of opinions , negotiations and consensus within the eu than the powerful presidency of germany .
this is what eu means for me as a pole : solidarity , freedom and common understanding . - l. wojtowicz , poland as a new member of the eu , poland would be wise to try to fit in .
a backlash would hurt poland like in the past .

poland is still stuck in the time warp of world war two , and britain is working as an agent provocateur for the us .
both poland and britain do not serve the interests of the european union , but have their own agendas .
blair has been the cause of a lot of disruption in the eu and now has a partner in poland .
if poland is complaining about its population that was decimated in world war two , why did it open hidden concentration camps on its own territory ?
poland has been wrong and will continue to be wrong as long as it digs up the recent past . - k. t. tellis , canada i can not believe that the two brothers represent the opinion of the polish people .
maybe they should go and get a life , if you know what i mean ! - hans , us this is no way to build trust and friendship in this rather unfriendly atmosphere .
but the big brother in the us allows the polish premier to say unfriendly words on the eu voting reform without having to fear economic consequences . - g. gosau , canada yes , for me it 's thumbs up !
the almost impossible was accomplished through skillful diplomacy .
britain with blair put the road blocks , but was outsmarted .
poland can not distinguish between patriotism and nationalism .
maybe future leaders will realize that if they are not prepared to give and take , they 'll isolate themselves . - e. heptner , usa the eu is better off without countries like poland , which not just hold the eu back , but increase the likelihood of its disintegration .

readers had mixed opinions readers weighed in on last week 's eu summit to revise the bloc 's constitutional draft . the following comments reflect the views of dw-world.de readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . the tension between less populated states and states with large populations , such as california where i live , is a fact of life in the united states and is a reality with which the eu will always have to contend .
the problem in the us has been more or less solved by allowing power to be shared based on population -lrb- the house of representatives in the us congress -rrb- and by allowing power to be shared based on individual state representation -lrb- the senate in the us congress -rrb- .
poland is not accustomed to having to work with other nations in the manner expected by the eu .
smaller nations like poland must develop their diplomatic skills and must learn to make strategic alliances within the eu to advance their agenda . - g. randel , us the countries in europe that are serious about their membership within the eu may want to form closer integration and cooperation , while countries like britain , poland and others may want to stay in the outer group .
of course this may eventually lead to a change in financial contributions for the ones that pay and the ones that receive .
it sounds fairer than the present system . - adam , canada i want to express my deep concern and disappointment of angela merkel 's behavior during the summit .
isolating poland during the summit and continuing the session without poland had nothing to do with common values and solidarity .
it was an example either of brutal pressure or a lack of the solidarity that germany talks so much about .
other members like portugal or slovenia understand more about freedom of opinions , negotiations and consensus within the eu than the powerful presidency of germany .
this is what eu means for me as a pole : solidarity , freedom and common understanding . - l. wojtowicz , poland as a new member of the eu , poland would be wise to try to fit in .
a backlash would hurt poland like in the past .
a lot of europeans want to move forward and have no time for such backward thinking . - d. noack , canada bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solidary , freedom and understanding are the eu ideals , wrote one polish reader british and poles were right .
german domination must be stopped .
comments about britain and poland from the german press are sickening . - maria , australia from the articles i have read -lrb- i do n't know the whole scope of the new agreement but -rrb- , it appears to say " to hell with what the people of europe want , we socialists know best . "
it could be a very disturbing trend toward less power by the people and a rise of a socialist aristocracy . - l. thrash , usa why should the european union pay much attention to what britain and poland say ?
poland is still stuck in the time warp of world war two , and britain is working as an agent provocateur for the us .
both poland and britain do not serve the interests of the european union , but have their own agendas .
blair has been the cause of a lot of disruption in the eu and now has a partner in poland .
if poland is complaining about its population that was decimated in world war two , why did it open hidden concentration camps on its own territory ?
poland has been wrong and will continue to be wrong as long as it digs up the recent past . - k. t. tellis , canada i can not believe that the two brothers represent the opinion of the polish people .
maybe they should go and get a life , if you know what i mean ! - hans , us this is no way to build trust and friendship in this rather unfriendly atmosphere .
but the big brother in the us allows the polish premier to say unfriendly words on the eu voting reform without having to fear economic consequences . - g. gosau , canada yes , for me it 's thumbs up !
the almost impossible was accomplished through skillful diplomacy .
britain with blair put the road blocks , but was outsmarted .
poland can not distinguish between patriotism and nationalism .
maybe future leaders will realize that if they are not prepared to give and take , they 'll isolate themselves . - e. heptner , usa the eu is better off without countries like poland , which not just hold the eu back , but increase the likelihood of its disintegration .
the eu has to be a union of like-minded nations .
poland is not one of those , and nor is england for that matter . - c. ranaweera , canada compiled by dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german press slams poland and britain after summit the german press on sunday slammed poland and britain for putting obstacles on the road to the deal reached on guidelines for a new european union treaty at the bloc 's summit this week .

it was an example either of brutal pressure or a lack of the solidarity that germany talks so much about .
other members like portugal or slovenia understand more about freedom of opinions , negotiations and consensus within the eu than the powerful presidency of germany .
this is what eu means for me as a pole : solidarity , freedom and common understanding . - l. wojtowicz , poland as a new member of the eu , poland would be wise to try to fit in .
a backlash would hurt poland like in the past .
a lot of europeans want to move forward and have no time for such backward thinking . - d. noack , canada bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solidary , freedom and understanding are the eu ideals , wrote one polish reader british and poles were right .
german domination must be stopped .
comments about britain and poland from the german press are sickening . - maria , australia from the articles i have read -lrb- i do n't know the whole scope of the new agreement but -rrb- , it appears to say " to hell with what the people of europe want , we socialists know best . "
it could be a very disturbing trend toward less power by the people and a rise of a socialist aristocracy . - l. thrash , usa why should the european union pay much attention to what britain and poland say ?
poland is still stuck in the time warp of world war two , and britain is working as an agent provocateur for the us .
both poland and britain do not serve the interests of the european union , but have their own agendas .
blair has been the cause of a lot of disruption in the eu and now has a partner in poland .
if poland is complaining about its population that was decimated in world war two , why did it open hidden concentration camps on its own territory ?
poland has been wrong and will continue to be wrong as long as it digs up the recent past . - k. t. tellis , canada i can not believe that the two brothers represent the opinion of the polish people .
maybe they should go and get a life , if you know what i mean ! - hans , us this is no way to build trust and friendship in this rather unfriendly atmosphere .
but the big brother in the us allows the polish premier to say unfriendly words on the eu voting reform without having to fear economic consequences . - g. gosau , canada yes , for me it 's thumbs up !
the almost impossible was accomplished through skillful diplomacy .
britain with blair put the road blocks , but was outsmarted .
poland can not distinguish between patriotism and nationalism .
maybe future leaders will realize that if they are not prepared to give and take , they 'll isolate themselves . - e. heptner , usa the eu is better off without countries like poland , which not just hold the eu back , but increase the likelihood of its disintegration .
the eu has to be a union of like-minded nations .
poland is not one of those , and nor is england for that matter . - c. ranaweera , canada compiled by dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german press slams poland and britain after summit the german press on sunday slammed poland and britain for putting obstacles on the road to the deal reached on guidelines for a new european union treaty at the bloc 's summit this week .
-lrb- 24.06.2007 -rrb- readers weigh in on poland 's stance in treaty discussions as the european union entered discussion this week on revising the draft of its constitutional treaty , poland expressed discontentment with the existing voting system .
readers responded to this week 's discussion .
-lrb- 22.06.2007 -rrb- readers respond to conflict over eu treaty just prior to this week 's eu constitutional treaty summit , poland insisted that changes be made to the treaty 's voting system .
can and should the document be rescued ?

" we are carefully watching how state-controlled corporate entities from russia , china and the middle east are taking a stake in or buying companies , " deputy finance minister thomas mirow told the handelsblatt daily on monday . it often remains unclear what motivates the state-controlled funds which are increasingly looking to german companies , said mirow , who added that more and more foreign financial institutes want to invest in germany . protective measures coming ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ackermann said germany needs to decide what sectors it wants to keep its own high-ranking german officials are also considering if and how the country should implement measures to protect the country 's core business from foreign takeovers , government spokesman ulrich wilhelm said monday in berlin . " considerations over whether we should come to a particular balance have been going on here for a series of months , " he said . deutsche bank ceo josef ackermann said last week that the government needed to decide if it wanted to defend domestic business from state-run foreign investment funds .

they dabbed a bit of a cannabis extract on the little ears , and the allergic reaction went away . teenagers looking for a good excuse to experiment with marijuana - in its topical form that is - may have one now .
it turns out that granny ’ s over-the-counter cannabis ointment sold one hundred years ago to treat eczema , hives and other skin allergies , has a scientific basis after all . in the 1930s , the household remedy was dismissed as a quack product and banned due to the intoxicating effects of its active ingredient , tetrahydrocannabinol -lrb- thc -rrb- , which induces the marijuana high . now a research team from the university of bonn has resurrected granny ’ s old herbal extract . it turns out that thc does in fact reduce the ugly zits and swelling from skin allergies .
the bonn team stumbled on thc ’ s anti-inflammatory benefits while doing a brain study on mice wearing ear clips . mice ear clips the clips were originally used as id tags to differentiate the little rodents from one another , but had unexpectedly caused an allergic reaction around the ears .
since the mice had been genetically engineered not to respond to cannabinoids , either thc or its natural equivalents generated in the brain , the researchers realized that they hit upon a discovery . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rash disappear when scientists dabbed a bit of granny 's ointment on mouse ears they realized that cannabinoids operate like the brakes of a car , and prevent the body ’ s immune system from triggering inflammatory red sores . for two decades , scientists have known that the brain produces cannabinoids naturally , but they are still trying to figure out how thc regulates the immune system . the bonn scientists then started dabbing a bit of granny ’ s concoction on the skin of the poor little mice , and bingo — the swelling and redness disappeared . professor thomas tuting , a member of the team , said : " if we dabbed thc solution onto the animals ' skin shortly before and after applying the allergen -lrb- the ear clips -rrb- , a lot less swelling occurred than normal . ” tuting added that the amount of thc required to treat skin allergies wouldn ’ t be enough to induce a high though .
in other words , cannabis skin lotion could make a comeback , but just don ’ t count on it as a recreational drug . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the spd has refused the deal . social democratic party chairman kurt beck could " be the chancellor tomorrow " if he accepted the left party 's demands for changes to germany 's labor , social and foreign policies , oskar lafontaine , a former spd party head and current left party chair , said in an interview published monday . " when -lrb- beck -rrb- asks , ' are you ready to push through a minimum wage , reinstate the old pension system , revise hartz iv -lrb- social welfare reforms -rrb- and pull troops out of afghanistan ? ' then beck can be chancellor tomorrow , " lafontaine told german news magazine der spiegel . a coalition of the spd , the left and the greens would represent a majority of parliamentary seats .
but beck , along with other high-ranking spd party members , flatly refused lafontaine 's offer at a weekend conference to determine the spd 's future direction . general rejection among spd bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few in the spd are interested in hearing lafontaine 's suggestions " the offer is ludicrous , " spd parliamentary group leader peter struck told sunday 's bild am sonntag newspaper .
" the left party will be in the opposition forever . " made up of disgruntled , left-leaning ex-social democrats and members of the former east german communists , the left party won its first seats in a western state government last month and has risen in political polls to 10 percent , putting it on equal footing with the green party and a point ahead of the free-market liberal fdp , according to a dimap survey conducted for the ard public broadcasting network . currently trailing the cdu by 9 percent , beck worked over the weekend to separate his party from both the left and the cdu by concentrating on domestic labor issues while chancellor angela merkel continues making a name for herself on the international stage . social and economic responsibility " we want economic goals to be inseparably connected to social justice and ecological rationality , " beck said in a speech broken up several times by applause .
" we will seek a very clear position on putting people first in the economy , contrasting neo-liberal developments in the cdu . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beck is hoping things will start looking up for his party soon beck said part of the spd 's strategy would include continuing to push for a national minimum wage , a topic of conflict in the grand coalition of spd and christian conservatives , after the cabinet reached a compromise on extending wage protections to a dozen industrial sectors . " we want social economics to be protected in the future , " he said .
" whoever works full-time has to be able to live from it . " the cdu has strongly opposed a national minimum wage . more common ground with the left ? that , however , is one of the spd 's goals that could be reached if it would leave the grand coalition and agree to working with the left , according to dietmar bartsch , the left 's general manager . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : left members said the spd needs their help to make germany more social " the spd will book success on neither the minimum wage nor the inheritance tax with the cdu or fdp , " he told monday 's leipziger volkszeitung .
" it will only work with us . " but even though the spd would be able to push through a national minimum wage with lafontaine 's help , a coalition would cost the social democrats more than they would gain , according to environment minister sigmar gabriel . " we could probably reach a minimum wage decision with him , but the price would be to isolate germany , " gabriel told the daily süddeutsche zeitung on monday . gabriel also said he doubted the sincerity of lafontaine 's offer , saying it had more to do with presenting himself in the media than with political decision making . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the spd has refused the deal . social democratic party chairman kurt beck could " be the chancellor tomorrow " if he accepted the left party 's demands for changes to germany 's labor , social and foreign policies , oskar lafontaine , a former spd party head and current left party chair , said in an interview published monday . " when -lrb- beck -rrb- asks , ' are you ready to push through a minimum wage , reinstate the old pension system , revise hartz iv -lrb- social welfare reforms -rrb- and pull troops out of afghanistan ? ' then beck can be chancellor tomorrow , " lafontaine told german news magazine der spiegel . a coalition of the spd , the left and the greens would represent a majority of parliamentary seats .
but beck , along with other high-ranking spd party members , flatly refused lafontaine 's offer at a weekend conference to determine the spd 's future direction . general rejection among spd bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few in the spd are interested in hearing lafontaine 's suggestions " the offer is ludicrous , " spd parliamentary group leader peter struck told sunday 's bild am sonntag newspaper .
" the left party will be in the opposition forever . " made up of disgruntled , left-leaning ex-social democrats and members of the former east german communists , the left party won its first seats in a western state government last month and has risen in political polls to 10 percent , putting it on equal footing with the green party and a point ahead of the free-market liberal fdp , according to a dimap survey conducted for the ard public broadcasting network . currently trailing the cdu by 9 percent , beck worked over the weekend to separate his party from both the left and the cdu by concentrating on domestic labor issues while chancellor angela merkel continues making a name for herself on the international stage . social and economic responsibility " we want economic goals to be inseparably connected to social justice and ecological rationality , " beck said in a speech broken up several times by applause .
" we will seek a very clear position on putting people first in the economy , contrasting neo-liberal developments in the cdu . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beck is hoping things will start looking up for his party soon beck said part of the spd 's strategy would include continuing to push for a national minimum wage , a topic of conflict in the grand coalition of spd and christian conservatives , after the cabinet reached a compromise on extending wage protections to a dozen industrial sectors . " we want social economics to be protected in the future , " he said .
" whoever works full-time has to be able to live from it . " the cdu has strongly opposed a national minimum wage . more common ground with the left ? that , however , is one of the spd 's goals that could be reached if it would leave the grand coalition and agree to working with the left , according to dietmar bartsch , the left 's general manager . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : left members said the spd needs their help to make germany more social " the spd will book success on neither the minimum wage nor the inheritance tax with the cdu or fdp , " he told monday 's leipziger volkszeitung .

1 to submit an alternative to a modern bridge planned for the park-like elbe valley near dresden , or the area may lose its world heritage status , the united nation 's world heritage committee announced on monday .
" if present plans for a bridge were replaced by a solution that respected the outstanding universal value of the cultural landscape , the site would remain on the world heritage list , " a statement on the organization 's web site said .
after evaluating the alternative plans for the the waldschlösschen bridge , the unesco committee will decide if the ensemble of gardens , palaces , woods and meadows along 20 kilometers -lrb- 12.4 miles -rrb- of the valley on both sides of the elbe will continue to qualify for world heritage status .
new deadline for dresden bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dresden will remain on the unesco watch list until at least october " by october we have to present something that can not be presented , " jan mücke , one of dresden 's representatives in germany 's national parliament , told dpa news service .
" basically , we just have a new deadline . "
the valley was designated as one of 830 sites currently on the world heritage list in 2004 , but plans for building a bridge across the elbe river have threatened its listing for the past two years .
the committee decided monday to leave it on the list of endangered places .
it has never before struck a heritage site off its list , and the eastern german city 's tourist officials are working to make sure the elbe valley is n't the first place to be de-listed .
city officials , however , have said the growing traffic has forced them to build a new bridge , estimated to cost 160 million euros -lrb- $ 215 million -rrb- .
residents , in a 2005 referendum , voted in favor of the bridge , and the german constitutional court ruled earlier this month that the people 's voice should have priority over retaining international honors .
tunnel a possibility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2005 , residents voted for an additional way to get across the elbe a tunnel connecting both sides of the elbe could represent a compromise that would meet the unesco committee 's demands as well as fulfill the public 's will , according to ralf weber , a dresden architecture professor who traveled to christchurch , new zealand , where the committee met .
" in their speeches , almost every delegate country identified a tunnel as the preferred solution , " he told dpa .
according to unesco , the bridge design is too " heavy " and would degrade the landscape .
the committee meetings , which run until july 2 and are closed to the public , will consider new site nominations , sites in danger , site management and protection .
they will also draw up lists for possible future world heritage sites . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

officials urge caution , but say there is no need to panic . veterinary experts confirmed on sunday that six wild birds found dead in two lakes near the southeastern german city nuremberg were infected with the deadly h5n1 virus . a health official at the friedrich loeffler institute said that tests were still being carried out on another five dead birds which tested positive for h5n1 , but it was still unclear whether they were infected with the deadly asian strain , which claimed nearly 200 lives since 2003 according to the world health organization . scientists fear that the virus could mutate into a form that makes human-to-human transmission possible , thereby setting off a global epidemic .
in order to contain the spread of the deadly virus , hundreds of millions of birds have been slaughtered worldwide since the first cases were discovered . no present danger to humans , but caution necessary germany 's agriculture minister horst seehofer told the newspaper münchner merkur , that there was no need to panic , but warned against contact with infected animals . " one thing is clear : the virus has not disappeared , " he said . a bird flu outbreak at the end of june is unusual said werner schnappauf , the regional minister of consumer affairs in bavaria in an interview with dpa wire services . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the infected area will be quaranteined for the next three weeks " with such warm temperatures , the virus can barely survive for a week - in cooler weather , four weeks , " he said , adding that there is no present danger for transmission of the virus to humans . local authorities had cordoned off the infected area where the diseased birds were found , which covers a radius of four kilometers -lrb- 2.5 miles -rrb- .
the area will remain quarantined for the next three weeks . over the next few days the city of nuremberg will be supported by a federal epidemiological team which will scientifically investigate the causes and background of the infection cases , city officials said .
they also warned cat and dog owners to keep their pets from straying into the quarantine zone .
possible link to last week 's outbreak in czech republic the new bird flu cases , which killed five swans and one goose , could be related to an outbreak of the same viral strain in the czech republic , which borders germany to the west and is 120 kilometers away from nuremberg .
last week , birds infected with h5n1 were found on a poultry farm in the central part of the czech republic , prompting authorities there to slaughter some 6,000 turkeys . last year in the spring , a bird flu epidemic had also broken out on the island of rügen on the baltic sea and had spread to several other regional states in germany , including bavaria .
the virus had infected other mammals , but did not spread to humans . the last case of bird flu in germany was reported last august in dresden , which is close to the czech border .

the move angered us-based google so much that the company threatened to close its popular e-mail service , which allows people to enter fake information when signing up for an e-mail address , according to the company 's privacy representative , peter fleischer .
many users around the globe make use of this anonymity , be it to protect themselves from spam , or to publish their opinions despite state repression " , fleischer told german business daily wirtschaftswoche .
" if the web community can no longer trust us to handle their data with care , we will go down in no time .
" in the worst case , we 'll turn off google mail in germany , " fleischer said .
he also said he doubted the law would have much of an effect , " people will simply turn to foreign e-mail addresses . "

german venture capitalist daniel giersch sued google for rights to the " gmail " trademark for his own business , which goes by the name g-mail - short for " giersch mail . "
giersch said he only wanted to use the trademark in germany , switzerland , norway and monaco .
the court is expected to provide a written ruling making giersch 's ownership of the trademark on july 4 , according to google and giersch .

early indications are that the turnout was low , with the electoral commission saying mistakes had been made .
the commission says it will take at least a week before the results of this election are known .
some 40 parties boycotted the poll , saying it was aimed at shoring up president denis sassou-nguesso , who has ruled the state for 23 years .
' incompetence ' in a short press conference in brazzaville after casting his vote , mr sassou-nguesso warned people against prejudging the election before the results were published .
what is clear is that many people were unable to vote because they had not received their electoral cards or because they were not on the electoral roll .
in the remote northern town of impfondo , observers said some voting stations could not open because they had neither electoral rolls nor ballot papers .
several people produced electoral cards accidentally printed for children and many - including the president - had their birthdays incorrectly printed on the electoral roll .

" we can talk about incompetence , but we can also talk about a deliberate attempt not to organise good elections , " said roger owoko , the head of congo 's ocdh human rights organisation , which has been monitoring the elections .
" we ca n't imagine that with the knowledge we have of organising elections , that we make even worse mistakes than at the last election in 2002 . "
analysts say they expect candidates loyal to the president to maintain their control of the national assembly .
those candidates who have not gained a majority of the votes cast in their constituencies will face a second round run-off in a month 's time .

a careless relative of one farmer started a fire to clear what was left of their already-harvested field .
unfortunately , the wind fanned the flames and before long , the fire had spread to nearby unharvested fields .
farmers desperately cleared a path in front of the flames to halt their advance .
they succeeded , but not before the fire had destroyed 60 mu -lrb- 1 hectare = 15 mu -rrb- of wheat fields .
furious villagers in donglu , in shandong province , demanded compensation from the woman responsible after seeing a sizable chunk of their annual earnings go up in smoke .
" she was only thinking of herself , " said the still-angry wang yuzhen , who farms 11 mu of land with her husband lu qingze .
they lost several mu of wheat .
" the woman came back from the county town to help her brother with the harvest .
they wanted to clear the field quickly so they could plant their maize crop , " mrs wang explained .
slim pickings the woman responsible eventually agreed to compensate each villager 400 yuan -lrb- $ 52 -rrb- for each mu of wheat they had lost .
villagers accepted , but in doing so , received only about half of what they would have earned if they had harvested and then sold the wheat on the open market .
and a neighbouring village , where fields were also damaged , has still not agreed compensation terms .
farmers there are threatening to sue the woman who has , perhaps wisely , gone back to her home and job in the nearby town of chiping .
the sums may appear small , but to these farmers , who have not benefited from china 's economic boom as much as urban workers , it means the difference between a good year and a bad year .
like others in donglu village , farmer wang and her husband harvest just two main crops a year - wheat in june , maize in the autumn - on their small plot of land , which was allocated to them by the village head .
together they can expect to earn a total of about 13,000 yuan -lrb- $ 1,700 -rrb- a year from the two crops .
they also have two cows , one pig and a yard full of squawking chickens , which they will sell to earn a little extra .
other villagers grow vegetables such as beans , onions , tomatoes and aubergines to earn more money , but profits are small .
mrs wang and her husband do n't think growing them is worth the effort .
the couple supplement their annual income with money sent home by their three daughters , who have all left the village to work in china 's big cities .
mrs wang and mr lu are currently arguing about whether to buy a washing machine or a refrigerator with money they expect their daughters to give them next year .
wealth gap widens donglu villagers are typical of others across china .
some provinces are richer than others , but all farmers generally earn less than their city cousins .
in january this year , when the chinese government held a news conference to talk about the economy 's performance in 2006 , the overall growth rate of 10.7 % made most of the headlines .
but at the same event , the government also revealed that the income gap between rural and urban workers widened last year .
workers in towns and cities now earn more than three times more than farmers .
urban people had an average disposable income of 11,759 yuan -lrb- $ 1,543 -rrb- last year , a figure that was higher in more developed cities such as shanghai and guangzhou .
net income in the countryside was just 3,587 yuan -lrb- $ 471 -rrb- a head .
part of the problem is that prices for agricultural products have not risen as much as for other goods in recent years .
in a report published in 2006 , the world bank estimated that 8 % of the chinese population - about 106 million people - lived on less than $ 1 a day .
most of those are in the countryside .
this does not mean that chinese farmers are not benefiting from the economic boom - they are .
last year , average rural incomes grew by more than 10 % .
the problem is that urban incomes are growing faster .
china 's government recognises the problem and sees the potential social problems that can arise if the income gap continues to widen .
it has initiated a number of schemes to reduce the burden on rural people , such as scrapping agricultural taxes last year - taxes that had been levied for 2,600 years .
" it made our lives a lot easier , " said mrs wang , whose family previously paid 400 yuan in tax every year for each person .
however , a report issued by china 's national development and reform commission earlier this year said government efforts to narrow the income gap between rural and urban areas had so far had " little effect " .
for the farmers of donglu and elsewhere in china , that means they will be at the mercy of accidents , natural disasters and fluctuating market prices for some years to come .

it has initiated a number of schemes to reduce the burden on rural people , such as scrapping agricultural taxes last year - taxes that had been levied for 2,600 years .
" it made our lives a lot easier , " said mrs wang , whose family previously paid 400 yuan in tax every year for each person .
however , a report issued by china 's national development and reform commission earlier this year said government efforts to narrow the income gap between rural and urban areas had so far had " little effect " .
for the farmers of donglu and elsewhere in china , that means they will be at the mercy of accidents , natural disasters and fluctuating market prices for some years to come .

flames reduced the fields to ashes a careless relative of one farmer started a fire to clear what was left of their already-harvested field .
unfortunately , the wind fanned the flames and before long , the fire had spread to nearby unharvested fields .
farmers desperately cleared a path in front of the flames to halt their advance .
they succeeded , but not before the fire had destroyed 60 mu -lrb- 1 hectare = 15 mu -rrb- of wheat fields .
furious villagers in donglu , in shandong province , demanded compensation from the woman responsible after seeing a sizable chunk of their annual earnings go up in smoke .
" she was only thinking of herself , " said the still-angry wang yuzhen , who farms 11 mu of land with her husband lu qingze .
they lost several mu of wheat .
" the woman came back from the county town to help her brother with the harvest .
they wanted to clear the field quickly so they could plant their maize crop , " mrs wang explained .
slim pickings the woman responsible eventually agreed to compensate each villager 400 yuan -lrb- $ 52 -rrb- for each mu of wheat they had lost .
villagers accepted , but in doing so , received only about half of what they would have earned if they had harvested and then sold the wheat on the open market .
and a neighbouring village , where fields were also damaged , has still not agreed compensation terms .
farmers there are threatening to sue the woman who has , perhaps wisely , gone back to her home and job in the nearby town of chiping .
the sums may appear small , but to these farmers , who have not benefited from china 's economic boom as much as urban workers , it means the difference between a good year and a bad year .
wang yuzhen and her husband are typical chinese farmers like others in donglu village , farmer wang and her husband harvest just two main crops a year - wheat in june , maize in the autumn - on their small plot of land , which was allocated to them by the village head .
together they can expect to earn a total of about 13,000 yuan -lrb- $ 1,700 -rrb- a year from the two crops .
they also have two cows , one pig and a yard full of squawking chickens , which they will sell to earn a little extra .
other villagers grow vegetables such as beans , onions , tomatoes and aubergines to earn more money , but profits are small .
mrs wang and her husband do n't think growing them is worth the effort .
the couple supplement their annual income with money sent home by their three daughters , who have all left the village to work in china 's big cities .
mrs wang and mr lu are currently arguing about whether to buy a washing machine or a refrigerator with money they expect their daughters to give them next year .
wealth gap widens donglu villagers are typical of others across china .
some provinces are richer than others , but all farmers generally earn less than their city cousins .
in january this year , when the chinese government held a news conference to talk about the economy 's performance in 2006 , the overall growth rate of 10.7 % made most of the headlines .
but at the same event , the government also revealed that the income gap between rural and urban workers widened last year .
workers in towns and cities now earn more than three times more than farmers .
urban people had an average disposable income of 11,759 yuan -lrb- $ 1,543 -rrb- last year , a figure that was higher in more developed cities such as shanghai and guangzhou .
net income in the countryside was just 3,587 yuan -lrb- $ 471 -rrb- a head .
part of the problem is that prices for agricultural products have not risen as much as for other goods in recent years .
chinese rural workers still have a hard life in a report published in 2006 , the world bank estimated that 8 % of the chinese population - about 106 million people - lived on less than $ 1 a day .

as many as four out of five people from gay communities will be verbally abused at some time in their lives while three out of five will be assaulted .
but , it is claimed , most attacks go unreported because of victims ' fears .
stonewall cymru has called for tougher laws to crack down on incitement to homophobic hatred .
bbc wales ' eye on wales programme found that reports of abuse and assault against gay , lesbian , bisexual and transgender communities , while on the increase , are thought to represent the tip of the iceberg .
the home office estimates around 90 % of homophobic hate crime goes unreported .
i 'm happy to say that things have vastly improved , but only recently improved south wales police deputy chief constable peter vaughan that is because victims are afraid of being " outed " to family , friends , colleagues and the community , or attracting retribution , or a general lack of confidence about how their case will be handed .
according to the programme the police , crown prosecution service and others in the criminal justice system are aware of the problem and are working with gay rights group stonewall cymru to encourage more victims to come forward .
anonymous reporting of incidents and the protection of victims ' identities in court cases are among measures which have been introduced to help .
south wales police 's deputy chief constable peter vaughan told the programme how attitudes have changed : " with the police service , up until fairly recently legislation pushed us down an avenue we did n't necessarily want to go down .
tougher laws " you 've gone from an organisation that a few years ago was unnecessarily prosecuting individuals for their sexual preferences , to one that is actively engaging our lesbian and gay communities to try and make things a little better .
" i 'm happy to say that things have vastly improved , but only recently improved , " he said .
meanwhile stonewall is urging tougher laws against incitement to homophobic hatred to send out a signal to society that such bigotry will not be tolerated .
since 2005 , homophobic intent can be taken into consideration as an aggravating feature when sentencing an offender , but there are currently no specific offences relating to homophobic hate crime , such as for crimes motivated by race or religious hatred .
matthew batten , stonewall cyrus 's policy and public affairs officer , said : " stonewall is campaigning for the government to including a new offence of incitement to hate crime on the grounds of sexual orientation . "
mr batten said they would like the changes to be introduced in the forthcoming criminal justice bill .
" it 's something we know we 've got widespread support for and will be lobbying very hard for , " he said .

bbc news -pipe- health -pipe- out-of-hours demand riles doctors home news sport radio tv weather languages low graphics -pipe- accessibility help one-minute world news news services your news when you want it news front page africa americas asia-pacific europe middle east south asia uk business health medical notes science & environment technology entertainment also in the news - video and audio - programmes have your say in pictures country profiles special reports related bbc sites sport weather on this day editors ' blog last updated : monday , 25 june 2007 , 06:33 gmt 07:33 uk e-mail this to a friend printable version out-of-hours demand riles doctors by adam brimelow health correspondent , bbc news patients want better access to gp surgeries gordon brown could be on a collision course with doctors over his big priority in the nhs - improving access to gps .
the british medical association has accused the government of trying to unpick the contract which allowed them to give up responsibility for out of hours care .
it says if ministers want gps to open for patients early or late in the day , or on saturdays , they are going to have to find more money , or services will suffer at other times of the day .
is there a way out of the deadlock ?
a few days ago at a bma gathering in london a yorkshire gp , dr andrew green , proposed charging patients for routine care at evenings and weekends .
there was a backlash in the papers , and from politicians .
they accused doctors of being greedy for demanding yet more money on top of big pay rises .
the idea was voted down .
but the bma 's gp chairman , dr hamish meldrum , said it had promoted an important discussion - one that is clearly exercising mr brown , who has made improving access a priority .
feeling of anger dr meldrum said there was no going back on the gp contract , agreed a few years ago .
there is a feeling of anger towards the government dr hamish meldrum this defined their core hours - 0800 to 1830 on weekdays - and allowed them to give up responsibility for out-of-hours care .
he said : " i think there is a feeling of anger towards the government in that an agreement was reached in good faith between both sides , voted on by the profession after a very extensive ballot , and now government are trying to unpick it .
" we are actually seeing the government trying to either change the definition of in-hours working or ask for more work for the same money . "
there is a perception among many doctors that many people feel that under the contract they are not providing value for money .
they insist this is unfair .
but the government is ready to wield the weapon of public opinion .
unhappy about access it is preparing to publish a survey of more than two million patients , which is likely to show a significant minority are unhappy about gp access .
dr meldrum is defiant .
" if the government is saying that , with essentially the same workforce , gps can extend their normal working hours very significantly , while at the same time many gps are still are still working out of hours , then i 'm sorry , that is unsustainable . "
a lot of gps are quite anxious about some of the many changes which have been occurring over the last few years dr maggie walker so how do you get round this ?
the patient survey will release small financial rewards for practices where patients are happy with access .
trusts can also buy in alternative providers , including private companies , to plug gaps in services .
dr michael dixon , chairman of the nhs alliance , which represents primary care trusts , says local solutions will work best .
" a showdown would happen if this had to be negotiated at national level as things stand , " he said .
" that is why my advice to gordon brown would be to hand the problem to local patients , local pcts , local practices , and say : ' you find out locally what you want , and then mutually you decide on how you are going to pay for it ' . "
extended hours that is what has happened at the churchill medical centre in kingston surrey , where patients have the option of early morning or evening appointments during the working week , or a saturday surgery .
opening hours were extended last autumn , in response to a patient survey .
one patient i spoke to , aisha javaid , said this was a great help .
" for me it 's actually crucial because i 'm a really busy childminder , and i have loads of kids during the day .
" if i was n't able to come in the evenings i literally would have to bring the whole crew to go and see the doctor when i need to . "
this is a big practice , with 11 gps .

the british medical association has accused the government of trying to unpick the contract which allowed them to give up responsibility for out of hours care .
it says if ministers want gps to open for patients early or late in the day , or on saturdays , they are going to have to find more money , or services will suffer at other times of the day .
is there a way out of the deadlock ?
a few days ago at a bma gathering in london a yorkshire gp , dr andrew green , proposed charging patients for routine care at evenings and weekends .
there was a backlash in the papers , and from politicians .
they accused doctors of being greedy for demanding yet more money on top of big pay rises .
the idea was voted down .
but the bma 's gp chairman , dr hamish meldrum , said it had promoted an important discussion - one that is clearly exercising mr brown , who has made improving access a priority .
feeling of anger dr meldrum said there was no going back on the gp contract , agreed a few years ago .
there is a feeling of anger towards the government dr hamish meldrum this defined their core hours - 0800 to 1830 on weekdays - and allowed them to give up responsibility for out-of-hours care .
he said : " i think there is a feeling of anger towards the government in that an agreement was reached in good faith between both sides , voted on by the profession after a very extensive ballot , and now government are trying to unpick it .
" we are actually seeing the government trying to either change the definition of in-hours working or ask for more work for the same money . "
there is a perception among many doctors that many people feel that under the contract they are not providing value for money .
they insist this is unfair .
but the government is ready to wield the weapon of public opinion .
unhappy about access it is preparing to publish a survey of more than two million patients , which is likely to show a significant minority are unhappy about gp access .
dr meldrum is defiant .
" if the government is saying that , with essentially the same workforce , gps can extend their normal working hours very significantly , while at the same time many gps are still are still working out of hours , then i 'm sorry , that is unsustainable . "
a lot of gps are quite anxious about some of the many changes which have been occurring over the last few years dr maggie walker so how do you get round this ?
the patient survey will release small financial rewards for practices where patients are happy with access .
trusts can also buy in alternative providers , including private companies , to plug gaps in services .
dr michael dixon , chairman of the nhs alliance , which represents primary care trusts , says local solutions will work best .
" a showdown would happen if this had to be negotiated at national level as things stand , " he said .
" that is why my advice to gordon brown would be to hand the problem to local patients , local pcts , local practices , and say : ' you find out locally what you want , and then mutually you decide on how you are going to pay for it ' . "
extended hours that is what has happened at the churchill medical centre in kingston surrey , where patients have the option of early morning or evening appointments during the working week , or a saturday surgery .
opening hours were extended last autumn , in response to a patient survey .
one patient i spoke to , aisha javaid , said this was a great help .
" for me it 's actually crucial because i 'm a really busy childminder , and i have loads of kids during the day .
" if i was n't able to come in the evenings i literally would have to bring the whole crew to go and see the doctor when i need to . "
this is a big practice , with 11 gps .
that made it easier to organise evening and saturday surgeries favoured by people with jobs , without cutting back on daytime services which see more older patients and children .
the gps do n't get any extra money , but dr maggie walker says it has been a great success for patients .

the two-man crew of the abbie rose were fishing a mile off tynemouth when their propeller fell off , leaving them drifting helplessly .
they made an emergency call to the coastguard , leading to the launch of tynemouth rnli 's all weather lifeboat .
a rope was attached and the boat was towed to safety .
the abbie rose was the subject of an inland rescue at scotswood in february when her engine failed .
' life-threatening ' the boat was again rescued in march , when her engine failed just off south shields beach .
volunteer rnli crewmember jill mccormick said : " when we got to the boat we could hardly believe it was the abbie rose again .
" some of the crew have rescued her three times now and are on first name terms with her owner . "
an rnli spokesman added : " sometimes people can just be unlucky , but we would urge anyone going to sea to make sure their engine and other mechanical parts are working properly .

as a child , clarkson 's favourite film was jim henson 's gothic muppet fantasy labyrinth .
the movie revolves around a young girl , sarah williams , who sets out to rescue her baby brother from david bowie 's fright-wigged goblin king .
at the climax , while being tormented in a wicked castle , sarah cries : " you have no power over me " and the goblin king is defeated .
" i said that all the time when i was a kid , " clarkson laughs .
" i 'd say it any time somebody did n't do what i wanted . "
it 's a phrase the 25-year-old pop star has found herself using in recent months as she battled for creative control of her career .
she parted ways with her manager and , days later , cancelled a us tour because of poor ticket sales .
clarkson told fans the planned 36-date jaunt was " too much , too soon " .
cash bonus this followed a feud with her record label boss clive davis , who felt the darker , rockier sound of clarkson 's new album , my december , was a mistake .
the music industry is kind of in a weird place right now .
people are definitely scared of any kind of artist development .
kelly clarkson davis suggested at least three , more commercial , replacements for songs clarkson had written - even offering a cash bonus if he got his way .
but his protegee put her foot down , and released the album the way she wanted , even though it meant significant delays .
" everybody was like : ' why would you take that option ? " ' she says .

as a child , clarkson 's favourite film was jim henson 's gothic muppet fantasy labyrinth .
the movie revolves around a young girl , sarah williams , who sets out to rescue her baby brother from david bowie 's fright-wigged goblin king .
at the climax , while being tormented in a wicked castle , sarah cries : " you have no power over me " and the goblin king is defeated .
" i said that all the time when i was a kid , " clarkson laughs .
" i 'd say it any time somebody did n't do what i wanted . "
it 's a phrase the 25-year-old pop star has found herself using in recent months as she battled for creative control of her career .
she parted ways with her manager and , days later , cancelled a us tour because of poor ticket sales .
clarkson told fans the planned 36-date jaunt was " too much , too soon " .
cash bonus this followed a feud with her record label boss clive davis , who felt the darker , rockier sound of clarkson 's new album , my december , was a mistake . "
the music industry is kind of in a weird place right now .
people are definitely scared of any kind of artist development . "
kelly clarkson davis suggested at least three , more commercial , replacements for songs clarkson had written - even offering a cash bonus if he got his way .
but his protegee put her foot down , and released the album the way she wanted , even though it meant significant delays .
" everybody was like : ' why would you take that option ? " ' she says .
" and honestly it 's because there 's not another option .
" i 'm set for life , i 've made my money .
i want to make sure i 'm enjoying my music .
otherwise what 's the point ? "
clarkson says the issue with her record label has been " blown out of proportion " in the press , but adds that such conflicts are not uncommon .
" it happens to everyone , " she says .
" i 'm no different to any other artist . "
scared the reason , the singer suggests , is that record companies have become " afraid " to take risks in the face of dwindling sales .
" the music industry is kind of in a weird place right now , " she says , " so i think people are definitely scared of any kind of artist development .
" people are really pressured by their bosses to make that bottom line every quarter . "
luckily for clarkson , her gamble paid off , with first single never again charting in the top 10 on both sides of the atlantic .
the song , a guitar-laden kiss-off to an ex-boyfriend , reflects the edgier , more personal tone of the album .
" oh , dude , it 's the most bitter song i 've ever written ! " laughs the former american idol , previously known for glossy pop songs like miss independent and since u been gone .
" i wrote about something that happened years ago and i was confused , i was angry and i was humiliated . "
intimate she declines to embellish the details , but admits the record comes from a darker place than her previous grammy-winning album breakaway .
" it 's the most intimate project i 've done , " she says .
" i write a lot on the road and literally every territory i went to on the last tour - regardless of whether it was the us , australia , the uk or japan - it was always winter .
" it was like we followed winter around the globe !
and i think it started messing with us .
" so that 's why a lot of the record is kind of sad .
i think i 'm going to go to bora bora to write my next record ! "
clarkson divulges that work on her fourth album has already started , which will mark another departure in musical style .
" it 's more like an acoustic country-blues-rock kind of thing , " she says .
" what you can always expect from me is something different , and i think that 's good . "
kelly clarkson 's album , my december , and single , never again , are out now .

and the crews who empty and clean them have the least desirable jobs at the festival .
so what is life like on the front line with the toilet teams ?
our candid feature leaves no stone unturned .
at a block of portable toilets , a man in a white waterproof suit charges into one of the makeshift loos with a large green hose .
with his overalls splattered with what i hope is mud , he wrestles his hose as it is shoved into the toilet bowl to suck up the contents .
the man with the hose is spencer , and he is helped by darren and tractor driver justin .
with 177,500 people partying in a field for up to five days , the mass of human waste has to be dealt with somehow .
' splashback ' this trio - the self-proclaimed not so solid crew - are part of the operation to do just that .
they are one of 22 teams who travel the site for 14 hours a day every day sucking up the contents of the toilets with tractor-pulled vacuum tankers , which then take everything to a huge lagoon at the edge of the site .
not so solid crew is written on the tractor 's bright yellow wheelguard in mud - or could it be something else ?
at the toilets , known as polyjohns , spencer moves from cubicle to cubicle , first sticking his hose into the basin , wiggling it to suck up any stubborn material .
he then lifts the whole basin up to tackle the tank beneath the seat .
when we arrive , most are in a half-decent state - but in some , the pile reaches seat level .
the smell lingers but is surprisingly bearable , because they have already been emptied once today and the weather is cool .
and thanks to the liberal use of disinfectant .
but they are not always so palatable .
the trio empty this block of 50 toilets three times a day - at 5am , lunchtime and again at 5pm .
darren says : " five in the morning is the worst one .
and friday night was disgusting .
glasto toilet trivia 3,220 toilets in total 540 more than 2005 70 toilet sites 700 metres of urinals 64 female " she-pee " urinals 35 disabled toilets 22 toilet-emptying tractor crews " i 'm a pig farmer normally , so my nostrils are used to a bit of flavour , but not to this extent . "
at one point , darren is called upon to get some tissue for spencer to wipe away " splashback " from his face .
at another , they come across a cubicle with muddy footprints astride the seat , where someone preferred to squat rather than sit down .
" that 's when they miss and make a mess , " darren explains .
it takes about a minute to empty each cubicle - two if they are in a bad state .
and although they leave them empty , the not so solid crew do not necessarily leave the toilets clean .
changing clientele that is the job of another set of workers , who have an even tougher task as they take a mop and bucket to each toilet in turn amid the mud and crowds .
have your say " i used to go to glastonbury in the early ' 80s .
i can still remember the smell from the toilet blocks " andy riches , london send us your comments but at least it shows there is a concerted effort to rid the glastonbury toilets of their soiled reputation .
" the clientele is changing , " says infrastructure manager bob st barbe , who has been in charge of the lavatories for 12 years .
" it 's people that pay money , they want a good experience and we want to do our best to give it to them . "
there are several types of loo for glastonbury fans to sample .
there are the portaloo-style polyjohns , the " long drops " - with rows of seats over a large trench - as well as urinals and female " she-pee " urinals .
the tankers visit them all and take the contents up to the lagoon , where everything gushes into a long red tank .
here , a machine removes whatever can not go to the sewage works - beer glasses , wet wipes , clothes , mobile phones , banknotes .
" it 's a very good year for pants , " reveals kevin , one of the lagoon workers .
" we had a polka dot pair this morning .
" they need to drop more money though .
we 've only got £ 5 so far . "
air freshener the lagoon and toilet crews bring together an unlikely mix of workers - from local farmers to a landscape gardener , an ambulance worker and a trainee barrister .
steve , 24 , who is getting called to the bar in july , says being part of the toilet team allows him to " pay for bar school , pay for a holiday , have a bit of a laugh and ride around on a tractor " .
the " fond memories " of camaraderie outweigh the unpleasantness and make him come back , he says .
but another crew member points out that he returns because " you forget how bad it is when you 're away " .
the lagoon itself is a lake up by worthy farm , with a fan blowing air freshener to disguise the smell .
the brown-grey sludge it holds does not look too dissimilar from what is swilling around on the rest of the site - although a suspiciously solid and stagnant area where the waste enters suggests this is more than just innocuous mud .
from here , larger tankers take the effluent away to local sewage works .
kevin boasts that they dealt with more than a million litres on saturday .
festival fans may take delight in complaining about the facilities - but would be complaining a lot more if it were not for the toilet crews .
it is dirty work , but someone 's got to do it .

and the crews who empty and clean them have the least desirable jobs at the festival .
so what is life like on the front line with the toilet teams ?
our candid feature leaves no stone unturned .
at a block of portable toilets , a man in a white waterproof suit charges into one of the makeshift loos with a large green hose .
with his overalls splattered with what i hope is mud , he wrestles his hose as it is shoved into the toilet bowl to suck up the contents .
the man with the hose is spencer , and he is helped by darren and tractor driver justin .
with 177,500 people partying in a field for up to five days , the mass of human waste has to be dealt with somehow .
' splashback ' this trio - the self-proclaimed not so solid crew - are part of the operation to do just that .
they are one of 22 teams who travel the site for 14 hours a day every day sucking up the contents of the toilets with tractor-pulled vacuum tankers , which then take everything to a huge lagoon at the edge of the site .
not so solid crew is written on the tractor 's bright yellow wheelguard in mud - or could it be something else ?
the not so solid crew : spencer -lrb- left -rrb- , justin -lrb- in cab -rrb- and darren at the toilets , known as polyjohns , spencer moves from cubicle to cubicle , first sticking his hose into the basin , wiggling it to suck up any stubborn material .
he then lifts the whole basin up to tackle the tank beneath the seat .
when we arrive , most are in a half-decent state - but in some , the pile reaches seat level .
the smell lingers but is surprisingly bearable , because they have already been emptied once today and the weather is cool .
and thanks to the liberal use of disinfectant .
but they are not always so palatable .
the trio empty this block of 50 toilets three times a day - at 5am , lunchtime and again at 5pm .
darren says : " five in the morning is the worst one .
and friday night was disgusting .
glasto toilet trivia 3,220 toilets in total 540 more than 2005 70 toilet sites 700 metres of urinals 64 female " she-pee " urinals 35 disabled toilets 22 toilet-emptying tractor crews " i 'm a pig farmer normally , so my nostrils are used to a bit of flavour , but not to this extent . "
at one point , darren is called upon to get some tissue for spencer to wipe away " splashback " from his face .
at another , they come across a cubicle with muddy footprints astride the seat , where someone preferred to squat rather than sit down .
" that 's when they miss and make a mess , " darren explains .
it takes about a minute to empty each cubicle - two if they are in a bad state .
and although they leave them empty , the not so solid crew do not necessarily leave the toilets clean .
changing clientele that is the job of another set of workers , who have an even tougher task as they take a mop and bucket to each toilet in turn amid the mud and crowds .
have your say i used to go to glastonbury in the early ' 80s .
i can still remember the smell from the toilet blocks andy riches , london send us your comments but at least it shows there is a concerted effort to rid the glastonbury toilets of their soiled reputation .
" the clientele is changing , " says infrastructure manager bob st barbe , who has been in charge of the lavatories for 12 years .
" it 's people that pay money , they want a good experience and we want to do our best to give it to them . "
cleaners make their way through the mud with mops and buckets there are several types of loo for glastonbury fans to sample .
there are the portaloo-style polyjohns , the " long drops " - with rows of seats over a large trench - as well as urinals and female " she-pee " urinals .
the tankers visit them all and take the contents up to the lagoon , where everything gushes into a long red tank .
here , a machine removes whatever can not go to the sewage works - beer glasses , wet wipes , clothes , mobile phones , banknotes .
" it 's a very good year for pants , " reveals kevin , one of the lagoon workers .
" we had a polka dot pair this morning .
" they need to drop more money though .
we 've only got £ 5 so far . "
air freshener the lagoon and toilet crews bring together an unlikely mix of workers - from local farmers to a landscape gardener , an ambulance worker and a trainee barrister .
steve , 24 , who is getting called to the bar in july , says being part of the toilet team allows him to " pay for bar school , pay for a holiday , have a bit of a laugh and ride around on a tractor " .
the " fond memories " of camaraderie outweigh the unpleasantness and make him come back , he says .
but another crew member points out that he returns because " you forget how bad it is when you 're away " .
the lagoon holds all the waste until it is shipped off to sewage works the lagoon itself is a lake up by worthy farm , with a fan blowing air freshener to disguise the smell .
the brown-grey sludge it holds does not look too dissimilar from what is swilling around on the rest of the site - although a suspiciously solid and stagnant area where the waste enters suggests this is more than just innocuous mud .
from here , larger tankers take the effluent away to local sewage works .
kevin boasts that they dealt with more than a million litres on saturday .
festival fans may take delight in complaining about the facilities - but would be complaining a lot more if it were not for the toilet crews .

plaid-con-lib dem : 41 % labour-plaid : 28 % labour-lib dem : 21 % other / do n't know : 10 % source : icm telephone poll for bbc wales .
a random sample of 1,001 adults aged 18 and over were interviewed by phone on 19-22 june .
plaid national council meets on 7 july to decide which direction to take .
plaid am alun ffred jones said : " most interesting is the fact that most people expect plaid cymru to be part of the next government , however it 's formed . "
but he said the poll was just a " snapshot " of public opinion .
" -lrb- first minister -rrb- rhodri morgan was allowed to form a government by the other parties and i think it was right and proper that we should ask the labour party whether they were serious about negotiating and they have been . "
' stable government ' more than half of those polled - 57 % - thought a coalition government would be good , while 27 % said they were against the idea .
labour , which is five seats short of a majority in the assembly elected on 3 may , is to hold a special conference to confirm any plaid deal .
but labour business and budget minister jane hutt said they had reached an agreement .
" we have had very serious and intensive discussions with plaid , it has reached conclusion and this is about ensuring we have a stable government , " she added .
the poll suggests that rhodri morgan remains the strongest and most popular candidate to lead any coalition government in wales .
however , given a straight choice between mr morgan and plaid leader ieuan wyn jones , just 48 % backed mr morgan .
another 34 % thought mr jones would make the best coalition leader .
but nearly one in five of those polled -lrb- 18 % -rrb- could not decide between them .
conservative am jonathan morgan said : " a collation of the three opposition parties would be healthy for wales .
i think it would introduce a new dynamic .
he added that forming an administration with the three opposition parties would be " enormous , in terms of a cultural change of attitude " .
however , he did admit to being frustrated because the process has " gone on so long " .
but liberal democrat am jenny randerson warned plaid against entering into government with labour .
" having been in government with labour , i know it was hard work to keep them to the letter of your agreement every day of the week , " ms randerson said .
interviewees were also asked how they would respond to a referendum on giving the welsh assembly full law-making powers , and the ability to raise its own taxes .
opinion was divided with 47 % in favour of the move and .
44 % against it while 9 % did not know .
