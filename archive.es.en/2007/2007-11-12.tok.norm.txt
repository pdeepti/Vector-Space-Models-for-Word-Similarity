airbus announced over the weekend that the emirates airline had placed an order that will net airbus over $ 20 billion -lrb- 13.8 billion euros -rrb- . us manufacturer boeing was pushed into the background at the dubai air show on sunday , nov .
11 , when the dubai-owned carrier announced it would buy 11 a380 superjumbos plus 70 midsized a350 xwb -lrb- extra wide body -rrb- aircraft in what airbus executives called the biggest order in the european constructor 's history . the total value of the new firm orders for the 70 a350s and 11 a380s is 20.2 billion dollars , according to airbus . an upbeat airbus sales chief john leahy raised forecast sales of the a350 xwb to " more than 300 " by year 's end .
he had expected 200 orders at the start of the year . boeing , whose b787 dreamliner is the major competitor to the a350 , won a comparatively modest $ 3.2 billion order from emirates for 12 of its b777-300s , bringing the dubai airline 's total outlay for new planes to over $ 23 billion at the show . seattle-based boeing also said in a statement it had signed an agreement with qatar airways for 30 787 dreamliners and five 777 cargo planes in a deal valued at over $ 6.1 billion at list prices . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : enders was happy and proud of emirates ' faith in airbus but the lion 's share of new orders announced sunday went to airbus , a fact welcomed by the company 's ceo tom enders . " emirates airline is placing great faith in our a350 xwb and a380 programs as well as our company and we are rightfully proud , " he said . the latest orders mark a dramatic turnaround for airbus , which was overtaken by rival boeing in the race for new business in 2006 .
the european plane maker had made a spectacular plunge into the red last year and has been beset this year by plane production woes . trade union warns cutbacks may affect orders however , some caution was added to the euphoria on monday when a leading french trade union warned that planned job cuts and site sales at airbus could jeopardize the company 's ability to fill the new orders . " we see a paradox in the accumulation of new orders ... and management 's implementation of power8 , with its job cuts and site sales , " jean-francois knepper , an organizer with force ouvriere -lrb- fo -rrb- , told reporters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus has committed to a plan of cuts and restructuring power8 is a sweeping - and contested - restructuring campaign launched by airbus last february in the face of costly production and delivery delays .
it calls notably for the elimination of 10,000 jobs over four years and the sale of certain production sites in order to achieve savings of 5 billion euros by 2010 . " how are we going to honor these -lsb- emirates -rsb- orders for the a350 when the plan to sell certain sites is not yet finalized ? "
knepper asked .
" time is passing and we are getting orders , but if our leaders do not reconsider the plan to sell sites under power8 , we will not be able to fill the orders on time . " with power8 , he added , " the company is temporarily de-stabilized at a time when we have to hold together . " emirates committing to long-term airbus orders as well as the 70 firm orders for the a350s - which are scheduled to come into service in 2013 - emirates chairman and chief executive sheikh ahmed bin saeed al-maktoum said the company had taken an option to buy a further 50 of the new-generation planes down the line .
he added that the airline had decided to order three more a380 superjumbos , and to firm up a previous option to buy a further eight . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first commercial a380 took off in singapore livery " the a350 xwb and a380 will play an important role in supporting emirates ' and dubai 's growth plans , " maktoum said .
" as the leading airline for the 21st century , it made sense for emirates to choose the a350 xwb - an aircraft designed with 21st century technologies . " the 70 firm orders - for 50 a350-900s and 20 a350-1000s - will make emirates the second biggest customer for the long-haul planes after qatar airways announced an order for 80 in june . the contract brings the number of a380s ordered by emirates to 58 , making it the world 's biggest customer for the superjumbo , which made its first commercial flight in the livery of singapore airlines last month . airbus also announced a $ 2-billion order from saudi business carrier nas for 20 airbus a320s , as well as an option to buy a further 18 of the short-haul planes . private superjumbo buyer revealed as saudi prince it was also revealed at the dubai air show that saudi billionaire prince alwaleed bin talal will be the first private buyer of an a380 superjumbo . the prospective buyer 's identity had been kept secret for months but was unveiled to coincide with the dubai air show . alwaleed , whose interests span kingdom holding to euro disney , hotels and banking , has ordered a vip version of the a380 dubbed the flying palace .
he already owns a boeing 747-400 , the newest type of the original jumbo jet currently in service . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the meetings took different tones , but both show the gap is closing over the atlantic , said dw 's christina bergmann . the trans-atlantic ice age is over .
if anyone still needed proof that the us on one side , and france and germany on the other , want to start a new chapter in their respective bilateral relationships , then they got it this past week . the east german physicist , german chancellor angela merkel , and the son of a hungarian immigrant , french president nicolas sarkozy , each took different approaches to their meetings with us president george w. bush . in a speech to the us congress , sarkozy pointed out that the two countries had had a long history together prior to the disagreement over the iraq war .
he practically fell over himself with enthusiasm for the united states and left out the iraq topic altogether , just to be on the safe side .
he has to be careful , however , not to take former british prime minister tony blair 's place as the american president 's " poodle . "
after all , those who wish to have influence on someone must be able to look them in the eye . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel is cleverer .
she did n't accept the invitation to the ranch - and its accompanying presidential honor - until her relationship to bush had solidified and she had given him her opinion on numerous occasions .
the president has no problem with that .
he 's proven more than once that he sticks by those who he 's taken a liking to - in good times and bad . it 's not only merkel and sarkozy 's differing personalities and destinies that contribute to the closing of ranks .
everyone knows that bush 's days are numbered .
both sarkozy and merkel will most likely have to do deal with his successor and are interested in setting the course now . in his last year in office , the american president is trying to save what 's left to save .
he continually emphasizes that he does n't make decisions based on opinion polls and that conclusions are n't made until much later .
nevertheless , he does n't want to leave with nothing to show for his time in office . both sides have recognized that things do n't work without the other .
the us is and will remain the only superpower that has the resources and the will to get involved in crisis areas .
but without influential allies , it ca n't be successful .
simply writing off " old " europe , as former us defense minister donald rumsfeld did , does n't work .
still , the countries of " new " europe - with all due respect - have a long road ahead of them before they even remotely attain the political clout that germany and france have . europeans have recognized that they ca n't solve crises alone - from kosovo 's status and the conflict in the middle east to global climate change .
they need the united states .
even in the nuclear conflict with iran .
those who take the path of diplomacy are more successful when they have a nation on their side that , if all else fails , wo n't be afraid to send its soldiers to war . christina bergmann is a correspondent for deutsche welle in washington , dc -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 12.11.2007 opinion : europe and the us need each other großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : george bush received nicolas sarkozy in the white house and angela merkel at his texas ranch last week .
the meetings took different tones , but both show the gap is closing over the atlantic , said dw 's christina bergmann . the trans-atlantic ice age is over .
if anyone still needed proof that the us on one side , and france and germany on the other , want to start a new chapter in their respective bilateral relationships , then they got it this past week . the east german physicist , german chancellor angela merkel , and the son of a hungarian immigrant , french president nicolas sarkozy , each took different approaches to their meetings with us president george w. bush . in a speech to the us congress , sarkozy pointed out that the two countries had had a long history together prior to the disagreement over the iraq war .
he practically fell over himself with enthusiasm for the united states and left out the iraq topic altogether , just to be on the safe side .
he has to be careful , however , not to take former british prime minister tony blair 's place as the american president 's " poodle . "
after all , those who wish to have influence on someone must be able to look them in the eye . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel is cleverer .
she did n't accept the invitation to the ranch - and its accompanying presidential honor - until her relationship to bush had solidified and she had given him her opinion on numerous occasions .
the president has no problem with that .
he 's proven more than once that he sticks by those who he 's taken a liking to - in good times and bad . it 's not only merkel and sarkozy 's differing personalities and destinies that contribute to the closing of ranks .
everyone knows that bush 's days are numbered .
both sarkozy and merkel will most likely have to do deal with his successor and are interested in setting the course now . in his last year in office , the american president is trying to save what 's left to save .
he continually emphasizes that he does n't make decisions based on opinion polls and that conclusions are n't made until much later .
nevertheless , he does n't want to leave with nothing to show for his time in office . both sides have recognized that things do n't work without the other .
the us is and will remain the only superpower that has the resources and the will to get involved in crisis areas .
but without influential allies , it ca n't be successful .
simply writing off " old " europe , as former us defense minister donald rumsfeld did , does n't work .
still , the countries of " new " europe - with all due respect - have a long road ahead of them before they even remotely attain the political clout that germany and france have . europeans have recognized that they ca n't solve crises alone - from kosovo 's status and the conflict in the middle east to global climate change .
they need the united states .
even in the nuclear conflict with iran .
those who take the path of diplomacy are more successful when they have a nation on their side that , if all else fails , wo n't be afraid to send its soldiers to war . christina bergmann is a correspondent for deutsche welle in washington , dc -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

officials cancelled one match , and met to discuss further measures against fan violence . a policeman , trying to break up a scuffle between soccer fans from opposing teams at a highway rest station near arezzo , killed one of the men when he fired warning shots into the air .
gabriele sandri , 26 , was a lazio fan heading for a game of the top italian league , serie a , in milan .
he died as a result of the gunshot wounds on the morning of sunday , nov .
11 , when an officer tried to stop a clash between fans of lazio and juventus , who appeared to have met by chance at the rest station .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gabriele sandri : killed in a soccer-related scuffle rioting then broke out in bergamo and rome , where fans attacked a police barracks , as well as the olympic stadium and the headquarters of the italian olympic committee next door .
one game cancellation inter milan-lazio was the only game cancelled sunday afternoon , but at an atalanta-ac milan match in bergamo , hooligans caused the game to be abandoned after they tried to destroy a glass barrier in order to stampede the pitch .
five other serie a games were played .
authorities decided to cancel the late game between roma and cagliari , which was already considered at risk , but riots began outside the stadio olimpico where hooligans attacked city policemen , damaged cars and motorcycles and set fire to a police bus .
later in the night , nearby police offices and the headquarters of the italian olympic committee were attacked by hundreds of people .
bildunterschrift : rioting broke out in downtown rome ansa news agency reported that nine policemen , three photographers and dozens of hooligans were injured in rome .
" now i have destroyed two families . "
police and the government , desperate to stem any further violence , are set to hold talks to clear up how the officer made such a " tragic error . "
the officer under investigation for firing the fatal shot , identified only as luigi s. , could not believe he had hit the victim .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lazio match on sunday was cancelled , but earlier they played werder bremen " i did n't point it at anything , i did n't aim at anybody , " he told corriere della sera daily .
" the first shot i fired into the air and the second left me while i was running . … now i have destroyed two families , the man 's and mine . "
sunday 's violence mirrored riots outside a catania match in sicily in february , where a policeman was killed .
that incident led to strict new security measures at soccer stadiums , but authorities may have to look again at the rules amid calls to ban away fans from all grounds in future .
" painful day " for italian soccer " it is another very sad and painful day for all of italian soccer , " italian soccer federation president giancarlo abete said in a statement to the press .
" the first thought is of huge condolences for the family of gabriele sandri . "
abete said he had convened a meeting for late monday with his board as well as representatives of the league , and player and coach associations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amato said the killing was a " tragic error " they will discuss what to do about the cancelled inter milan vs. lazio and as roma vs. cagliari matches , and whether to play the atalanta game or award the points to milan .
interior minister giuliano amato told news agencies the killing was " a tragic error , " but it happened in circumstances linked to the violence that permeates soccer , and " every week forces thousands of agents to patrol cities and roads to prevent that the worst happens . "
a report last month said injuries at stadiums caused by fan violence had dropped 80 percent from last season , but abete has often said that soccer authorities can do little to stamp out trouble away from stadiums . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

airbus announced over the weekend that the emirates airline had placed an order that will net airbus over $ 20 billion -lrb- 13.8 billion euros -rrb- . us manufacturer boeing was pushed into the background at the dubai air show on sunday , nov .
11 , when the dubai-owned carrier announced it would buy 11 a380 superjumbos plus 70 midsized a350 xwb -lrb- extra wide body -rrb- aircraft in what airbus executives called the biggest order in the european constructor 's history . the total value of the new firm orders for the 70 a350s and 11 a380s is 20.2 billion dollars , according to airbus . an upbeat airbus sales chief john leahy raised forecast sales of the a350 xwb to " more than 300 " by year 's end .
he had expected 200 orders at the start of the year . boeing , whose b787 dreamliner is the major competitor to the a350 , won a comparatively modest $ 3.2 billion order from emirates for 12 of its b777-300s , bringing the dubai airline 's total outlay for new planes to over $ 23 billion at the show . seattle-based boeing also said in a statement it had signed an agreement with qatar airways for 30 787 dreamliners and five 777 cargo planes in a deal valued at over $ 6.1 billion at list prices . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : enders was happy and proud of emirates ' faith in airbus but the lion 's share of new orders announced sunday went to airbus , a fact welcomed by the company 's ceo tom enders . " emirates airline is placing great faith in our a350 xwb and a380 programs as well as our company and we are rightfully proud , " he said . the latest orders mark a dramatic turnaround for airbus , which was overtaken by rival boeing in the race for new business in 2006 .
the european plane maker had made a spectacular plunge into the red last year and has been beset this year by plane production woes . trade union warns cutbacks may affect orders however , some caution was added to the euphoria on monday when a leading french trade union warned that planned job cuts and site sales at airbus could jeopardize the company 's ability to fill the new orders . " we see a paradox in the accumulation of new orders ... and management 's implementation of power8 , with its job cuts and site sales , " jean-francois knepper , an organizer with force ouvriere -lrb- fo -rrb- , told reporters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus has committed to a plan of cuts and restructuring power8 is a sweeping - and contested - restructuring campaign launched by airbus last february in the face of costly production and delivery delays .
it calls notably for the elimination of 10,000 jobs over four years and the sale of certain production sites in order to achieve savings of 5 billion euros by 2010 . " how are we going to honor these -lsb- emirates -rsb- orders for the a350 when the plan to sell certain sites is not yet finalized ? "
knepper asked .
" time is passing and we are getting orders , but if our leaders do not reconsider the plan to sell sites under power8 , we will not be able to fill the orders on time . " with power8 , he added , " the company is temporarily de-stabilized at a time when we have to hold together . " emirates committing to long-term airbus orders as well as the 70 firm orders for the a350s - which are scheduled to come into service in 2013 - emirates chairman and chief executive sheikh ahmed bin saeed al-maktoum said the company had taken an option to buy a further 50 of the new-generation planes down the line .
he added that the airline had decided to order three more a380 superjumbos , and to firm up a previous option to buy a further eight . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first commercial a380 took off in singapore livery " the a350 xwb and a380 will play an important role in supporting emirates ' and dubai 's growth plans , " maktoum said .
" as the leading airline for the 21st century , it made sense for emirates to choose the a350 xwb - an aircraft designed with 21st century technologies . " the 70 firm orders - for 50 a350-900s and 20 a350-1000s - will make emirates the second biggest customer for the long-haul planes after qatar airways announced an order for 80 in june . the contract brings the number of a380s ordered by emirates to 58 , making it the world 's biggest customer for the superjumbo , which made its first commercial flight in the livery of singapore airlines last month . airbus also announced a $ 2-billion order from saudi business carrier nas for 20 airbus a320s , as well as an option to buy a further 18 of the short-haul planes . private superjumbo buyer revealed as saudi prince it was also revealed at the dubai air show that saudi billionaire prince alwaleed bin talal will be the first private buyer of an a380 superjumbo . the prospective buyer 's identity had been kept secret for months but was unveiled to coincide with the dubai air show . alwaleed , whose interests span kingdom holding to euro disney , hotels and banking , has ordered a vip version of the a380 dubbed the flying palace .
he already owns a boeing 747-400 , the newest type of the original jumbo jet currently in service . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" you are always talking about russia but the real threat is coming from the european commission , " the chief executive of german energy giant eon wulf bernotat told the financial times on monday , nov .
12 . many in europe have rung alarms over what they see as russian intentions to dominate the european energy sector through investments by groups such as the state-controlled gas monopoly gazprom . bernotat added , however , that he did not think commission plans to increase competition by breaking up big power groups through a process called unbundling would succeed because they were opposed by major eu members . " i am pretty sure unbundling is not coming , " he said .
" such processes in brussels take time especially if important member states such as france and germany are against it . " hesse minister joins calls for more competition meanwhile , the german state of hesse 's minister for economic affairs alois rhiel called for germany 's federal cartel office to have more power and to increase energy competition in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rwe and eon have the lion 's share rhiel called on the federal regulator to step up efforts to force the four big german energy groups - e.on , rwe , enbw and vattenfall - to put power stations up for sale in a bid to allow other companies into the sector .
together the four firms own over 75 percent of germany 's power stations .
e.on and rival rwe have a particularly dominant position in the country . he also called on germany 's minister for economic affairs michael glos to extend the law against competitive restrictions , so that the cartel office could control the prices of the energy and gas groups more strictly . a ministry spokesperson said separating energy production and delivery would be reserved as the last possible option in dealing with energy companies .
the german finance ministry also does not have plans to break up german energy companies , ministry spokesman torsten albig told reporters . but opening up the market to competition , energy prices in germany could be reduced to by 10 percent to 15 percent , a target that the hesse minister said he was pursuing in his own state commission concerned about energy prices in germany these views are shared by those in the european commission who are concerned at the amount of market control exerted by the four german energy companies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kroes said that liberalization was needed in germany eu competition commissioner neelie kroes argued again over the weekend for liberalization measures , saying that " in germany , prices are higher than you might expect in a market that was fully competitive . " the eu has started investigations into possible price fixing agreement between e.on and rwe . she added that the commission 's plan to break-up the two key activities of production and distribution was " indispensable " if consumers were to benefit from the lower prices for gas and electricity that an open market could provide . the german government has backed its big energy groups in the stand-off with eu officials , but berlin has said that position could change if power groups did not make a bigger effort to increase competition and transparency within their operations . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" targeted sanctions against individuals or specific groups are , in principle , preferable to general sanctions imposed on states .
general sanctions often have dire consequences for vulnerable population groups in the countries concerned , and generally not for their leadership , " marty said in a report released sunday , nov .
11 .
lost credibility but , marty said , individual suspects placed on the lists did not have the right to reply and found it virtually impossible to clear their names .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marty : the lists are " unworthy " of the eu and un 's " lofty goals " " the present system of blacklists flouts the fundamental principles which are the basis of human rights , " he said in the report , which is due to be presented to the strasbourg-based council of europe on monday .
the un security council first established a list of al-qaeda and taliban suspects in 1999 .
it contains the names of 368 individuals and 124 entities .
the united nations said its members must freeze the assets , and prevent the entry into their territories , of anyone on the lists .
also , it must prevent the sale and transfer of arms to them .
the european union has set up its own blacklist .
marty said both organizations must respect " minimal norms of procedure and juridical safeguards " before imposing restrictions .
these norms included giving suspects the right to appeal to an independent and impartial organization and the right to compensation in the case of any miscarriage of justice .
attacks on cia practices he said the council of europe 's 47 member states should make sure such guarantees were offered .
in the past , the swiss senator has attacked the us practice of " extraordinary rendition " of terror suspects and secret cia prisons in countries with little regard for human rights .
while blacklisting " may be a useful instrument in certain circumstances and , in any event , for a limited period of time , " marty said it is unacceptable that no clear procedure is foreseen for getting off the blacklist .
" if one adds to this picture the practice of abductions -lsb- " extraordinary renditions " -rsb- , secret detention centers and the trivialization of torture , this provides a worrying , devastating message : principles that are as fundamental as the rule of law and the protection of human rights are optional accessories applicable only in fair weather . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the council of europe guarantee the rights of those blacklisted ?
marty highlighted the case of the people 's mujahedeen of iran , which forms part of the national council of resistance of iran and is on an eu blacklist despite a european court ruling in 2006 saying it should be removed from the list .
" despite recent procedural improvements it remains almost impossible , in practice , to be removed from the blacklist - a situation that is illegal and unacceptable , " marty wrote .

airbus announced over the weekend that the emirates airline had placed an order that will net airbus over $ 20 billion -lrb- 13.8 billion euros -rrb- . us manufacturer boeing was pushed into the background at the dubai air show on sunday , nov .
11 , when the dubai-owned carrier announced it would buy 11 a380 superjumbos plus 70 midsized a350 xwb -lrb- extra wide body -rrb- aircraft in what airbus executives called the biggest order in the european constructor 's history . the total value of the new firm orders for the 70 a350s and 11 a380s is 20.2 billion dollars , according to airbus . an upbeat airbus sales chief john leahy raised forecast sales of the a350 xwb to " more than 300 " by year 's end .
he had expected 200 orders at the start of the year . boeing , whose b787 dreamliner is the major competitor to the a350 , won a comparatively modest $ 3.2 billion order from emirates for 12 of its b777-300s , bringing the dubai airline 's total outlay for new planes to over $ 23 billion at the show . seattle-based boeing also said in a statement it had signed an agreement with qatar airways for 30 787 dreamliners and five 777 cargo planes in a deal valued at over $ 6.1 billion at list prices . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : enders was happy and proud of emirates ' faith in airbus but the lion 's share of new orders announced sunday went to airbus , a fact welcomed by the company 's ceo tom enders . " emirates airline is placing great faith in our a350 xwb and a380 programs as well as our company and we are rightfully proud , " he said . the latest orders mark a dramatic turnaround for airbus , which was overtaken by rival boeing in the race for new business in 2006 .
the european plane maker had made a spectacular plunge into the red last year and has been beset this year by plane production woes . trade union warns cutbacks may affect orders however , some caution was added to the euphoria on monday when a leading french trade union warned that planned job cuts and site sales at airbus could jeopardize the company 's ability to fill the new orders . " we see a paradox in the accumulation of new orders ... and management 's implementation of power8 , with its job cuts and site sales , " jean-francois knepper , an organizer with force ouvriere -lrb- fo -rrb- , told reporters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus has committed to a plan of cuts and restructuring power8 is a sweeping - and contested - restructuring campaign launched by airbus last february in the face of costly production and delivery delays .
it calls notably for the elimination of 10,000 jobs over four years and the sale of certain production sites in order to achieve savings of 5 billion euros by 2010 . " how are we going to honor these -lsb- emirates -rsb- orders for the a350 when the plan to sell certain sites is not yet finalized ? "
knepper asked .

" emirates committing to long-term airbus orders as well as the 70 firm orders for the a350s - which are scheduled to come into service in 2013 - emirates chairman and chief executive sheikh ahmed bin saeed al-maktoum said the company had taken an option to buy a further 50 of the new-generation planes down the line .
he added that the airline had decided to order three more a380 superjumbos , and to firm up a previous option to buy a further eight . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first commercial a380 took off in singapore livery " the a350 xwb and a380 will play an important role in supporting emirates ' and dubai 's growth plans , " maktoum said .

" you are always talking about russia but the real threat is coming from the european commission , " the chief executive of german energy giant eon wulf bernotat told the financial times on monday , nov .
12 . many in europe have rung alarms over what they see as russian intentions to dominate the european energy sector through investments by groups such as the state-controlled gas monopoly gazprom . bernotat added , however , that he did not think commission plans to increase competition by breaking up big power groups through a process called unbundling would succeed because they were opposed by major eu members . " i am pretty sure unbundling is not coming , " he said .
" such processes in brussels take time especially if important member states such as france and germany are against it . " hesse minister joins calls for more competition meanwhile , the german state of hesse 's minister for economic affairs alois rhiel called for germany 's federal cartel office to have more power and to increase energy competition in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rwe and eon have the lion 's share rhiel called on the federal regulator to step up efforts to force the four big german energy groups - e.on , rwe , enbw and vattenfall - to put power stations up for sale in a bid to allow other companies into the sector .
together the four firms own over 75 percent of germany 's power stations .
e.on and rival rwe have a particularly dominant position in the country . he also called on germany 's minister for economic affairs michael glos to extend the law against competitive restrictions , so that the cartel office could control the prices of the energy and gas groups more strictly . a ministry spokesperson said separating energy production and delivery would be reserved as the last possible option in dealing with energy companies .
the german finance ministry also does not have plans to break up german energy companies , ministry spokesman torsten albig told reporters . but opening up the market to competition , energy prices in germany could be reduced to by 10 percent to 15 percent , a target that the hesse minister said he was pursuing in his own state commission concerned about energy prices in germany these views are shared by those in the european commission who are concerned at the amount of market control exerted by the four german energy companies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kroes said that liberalization was needed in germany eu competition commissioner neelie kroes argued again over the weekend for liberalization measures , saying that " in germany , prices are higher than you might expect in a market that was fully competitive . " the eu has started investigations into possible price fixing agreement between e.on and rwe . she added that the commission 's plan to break-up the two key activities of production and distribution was " indispensable " if consumers were to benefit from the lower prices for gas and electricity that an open market could provide . the german government has backed its big energy groups in the stand-off with eu officials , but berlin has said that position could change if power groups did not make a bigger effort to increase competition and transparency within their operations . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

airbus announced over the weekend that the emirates airline had placed an order that will net airbus over $ 20 billion -lrb- 13.8 billion euros -rrb- . us manufacturer boeing was pushed into the background at the dubai air show on sunday , nov .
11 , when the dubai-owned carrier announced it would buy 11 a380 superjumbos plus 70 midsized a350 xwb -lrb- extra wide body -rrb- aircraft in what airbus executives called the biggest order in the european constructor 's history . the total value of the new firm orders for the 70 a350s and 11 a380s is 20.2 billion dollars , according to airbus . an upbeat airbus sales chief john leahy raised forecast sales of the a350 xwb to " more than 300 " by year 's end .
he had expected 200 orders at the start of the year . boeing , whose b787 dreamliner is the major competitor to the a350 , won a comparatively modest $ 3.2 billion order from emirates for 12 of its b777-300s , bringing the dubai airline 's total outlay for new planes to over $ 23 billion at the show . seattle-based boeing also said in a statement it had signed an agreement with qatar airways for 30 787 dreamliners and five 777 cargo planes in a deal valued at over $ 6.1 billion at list prices . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : enders was happy and proud of emirates ' faith in airbus but the lion 's share of new orders announced sunday went to airbus , a fact welcomed by the company 's ceo tom enders . " emirates airline is placing great faith in our a350 xwb and a380 programs as well as our company and we are rightfully proud , " he said . the latest orders mark a dramatic turnaround for airbus , which was overtaken by rival boeing in the race for new business in 2006 .
the european plane maker had made a spectacular plunge into the red last year and has been beset this year by plane production woes . trade union warns cutbacks may affect orders however , some caution was added to the euphoria on monday when a leading french trade union warned that planned job cuts and site sales at airbus could jeopardize the company 's ability to fill the new orders . " we see a paradox in the accumulation of new orders ... and management 's implementation of power8 , with its job cuts and site sales , " jean-francois knepper , an organizer with force ouvriere -lrb- fo -rrb- , told reporters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus has committed to a plan of cuts and restructuring power8 is a sweeping - and contested - restructuring campaign launched by airbus last february in the face of costly production and delivery delays .
it calls notably for the elimination of 10,000 jobs over four years and the sale of certain production sites in order to achieve savings of 5 billion euros by 2010 . " how are we going to honor these -lsb- emirates -rsb- orders for the a350 when the plan to sell certain sites is not yet finalized ? "
knepper asked .
" time is passing and we are getting orders , but if our leaders do not reconsider the plan to sell sites under power8 , we will not be able to fill the orders on time . " with power8 , he added , " the company is temporarily de-stabilized at a time when we have to hold together . " emirates committing to long-term airbus orders as well as the 70 firm orders for the a350s - which are scheduled to come into service in 2013 - emirates chairman and chief executive sheikh ahmed bin saeed al-maktoum said the company had taken an option to buy a further 50 of the new-generation planes down the line .
he added that the airline had decided to order three more a380 superjumbos , and to firm up a previous option to buy a further eight . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first commercial a380 took off in singapore livery " the a350 xwb and a380 will play an important role in supporting emirates ' and dubai 's growth plans , " maktoum said .
" as the leading airline for the 21st century , it made sense for emirates to choose the a350 xwb - an aircraft designed with 21st century technologies . " the 70 firm orders - for 50 a350-900s and 20 a350-1000s - will make emirates the second biggest customer for the long-haul planes after qatar airways announced an order for 80 in june . the contract brings the number of a380s ordered by emirates to 58 , making it the world 's biggest customer for the superjumbo , which made its first commercial flight in the livery of singapore airlines last month . airbus also announced a $ 2-billion order from saudi business carrier nas for 20 airbus a320s , as well as an option to buy a further 18 of the short-haul planes . private superjumbo buyer revealed as saudi prince it was also revealed at the dubai air show that saudi billionaire prince alwaleed bin talal will be the first private buyer of an a380 superjumbo . the prospective buyer 's identity had been kept secret for months but was unveiled to coincide with the dubai air show . alwaleed , whose interests span kingdom holding to euro disney , hotels and banking , has ordered a vip version of the a380 dubbed the flying palace .
he already owns a boeing 747-400 , the newest type of the original jumbo jet currently in service . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" targeted sanctions against individuals or specific groups are , in principle , preferable to general sanctions imposed on states .
general sanctions often have dire consequences for vulnerable population groups in the countries concerned , and generally not for their leadership , " marty said in a report released sunday , nov .
11 .
lost credibility but , marty said , individual suspects placed on the lists did not have the right to reply and found it virtually impossible to clear their names .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marty : the lists are " unworthy " of the eu and un 's " lofty goals " " the present system of blacklists flouts the fundamental principles which are the basis of human rights , " he said in the report , which is due to be presented to the strasbourg-based council of europe on monday .
the un security council first established a list of al-qaeda and taliban suspects in 1999 .
it contains the names of 368 individuals and 124 entities .
the united nations said its members must freeze the assets , and prevent the entry into their territories , of anyone on the lists .
also , it must prevent the sale and transfer of arms to them .
the european union has set up its own blacklist .
marty said both organizations must respect " minimal norms of procedure and juridical safeguards " before imposing restrictions .
these norms included giving suspects the right to appeal to an independent and impartial organization and the right to compensation in the case of any miscarriage of justice .
attacks on cia practices he said the council of europe 's 47 member states should make sure such guarantees were offered .
in the past , the swiss senator has attacked the us practice of " extraordinary rendition " of terror suspects and secret cia prisons in countries with little regard for human rights .
while blacklisting " may be a useful instrument in certain circumstances and , in any event , for a limited period of time , " marty said it is unacceptable that no clear procedure is foreseen for getting off the blacklist .
" if one adds to this picture the practice of abductions -lsb- " extraordinary renditions " -rsb- , secret detention centers and the trivialization of torture , this provides a worrying , devastating message : principles that are as fundamental as the rule of law and the protection of human rights are optional accessories applicable only in fair weather . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the council of europe guarantee the rights of those blacklisted ?
marty highlighted the case of the people 's mujahedeen of iran , which forms part of the national council of resistance of iran and is on an eu blacklist despite a european court ruling in 2006 saying it should be removed from the list .
" despite recent procedural improvements it remains almost impossible , in practice , to be removed from the blacklist - a situation that is illegal and unacceptable , " marty wrote .
in another example , yussef nada , an italian businessman of egyptian origin living in switzerland for three decades , was placed on such a blacklist in 2001 on suspicion of having financed the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks .
his assets were seized and his freedom of movement was severely restricted .
he was not informed and was unable to appeal the decision , he has said .
six years later , the 78-year-old remains blacklisted despite law enforcement agencies in two countries " not finding a shred of evidence of any wrongdoing , " marty said . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

airbus announced over the weekend that the emirates airline had placed an order that will net airbus over $ 20 billion -lrb- 13.8 billion euros -rrb- . us manufacturer boeing was pushed into the background at the dubai air show on sunday , nov .
11 , when the dubai-owned carrier announced it would buy 11 a380 superjumbos plus 70 midsized a350 xwb -lrb- extra wide body -rrb- aircraft in what airbus executives called the biggest order in the european constructor 's history . the total value of the new firm orders for the 70 a350s and 11 a380s is 20.2 billion dollars , according to airbus . an upbeat airbus sales chief john leahy raised forecast sales of the a350 xwb to " more than 300 " by year 's end .
he had expected 200 orders at the start of the year . boeing , whose b787 dreamliner is the major competitor to the a350 , won a comparatively modest $ 3.2 billion order from emirates for 12 of its b777-300s , bringing the dubai airline 's total outlay for new planes to over $ 23 billion at the show . seattle-based boeing also said in a statement it had signed an agreement with qatar airways for 30 787 dreamliners and five 777 cargo planes in a deal valued at over $ 6.1 billion at list prices . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : enders was happy and proud of emirates ' faith in airbus but the lion 's share of new orders announced sunday went to airbus , a fact welcomed by the company 's ceo tom enders . " emirates airline is placing great faith in our a350 xwb and a380 programs as well as our company and we are rightfully proud , " he said . the latest orders mark a dramatic turnaround for airbus , which was overtaken by rival boeing in the race for new business in 2006 .
the european plane maker had made a spectacular plunge into the red last year and has been beset this year by plane production woes . trade union warns cutbacks may affect orders however , some caution was added to the euphoria on monday when a leading french trade union warned that planned job cuts and site sales at airbus could jeopardize the company 's ability to fill the new orders . " we see a paradox in the accumulation of new orders ... and management 's implementation of power8 , with its job cuts and site sales , " jean-francois knepper , an organizer with force ouvriere -lrb- fo -rrb- , told reporters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus has committed to a plan of cuts and restructuring power8 is a sweeping - and contested - restructuring campaign launched by airbus last february in the face of costly production and delivery delays .
it calls notably for the elimination of 10,000 jobs over four years and the sale of certain production sites in order to achieve savings of 5 billion euros by 2010 . " how are we going to honor these -lsb- emirates -rsb- orders for the a350 when the plan to sell certain sites is not yet finalized ? "
knepper asked .
" time is passing and we are getting orders , but if our leaders do not reconsider the plan to sell sites under power8 , we will not be able to fill the orders on time . " with power8 , he added , " the company is temporarily de-stabilized at a time when we have to hold together . " emirates committing to long-term airbus orders as well as the 70 firm orders for the a350s - which are scheduled to come into service in 2013 - emirates chairman and chief executive sheikh ahmed bin saeed al-maktoum said the company had taken an option to buy a further 50 of the new-generation planes down the line .
he added that the airline had decided to order three more a380 superjumbos , and to firm up a previous option to buy a further eight . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first commercial a380 took off in singapore livery " the a350 xwb and a380 will play an important role in supporting emirates ' and dubai 's growth plans , " maktoum said .
" as the leading airline for the 21st century , it made sense for emirates to choose the a350 xwb - an aircraft designed with 21st century technologies . " the 70 firm orders - for 50 a350-900s and 20 a350-1000s - will make emirates the second biggest customer for the long-haul planes after qatar airways announced an order for 80 in june . the contract brings the number of a380s ordered by emirates to 58 , making it the world 's biggest customer for the superjumbo , which made its first commercial flight in the livery of singapore airlines last month . airbus also announced a $ 2-billion order from saudi business carrier nas for 20 airbus a320s , as well as an option to buy a further 18 of the short-haul planes . private superjumbo buyer revealed as saudi prince it was also revealed at the dubai air show that saudi billionaire prince alwaleed bin talal will be the first private buyer of an a380 superjumbo . the prospective buyer 's identity had been kept secret for months but was unveiled to coincide with the dubai air show . alwaleed , whose interests span kingdom holding to euro disney , hotels and banking , has ordered a vip version of the a380 dubbed the flying palace .
he already owns a boeing 747-400 , the newest type of the original jumbo jet currently in service . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 12.11.2007 fictional thalidomide victim haunts germans after 50 years großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a single sedative was enough to cause severe birth defects after a protracted legal battle , producers of a drama about germany 's thalidomide disaster from 1958-1962 won the right to air their two-part film on prime time television . contergan , a sedative that contained thalidomide , caused severe birth defects in 10,000 children worldwide when it was introduced on the market 50 years ago . the drug was sold over-the-counter and was also used by mothers-to-be as a remedy for morning sickness , but had devastating consequences for the developing embryo .
thalidomide babies developed abnormally short limbs - typically flipper-like fingers emerging from the shoulders .
other infants had eye and ear defects and no legs . a two-part tv film on public television , called " a single tablet " in german , dramatized one of the worst blunders by a drug company .
warner home video germany picked up the us rights to the film and released it as a double dvd under the new title " side effects " on friday , nov .
9 . thalidomide linked to birth defects bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thalidomide victims suffered varying degrees of deformity grünenthal , a private german drug company with an annual turnover of 800 million euros -lrb- $ 1.2 billion -rrb- , started selling thalidomide in october 1957 and only withdraw it as a sedative when findings linking it to birth defects were published by the german press in november 1961 .
the company 's owners are among the 30 wealthiest families in germany with a personal fortune estimated at about 3.3 billion euros according to manager magazin . widukind lenz , a hamburg pediatrician and geneticist , was one of the first to link thalidomide to the sudden surge in birth defects in the late 1950s and early 1960s .
he noticed that thalidomide babies were virtually non-existent in communist east germany , where contergan had not been approved for use . most cases in west germany west germany was hardest hit by thalidomide , with about half , or 5,000 , of all cases worldwide .
contergan was sold in almost 50 countries , but not in the united states , where the fda regulatory authorities refused to give it the green light . thalidomide was sold in canada , however , and it was fda newcomer frances kelsey , a canadian physician , who had resisted intense pressure to put thalidomide on the american market .
she was later decorated by president john f. kennedy in 1962 for her courage .
in 1970 , grünenthal paid a total of 100 million deutschmarks -lrb- $ 75 million , 51.1 million euros -rrb- in a settlement with germany 's thalidomide victims shortly after the civil settlement , the criminal trial of hermann wirtz , the company owner , and eight grünenthal executives was abandoned in december 1970 on the grounds that their guilt was impossible to establish . the german government had contributed a matching amount to the relief fund , which paid modest monthly sums to the survivors until it dried up 10 years ago .
since 1997 the government alone has continued to pay survivors up to 545 euros per month . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german victims are bitter about the 1970 settlement grünenthal is under no legal obligation to continue compensating the victims and has never issued an apology to thalidomide survivors or their families . higher compensation outside germany other countries , including canada , britain and sweden , had ensured more generous compensation .
now in their mid to late 40s , the survivors often suffer from arthritis and back problems resulting from a lifetime of awkward movement .
some of them are forced to retire early for health reasons and many live on social welfare . the two-part tv dramatization tells the story of a fictitious lawyer whose wife takes " just one tablet " of contergan , and gives birth to a daughter with no arms and only one leg . " what 's the matter ?
show me my baby , " says the mother , vera wegener , amid a ghastly silence in the delivery room .
" do n't worry , you can put it in an orphanage , " a doctor replies . another doctor calls the " deformed " daughter " horrible . " " in those days people did not speak of a ' disability , " ' adolf winkelmann of german public broadcaster wdr television told the german dpa news agency .
" the terms they used were pretty insensitive . " part one of the film had showed the lawyer gradually becoming convinced that contergan was responsible for his daughter 's condition .
the second part of the tv movie re-enacted the legal battle for compensating the victims . producers won legal battle to air tv film bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fda approved thalidomide to treat leprosy under strict regulations the film producers had spent 18 months in court with grünenthal executives and the real-life lawyer who led the compensation fight against the drug maker .
both the company and lawyer claimed they had been misrepresented by the film .
the dramatization was changed and now comes with disclaimers insisting that the characters do not represent actual people . several weeks ago , germany 's federal constitutional court struck down temporary injunctions aimed at keeping the tv film off the air .

the meetings took different tones , but both show the gap is closing over the atlantic , said dw 's christina bergmann . the trans-atlantic ice age is over .
if anyone still needed proof that the us on one side , and france and germany on the other , want to start a new chapter in their respective bilateral relationships , then they got it this past week . the east german physicist , german chancellor angela merkel , and the son of a hungarian immigrant , french president nicolas sarkozy , each took different approaches to their meetings with us president george w. bush . in a speech to the us congress , sarkozy pointed out that the two countries had had a long history together prior to the disagreement over the iraq war .
he practically fell over himself with enthusiasm for the united states and left out the iraq topic altogether , just to be on the safe side .
he has to be careful , however , not to take former british prime minister tony blair 's place as the american president 's " poodle . "
after all , those who wish to have influence on someone must be able to look them in the eye . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel is cleverer .
she did n't accept the invitation to the ranch - and its accompanying presidential honor - until her relationship to bush had solidified and she had given him her opinion on numerous occasions .
the president has no problem with that .
he 's proven more than once that he sticks by those who he 's taken a liking to - in good times and bad . it 's not only merkel and sarkozy 's differing personalities and destinies that contribute to the closing of ranks .
everyone knows that bush 's days are numbered .
both sarkozy and merkel will most likely have to do deal with his successor and are interested in setting the course now . in his last year in office , the american president is trying to save what 's left to save .
he continually emphasizes that he does n't make decisions based on opinion polls and that conclusions are n't made until much later .
nevertheless , he does n't want to leave with nothing to show for his time in office . both sides have recognized that things do n't work without the other .
the us is and will remain the only superpower that has the resources and the will to get involved in crisis areas .
but without influential allies , it ca n't be successful .
simply writing off " old " europe , as former us defense minister donald rumsfeld did , does n't work .
still , the countries of " new " europe - with all due respect - have a long road ahead of them before they even remotely attain the political clout that germany and france have . europeans have recognized that they ca n't solve crises alone - from kosovo 's status and the conflict in the middle east to global climate change .
they need the united states .
even in the nuclear conflict with iran .
those who take the path of diplomacy are more successful when they have a nation on their side that , if all else fails , wo n't be afraid to send its soldiers to war . christina bergmann is a correspondent for deutsche welle in washington , dc -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 12.11.2007 fictional thalidomide victim haunts germans after 50 years großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a single sedative was enough to cause severe birth defects after a protracted legal battle , producers of a drama about germany 's thalidomide disaster from 1958-1962 won the right to air their two-part film on prime time television . contergan , a sedative that contained thalidomide , caused severe birth defects in 10,000 children worldwide when it was introduced on the market 50 years ago . the drug was sold over-the-counter and was also used by mothers-to-be as a remedy for morning sickness , but had devastating consequences for the developing embryo .
thalidomide babies developed abnormally short limbs - typically flipper-like fingers emerging from the shoulders .
other infants had eye and ear defects and no legs . a two-part tv film on public television , called " a single tablet " in german , dramatized one of the worst blunders by a drug company .
warner home video germany picked up the us rights to the film and released it as a double dvd under the new title " side effects " on friday , nov .
9 . thalidomide linked to birth defects bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thalidomide victims suffered varying degrees of deformity grünenthal , a private german drug company with an annual turnover of 800 million euros -lrb- $ 1.2 billion -rrb- , started selling thalidomide in october 1957 and only withdraw it as a sedative when findings linking it to birth defects were published by the german press in november 1961 .
the company 's owners are among the 30 wealthiest families in germany with a personal fortune estimated at about 3.3 billion euros according to manager magazin . widukind lenz , a hamburg pediatrician and geneticist , was one of the first to link thalidomide to the sudden surge in birth defects in the late 1950s and early 1960s .
he noticed that thalidomide babies were virtually non-existent in communist east germany , where contergan had not been approved for use . most cases in west germany west germany was hardest hit by thalidomide , with about half , or 5,000 , of all cases worldwide .
contergan was sold in almost 50 countries , but not in the united states , where the fda regulatory authorities refused to give it the green light . thalidomide was sold in canada , however , and it was fda newcomer frances kelsey , a canadian physician , who had resisted intense pressure to put thalidomide on the american market .
she was later decorated by president john f. kennedy in 1962 for her courage .
in 1970 , grünenthal paid a total of 100 million deutschmarks -lrb- $ 75 million , 51.1 million euros -rrb- in a settlement with germany 's thalidomide victims shortly after the civil settlement , the criminal trial of hermann wirtz , the company owner , and eight grünenthal executives was abandoned in december 1970 on the grounds that their guilt was impossible to establish . the german government had contributed a matching amount to the relief fund , which paid modest monthly sums to the survivors until it dried up 10 years ago .
since 1997 the government alone has continued to pay survivors up to 545 euros per month . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german victims are bitter about the 1970 settlement grünenthal is under no legal obligation to continue compensating the victims and has never issued an apology to thalidomide survivors or their families . higher compensation outside germany other countries , including canada , britain and sweden , had ensured more generous compensation .
now in their mid to late 40s , the survivors often suffer from arthritis and back problems resulting from a lifetime of awkward movement .
some of them are forced to retire early for health reasons and many live on social welfare . the two-part tv dramatization tells the story of a fictitious lawyer whose wife takes " just one tablet " of contergan , and gives birth to a daughter with no arms and only one leg . " what 's the matter ?
show me my baby , " says the mother , vera wegener , amid a ghastly silence in the delivery room .
" do n't worry , you can put it in an orphanage , " a doctor replies . another doctor calls the " deformed " daughter " horrible . " " in those days people did not speak of a ' disability , " ' adolf winkelmann of german public broadcaster wdr television told the german dpa news agency .
" the terms they used were pretty insensitive . " part one of the film had showed the lawyer gradually becoming convinced that contergan was responsible for his daughter 's condition .
the second part of the tv movie re-enacted the legal battle for compensating the victims . producers won legal battle to air tv film bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fda approved thalidomide to treat leprosy under strict regulations the film producers had spent 18 months in court with grünenthal executives and the real-life lawyer who led the compensation fight against the drug maker .
both the company and lawyer claimed they had been misrepresented by the film .
the dramatization was changed and now comes with disclaimers insisting that the characters do not represent actual people . several weeks ago , germany 's federal constitutional court struck down temporary injunctions aimed at keeping the tv film off the air .
it was aired on prime time last week with each episode drawing about 7 million viewers . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 12.11.2007 fictional thalidomide victim haunts germans after 50 years großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a single sedative was enough to cause severe birth defects after a protracted legal battle , producers of a drama about germany 's thalidomide disaster from 1958-1962 won the right to air their two-part film on prime time television . contergan , a sedative that contained thalidomide , caused severe birth defects in 10,000 children worldwide when it was introduced on the market 50 years ago . the drug was sold over-the-counter and was also used by mothers-to-be as a remedy for morning sickness , but had devastating consequences for the developing embryo .
thalidomide babies developed abnormally short limbs - typically flipper-like fingers emerging from the shoulders .
other infants had eye and ear defects and no legs . a two-part tv film on public television , called " a single tablet " in german , dramatized one of the worst blunders by a drug company .
warner home video germany picked up the us rights to the film and released it as a double dvd under the new title " side effects " on friday , nov .
9 . thalidomide linked to birth defects bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thalidomide victims suffered varying degrees of deformity grünenthal , a private german drug company with an annual turnover of 800 million euros -lrb- $ 1.2 billion -rrb- , started selling thalidomide in october 1957 and only withdraw it as a sedative when findings linking it to birth defects were published by the german press in november 1961 .
the company 's owners are among the 30 wealthiest families in germany with a personal fortune estimated at about 3.3 billion euros according to manager magazin . widukind lenz , a hamburg pediatrician and geneticist , was one of the first to link thalidomide to the sudden surge in birth defects in the late 1950s and early 1960s .
he noticed that thalidomide babies were virtually non-existent in communist east germany , where contergan had not been approved for use . most cases in west germany west germany was hardest hit by thalidomide , with about half , or 5,000 , of all cases worldwide .
contergan was sold in almost 50 countries , but not in the united states , where the fda regulatory authorities refused to give it the green light . thalidomide was sold in canada , however , and it was fda newcomer frances kelsey , a canadian physician , who had resisted intense pressure to put thalidomide on the american market .
she was later decorated by president john f. kennedy in 1962 for her courage .
in 1970 , grünenthal paid a total of 100 million deutschmarks -lrb- $ 75 million , 51.1 million euros -rrb- in a settlement with germany 's thalidomide victims shortly after the civil settlement , the criminal trial of hermann wirtz , the company owner , and eight grünenthal executives was abandoned in december 1970 on the grounds that their guilt was impossible to establish . the german government had contributed a matching amount to the relief fund , which paid modest monthly sums to the survivors until it dried up 10 years ago .
since 1997 the government alone has continued to pay survivors up to 545 euros per month . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german victims are bitter about the 1970 settlement grünenthal is under no legal obligation to continue compensating the victims and has never issued an apology to thalidomide survivors or their families . higher compensation outside germany other countries , including canada , britain and sweden , had ensured more generous compensation .
now in their mid to late 40s , the survivors often suffer from arthritis and back problems resulting from a lifetime of awkward movement .
some of them are forced to retire early for health reasons and many live on social welfare . the two-part tv dramatization tells the story of a fictitious lawyer whose wife takes " just one tablet " of contergan , and gives birth to a daughter with no arms and only one leg . " what 's the matter ?
show me my baby , " says the mother , vera wegener , amid a ghastly silence in the delivery room .
" do n't worry , you can put it in an orphanage , " a doctor replies . another doctor calls the " deformed " daughter " horrible . " " in those days people did not speak of a ' disability , " ' adolf winkelmann of german public broadcaster wdr television told the german dpa news agency .
" the terms they used were pretty insensitive . " part one of the film had showed the lawyer gradually becoming convinced that contergan was responsible for his daughter 's condition .
the second part of the tv movie re-enacted the legal battle for compensating the victims . producers won legal battle to air tv film bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fda approved thalidomide to treat leprosy under strict regulations the film producers had spent 18 months in court with grünenthal executives and the real-life lawyer who led the compensation fight against the drug maker .
both the company and lawyer claimed they had been misrepresented by the film .
the dramatization was changed and now comes with disclaimers insisting that the characters do not represent actual people . several weeks ago , germany 's federal constitutional court struck down temporary injunctions aimed at keeping the tv film off the air .
it was aired on prime time last week with each episode drawing about 7 million viewers . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-world.de spoke to a thalidomide survivor and his mother . in the autumn of 1960 , margret schlömann , now 75 , had trouble sleeping during her pregnancy and had taken an over-the-counter sedative called contergan , which was produced by the privately owned german drug maker grünenthal . what schlömann and thousands of other pregnant women did not know was that contergan 's active ingredient was thalidomide , a toxic substance that severely stunts the growth of a developing embryo 's limbs .
in june 1961 , her son markus was born without arms and thumbs and fingers that jutted out from each shoulder . today markus schlömann , 46 , is one of around 2,800 thalidomide survivors living in germany .
born in bonn , he works for a bank , is an avid world traveler and has a seven-year-old daughter , lena . his mother also lives in bonn and helps look after lena . dw-world.de : frau schlömann , what was it like for you after giving birth to markus ? margret schlömann : markus was my first child , so i did n't know what to expect .
he also came six weeks early .
pre-maturity was common for thalidomide babies .
after a normal hospital delivery , he was whisked away and put in an incubator .
i did n't get to see my son .
nobody congratulated me .
no one spoke to me . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : without arms , markus needed the help of a harness to balance my husband herbert had arrived , bringing flowers , but he was intercepted by the doctor before seeing me .
i knew something was wrong .
" is the baby dead ? "
i asked herbert .
he broke the news to me .
i was in shock , physically exhausted from the birth , and suddenly overwhelmed with grief . i saw markus four days later .
my maternal instincts took over , and i held him close .
there was another mother in the ward with her perfectly normal baby .
she saw markus there without any arms , and shrieked " what is that thing ? " you must have wondered what caused your child to be born without arms . margret schlömann : a tiny percentage of babies have always been born with birth defects , and i thought that mother nature singled markus out to be that one random statistic . what i did n't know at the time was that clinics all over west germany were seeing a sudden , drastic boom in the number of babies born without arms or legs or any limbs at all . i joined a thalidomide support group for parents .
it became clear that some outside factor must have been responsible for the limb deformities , but what ? was it radioactivity from nuclear testing ?
the shampoo i was using ? then in november 1961 , it came out in the newspapers .
it was contergan .
i was hysterical .
my doctor had urged me to take contergan .
in those days , you simply did n't challenge doctors or authority figures . i took maybe two tablets throughout the pregnancy , but i was too busy to dwell on my feelings of guilt , which surfaced in later years .
after markus , the twins -lsb- who were healthy -rsb- came 18 months later , and restored a sense of normality in our lives . how did people react to markus ? margret schlömann : some were voyeurs - they were either fascinated or repulsed by his armless torso .
one old woman made such a nasty remark , " how could you bring such a freak into this world , " she hollered .
others pitied him .
his appearance obviously made people feel squeamish or uncomfortable . when he was a small child , the neighborhood kids taunted him , but the worst insults were directed at another thalidomide boy , who had no limbs , only extremities .
the kids flapped their arms and chanted , " penguin , penguin , see that penguin , ha , ha . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : markus ' brother -lrb- right -rrb- is 18 months younger .
by 1963 , thalidomide was off the market markus , have attitudes toward the disabled changed in germany ? markus schlömann : yes , definitely .
in the past , families felt ashamed of their disabled relatives and hid them from view , so handicapped people were far more isolated in the 60s than they are today . germans have become much more open talking about disability now .
this is in part due to the aids / hiv revolution and greater awareness of the so-called diseases of civilization in the last decades , when those afflicted came out of the closet . a lot of people do n't even notice my handicap anymore .
one colleague said , " can you get that folder on the top shelf ? "
then they realize i do n't have the arms to reach for it . it 's only when lena was born and started going to school that my disability became an issue again .
lena 's schoolmates are not cruel and insensitive as kids in the 60s were , but they get on my nerves .
" why are your arms so short ? " they keep asking over and over , even when they know the answer . but kids are like that ... markus schlömann : yes , but they can ask me other questions .
i do n't want to be defined by my disability . mostly adults , on the other hand , try to be helpful towards me .
one guy offered to bag my groceries even though i am perfectly capable of doing it myself .
i tried to be gracious about it , although i have some thalidomide friends who feel offended , even hostile towards such well-meaning gestures . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : markus had attended a special needs school you 've also traveled quite a bit .
you 've taken a greyhound bus across america , you 've been to india seven times , and taken trips to latin america , vietnam , thailand , indonesia , fiji , australia .
how do reactions toward your disability differ in those places in comparison to germany ? markus schlömann : i have never had a negative experience .
i 've always been a communicative person , and people respond in kind .
someone might be impressed by the way i can lift a coffee cup , but i do n't know how to do it any other way . in thailand , where extended family structures are part of the culture , people are astounded that i have a regular banking job .
they ask me , " why does n't your family take care of you ? " in some countries though , the infrastructure for handicapped people is not great .
germany is much further along in that respect .
the increasing acceptance of disabled people here is reflected in how our special needs are addressed .
public buildings are equipped with wheelchair ramps and cars are specially designed for people like me to drive . but in german schools , the physically handicapped are not exactly mainstreamed into the system .
there 's the so-called special needs school , which you attended . markus schlömann : there was no alternative when i went to school in the 60s and 70s .
the advantage of a special school is that the entire curriculum is geared towards your needs .
in the afternoons we had gymnastic training to strengthen our back muscles for example . we were all physically handicapped in some way and had great fun together , but by the time i graduated , i wanted to move out into the wider world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " a lot of people do n't even notice my handicap anymore " do you get frustrated about your physical limitations when you see others performing simple tasks that you struggle with ? markus schlömann : i wish i could have been born otherwise .
i would have liked to play the guitar .
i would have liked to be a marine biologist or a forester .
i wish that i could hold my daughter 's hand when we walk down the street .
but this is my body and i have to live with its limitations . there are so many thalidomide adults who are much worse off than me .
i have a good , well-paying job .
i can walk , ride a bike and play soccer . some of my friends have physical limitations that make them unemployable .

on friday , nov .
9 , " side effects " was also released in english .
dw-world.de spoke to a thalidomide survivor and his mother . in the autumn of 1960 , margret schlömann , now 75 , had trouble sleeping during her pregnancy and had taken an over-the-counter sedative called contergan , which was produced by the privately owned german drug maker grünenthal . what schlömann and thousands of other pregnant women did not know was that contergan 's active ingredient was thalidomide , a toxic substance that severely stunts the growth of a developing embryo 's limbs .
in june 1961 , her son markus was born without arms and thumbs and fingers that jutted out from each shoulder . today markus schlömann , 46 , is one of around 2,800 thalidomide survivors living in germany .
born in bonn , he works for a bank , is an avid world traveler and has a seven-year-old daughter , lena . his mother also lives in bonn and helps look after lena . dw-world.de : frau schlömann , what was it like for you after giving birth to markus ? margret schlömann : markus was my first child , so i did n't know what to expect .
he also came six weeks early .
pre-maturity was common for thalidomide babies .
after a normal hospital delivery , he was whisked away and put in an incubator .
i did n't get to see my son .
nobody congratulated me .
no one spoke to me . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : without arms , markus needed the help of a harness to balance my husband herbert had arrived , bringing flowers , but he was intercepted by the doctor before seeing me .
i knew something was wrong .
" is the baby dead ? "
i asked herbert .
he broke the news to me .
i was in shock , physically exhausted from the birth , and suddenly overwhelmed with grief . i saw markus four days later .
my maternal instincts took over , and i held him close .
there was another mother in the ward with her perfectly normal baby .
she saw markus there without any arms , and shrieked " what is that thing ? " you must have wondered what caused your child to be born without arms . margret schlömann : a tiny percentage of babies have always been born with birth defects , and i thought that mother nature singled markus out to be that one random statistic . what i did n't know at the time was that clinics all over west germany were seeing a sudden , drastic boom in the number of babies born without arms or legs or any limbs at all . i joined a thalidomide support group for parents .
it became clear that some outside factor must have been responsible for the limb deformities , but what ? was it radioactivity from nuclear testing ?
the shampoo i was using ? then in november 1961 , it came out in the newspapers .
it was contergan .
i was hysterical .
my doctor had urged me to take contergan .
in those days , you simply did n't challenge doctors or authority figures . i took maybe two tablets throughout the pregnancy , but i was too busy to dwell on my feelings of guilt , which surfaced in later years .
after markus , the twins -lsb- who were healthy -rsb- came 18 months later , and restored a sense of normality in our lives . how did people react to markus ? margret schlömann : some were voyeurs - they were either fascinated or repulsed by his armless torso .
one old woman made such a nasty remark , " how could you bring such a freak into this world , " she hollered .
others pitied him .
his appearance obviously made people feel squeamish or uncomfortable . when he was a small child , the neighborhood kids taunted him , but the worst insults were directed at another thalidomide boy , who had no limbs , only extremities .
the kids flapped their arms and chanted , " penguin , penguin , see that penguin , ha , ha . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : markus ' brother -lrb- right -rrb- is 18 months younger .
by 1963 , thalidomide was off the market markus , have attitudes toward the disabled changed in germany ? markus schlömann : yes , definitely .
in the past , families felt ashamed of their disabled relatives and hid them from view , so handicapped people were far more isolated in the 60s than they are today . germans have become much more open talking about disability now .
this is in part due to the aids / hiv revolution and greater awareness of the so-called diseases of civilization in the last decades , when those afflicted came out of the closet . a lot of people do n't even notice my handicap anymore .
one colleague said , " can you get that folder on the top shelf ? "
then they realize i do n't have the arms to reach for it . it 's only when lena was born and started going to school that my disability became an issue again .
lena 's schoolmates are not cruel and insensitive as kids in the 60s were , but they get on my nerves .
" why are your arms so short ? " they keep asking over and over , even when they know the answer . but kids are like that ... markus schlömann : yes , but they can ask me other questions .
i do n't want to be defined by my disability . mostly adults , on the other hand , try to be helpful towards me .
one guy offered to bag my groceries even though i am perfectly capable of doing it myself .
i tried to be gracious about it , although i have some thalidomide friends who feel offended , even hostile towards such well-meaning gestures . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : markus had attended a special needs school you 've also traveled quite a bit .
you 've taken a greyhound bus across america , you 've been to india seven times , and taken trips to latin america , vietnam , thailand , indonesia , fiji , australia .
how do reactions toward your disability differ in those places in comparison to germany ? markus schlömann : i have never had a negative experience .
i 've always been a communicative person , and people respond in kind .
someone might be impressed by the way i can lift a coffee cup , but i do n't know how to do it any other way . in thailand , where extended family structures are part of the culture , people are astounded that i have a regular banking job .
they ask me , " why does n't your family take care of you ? " in some countries though , the infrastructure for handicapped people is not great .
germany is much further along in that respect .
the increasing acceptance of disabled people here is reflected in how our special needs are addressed .
public buildings are equipped with wheelchair ramps and cars are specially designed for people like me to drive . but in german schools , the physically handicapped are not exactly mainstreamed into the system .
there 's the so-called special needs school , which you attended . markus schlömann : there was no alternative when i went to school in the 60s and 70s .
the advantage of a special school is that the entire curriculum is geared towards your needs .
in the afternoons we had gymnastic training to strengthen our back muscles for example . we were all physically handicapped in some way and had great fun together , but by the time i graduated , i wanted to move out into the wider world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " a lot of people do n't even notice my handicap anymore " do you get frustrated about your physical limitations when you see others performing simple tasks that you struggle with ? markus schlömann : i wish i could have been born otherwise .
i would have liked to play the guitar .
i would have liked to be a marine biologist or a forester .
i wish that i could hold my daughter 's hand when we walk down the street .
but this is my body and i have to live with its limitations . there are so many thalidomide adults who are much worse off than me .
i have a good , well-paying job .
i can walk , ride a bike and play soccer . some of my friends have physical limitations that make them unemployable .
many people i have known have died from their severe disabilities , others committed suicide .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 12.11.2007 living with germany 's biggest pharmaceutical disaster großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : markus with his sister : " this is my body and i have to live with its limitations " millions watched a controversial german tv film based on the thalidomide legacy last week .
on friday , nov .
9 , " side effects " was also released in english .
dw-world.de spoke to a thalidomide survivor and his mother . in the autumn of 1960 , margret schlömann , now 75 , had trouble sleeping during her pregnancy and had taken an over-the-counter sedative called contergan , which was produced by the privately owned german drug maker grünenthal . what schlömann and thousands of other pregnant women did not know was that contergan 's active ingredient was thalidomide , a toxic substance that severely stunts the growth of a developing embryo 's limbs .
in june 1961 , her son markus was born without arms and thumbs and fingers that jutted out from each shoulder . today markus schlömann , 46 , is one of around 2,800 thalidomide survivors living in germany .
born in bonn , he works for a bank , is an avid world traveler and has a seven-year-old daughter , lena . his mother also lives in bonn and helps look after lena . dw-world.de : frau schlömann , what was it like for you after giving birth to markus ? margret schlömann : markus was my first child , so i did n't know what to expect .
he also came six weeks early .
pre-maturity was common for thalidomide babies .
after a normal hospital delivery , he was whisked away and put in an incubator .
i did n't get to see my son .
nobody congratulated me .
no one spoke to me . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : without arms , markus needed the help of a harness to balance my husband herbert had arrived , bringing flowers , but he was intercepted by the doctor before seeing me .
i knew something was wrong .
" is the baby dead ? "
i asked herbert .
he broke the news to me .
i was in shock , physically exhausted from the birth , and suddenly overwhelmed with grief . i saw markus four days later .
my maternal instincts took over , and i held him close .
there was another mother in the ward with her perfectly normal baby .
she saw markus there without any arms , and shrieked " what is that thing ? " you must have wondered what caused your child to be born without arms . margret schlömann : a tiny percentage of babies have always been born with birth defects , and i thought that mother nature singled markus out to be that one random statistic . what i did n't know at the time was that clinics all over west germany were seeing a sudden , drastic boom in the number of babies born without arms or legs or any limbs at all . i joined a thalidomide support group for parents .
it became clear that some outside factor must have been responsible for the limb deformities , but what ? was it radioactivity from nuclear testing ?
the shampoo i was using ? then in november 1961 , it came out in the newspapers .
it was contergan .
i was hysterical .
my doctor had urged me to take contergan .
in those days , you simply did n't challenge doctors or authority figures . i took maybe two tablets throughout the pregnancy , but i was too busy to dwell on my feelings of guilt , which surfaced in later years .
after markus , the twins -lsb- who were healthy -rsb- came 18 months later , and restored a sense of normality in our lives . how did people react to markus ? margret schlömann : some were voyeurs - they were either fascinated or repulsed by his armless torso .
one old woman made such a nasty remark , " how could you bring such a freak into this world , " she hollered .
others pitied him .
his appearance obviously made people feel squeamish or uncomfortable . when he was a small child , the neighborhood kids taunted him , but the worst insults were directed at another thalidomide boy , who had no limbs , only extremities .
the kids flapped their arms and chanted , " penguin , penguin , see that penguin , ha , ha . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : markus ' brother -lrb- right -rrb- is 18 months younger .
by 1963 , thalidomide was off the market markus , have attitudes toward the disabled changed in germany ? markus schlömann : yes , definitely .
in the past , families felt ashamed of their disabled relatives and hid them from view , so handicapped people were far more isolated in the 60s than they are today . germans have become much more open talking about disability now .
this is in part due to the aids / hiv revolution and greater awareness of the so-called diseases of civilization in the last decades , when those afflicted came out of the closet . a lot of people do n't even notice my handicap anymore .
one colleague said , " can you get that folder on the top shelf ? "
then they realize i do n't have the arms to reach for it . it 's only when lena was born and started going to school that my disability became an issue again .
lena 's schoolmates are not cruel and insensitive as kids in the 60s were , but they get on my nerves .
" why are your arms so short ? " they keep asking over and over , even when they know the answer . but kids are like that ... markus schlömann : yes , but they can ask me other questions .
i do n't want to be defined by my disability . mostly adults , on the other hand , try to be helpful towards me .
one guy offered to bag my groceries even though i am perfectly capable of doing it myself .
i tried to be gracious about it , although i have some thalidomide friends who feel offended , even hostile towards such well-meaning gestures . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : markus had attended a special needs school you 've also traveled quite a bit .
you 've taken a greyhound bus across america , you 've been to india seven times , and taken trips to latin america , vietnam , thailand , indonesia , fiji , australia .
how do reactions toward your disability differ in those places in comparison to germany ? markus schlömann : i have never had a negative experience .
i 've always been a communicative person , and people respond in kind .
someone might be impressed by the way i can lift a coffee cup , but i do n't know how to do it any other way . in thailand , where extended family structures are part of the culture , people are astounded that i have a regular banking job .
they ask me , " why does n't your family take care of you ? " in some countries though , the infrastructure for handicapped people is not great .
germany is much further along in that respect .
the increasing acceptance of disabled people here is reflected in how our special needs are addressed .
public buildings are equipped with wheelchair ramps and cars are specially designed for people like me to drive . but in german schools , the physically handicapped are not exactly mainstreamed into the system .
there 's the so-called special needs school , which you attended . markus schlömann : there was no alternative when i went to school in the 60s and 70s .
the advantage of a special school is that the entire curriculum is geared towards your needs .
in the afternoons we had gymnastic training to strengthen our back muscles for example . we were all physically handicapped in some way and had great fun together , but by the time i graduated , i wanted to move out into the wider world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " a lot of people do n't even notice my handicap anymore " do you get frustrated about your physical limitations when you see others performing simple tasks that you struggle with ? markus schlömann : i wish i could have been born otherwise .
i would have liked to play the guitar .
i would have liked to be a marine biologist or a forester .
i wish that i could hold my daughter 's hand when we walk down the street .
but this is my body and i have to live with its limitations . there are so many thalidomide adults who are much worse off than me .
i have a good , well-paying job .
i can walk , ride a bike and play soccer . some of my friends have physical limitations that make them unemployable .
many people i have known have died from their severe disabilities , others committed suicide .
i think i 've come to terms with my life . diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

airbus announced over the weekend that the emirates airline had placed an order that will net airbus over $ 20 billion -lrb- 13.8 billion euros -rrb- . us manufacturer boeing was pushed into the background at the dubai air show on sunday , nov .
11 , when the dubai-owned carrier announced it would buy 11 a380 superjumbos plus 70 midsized a350 xwb -lrb- extra wide body -rrb- aircraft in what airbus executives called the biggest order in the european constructor 's history . the total value of the new firm orders for the 70 a350s and 11 a380s is 20.2 billion dollars , according to airbus . an upbeat airbus sales chief john leahy raised forecast sales of the a350 xwb to " more than 300 " by year 's end .
he had expected 200 orders at the start of the year . boeing , whose b787 dreamliner is the major competitor to the a350 , won a comparatively modest $ 3.2 billion order from emirates for 12 of its b777-300s , bringing the dubai airline 's total outlay for new planes to over $ 23 billion at the show . seattle-based boeing also said in a statement it had signed an agreement with qatar airways for 30 787 dreamliners and five 777 cargo planes in a deal valued at over $ 6.1 billion at list prices . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : enders was happy and proud of emirates ' faith in airbus but the lion 's share of new orders announced sunday went to airbus , a fact welcomed by the company 's ceo tom enders . " emirates airline is placing great faith in our a350 xwb and a380 programs as well as our company and we are rightfully proud , " he said . the latest orders mark a dramatic turnaround for airbus , which was overtaken by rival boeing in the race for new business in 2006 .
the european plane maker had made a spectacular plunge into the red last year and has been beset this year by plane production woes . trade union warns cutbacks may affect orders however , some caution was added to the euphoria on monday when a leading french trade union warned that planned job cuts and site sales at airbus could jeopardize the company 's ability to fill the new orders . " we see a paradox in the accumulation of new orders ... and management 's implementation of power8 , with its job cuts and site sales , " jean-francois knepper , an organizer with force ouvriere -lrb- fo -rrb- , told reporters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus has committed to a plan of cuts and restructuring power8 is a sweeping - and contested - restructuring campaign launched by airbus last february in the face of costly production and delivery delays .
it calls notably for the elimination of 10,000 jobs over four years and the sale of certain production sites in order to achieve savings of 5 billion euros by 2010 . " how are we going to honor these -lsb- emirates -rsb- orders for the a350 when the plan to sell certain sites is not yet finalized ? "
knepper asked .
" time is passing and we are getting orders , but if our leaders do not reconsider the plan to sell sites under power8 , we will not be able to fill the orders on time . " with power8 , he added , " the company is temporarily de-stabilized at a time when we have to hold together . " emirates committing to long-term airbus orders as well as the 70 firm orders for the a350s - which are scheduled to come into service in 2013 - emirates chairman and chief executive sheikh ahmed bin saeed al-maktoum said the company had taken an option to buy a further 50 of the new-generation planes down the line .
he added that the airline had decided to order three more a380 superjumbos , and to firm up a previous option to buy a further eight . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first commercial a380 took off in singapore livery " the a350 xwb and a380 will play an important role in supporting emirates ' and dubai 's growth plans , " maktoum said .
" as the leading airline for the 21st century , it made sense for emirates to choose the a350 xwb - an aircraft designed with 21st century technologies . " the 70 firm orders - for 50 a350-900s and 20 a350-1000s - will make emirates the second biggest customer for the long-haul planes after qatar airways announced an order for 80 in june . the contract brings the number of a380s ordered by emirates to 58 , making it the world 's biggest customer for the superjumbo , which made its first commercial flight in the livery of singapore airlines last month . airbus also announced a $ 2-billion order from saudi business carrier nas for 20 airbus a320s , as well as an option to buy a further 18 of the short-haul planes . private superjumbo buyer revealed as saudi prince it was also revealed at the dubai air show that saudi billionaire prince alwaleed bin talal will be the first private buyer of an a380 superjumbo . the prospective buyer 's identity had been kept secret for months but was unveiled to coincide with the dubai air show . alwaleed , whose interests span kingdom holding to euro disney , hotels and banking , has ordered a vip version of the a380 dubbed the flying palace .
he already owns a boeing 747-400 , the newest type of the original jumbo jet currently in service . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

thalidomide babies developed abnormally short limbs - typically flipper-like fingers emerging from the shoulders .
other infants had eye and ear defects and no legs . a two-part tv film on public television , called " a single tablet " in german , dramatized one of the worst blunders by a drug company .
warner home video germany picked up the us rights to the film and released it as a double dvd under the new title " side effects " on friday , nov .
9 . thalidomide linked to birth defects bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thalidomide victims suffered varying degrees of deformity grünenthal , a private german drug company with an annual turnover of 800 million euros -lrb- $ 1.2 billion -rrb- , started selling thalidomide in october 1957 and only withdraw it as a sedative when findings linking it to birth defects were published by the german press in november 1961 .
the company 's owners are among the 30 wealthiest families in germany with a personal fortune estimated at about 3.3 billion euros according to manager magazin . widukind lenz , a hamburg pediatrician and geneticist , was one of the first to link thalidomide to the sudden surge in birth defects in the late 1950s and early 1960s .

some of them are forced to retire early for health reasons and many live on social welfare . the two-part tv dramatization tells the story of a fictitious lawyer whose wife takes " just one tablet " of contergan , and gives birth to a daughter with no arms and only one leg . " what 's the matter ?
show me my baby , " says the mother , vera wegener , amid a ghastly silence in the delivery room .
" do n't worry , you can put it in an orphanage , " a doctor replies . another doctor calls the " deformed " daughter " horrible . " " in those days people did not speak of a ' disability , " ' adolf winkelmann of german public broadcaster wdr television told the german dpa news agency .
" the terms they used were pretty insensitive . " part one of the film had showed the lawyer gradually becoming convinced that contergan was responsible for his daughter 's condition .
the second part of the tv movie re-enacted the legal battle for compensating the victims . producers won legal battle to air tv film bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fda approved thalidomide to treat leprosy under strict regulations the film producers had spent 18 months in court with grünenthal executives and the real-life lawyer who led the compensation fight against the drug maker .
both the company and lawyer claimed they had been misrepresented by the film .
the dramatization was changed and now comes with disclaimers insisting that the characters do not represent actual people . several weeks ago , germany 's federal constitutional court struck down temporary injunctions aimed at keeping the tv film off the air .
it was aired on prime time last week with each episode drawing about 7 million viewers . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but when performed by two politicians , it could threaten civilization . just as models and hotel heiresses should never become actors ; neither should politicians become pop stars .
it is an unwritten rule that has kept the fragile state of the planet intact for many centuries .
when people who excel at what they do in one field , and paris hilton , decide that they would like to branch out , it can have a very damaging effect on the delicate balance of existence . of all those who think that adding a " slash " somewhere in the job title - " actor-slash-model , " " singer-slash-human rights campaigner " - is a good idea , politicians are among those who should receive the least encouragement . however , it seems that someone forgot to tell german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier and his french counterpart bernard kouchner to stick to diplomacy . in an act of ill-conceived detente , the two foreign ministers recorded a " rhythm and blues " song in berlin on monday , nov .
12 . unlikely soundtrack for romantic evenings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : things went from bad to worse when he played the steinmeier / kouchner song if that 's not enough to get true music fans on their knees praying for deafness , the song is about european integration and is expected to have the complete opposite effect of a barry white record by seriously adding to europe 's birth-rate crisis . " the two foreign ministers want to make their contribution to the debate but in a somewhat unconventional way , " german foreign ministry spokesman martin jäger told a news conference . in an effort to show that they 're " down with the kids , " steinmeier and kouchner slipped away from the franco-german summit held in the governmental quarter to record their ode to europe with a backing group of young people in berlin 's kreuzberg district , a heavily turkish section of the german capital . " no one has ever heard a french and german foreign minister singing together , " jäger added before the recording .
" on monday , this will happen . " unfortunately for almost everyone , this is n't the first time that politicians have revealed that their hearts belong to rock 'n'roll . bill blows , robert plucks , tony strums bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair 's " stairway to heaven " was a popular turn who can ever forget bill clinton 's shameless milking of his mediocre saxophone talent during campaign rallies ? and from the fringe is sure that robert mugabe 's double-bass skills would have attracted a much larger audience had the zimbabwean dictator not silenced the country 's music press along with everyone else . then there 's former british prime minister tony blair who was just plain old tony blair when he started playing guitar for his university rock band " ugly rumours . " unfortunately , his career in politics failed to dull the ex-labour party leader 's dream of making it big and he could never resist going through his repertoire of licks whenever an unsuspecting guitar was at hand .
even becoming the middle east quartet 's special envoy has failed to shake the stars from blair 's eyes . -lsb- ugly -rsb- rumours are rife that blair may be considering joining us president george w. bush and secretary of state condoleezza rice , a proficient pianist , in a performance at the upcoming middle east quartet 's meeting in annapolis this month . while the rumors suggest that no song has yet been chosen , it is believed that bush , blair and rice have vetoed a proposed reworking of pink floyd 's " get your filthy hands off my desert .

the meetings took different tones , but both show the gap is closing over the atlantic , said dw 's christina bergmann . the trans-atlantic ice age is over .
if anyone still needed proof that the us on one side , and france and germany on the other , want to start a new chapter in their respective bilateral relationships , then they got it this past week . the east german physicist , german chancellor angela merkel , and the son of a hungarian immigrant , french president nicolas sarkozy , each took different approaches to their meetings with us president george w. bush . in a speech to the us congress , sarkozy pointed out that the two countries had had a long history together prior to the disagreement over the iraq war .
he practically fell over himself with enthusiasm for the united states and left out the iraq topic altogether , just to be on the safe side .
he has to be careful , however , not to take former british prime minister tony blair 's place as the american president 's " poodle . "
after all , those who wish to have influence on someone must be able to look them in the eye . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel is cleverer .
she did n't accept the invitation to the ranch - and its accompanying presidential honor - until her relationship to bush had solidified and she had given him her opinion on numerous occasions .
the president has no problem with that .
he 's proven more than once that he sticks by those who he 's taken a liking to - in good times and bad . it 's not only merkel and sarkozy 's differing personalities and destinies that contribute to the closing of ranks .
everyone knows that bush 's days are numbered .
both sarkozy and merkel will most likely have to do deal with his successor and are interested in setting the course now . in his last year in office , the american president is trying to save what 's left to save .
he continually emphasizes that he does n't make decisions based on opinion polls and that conclusions are n't made until much later .
nevertheless , he does n't want to leave with nothing to show for his time in office . both sides have recognized that things do n't work without the other .
the us is and will remain the only superpower that has the resources and the will to get involved in crisis areas .
but without influential allies , it ca n't be successful .
simply writing off " old " europe , as former us defense minister donald rumsfeld did , does n't work .
still , the countries of " new " europe - with all due respect - have a long road ahead of them before they even remotely attain the political clout that germany and france have . europeans have recognized that they ca n't solve crises alone - from kosovo 's status and the conflict in the middle east to global climate change .
they need the united states .
even in the nuclear conflict with iran .
those who take the path of diplomacy are more successful when they have a nation on their side that , if all else fails , wo n't be afraid to send its soldiers to war . christina bergmann is a correspondent for deutsche welle in washington , dc -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" targeted sanctions against individuals or specific groups are , in principle , preferable to general sanctions imposed on states .
general sanctions often have dire consequences for vulnerable population groups in the countries concerned , and generally not for their leadership , " marty said in a report released sunday , nov .
11 .
lost credibility but , marty said , individual suspects placed on the lists did not have the right to reply and found it virtually impossible to clear their names .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marty : the lists are " unworthy " of the eu and un 's " lofty goals " " the present system of blacklists flouts the fundamental principles which are the basis of human rights , " he said in the report , which is due to be presented to the strasbourg-based council of europe on monday .
the un security council first established a list of al-qaeda and taliban suspects in 1999 .
it contains the names of 368 individuals and 124 entities .
the united nations said its members must freeze the assets , and prevent the entry into their territories , of anyone on the lists .
also , it must prevent the sale and transfer of arms to them .
the european union has set up its own blacklist .
marty said both organizations must respect " minimal norms of procedure and juridical safeguards " before imposing restrictions .
these norms included giving suspects the right to appeal to an independent and impartial organization and the right to compensation in the case of any miscarriage of justice .
attacks on cia practices he said the council of europe 's 47 member states should make sure such guarantees were offered .
in the past , the swiss senator has attacked the us practice of " extraordinary rendition " of terror suspects and secret cia prisons in countries with little regard for human rights .
while blacklisting " may be a useful instrument in certain circumstances and , in any event , for a limited period of time , " marty said it is unacceptable that no clear procedure is foreseen for getting off the blacklist .
" if one adds to this picture the practice of abductions -lsb- " extraordinary renditions " -rsb- , secret detention centers and the trivialization of torture , this provides a worrying , devastating message : principles that are as fundamental as the rule of law and the protection of human rights are optional accessories applicable only in fair weather . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the council of europe guarantee the rights of those blacklisted ?
marty highlighted the case of the people 's mujahedeen of iran , which forms part of the national council of resistance of iran and is on an eu blacklist despite a european court ruling in 2006 saying it should be removed from the list .
" despite recent procedural improvements it remains almost impossible , in practice , to be removed from the blacklist - a situation that is illegal and unacceptable , " marty wrote .
in another example , yussef nada , an italian businessman of egyptian origin living in switzerland for three decades , was placed on such a blacklist in 2001 on suspicion of having financed the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks .
his assets were seized and his freedom of movement was severely restricted .
he was not informed and was unable to appeal the decision , he has said .
six years later , the 78-year-old remains blacklisted despite law enforcement agencies in two countries " not finding a shred of evidence of any wrongdoing , " marty said . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" targeted sanctions against individuals or specific groups are , in principle , preferable to general sanctions imposed on states .
general sanctions often have dire consequences for vulnerable population groups in the countries concerned , and generally not for their leadership , " marty said in a report released sunday , nov .
11 .
lost credibility but , marty said , individual suspects placed on the lists did not have the right to reply and found it virtually impossible to clear their names .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marty : the lists are " unworthy " of the eu and un 's " lofty goals " " the present system of blacklists flouts the fundamental principles which are the basis of human rights , " he said in the report , which is due to be presented to the strasbourg-based council of europe on monday .
the un security council first established a list of al-qaeda and taliban suspects in 1999 .
it contains the names of 368 individuals and 124 entities .
the united nations said its members must freeze the assets , and prevent the entry into their territories , of anyone on the lists .
also , it must prevent the sale and transfer of arms to them .
the european union has set up its own blacklist .
marty said both organizations must respect " minimal norms of procedure and juridical safeguards " before imposing restrictions .
these norms included giving suspects the right to appeal to an independent and impartial organization and the right to compensation in the case of any miscarriage of justice .
attacks on cia practices he said the council of europe 's 47 member states should make sure such guarantees were offered .
in the past , the swiss senator has attacked the us practice of " extraordinary rendition " of terror suspects and secret cia prisons in countries with little regard for human rights .
while blacklisting " may be a useful instrument in certain circumstances and , in any event , for a limited period of time , " marty said it is unacceptable that no clear procedure is foreseen for getting off the blacklist .
" if one adds to this picture the practice of abductions -lsb- " extraordinary renditions " -rsb- , secret detention centers and the trivialization of torture , this provides a worrying , devastating message : principles that are as fundamental as the rule of law and the protection of human rights are optional accessories applicable only in fair weather . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the council of europe guarantee the rights of those blacklisted ?
marty highlighted the case of the people 's mujahedeen of iran , which forms part of the national council of resistance of iran and is on an eu blacklist despite a european court ruling in 2006 saying it should be removed from the list .
" despite recent procedural improvements it remains almost impossible , in practice , to be removed from the blacklist - a situation that is illegal and unacceptable , " marty wrote .
in another example , yussef nada , an italian businessman of egyptian origin living in switzerland for three decades , was placed on such a blacklist in 2001 on suspicion of having financed the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks .
his assets were seized and his freedom of movement was severely restricted .
he was not informed and was unable to appeal the decision , he has said .
six years later , the 78-year-old remains blacklisted despite law enforcement agencies in two countries " not finding a shred of evidence of any wrongdoing , " marty said . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but when performed by two politicians , it could threaten civilization . just as models and hotel heiresses should never become actors ; neither should politicians become pop stars .
it is an unwritten rule that has kept the fragile state of the planet intact for many centuries .
when people who excel at what they do in one field , and paris hilton , decide that they would like to branch out , it can have a very damaging effect on the delicate balance of existence . of all those who think that adding a " slash " somewhere in the job title - " actor-slash-model , " " singer-slash-human rights campaigner " - is a good idea , politicians are among those who should receive the least encouragement . however , it seems that someone forgot to tell german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier and his french counterpart bernard kouchner to stick to diplomacy . in an act of ill-conceived detente , the two foreign ministers recorded a " rhythm and blues " song in berlin on monday , nov .
12 . unlikely soundtrack for romantic evenings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : things went from bad to worse when he played the steinmeier / kouchner song if that 's not enough to get true music fans on their knees praying for deafness , the song is about european integration and is expected to have the complete opposite effect of a barry white record by seriously adding to europe 's birth-rate crisis . " the two foreign ministers want to make their contribution to the debate but in a somewhat unconventional way , " german foreign ministry spokesman martin jäger told a news conference . in an effort to show that they 're " down with the kids , " steinmeier and kouchner slipped away from the franco-german summit held in the governmental quarter to record their ode to europe with a backing group of young people in berlin 's kreuzberg district , a heavily turkish section of the german capital . " no one has ever heard a french and german foreign minister singing together , " jäger added before the recording .
" on monday , this will happen . " unfortunately for almost everyone , this is n't the first time that politicians have revealed that their hearts belong to rock 'n'roll . bill blows , robert plucks , tony strums bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair 's " stairway to heaven " was a popular turn who can ever forget bill clinton 's shameless milking of his mediocre saxophone talent during campaign rallies ? and from the fringe is sure that robert mugabe 's double-bass skills would have attracted a much larger audience had the zimbabwean dictator not silenced the country 's music press along with everyone else . then there 's former british prime minister tony blair who was just plain old tony blair when he started playing guitar for his university rock band " ugly rumours . " unfortunately , his career in politics failed to dull the ex-labour party leader 's dream of making it big and he could never resist going through his repertoire of licks whenever an unsuspecting guitar was at hand .
even becoming the middle east quartet 's special envoy has failed to shake the stars from blair 's eyes . -lsb- ugly -rsb- rumours are rife that blair may be considering joining us president george w. bush and secretary of state condoleezza rice , a proficient pianist , in a performance at the upcoming middle east quartet 's meeting in annapolis this month . while the rumors suggest that no song has yet been chosen , it is believed that bush , blair and rice have vetoed a proposed reworking of pink floyd 's " get your filthy hands off my desert .

the meetings took different tones , but both show the gap is closing over the atlantic , said dw 's christina bergmann . the trans-atlantic ice age is over .
if anyone still needed proof that the us on one side , and france and germany on the other , want to start a new chapter in their respective bilateral relationships , then they got it this past week . the east german physicist , german chancellor angela merkel , and the son of a hungarian immigrant , french president nicolas sarkozy , each took different approaches to their meetings with us president george w. bush . in a speech to the us congress , sarkozy pointed out that the two countries had had a long history together prior to the disagreement over the iraq war .
he practically fell over himself with enthusiasm for the united states and left out the iraq topic altogether , just to be on the safe side .
he has to be careful , however , not to take former british prime minister tony blair 's place as the american president 's " poodle . "
after all , those who wish to have influence on someone must be able to look them in the eye . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel is cleverer .
she did n't accept the invitation to the ranch - and its accompanying presidential honor - until her relationship to bush had solidified and she had given him her opinion on numerous occasions .
the president has no problem with that .
he 's proven more than once that he sticks by those who he 's taken a liking to - in good times and bad . it 's not only merkel and sarkozy 's differing personalities and destinies that contribute to the closing of ranks .
everyone knows that bush 's days are numbered .
both sarkozy and merkel will most likely have to do deal with his successor and are interested in setting the course now . in his last year in office , the american president is trying to save what 's left to save .
he continually emphasizes that he does n't make decisions based on opinion polls and that conclusions are n't made until much later .
nevertheless , he does n't want to leave with nothing to show for his time in office . both sides have recognized that things do n't work without the other .
the us is and will remain the only superpower that has the resources and the will to get involved in crisis areas .
but without influential allies , it ca n't be successful .
simply writing off " old " europe , as former us defense minister donald rumsfeld did , does n't work .
still , the countries of " new " europe - with all due respect - have a long road ahead of them before they even remotely attain the political clout that germany and france have . europeans have recognized that they ca n't solve crises alone - from kosovo 's status and the conflict in the middle east to global climate change .
they need the united states .
even in the nuclear conflict with iran .
those who take the path of diplomacy are more successful when they have a nation on their side that , if all else fails , wo n't be afraid to send its soldiers to war . christina bergmann is a correspondent for deutsche welle in washington , dc -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

officials cancelled one match , and met to discuss further measures against fan violence . a policeman , trying to break up a scuffle between soccer fans from opposing teams at a highway rest station near arezzo , killed one of the men when he fired warning shots into the air .
gabriele sandri , 26 , was a lazio fan heading for a game of the top italian league , serie a , in milan .
he died as a result of the gunshot wounds on the morning of sunday , nov .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gabriele sandri : killed in a soccer-related scuffle rioting then broke out in bergamo and rome , where fans attacked a police barracks , as well as the olympic stadium and the headquarters of the italian olympic committee next door .
one game cancellation inter milan-lazio was the only game cancelled sunday afternoon , but at an atalanta-ac milan match in bergamo , hooligans caused the game to be abandoned after they tried to destroy a glass barrier in order to stampede the pitch .
five other serie a games were played .
authorities decided to cancel the late game between roma and cagliari , which was already considered at risk , but riots began outside the stadio olimpico where hooligans attacked city policemen , damaged cars and motorcycles and set fire to a police bus .
later in the night , nearby police offices and the headquarters of the italian olympic committee were attacked by hundreds of people .
bildunterschrift : rioting broke out in downtown rome ansa news agency reported that nine policemen , three photographers and dozens of hooligans were injured in rome .

sunday 's violence mirrored riots outside a catania match in sicily in february , where a policeman was killed .
that incident led to strict new security measures at soccer stadiums , but authorities may have to look again at the rules amid calls to ban away fans from all grounds in future .
" painful day " for italian soccer " it is another very sad and painful day for all of italian soccer , " italian soccer federation president giancarlo abete said in a statement to the press .
" the first thought is of huge condolences for the family of gabriele sandri . "
abete said he had convened a meeting for late monday with his board as well as representatives of the league , and player and coach associations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amato said the killing was a " tragic error " they will discuss what to do about the cancelled inter milan vs. lazio and as roma vs. cagliari matches , and whether to play the atalanta game or award the points to milan .
interior minister giuliano amato told news agencies the killing was " a tragic error , " but it happened in circumstances linked to the violence that permeates soccer , and " every week forces thousands of agents to patrol cities and roads to prevent that the worst happens . "
a report last month said injuries at stadiums caused by fan violence had dropped 80 percent from last season , but abete has often said that soccer authorities can do little to stamp out trouble away from stadiums . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" targeted sanctions against individuals or specific groups are , in principle , preferable to general sanctions imposed on states .
general sanctions often have dire consequences for vulnerable population groups in the countries concerned , and generally not for their leadership , " marty said in a report released sunday , nov .
11 .
lost credibility but , marty said , individual suspects placed on the lists did not have the right to reply and found it virtually impossible to clear their names .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marty : the lists are " unworthy " of the eu and un 's " lofty goals " " the present system of blacklists flouts the fundamental principles which are the basis of human rights , " he said in the report , which is due to be presented to the strasbourg-based council of europe on monday .
the un security council first established a list of al-qaeda and taliban suspects in 1999 .
it contains the names of 368 individuals and 124 entities .
the united nations said its members must freeze the assets , and prevent the entry into their territories , of anyone on the lists .
also , it must prevent the sale and transfer of arms to them .
the european union has set up its own blacklist .
marty said both organizations must respect " minimal norms of procedure and juridical safeguards " before imposing restrictions .
these norms included giving suspects the right to appeal to an independent and impartial organization and the right to compensation in the case of any miscarriage of justice .
attacks on cia practices he said the council of europe 's 47 member states should make sure such guarantees were offered .
in the past , the swiss senator has attacked the us practice of " extraordinary rendition " of terror suspects and secret cia prisons in countries with little regard for human rights .
while blacklisting " may be a useful instrument in certain circumstances and , in any event , for a limited period of time , " marty said it is unacceptable that no clear procedure is foreseen for getting off the blacklist .
" if one adds to this picture the practice of abductions -lsb- " extraordinary renditions " -rsb- , secret detention centers and the trivialization of torture , this provides a worrying , devastating message : principles that are as fundamental as the rule of law and the protection of human rights are optional accessories applicable only in fair weather . "

marty highlighted the case of the people 's mujahedeen of iran , which forms part of the national council of resistance of iran and is on an eu blacklist despite a european court ruling in 2006 saying it should be removed from the list .
" despite recent procedural improvements it remains almost impossible , in practice , to be removed from the blacklist - a situation that is illegal and unacceptable , " marty wrote .
in another example , yussef nada , an italian businessman of egyptian origin living in switzerland for three decades , was placed on such a blacklist in 2001 on suspicion of having financed the sept .

his assets were seized and his freedom of movement was severely restricted .

dw-world.de spoke to a thalidomide survivor and his mother . in the autumn of 1960 , margret schlömann , now 75 , had trouble sleeping during her pregnancy and had taken an over-the-counter sedative called contergan , which was produced by the privately owned german drug maker grünenthal . what schlömann and thousands of other pregnant women did not know was that contergan 's active ingredient was thalidomide , a toxic substance that severely stunts the growth of a developing embryo 's limbs .
in june 1961 , her son markus was born without arms and thumbs and fingers that jutted out from each shoulder . today markus schlömann , 46 , is one of around 2,800 thalidomide survivors living in germany .
born in bonn , he works for a bank , is an avid world traveler and has a seven-year-old daughter , lena . his mother also lives in bonn and helps look after lena . dw-world.de : frau schlömann , what was it like for you after giving birth to markus ? margret schlömann : markus was my first child , so i did n't know what to expect .
he also came six weeks early .
pre-maturity was common for thalidomide babies .
after a normal hospital delivery , he was whisked away and put in an incubator .
i did n't get to see my son .
nobody congratulated me .
no one spoke to me . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : without arms , markus needed the help of a harness to balance my husband herbert had arrived , bringing flowers , but he was intercepted by the doctor before seeing me .
i knew something was wrong .
" is the baby dead ? "
i asked herbert .
he broke the news to me .
i was in shock , physically exhausted from the birth , and suddenly overwhelmed with grief . i saw markus four days later .
my maternal instincts took over , and i held him close .
there was another mother in the ward with her perfectly normal baby .
she saw markus there without any arms , and shrieked " what is that thing ? " you must have wondered what caused your child to be born without arms . margret schlömann : a tiny percentage of babies have always been born with birth defects , and i thought that mother nature singled markus out to be that one random statistic . what i did n't know at the time was that clinics all over west germany were seeing a sudden , drastic boom in the number of babies born without arms or legs or any limbs at all . i joined a thalidomide support group for parents .
it became clear that some outside factor must have been responsible for the limb deformities , but what ? was it radioactivity from nuclear testing ?
the shampoo i was using ? then in november 1961 , it came out in the newspapers .
it was contergan .
i was hysterical .
my doctor had urged me to take contergan .
in those days , you simply did n't challenge doctors or authority figures . i took maybe two tablets throughout the pregnancy , but i was too busy to dwell on my feelings of guilt , which surfaced in later years .
after markus , the twins -lsb- who were healthy -rsb- came 18 months later , and restored a sense of normality in our lives . how did people react to markus ? margret schlömann : some were voyeurs - they were either fascinated or repulsed by his armless torso .
one old woman made such a nasty remark , " how could you bring such a freak into this world , " she hollered .
others pitied him .
his appearance obviously made people feel squeamish or uncomfortable . when he was a small child , the neighborhood kids taunted him , but the worst insults were directed at another thalidomide boy , who had no limbs , only extremities .
the kids flapped their arms and chanted , " penguin , penguin , see that penguin , ha , ha . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : markus ' brother -lrb- right -rrb- is 18 months younger .
by 1963 , thalidomide was off the market markus , have attitudes toward the disabled changed in germany ? markus schlömann : yes , definitely .
in the past , families felt ashamed of their disabled relatives and hid them from view , so handicapped people were far more isolated in the 60s than they are today . germans have become much more open talking about disability now .
this is in part due to the aids / hiv revolution and greater awareness of the so-called diseases of civilization in the last decades , when those afflicted came out of the closet . a lot of people do n't even notice my handicap anymore .
one colleague said , " can you get that folder on the top shelf ? "
then they realize i do n't have the arms to reach for it . it 's only when lena was born and started going to school that my disability became an issue again .
lena 's schoolmates are not cruel and insensitive as kids in the 60s were , but they get on my nerves .
" why are your arms so short ? " they keep asking over and over , even when they know the answer . but kids are like that ... markus schlömann : yes , but they can ask me other questions .
i do n't want to be defined by my disability . mostly adults , on the other hand , try to be helpful towards me .
one guy offered to bag my groceries even though i am perfectly capable of doing it myself .
i tried to be gracious about it , although i have some thalidomide friends who feel offended , even hostile towards such well-meaning gestures . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : markus had attended a special needs school you 've also traveled quite a bit .
you 've taken a greyhound bus across america , you 've been to india seven times , and taken trips to latin america , vietnam , thailand , indonesia , fiji , australia .
how do reactions toward your disability differ in those places in comparison to germany ? markus schlömann : i have never had a negative experience .
i 've always been a communicative person , and people respond in kind .
someone might be impressed by the way i can lift a coffee cup , but i do n't know how to do it any other way . in thailand , where extended family structures are part of the culture , people are astounded that i have a regular banking job .
they ask me , " why does n't your family take care of you ? " in some countries though , the infrastructure for handicapped people is not great .
germany is much further along in that respect .
the increasing acceptance of disabled people here is reflected in how our special needs are addressed .
public buildings are equipped with wheelchair ramps and cars are specially designed for people like me to drive . but in german schools , the physically handicapped are not exactly mainstreamed into the system .
there 's the so-called special needs school , which you attended . markus schlömann : there was no alternative when i went to school in the 60s and 70s .
the advantage of a special school is that the entire curriculum is geared towards your needs .
in the afternoons we had gymnastic training to strengthen our back muscles for example . we were all physically handicapped in some way and had great fun together , but by the time i graduated , i wanted to move out into the wider world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " a lot of people do n't even notice my handicap anymore " do you get frustrated about your physical limitations when you see others performing simple tasks that you struggle with ? markus schlömann : i wish i could have been born otherwise .
i would have liked to play the guitar .
i would have liked to be a marine biologist or a forester .
i wish that i could hold my daughter 's hand when we walk down the street .
but this is my body and i have to live with its limitations . there are so many thalidomide adults who are much worse off than me .
i have a good , well-paying job .
i can walk , ride a bike and play soccer . some of my friends have physical limitations that make them unemployable .
many people i have known have died from their severe disabilities , others committed suicide .
i think i 've come to terms with my life . diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-world.de spoke to a thalidomide survivor and his mother . in the autumn of 1960 , margret schlömann , now 75 , had trouble sleeping during her pregnancy and had taken an over-the-counter sedative called contergan , which was produced by the privately owned german drug maker grünenthal . what schlömann and thousands of other pregnant women did not know was that contergan 's active ingredient was thalidomide , a toxic substance that severely stunts the growth of a developing embryo 's limbs .
in june 1961 , her son markus was born without arms and thumbs and fingers that jutted out from each shoulder . today markus schlömann , 46 , is one of around 2,800 thalidomide survivors living in germany .
born in bonn , he works for a bank , is an avid world traveler and has a seven-year-old daughter , lena . his mother also lives in bonn and helps look after lena . dw-world.de : frau schlömann , what was it like for you after giving birth to markus ? margret schlömann : markus was my first child , so i did n't know what to expect .
he also came six weeks early .
pre-maturity was common for thalidomide babies .
after a normal hospital delivery , he was whisked away and put in an incubator .
i did n't get to see my son .
nobody congratulated me .
no one spoke to me . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : without arms , markus needed the help of a harness to balance my husband herbert had arrived , bringing flowers , but he was intercepted by the doctor before seeing me .
i knew something was wrong .
" is the baby dead ? "
i asked herbert .
he broke the news to me .
i was in shock , physically exhausted from the birth , and suddenly overwhelmed with grief . i saw markus four days later .
my maternal instincts took over , and i held him close .
there was another mother in the ward with her perfectly normal baby .
she saw markus there without any arms , and shrieked " what is that thing ? " you must have wondered what caused your child to be born without arms . margret schlömann : a tiny percentage of babies have always been born with birth defects , and i thought that mother nature singled markus out to be that one random statistic . what i did n't know at the time was that clinics all over west germany were seeing a sudden , drastic boom in the number of babies born without arms or legs or any limbs at all . i joined a thalidomide support group for parents .
it became clear that some outside factor must have been responsible for the limb deformities , but what ? was it radioactivity from nuclear testing ?
the shampoo i was using ? then in november 1961 , it came out in the newspapers .
it was contergan .
i was hysterical .
my doctor had urged me to take contergan .
in those days , you simply did n't challenge doctors or authority figures . i took maybe two tablets throughout the pregnancy , but i was too busy to dwell on my feelings of guilt , which surfaced in later years .
after markus , the twins -lsb- who were healthy -rsb- came 18 months later , and restored a sense of normality in our lives . how did people react to markus ? margret schlömann : some were voyeurs - they were either fascinated or repulsed by his armless torso .
one old woman made such a nasty remark , " how could you bring such a freak into this world , " she hollered .
others pitied him .
his appearance obviously made people feel squeamish or uncomfortable . when he was a small child , the neighborhood kids taunted him , but the worst insults were directed at another thalidomide boy , who had no limbs , only extremities .
the kids flapped their arms and chanted , " penguin , penguin , see that penguin , ha , ha . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : markus ' brother -lrb- right -rrb- is 18 months younger .
by 1963 , thalidomide was off the market markus , have attitudes toward the disabled changed in germany ? markus schlömann : yes , definitely .
in the past , families felt ashamed of their disabled relatives and hid them from view , so handicapped people were far more isolated in the 60s than they are today . germans have become much more open talking about disability now .
this is in part due to the aids / hiv revolution and greater awareness of the so-called diseases of civilization in the last decades , when those afflicted came out of the closet . a lot of people do n't even notice my handicap anymore .
one colleague said , " can you get that folder on the top shelf ? "
then they realize i do n't have the arms to reach for it . it 's only when lena was born and started going to school that my disability became an issue again .
lena 's schoolmates are not cruel and insensitive as kids in the 60s were , but they get on my nerves .
" why are your arms so short ? " they keep asking over and over , even when they know the answer . but kids are like that ... markus schlömann : yes , but they can ask me other questions .
i do n't want to be defined by my disability . mostly adults , on the other hand , try to be helpful towards me .
one guy offered to bag my groceries even though i am perfectly capable of doing it myself .
i tried to be gracious about it , although i have some thalidomide friends who feel offended , even hostile towards such well-meaning gestures . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : markus had attended a special needs school you 've also traveled quite a bit .
you 've taken a greyhound bus across america , you 've been to india seven times , and taken trips to latin america , vietnam , thailand , indonesia , fiji , australia .
how do reactions toward your disability differ in those places in comparison to germany ? markus schlömann : i have never had a negative experience .
i 've always been a communicative person , and people respond in kind .
someone might be impressed by the way i can lift a coffee cup , but i do n't know how to do it any other way . in thailand , where extended family structures are part of the culture , people are astounded that i have a regular banking job .
they ask me , " why does n't your family take care of you ? " in some countries though , the infrastructure for handicapped people is not great .
germany is much further along in that respect .
the increasing acceptance of disabled people here is reflected in how our special needs are addressed .
public buildings are equipped with wheelchair ramps and cars are specially designed for people like me to drive . but in german schools , the physically handicapped are not exactly mainstreamed into the system .
there 's the so-called special needs school , which you attended . markus schlömann : there was no alternative when i went to school in the 60s and 70s .
the advantage of a special school is that the entire curriculum is geared towards your needs .
in the afternoons we had gymnastic training to strengthen our back muscles for example . we were all physically handicapped in some way and had great fun together , but by the time i graduated , i wanted to move out into the wider world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " a lot of people do n't even notice my handicap anymore " do you get frustrated about your physical limitations when you see others performing simple tasks that you struggle with ? markus schlömann : i wish i could have been born otherwise .
i would have liked to play the guitar .
i would have liked to be a marine biologist or a forester .
i wish that i could hold my daughter 's hand when we walk down the street .
but this is my body and i have to live with its limitations . there are so many thalidomide adults who are much worse off than me .
i have a good , well-paying job .
i can walk , ride a bike and play soccer . some of my friends have physical limitations that make them unemployable .
many people i have known have died from their severe disabilities , others committed suicide .
i think i 've come to terms with my life . diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

on friday , nov .

dw-world.de spoke to a thalidomide survivor and his mother . in the autumn of 1960 , margret schlömann , now 75 , had trouble sleeping during her pregnancy and had taken an over-the-counter sedative called contergan , which was produced by the privately owned german drug maker grünenthal . what schlömann and thousands of other pregnant women did not know was that contergan 's active ingredient was thalidomide , a toxic substance that severely stunts the growth of a developing embryo 's limbs .
in june 1961 , her son markus was born without arms and thumbs and fingers that jutted out from each shoulder . today markus schlömann , 46 , is one of around 2,800 thalidomide survivors living in germany .
born in bonn , he works for a bank , is an avid world traveler and has a seven-year-old daughter , lena . his mother also lives in bonn and helps look after lena . dw-world.de : frau schlömann , what was it like for you after giving birth to markus ? margret schlömann : markus was my first child , so i did n't know what to expect .
he also came six weeks early .
pre-maturity was common for thalidomide babies .
after a normal hospital delivery , he was whisked away and put in an incubator .
i did n't get to see my son .
nobody congratulated me .
no one spoke to me . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : without arms , markus needed the help of a harness to balance my husband herbert had arrived , bringing flowers , but he was intercepted by the doctor before seeing me .
i knew something was wrong .
" is the baby dead ? "
i asked herbert .
he broke the news to me .
i was in shock , physically exhausted from the birth , and suddenly overwhelmed with grief . i saw markus four days later .
my maternal instincts took over , and i held him close .
there was another mother in the ward with her perfectly normal baby .
she saw markus there without any arms , and shrieked " what is that thing ? " you must have wondered what caused your child to be born without arms . margret schlömann : a tiny percentage of babies have always been born with birth defects , and i thought that mother nature singled markus out to be that one random statistic . what i did n't know at the time was that clinics all over west germany were seeing a sudden , drastic boom in the number of babies born without arms or legs or any limbs at all . i joined a thalidomide support group for parents .
it became clear that some outside factor must have been responsible for the limb deformities , but what ? was it radioactivity from nuclear testing ?
the shampoo i was using ? then in november 1961 , it came out in the newspapers .
it was contergan .
i was hysterical .
my doctor had urged me to take contergan .
in those days , you simply did n't challenge doctors or authority figures . i took maybe two tablets throughout the pregnancy , but i was too busy to dwell on my feelings of guilt , which surfaced in later years .
after markus , the twins -lsb- who were healthy -rsb- came 18 months later , and restored a sense of normality in our lives . how did people react to markus ? margret schlömann : some were voyeurs - they were either fascinated or repulsed by his armless torso .
one old woman made such a nasty remark , " how could you bring such a freak into this world , " she hollered .
others pitied him .
his appearance obviously made people feel squeamish or uncomfortable . when he was a small child , the neighborhood kids taunted him , but the worst insults were directed at another thalidomide boy , who had no limbs , only extremities .
the kids flapped their arms and chanted , " penguin , penguin , see that penguin , ha , ha . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : markus ' brother -lrb- right -rrb- is 18 months younger .
by 1963 , thalidomide was off the market markus , have attitudes toward the disabled changed in germany ? markus schlömann : yes , definitely .
in the past , families felt ashamed of their disabled relatives and hid them from view , so handicapped people were far more isolated in the 60s than they are today . germans have become much more open talking about disability now .
this is in part due to the aids / hiv revolution and greater awareness of the so-called diseases of civilization in the last decades , when those afflicted came out of the closet . a lot of people do n't even notice my handicap anymore .
one colleague said , " can you get that folder on the top shelf ? "
then they realize i do n't have the arms to reach for it . it 's only when lena was born and started going to school that my disability became an issue again .
lena 's schoolmates are not cruel and insensitive as kids in the 60s were , but they get on my nerves .
" why are your arms so short ? " they keep asking over and over , even when they know the answer . but kids are like that ... markus schlömann : yes , but they can ask me other questions .
i do n't want to be defined by my disability . mostly adults , on the other hand , try to be helpful towards me .
one guy offered to bag my groceries even though i am perfectly capable of doing it myself .
i tried to be gracious about it , although i have some thalidomide friends who feel offended , even hostile towards such well-meaning gestures . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : markus had attended a special needs school you 've also traveled quite a bit .
you 've taken a greyhound bus across america , you 've been to india seven times , and taken trips to latin america , vietnam , thailand , indonesia , fiji , australia .
how do reactions toward your disability differ in those places in comparison to germany ? markus schlömann : i have never had a negative experience .
i 've always been a communicative person , and people respond in kind .
someone might be impressed by the way i can lift a coffee cup , but i do n't know how to do it any other way . in thailand , where extended family structures are part of the culture , people are astounded that i have a regular banking job .
they ask me , " why does n't your family take care of you ? " in some countries though , the infrastructure for handicapped people is not great .
germany is much further along in that respect .
the increasing acceptance of disabled people here is reflected in how our special needs are addressed .
public buildings are equipped with wheelchair ramps and cars are specially designed for people like me to drive . but in german schools , the physically handicapped are not exactly mainstreamed into the system .
there 's the so-called special needs school , which you attended . markus schlömann : there was no alternative when i went to school in the 60s and 70s .
the advantage of a special school is that the entire curriculum is geared towards your needs .
in the afternoons we had gymnastic training to strengthen our back muscles for example . we were all physically handicapped in some way and had great fun together , but by the time i graduated , i wanted to move out into the wider world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " a lot of people do n't even notice my handicap anymore " do you get frustrated about your physical limitations when you see others performing simple tasks that you struggle with ? markus schlömann : i wish i could have been born otherwise .
i would have liked to play the guitar .
i would have liked to be a marine biologist or a forester .
i wish that i could hold my daughter 's hand when we walk down the street .
but this is my body and i have to live with its limitations . there are so many thalidomide adults who are much worse off than me .
i have a good , well-paying job .
i can walk , ride a bike and play soccer . some of my friends have physical limitations that make them unemployable .
many people i have known have died from their severe disabilities , others committed suicide .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de aviation -pipe- 12.11.2007 airbus overshadows boeing with multi-billion dollar order großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : emirates airlines will buy 70 a350 's as well as 11 a380 superjumbos from airbus aviation rivals airbus and boeing went head-to-head with each other at the dubai air show this weekend with both companies hoping to secure orders for their new models : the a380 superjumbo and the boeing dreamliner . the european company appears to have won the latest round in the heavyweight airline championship bout between the airbus a380 and the boeing dreamliner .
airbus announced over the weekend that the emirates airline had placed an order that will net airbus over $ 20 billion -lrb- 13.8 billion euros -rrb- . us manufacturer boeing was pushed into the background at the dubai air show on sunday , nov .
11 , when the dubai-owned carrier announced it would buy 11 a380 superjumbos plus 70 midsized a350 xwb -lrb- extra wide body -rrb- aircraft in what airbus executives called the biggest order in the european constructor 's history . the total value of the new firm orders for the 70 a350s and 11 a380s is 20.2 billion dollars , according to airbus . an upbeat airbus sales chief john leahy raised forecast sales of the a350 xwb to " more than 300 " by year 's end .
he had expected 200 orders at the start of the year . boeing , whose b787 dreamliner is the major competitor to the a350 , won a comparatively modest $ 3.2 billion order from emirates for 12 of its b777-300s , bringing the dubai airline 's total outlay for new planes to over $ 23 billion at the show . seattle-based boeing also said in a statement it had signed an agreement with qatar airways for 30 787 dreamliners and five 777 cargo planes in a deal valued at over $ 6.1 billion at list prices . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : enders was happy and proud of emirates ' faith in airbus but the lion 's share of new orders announced sunday went to airbus , a fact welcomed by the company 's ceo tom enders . " emirates airline is placing great faith in our a350 xwb and a380 programs as well as our company and we are rightfully proud , " he said . the latest orders mark a dramatic turnaround for airbus , which was overtaken by rival boeing in the race for new business in 2006 .
the european plane maker had made a spectacular plunge into the red last year and has been beset this year by plane production woes . trade union warns cutbacks may affect orders however , some caution was added to the euphoria on monday when a leading french trade union warned that planned job cuts and site sales at airbus could jeopardize the company 's ability to fill the new orders . " we see a paradox in the accumulation of new orders ... and management 's implementation of power8 , with its job cuts and site sales , " jean-francois knepper , an organizer with force ouvriere -lrb- fo -rrb- , told reporters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus has committed to a plan of cuts and restructuring power8 is a sweeping - and contested - restructuring campaign launched by airbus last february in the face of costly production and delivery delays .
it calls notably for the elimination of 10,000 jobs over four years and the sale of certain production sites in order to achieve savings of 5 billion euros by 2010 . " how are we going to honor these -lsb- emirates -rsb- orders for the a350 when the plan to sell certain sites is not yet finalized ? "
knepper asked .
" time is passing and we are getting orders , but if our leaders do not reconsider the plan to sell sites under power8 , we will not be able to fill the orders on time . " with power8 , he added , " the company is temporarily de-stabilized at a time when we have to hold together . " emirates committing to long-term airbus orders as well as the 70 firm orders for the a350s - which are scheduled to come into service in 2013 - emirates chairman and chief executive sheikh ahmed bin saeed al-maktoum said the company had taken an option to buy a further 50 of the new-generation planes down the line .
he added that the airline had decided to order three more a380 superjumbos , and to firm up a previous option to buy a further eight . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first commercial a380 took off in singapore livery " the a350 xwb and a380 will play an important role in supporting emirates ' and dubai 's growth plans , " maktoum said .
" as the leading airline for the 21st century , it made sense for emirates to choose the a350 xwb - an aircraft designed with 21st century technologies . " the 70 firm orders - for 50 a350-900s and 20 a350-1000s - will make emirates the second biggest customer for the long-haul planes after qatar airways announced an order for 80 in june . the contract brings the number of a380s ordered by emirates to 58 , making it the world 's biggest customer for the superjumbo , which made its first commercial flight in the livery of singapore airlines last month . airbus also announced a $ 2-billion order from saudi business carrier nas for 20 airbus a320s , as well as an option to buy a further 18 of the short-haul planes . private superjumbo buyer revealed as saudi prince it was also revealed at the dubai air show that saudi billionaire prince alwaleed bin talal will be the first private buyer of an a380 superjumbo . the prospective buyer 's identity had been kept secret for months but was unveiled to coincide with the dubai air show . alwaleed , whose interests span kingdom holding to euro disney , hotels and banking , has ordered a vip version of the a380 dubbed the flying palace .
he already owns a boeing 747-400 , the newest type of the original jumbo jet currently in service . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

airbus announced over the weekend that the emirates airline had placed an order that will net airbus over $ 20 billion -lrb- 13.8 billion euros -rrb- . us manufacturer boeing was pushed into the background at the dubai air show on sunday , nov .
11 , when the dubai-owned carrier announced it would buy 11 a380 superjumbos plus 70 midsized a350 xwb -lrb- extra wide body -rrb- aircraft in what airbus executives called the biggest order in the european constructor 's history . the total value of the new firm orders for the 70 a350s and 11 a380s is 20.2 billion dollars , according to airbus . an upbeat airbus sales chief john leahy raised forecast sales of the a350 xwb to " more than 300 " by year 's end .
he had expected 200 orders at the start of the year . boeing , whose b787 dreamliner is the major competitor to the a350 , won a comparatively modest $ 3.2 billion order from emirates for 12 of its b777-300s , bringing the dubai airline 's total outlay for new planes to over $ 23 billion at the show . seattle-based boeing also said in a statement it had signed an agreement with qatar airways for 30 787 dreamliners and five 777 cargo planes in a deal valued at over $ 6.1 billion at list prices . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : enders was happy and proud of emirates ' faith in airbus but the lion 's share of new orders announced sunday went to airbus , a fact welcomed by the company 's ceo tom enders . " emirates airline is placing great faith in our a350 xwb and a380 programs as well as our company and we are rightfully proud , " he said . the latest orders mark a dramatic turnaround for airbus , which was overtaken by rival boeing in the race for new business in 2006 .
the european plane maker had made a spectacular plunge into the red last year and has been beset this year by plane production woes . trade union warns cutbacks may affect orders however , some caution was added to the euphoria on monday when a leading french trade union warned that planned job cuts and site sales at airbus could jeopardize the company 's ability to fill the new orders . " we see a paradox in the accumulation of new orders ... and management 's implementation of power8 , with its job cuts and site sales , " jean-francois knepper , an organizer with force ouvriere -lrb- fo -rrb- , told reporters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus has committed to a plan of cuts and restructuring power8 is a sweeping - and contested - restructuring campaign launched by airbus last february in the face of costly production and delivery delays .
it calls notably for the elimination of 10,000 jobs over four years and the sale of certain production sites in order to achieve savings of 5 billion euros by 2010 . " how are we going to honor these -lsb- emirates -rsb- orders for the a350 when the plan to sell certain sites is not yet finalized ? "
knepper asked .
" time is passing and we are getting orders , but if our leaders do not reconsider the plan to sell sites under power8 , we will not be able to fill the orders on time . " with power8 , he added , " the company is temporarily de-stabilized at a time when we have to hold together . " emirates committing to long-term airbus orders as well as the 70 firm orders for the a350s - which are scheduled to come into service in 2013 - emirates chairman and chief executive sheikh ahmed bin saeed al-maktoum said the company had taken an option to buy a further 50 of the new-generation planes down the line .
he added that the airline had decided to order three more a380 superjumbos , and to firm up a previous option to buy a further eight . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first commercial a380 took off in singapore livery " the a350 xwb and a380 will play an important role in supporting emirates ' and dubai 's growth plans , " maktoum said .
" as the leading airline for the 21st century , it made sense for emirates to choose the a350 xwb - an aircraft designed with 21st century technologies . " the 70 firm orders - for 50 a350-900s and 20 a350-1000s - will make emirates the second biggest customer for the long-haul planes after qatar airways announced an order for 80 in june . the contract brings the number of a380s ordered by emirates to 58 , making it the world 's biggest customer for the superjumbo , which made its first commercial flight in the livery of singapore airlines last month . airbus also announced a $ 2-billion order from saudi business carrier nas for 20 airbus a320s , as well as an option to buy a further 18 of the short-haul planes . private superjumbo buyer revealed as saudi prince it was also revealed at the dubai air show that saudi billionaire prince alwaleed bin talal will be the first private buyer of an a380 superjumbo . the prospective buyer 's identity had been kept secret for months but was unveiled to coincide with the dubai air show . alwaleed , whose interests span kingdom holding to euro disney , hotels and banking , has ordered a vip version of the a380 dubbed the flying palace .

" we see a paradox in the accumulation of new orders ... and management 's implementation of power8 , with its job cuts and site sales , " jean-francois knepper , an organizer with force ouvriere -lrb- fo -rrb- , told reporters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus has committed to a plan of cuts and restructuring power8 is a sweeping - and contested - restructuring campaign launched by airbus last february in the face of costly production and delivery delays .
it calls notably for the elimination of 10,000 jobs over four years and the sale of certain production sites in order to achieve savings of 5 billion euros by 2010 . " how are we going to honor these -lsb- emirates -rsb- orders for the a350 when the plan to sell certain sites is not yet finalized ? "
knepper asked .
" time is passing and we are getting orders , but if our leaders do not reconsider the plan to sell sites under power8 , we will not be able to fill the orders on time . " with power8 , he added , " the company is temporarily de-stabilized at a time when we have to hold together . " emirates committing to long-term airbus orders as well as the 70 firm orders for the a350s - which are scheduled to come into service in 2013 - emirates chairman and chief executive sheikh ahmed bin saeed al-maktoum said the company had taken an option to buy a further 50 of the new-generation planes down the line .
he added that the airline had decided to order three more a380 superjumbos , and to firm up a previous option to buy a further eight . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first commercial a380 took off in singapore livery " the a350 xwb and a380 will play an important role in supporting emirates ' and dubai 's growth plans , " maktoum said .
" as the leading airline for the 21st century , it made sense for emirates to choose the a350 xwb - an aircraft designed with 21st century technologies . " the 70 firm orders - for 50 a350-900s and 20 a350-1000s - will make emirates the second biggest customer for the long-haul planes after qatar airways announced an order for 80 in june . the contract brings the number of a380s ordered by emirates to 58 , making it the world 's biggest customer for the superjumbo , which made its first commercial flight in the livery of singapore airlines last month . airbus also announced a $ 2-billion order from saudi business carrier nas for 20 airbus a320s , as well as an option to buy a further 18 of the short-haul planes . private superjumbo buyer revealed as saudi prince it was also revealed at the dubai air show that saudi billionaire prince alwaleed bin talal will be the first private buyer of an a380 superjumbo . the prospective buyer 's identity had been kept secret for months but was unveiled to coincide with the dubai air show . alwaleed , whose interests span kingdom holding to euro disney , hotels and banking , has ordered a vip version of the a380 dubbed the flying palace .
he already owns a boeing 747-400 , the newest type of the original jumbo jet currently in service . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

five other serie a games were played .
authorities decided to cancel the late game between roma and cagliari , which was already considered at risk , but riots began outside the stadio olimpico where hooligans attacked city policemen , damaged cars and motorcycles and set fire to a police bus .

" painful day " for italian soccer " it is another very sad and painful day for all of italian soccer , " italian soccer federation president giancarlo abete said in a statement to the press .
" the first thought is of huge condolences for the family of gabriele sandri . "

a report last month said injuries at stadiums caused by fan violence had dropped 80 percent from last season , but abete has often said that soccer authorities can do little to stamp out trouble away from stadiums . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

officials cancelled one match , and met to discuss further measures against fan violence . a policeman , trying to break up a scuffle between soccer fans from opposing teams at a highway rest station near arezzo , killed one of the men when he fired warning shots into the air .
gabriele sandri , 26 , was a lazio fan heading for a game of the top italian league , serie a , in milan .
he died as a result of the gunshot wounds on the morning of sunday , nov .
11 , when an officer tried to stop a clash between fans of lazio and juventus , who appeared to have met by chance at the rest station .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gabriele sandri : killed in a soccer-related scuffle rioting then broke out in bergamo and rome , where fans attacked a police barracks , as well as the olympic stadium and the headquarters of the italian olympic committee next door .
one game cancellation inter milan-lazio was the only game cancelled sunday afternoon , but at an atalanta-ac milan match in bergamo , hooligans caused the game to be abandoned after they tried to destroy a glass barrier in order to stampede the pitch .
five other serie a games were played .
authorities decided to cancel the late game between roma and cagliari , which was already considered at risk , but riots began outside the stadio olimpico where hooligans attacked city policemen , damaged cars and motorcycles and set fire to a police bus .
later in the night , nearby police offices and the headquarters of the italian olympic committee were attacked by hundreds of people .
bildunterschrift : rioting broke out in downtown rome ansa news agency reported that nine policemen , three photographers and dozens of hooligans were injured in rome .
" now i have destroyed two families . "
police and the government , desperate to stem any further violence , are set to hold talks to clear up how the officer made such a " tragic error . "
the officer under investigation for firing the fatal shot , identified only as luigi s. , could not believe he had hit the victim .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lazio match on sunday was cancelled , but earlier they played werder bremen " i did n't point it at anything , i did n't aim at anybody , " he told corriere della sera daily .
" the first shot i fired into the air and the second left me while i was running . … now i have destroyed two families , the man 's and mine . "
sunday 's violence mirrored riots outside a catania match in sicily in february , where a policeman was killed .
that incident led to strict new security measures at soccer stadiums , but authorities may have to look again at the rules amid calls to ban away fans from all grounds in future .
" painful day " for italian soccer " it is another very sad and painful day for all of italian soccer , " italian soccer federation president giancarlo abete said in a statement to the press .
" the first thought is of huge condolences for the family of gabriele sandri . "
abete said he had convened a meeting for late monday with his board as well as representatives of the league , and player and coach associations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amato said the killing was a " tragic error " they will discuss what to do about the cancelled inter milan vs. lazio and as roma vs. cagliari matches , and whether to play the atalanta game or award the points to milan .
interior minister giuliano amato told news agencies the killing was " a tragic error , " but it happened in circumstances linked to the violence that permeates soccer , and " every week forces thousands of agents to patrol cities and roads to prevent that the worst happens . "
a report last month said injuries at stadiums caused by fan violence had dropped 80 percent from last season , but abete has often said that soccer authorities can do little to stamp out trouble away from stadiums . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 12.11.2007 opinion : europe and the us need each other großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : george bush received nicolas sarkozy in the white house and angela merkel at his texas ranch last week .
the meetings took different tones , but both show the gap is closing over the atlantic , said dw 's christina bergmann . the trans-atlantic ice age is over .
if anyone still needed proof that the us on one side , and france and germany on the other , want to start a new chapter in their respective bilateral relationships , then they got it this past week . the east german physicist , german chancellor angela merkel , and the son of a hungarian immigrant , french president nicolas sarkozy , each took different approaches to their meetings with us president george w. bush . in a speech to the us congress , sarkozy pointed out that the two countries had had a long history together prior to the disagreement over the iraq war .
he practically fell over himself with enthusiasm for the united states and left out the iraq topic altogether , just to be on the safe side .
he has to be careful , however , not to take former british prime minister tony blair 's place as the american president 's " poodle . "
after all , those who wish to have influence on someone must be able to look them in the eye . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel is cleverer .
she did n't accept the invitation to the ranch - and its accompanying presidential honor - until her relationship to bush had solidified and she had given him her opinion on numerous occasions .
the president has no problem with that .
he 's proven more than once that he sticks by those who he 's taken a liking to - in good times and bad . it 's not only merkel and sarkozy 's differing personalities and destinies that contribute to the closing of ranks .
everyone knows that bush 's days are numbered .
both sarkozy and merkel will most likely have to do deal with his successor and are interested in setting the course now . in his last year in office , the american president is trying to save what 's left to save .
he continually emphasizes that he does n't make decisions based on opinion polls and that conclusions are n't made until much later .
nevertheless , he does n't want to leave with nothing to show for his time in office . both sides have recognized that things do n't work without the other .
the us is and will remain the only superpower that has the resources and the will to get involved in crisis areas .
but without influential allies , it ca n't be successful .
simply writing off " old " europe , as former us defense minister donald rumsfeld did , does n't work .
still , the countries of " new " europe - with all due respect - have a long road ahead of them before they even remotely attain the political clout that germany and france have . europeans have recognized that they ca n't solve crises alone - from kosovo 's status and the conflict in the middle east to global climate change .
they need the united states .
even in the nuclear conflict with iran .
those who take the path of diplomacy are more successful when they have a nation on their side that , if all else fails , wo n't be afraid to send its soldiers to war . christina bergmann is a correspondent for deutsche welle in washington , dc -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

thalidomide babies developed abnormally short limbs - typically flipper-like fingers emerging from the shoulders .

the company 's owners are among the 30 wealthiest families in germany with a personal fortune estimated at about 3.3 billion euros according to manager magazin . widukind lenz , a hamburg pediatrician and geneticist , was one of the first to link thalidomide to the sudden surge in birth defects in the late 1950s and early 1960s .
he noticed that thalidomide babies were virtually non-existent in communist east germany , where contergan had not been approved for use . most cases in west germany west germany was hardest hit by thalidomide , with about half , or 5,000 , of all cases worldwide .
contergan was sold in almost 50 countries , but not in the united states , where the fda regulatory authorities refused to give it the green light . thalidomide was sold in canada , however , and it was fda newcomer frances kelsey , a canadian physician , who had resisted intense pressure to put thalidomide on the american market .

thalidomide babies developed abnormally short limbs - typically flipper-like fingers emerging from the shoulders .
other infants had eye and ear defects and no legs . a two-part tv film on public television , called " a single tablet " in german , dramatized one of the worst blunders by a drug company .
warner home video germany picked up the us rights to the film and released it as a double dvd under the new title " side effects " on friday , nov .
9 . thalidomide linked to birth defects bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thalidomide victims suffered varying degrees of deformity grünenthal , a private german drug company with an annual turnover of 800 million euros -lrb- $ 1.2 billion -rrb- , started selling thalidomide in october 1957 and only withdraw it as a sedative when findings linking it to birth defects were published by the german press in november 1961 .
the company 's owners are among the 30 wealthiest families in germany with a personal fortune estimated at about 3.3 billion euros according to manager magazin . widukind lenz , a hamburg pediatrician and geneticist , was one of the first to link thalidomide to the sudden surge in birth defects in the late 1950s and early 1960s .
he noticed that thalidomide babies were virtually non-existent in communist east germany , where contergan had not been approved for use . most cases in west germany west germany was hardest hit by thalidomide , with about half , or 5,000 , of all cases worldwide .
contergan was sold in almost 50 countries , but not in the united states , where the fda regulatory authorities refused to give it the green light . thalidomide was sold in canada , however , and it was fda newcomer frances kelsey , a canadian physician , who had resisted intense pressure to put thalidomide on the american market .
she was later decorated by president john f. kennedy in 1962 for her courage .
in 1970 , grünenthal paid a total of 100 million deutschmarks -lrb- $ 75 million , 51.1 million euros -rrb- in a settlement with germany 's thalidomide victims shortly after the civil settlement , the criminal trial of hermann wirtz , the company owner , and eight grünenthal executives was abandoned in december 1970 on the grounds that their guilt was impossible to establish . the german government had contributed a matching amount to the relief fund , which paid modest monthly sums to the survivors until it dried up 10 years ago .
since 1997 the government alone has continued to pay survivors up to 545 euros per month . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german victims are bitter about the 1970 settlement grünenthal is under no legal obligation to continue compensating the victims and has never issued an apology to thalidomide survivors or their families . higher compensation outside germany other countries , including canada , britain and sweden , had ensured more generous compensation .
now in their mid to late 40s , the survivors often suffer from arthritis and back problems resulting from a lifetime of awkward movement .
some of them are forced to retire early for health reasons and many live on social welfare . the two-part tv dramatization tells the story of a fictitious lawyer whose wife takes " just one tablet " of contergan , and gives birth to a daughter with no arms and only one leg . " what 's the matter ?
show me my baby , " says the mother , vera wegener , amid a ghastly silence in the delivery room .
" do n't worry , you can put it in an orphanage , " a doctor replies . another doctor calls the " deformed " daughter " horrible . " " in those days people did not speak of a ' disability , " ' adolf winkelmann of german public broadcaster wdr television told the german dpa news agency .
" the terms they used were pretty insensitive . " part one of the film had showed the lawyer gradually becoming convinced that contergan was responsible for his daughter 's condition .
the second part of the tv movie re-enacted the legal battle for compensating the victims . producers won legal battle to air tv film bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fda approved thalidomide to treat leprosy under strict regulations the film producers had spent 18 months in court with grünenthal executives and the real-life lawyer who led the compensation fight against the drug maker .
both the company and lawyer claimed they had been misrepresented by the film .
the dramatization was changed and now comes with disclaimers insisting that the characters do not represent actual people . several weeks ago , germany 's federal constitutional court struck down temporary injunctions aimed at keeping the tv film off the air .

thalidomide babies developed abnormally short limbs - typically flipper-like fingers emerging from the shoulders .
other infants had eye and ear defects and no legs . a two-part tv film on public television , called " a single tablet " in german , dramatized one of the worst blunders by a drug company .

the company 's owners are among the 30 wealthiest families in germany with a personal fortune estimated at about 3.3 billion euros according to manager magazin . widukind lenz , a hamburg pediatrician and geneticist , was one of the first to link thalidomide to the sudden surge in birth defects in the late 1950s and early 1960s .
he noticed that thalidomide babies were virtually non-existent in communist east germany , where contergan had not been approved for use . most cases in west germany west germany was hardest hit by thalidomide , with about half , or 5,000 , of all cases worldwide .
contergan was sold in almost 50 countries , but not in the united states , where the fda regulatory authorities refused to give it the green light . thalidomide was sold in canada , however , and it was fda newcomer frances kelsey , a canadian physician , who had resisted intense pressure to put thalidomide on the american market .

now in their mid to late 40s , the survivors often suffer from arthritis and back problems resulting from a lifetime of awkward movement .
some of them are forced to retire early for health reasons and many live on social welfare . the two-part tv dramatization tells the story of a fictitious lawyer whose wife takes " just one tablet " of contergan , and gives birth to a daughter with no arms and only one leg . " what 's the matter ?

" the terms they used were pretty insensitive . " part one of the film had showed the lawyer gradually becoming convinced that contergan was responsible for his daughter 's condition .

" targeted sanctions against individuals or specific groups are , in principle , preferable to general sanctions imposed on states .
general sanctions often have dire consequences for vulnerable population groups in the countries concerned , and generally not for their leadership , " marty said in a report released sunday , nov .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marty : the lists are " unworthy " of the eu and un 's " lofty goals " " the present system of blacklists flouts the fundamental principles which are the basis of human rights , " he said in the report , which is due to be presented to the strasbourg-based council of europe on monday .
the un security council first established a list of al-qaeda and taliban suspects in 1999 .

the united nations said its members must freeze the assets , and prevent the entry into their territories , of anyone on the lists .

these norms included giving suspects the right to appeal to an independent and impartial organization and the right to compensation in the case of any miscarriage of justice .
attacks on cia practices he said the council of europe 's 47 member states should make sure such guarantees were offered .
in the past , the swiss senator has attacked the us practice of " extraordinary rendition " of terror suspects and secret cia prisons in countries with little regard for human rights .
while blacklisting " may be a useful instrument in certain circumstances and , in any event , for a limited period of time , " marty said it is unacceptable that no clear procedure is foreseen for getting off the blacklist .
" if one adds to this picture the practice of abductions -lsb- " extraordinary renditions " -rsb- , secret detention centers and the trivialization of torture , this provides a worrying , devastating message : principles that are as fundamental as the rule of law and the protection of human rights are optional accessories applicable only in fair weather .

marty highlighted the case of the people 's mujahedeen of iran , which forms part of the national council of resistance of iran and is on an eu blacklist despite a european court ruling in 2006 saying it should be removed from the list .
" despite recent procedural improvements it remains almost impossible , in practice , to be removed from the blacklist - a situation that is illegal and unacceptable , " marty wrote .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marty : the lists are " unworthy " of the eu and un 's " lofty goals " " the present system of blacklists flouts the fundamental principles which are the basis of human rights , " he said in the report , which is due to be presented to the strasbourg-based council of europe on monday .
the un security council first established a list of al-qaeda and taliban suspects in 1999 .
it contains the names of 368 individuals and 124 entities .
the united nations said its members must freeze the assets , and prevent the entry into their territories , of anyone on the lists .
also , it must prevent the sale and transfer of arms to them .
the european union has set up its own blacklist .
marty said both organizations must respect " minimal norms of procedure and juridical safeguards " before imposing restrictions .
these norms included giving suspects the right to appeal to an independent and impartial organization and the right to compensation in the case of any miscarriage of justice .
attacks on cia practices he said the council of europe 's 47 member states should make sure such guarantees were offered .
in the past , the swiss senator has attacked the us practice of " extraordinary rendition " of terror suspects and secret cia prisons in countries with little regard for human rights .
while blacklisting " may be a useful instrument in certain circumstances and , in any event , for a limited period of time , " marty said it is unacceptable that no clear procedure is foreseen for getting off the blacklist .
" if one adds to this picture the practice of abductions -lsb- " extraordinary renditions " -rsb- , secret detention centers and the trivialization of torture , this provides a worrying , devastating message : principles that are as fundamental as the rule of law and the protection of human rights are optional accessories applicable only in fair weather . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the council of europe guarantee the rights of those blacklisted ?
marty highlighted the case of the people 's mujahedeen of iran , which forms part of the national council of resistance of iran and is on an eu blacklist despite a european court ruling in 2006 saying it should be removed from the list .
" despite recent procedural improvements it remains almost impossible , in practice , to be removed from the blacklist - a situation that is illegal and unacceptable , " marty wrote .
in another example , yussef nada , an italian businessman of egyptian origin living in switzerland for three decades , was placed on such a blacklist in 2001 on suspicion of having financed the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks .
his assets were seized and his freedom of movement was severely restricted .
he was not informed and was unable to appeal the decision , he has said .
six years later , the 78-year-old remains blacklisted despite law enforcement agencies in two countries " not finding a shred of evidence of any wrongdoing , " marty said . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

e.on and rival rwe have a particularly dominant position in the country . he also called on germany 's minister for economic affairs michael glos to extend the law against competitive restrictions , so that the cartel office could control the prices of the energy and gas groups more strictly . a ministry spokesperson said separating energy production and delivery would be reserved as the last possible option in dealing with energy companies .
the german finance ministry also does not have plans to break up german energy companies , ministry spokesman torsten albig told reporters . but opening up the market to competition , energy prices in germany could be reduced to by 10 percent to 15 percent , a target that the hesse minister said he was pursuing in his own state commission concerned about energy prices in germany these views are shared by those in the european commission who are concerned at the amount of market control exerted by the four german energy companies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kroes said that liberalization was needed in germany eu competition commissioner neelie kroes argued again over the weekend for liberalization measures , saying that " in germany , prices are higher than you might expect in a market that was fully competitive .

on friday , nov .
9 , " side effects " was also released in english .
dw-world.de spoke to a thalidomide survivor and his mother . in the autumn of 1960 , margret schlömann , now 75 , had trouble sleeping during her pregnancy and had taken an over-the-counter sedative called contergan , which was produced by the privately owned german drug maker grünenthal . what schlömann and thousands of other pregnant women did not know was that contergan 's active ingredient was thalidomide , a toxic substance that severely stunts the growth of a developing embryo 's limbs .
in june 1961 , her son markus was born without arms and thumbs and fingers that jutted out from each shoulder . today markus schlömann , 46 , is one of around 2,800 thalidomide survivors living in germany .
born in bonn , he works for a bank , is an avid world traveler and has a seven-year-old daughter , lena . his mother also lives in bonn and helps look after lena . dw-world.de : frau schlömann , what was it like for you after giving birth to markus ? margret schlömann : markus was my first child , so i did n't know what to expect .
he also came six weeks early .
pre-maturity was common for thalidomide babies .
after a normal hospital delivery , he was whisked away and put in an incubator .
i did n't get to see my son .
nobody congratulated me .
no one spoke to me . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : without arms , markus needed the help of a harness to balance my husband herbert had arrived , bringing flowers , but he was intercepted by the doctor before seeing me .
i knew something was wrong .
" is the baby dead ? "
i asked herbert .
he broke the news to me .
i was in shock , physically exhausted from the birth , and suddenly overwhelmed with grief . i saw markus four days later .
my maternal instincts took over , and i held him close .
there was another mother in the ward with her perfectly normal baby .
she saw markus there without any arms , and shrieked " what is that thing ? " you must have wondered what caused your child to be born without arms . margret schlömann : a tiny percentage of babies have always been born with birth defects , and i thought that mother nature singled markus out to be that one random statistic . what i did n't know at the time was that clinics all over west germany were seeing a sudden , drastic boom in the number of babies born without arms or legs or any limbs at all . i joined a thalidomide support group for parents .
it became clear that some outside factor must have been responsible for the limb deformities , but what ? was it radioactivity from nuclear testing ?
the shampoo i was using ? then in november 1961 , it came out in the newspapers .
it was contergan .
i was hysterical .
my doctor had urged me to take contergan .
in those days , you simply did n't challenge doctors or authority figures . i took maybe two tablets throughout the pregnancy , but i was too busy to dwell on my feelings of guilt , which surfaced in later years .
after markus , the twins -lsb- who were healthy -rsb- came 18 months later , and restored a sense of normality in our lives . how did people react to markus ? margret schlömann : some were voyeurs - they were either fascinated or repulsed by his armless torso .
one old woman made such a nasty remark , " how could you bring such a freak into this world , " she hollered .
others pitied him .
his appearance obviously made people feel squeamish or uncomfortable . when he was a small child , the neighborhood kids taunted him , but the worst insults were directed at another thalidomide boy , who had no limbs , only extremities .
the kids flapped their arms and chanted , " penguin , penguin , see that penguin , ha , ha . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : markus ' brother -lrb- right -rrb- is 18 months younger .
by 1963 , thalidomide was off the market markus , have attitudes toward the disabled changed in germany ? markus schlömann : yes , definitely .
in the past , families felt ashamed of their disabled relatives and hid them from view , so handicapped people were far more isolated in the 60s than they are today . germans have become much more open talking about disability now .
this is in part due to the aids / hiv revolution and greater awareness of the so-called diseases of civilization in the last decades , when those afflicted came out of the closet . a lot of people do n't even notice my handicap anymore .
one colleague said , " can you get that folder on the top shelf ? "
then they realize i do n't have the arms to reach for it . it 's only when lena was born and started going to school that my disability became an issue again .
lena 's schoolmates are not cruel and insensitive as kids in the 60s were , but they get on my nerves .
" why are your arms so short ? " they keep asking over and over , even when they know the answer . but kids are like that ... markus schlömann : yes , but they can ask me other questions .
i do n't want to be defined by my disability . mostly adults , on the other hand , try to be helpful towards me .
one guy offered to bag my groceries even though i am perfectly capable of doing it myself .
i tried to be gracious about it , although i have some thalidomide friends who feel offended , even hostile towards such well-meaning gestures . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : markus had attended a special needs school you 've also traveled quite a bit .
you 've taken a greyhound bus across america , you 've been to india seven times , and taken trips to latin america , vietnam , thailand , indonesia , fiji , australia .
how do reactions toward your disability differ in those places in comparison to germany ? markus schlömann : i have never had a negative experience .
i 've always been a communicative person , and people respond in kind .
someone might be impressed by the way i can lift a coffee cup , but i do n't know how to do it any other way . in thailand , where extended family structures are part of the culture , people are astounded that i have a regular banking job .
they ask me , " why does n't your family take care of you ? " in some countries though , the infrastructure for handicapped people is not great .
germany is much further along in that respect .
the increasing acceptance of disabled people here is reflected in how our special needs are addressed .
public buildings are equipped with wheelchair ramps and cars are specially designed for people like me to drive . but in german schools , the physically handicapped are not exactly mainstreamed into the system .
there 's the so-called special needs school , which you attended . markus schlömann : there was no alternative when i went to school in the 60s and 70s .
the advantage of a special school is that the entire curriculum is geared towards your needs .
in the afternoons we had gymnastic training to strengthen our back muscles for example . we were all physically handicapped in some way and had great fun together , but by the time i graduated , i wanted to move out into the wider world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " a lot of people do n't even notice my handicap anymore " do you get frustrated about your physical limitations when you see others performing simple tasks that you struggle with ? markus schlömann : i wish i could have been born otherwise .
i would have liked to play the guitar .
i would have liked to be a marine biologist or a forester .
i wish that i could hold my daughter 's hand when we walk down the street .
but this is my body and i have to live with its limitations . there are so many thalidomide adults who are much worse off than me .
i have a good , well-paying job .
i can walk , ride a bike and play soccer . some of my friends have physical limitations that make them unemployable .
many people i have known have died from their severe disabilities , others committed suicide .
i think i 've come to terms with my life . diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

on friday , nov .
9 , " side effects " was also released in english .
dw-world.de spoke to a thalidomide survivor and his mother . in the autumn of 1960 , margret schlömann , now 75 , had trouble sleeping during her pregnancy and had taken an over-the-counter sedative called contergan , which was produced by the privately owned german drug maker grünenthal . what schlömann and thousands of other pregnant women did not know was that contergan 's active ingredient was thalidomide , a toxic substance that severely stunts the growth of a developing embryo 's limbs .
in june 1961 , her son markus was born without arms and thumbs and fingers that jutted out from each shoulder . today markus schlömann , 46 , is one of around 2,800 thalidomide survivors living in germany .
born in bonn , he works for a bank , is an avid world traveler and has a seven-year-old daughter , lena . his mother also lives in bonn and helps look after lena . dw-world.de : frau schlömann , what was it like for you after giving birth to markus ? margret schlömann : markus was my first child , so i did n't know what to expect .
he also came six weeks early .
pre-maturity was common for thalidomide babies .
after a normal hospital delivery , he was whisked away and put in an incubator .
i did n't get to see my son .
nobody congratulated me .
no one spoke to me . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : without arms , markus needed the help of a harness to balance my husband herbert had arrived , bringing flowers , but he was intercepted by the doctor before seeing me .
i knew something was wrong .
" is the baby dead ? "
i asked herbert .
he broke the news to me .
i was in shock , physically exhausted from the birth , and suddenly overwhelmed with grief . i saw markus four days later .
my maternal instincts took over , and i held him close .
there was another mother in the ward with her perfectly normal baby .
she saw markus there without any arms , and shrieked " what is that thing ? " you must have wondered what caused your child to be born without arms . margret schlömann : a tiny percentage of babies have always been born with birth defects , and i thought that mother nature singled markus out to be that one random statistic . what i did n't know at the time was that clinics all over west germany were seeing a sudden , drastic boom in the number of babies born without arms or legs or any limbs at all . i joined a thalidomide support group for parents .
it became clear that some outside factor must have been responsible for the limb deformities , but what ? was it radioactivity from nuclear testing ?
the shampoo i was using ? then in november 1961 , it came out in the newspapers .
it was contergan .
i was hysterical .
my doctor had urged me to take contergan .
in those days , you simply did n't challenge doctors or authority figures . i took maybe two tablets throughout the pregnancy , but i was too busy to dwell on my feelings of guilt , which surfaced in later years .
after markus , the twins -lsb- who were healthy -rsb- came 18 months later , and restored a sense of normality in our lives . how did people react to markus ? margret schlömann : some were voyeurs - they were either fascinated or repulsed by his armless torso .
one old woman made such a nasty remark , " how could you bring such a freak into this world , " she hollered .
others pitied him .
his appearance obviously made people feel squeamish or uncomfortable . when he was a small child , the neighborhood kids taunted him , but the worst insults were directed at another thalidomide boy , who had no limbs , only extremities .
the kids flapped their arms and chanted , " penguin , penguin , see that penguin , ha , ha . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : markus ' brother -lrb- right -rrb- is 18 months younger .
by 1963 , thalidomide was off the market markus , have attitudes toward the disabled changed in germany ? markus schlömann : yes , definitely .
in the past , families felt ashamed of their disabled relatives and hid them from view , so handicapped people were far more isolated in the 60s than they are today . germans have become much more open talking about disability now .
this is in part due to the aids / hiv revolution and greater awareness of the so-called diseases of civilization in the last decades , when those afflicted came out of the closet . a lot of people do n't even notice my handicap anymore .
one colleague said , " can you get that folder on the top shelf ? "
then they realize i do n't have the arms to reach for it . it 's only when lena was born and started going to school that my disability became an issue again .
lena 's schoolmates are not cruel and insensitive as kids in the 60s were , but they get on my nerves .
" why are your arms so short ? " they keep asking over and over , even when they know the answer . but kids are like that ... markus schlömann : yes , but they can ask me other questions .
i do n't want to be defined by my disability . mostly adults , on the other hand , try to be helpful towards me .
one guy offered to bag my groceries even though i am perfectly capable of doing it myself .
i tried to be gracious about it , although i have some thalidomide friends who feel offended , even hostile towards such well-meaning gestures . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : markus had attended a special needs school you 've also traveled quite a bit .
you 've taken a greyhound bus across america , you 've been to india seven times , and taken trips to latin america , vietnam , thailand , indonesia , fiji , australia .
how do reactions toward your disability differ in those places in comparison to germany ? markus schlömann : i have never had a negative experience .
i 've always been a communicative person , and people respond in kind .
someone might be impressed by the way i can lift a coffee cup , but i do n't know how to do it any other way . in thailand , where extended family structures are part of the culture , people are astounded that i have a regular banking job .
they ask me , " why does n't your family take care of you ? " in some countries though , the infrastructure for handicapped people is not great .
germany is much further along in that respect .
the increasing acceptance of disabled people here is reflected in how our special needs are addressed .
public buildings are equipped with wheelchair ramps and cars are specially designed for people like me to drive . but in german schools , the physically handicapped are not exactly mainstreamed into the system .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 12.11.2007 living with germany 's biggest pharmaceutical disaster großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : markus with his sister : " this is my body and i have to live with its limitations " millions watched a controversial german tv film based on the thalidomide legacy last week .
on friday , nov .
9 , " side effects " was also released in english .
dw-world.de spoke to a thalidomide survivor and his mother . in the autumn of 1960 , margret schlömann , now 75 , had trouble sleeping during her pregnancy and had taken an over-the-counter sedative called contergan , which was produced by the privately owned german drug maker grünenthal . what schlömann and thousands of other pregnant women did not know was that contergan 's active ingredient was thalidomide , a toxic substance that severely stunts the growth of a developing embryo 's limbs .
in june 1961 , her son markus was born without arms and thumbs and fingers that jutted out from each shoulder . today markus schlömann , 46 , is one of around 2,800 thalidomide survivors living in germany .
born in bonn , he works for a bank , is an avid world traveler and has a seven-year-old daughter , lena . his mother also lives in bonn and helps look after lena . dw-world.de : frau schlömann , what was it like for you after giving birth to markus ? margret schlömann : markus was my first child , so i did n't know what to expect .
he also came six weeks early .
pre-maturity was common for thalidomide babies .
after a normal hospital delivery , he was whisked away and put in an incubator .
i did n't get to see my son .
nobody congratulated me .
no one spoke to me . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : without arms , markus needed the help of a harness to balance my husband herbert had arrived , bringing flowers , but he was intercepted by the doctor before seeing me .
i knew something was wrong .
" is the baby dead ? "
i asked herbert .
he broke the news to me .
i was in shock , physically exhausted from the birth , and suddenly overwhelmed with grief . i saw markus four days later .
my maternal instincts took over , and i held him close .
there was another mother in the ward with her perfectly normal baby .
she saw markus there without any arms , and shrieked " what is that thing ? " you must have wondered what caused your child to be born without arms . margret schlömann : a tiny percentage of babies have always been born with birth defects , and i thought that mother nature singled markus out to be that one random statistic . what i did n't know at the time was that clinics all over west germany were seeing a sudden , drastic boom in the number of babies born without arms or legs or any limbs at all . i joined a thalidomide support group for parents .
it became clear that some outside factor must have been responsible for the limb deformities , but what ? was it radioactivity from nuclear testing ?
the shampoo i was using ? then in november 1961 , it came out in the newspapers .
it was contergan .
i was hysterical .
my doctor had urged me to take contergan .
in those days , you simply did n't challenge doctors or authority figures . i took maybe two tablets throughout the pregnancy , but i was too busy to dwell on my feelings of guilt , which surfaced in later years .
after markus , the twins -lsb- who were healthy -rsb- came 18 months later , and restored a sense of normality in our lives . how did people react to markus ? margret schlömann : some were voyeurs - they were either fascinated or repulsed by his armless torso .
one old woman made such a nasty remark , " how could you bring such a freak into this world , " she hollered .
others pitied him .
his appearance obviously made people feel squeamish or uncomfortable . when he was a small child , the neighborhood kids taunted him , but the worst insults were directed at another thalidomide boy , who had no limbs , only extremities .
the kids flapped their arms and chanted , " penguin , penguin , see that penguin , ha , ha . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : markus ' brother -lrb- right -rrb- is 18 months younger .
by 1963 , thalidomide was off the market markus , have attitudes toward the disabled changed in germany ? markus schlömann : yes , definitely .
in the past , families felt ashamed of their disabled relatives and hid them from view , so handicapped people were far more isolated in the 60s than they are today . germans have become much more open talking about disability now .
this is in part due to the aids / hiv revolution and greater awareness of the so-called diseases of civilization in the last decades , when those afflicted came out of the closet . a lot of people do n't even notice my handicap anymore .
one colleague said , " can you get that folder on the top shelf ? "
then they realize i do n't have the arms to reach for it . it 's only when lena was born and started going to school that my disability became an issue again .
lena 's schoolmates are not cruel and insensitive as kids in the 60s were , but they get on my nerves .
" why are your arms so short ? " they keep asking over and over , even when they know the answer . but kids are like that ... markus schlömann : yes , but they can ask me other questions .
i do n't want to be defined by my disability . mostly adults , on the other hand , try to be helpful towards me .
one guy offered to bag my groceries even though i am perfectly capable of doing it myself .
i tried to be gracious about it , although i have some thalidomide friends who feel offended , even hostile towards such well-meaning gestures . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : markus had attended a special needs school you 've also traveled quite a bit .
you 've taken a greyhound bus across america , you 've been to india seven times , and taken trips to latin america , vietnam , thailand , indonesia , fiji , australia .
how do reactions toward your disability differ in those places in comparison to germany ? markus schlömann : i have never had a negative experience .
i 've always been a communicative person , and people respond in kind .
someone might be impressed by the way i can lift a coffee cup , but i do n't know how to do it any other way . in thailand , where extended family structures are part of the culture , people are astounded that i have a regular banking job .
they ask me , " why does n't your family take care of you ? " in some countries though , the infrastructure for handicapped people is not great .
germany is much further along in that respect .
the increasing acceptance of disabled people here is reflected in how our special needs are addressed .
public buildings are equipped with wheelchair ramps and cars are specially designed for people like me to drive . but in german schools , the physically handicapped are not exactly mainstreamed into the system .
there 's the so-called special needs school , which you attended . markus schlömann : there was no alternative when i went to school in the 60s and 70s .
the advantage of a special school is that the entire curriculum is geared towards your needs .
in the afternoons we had gymnastic training to strengthen our back muscles for example . we were all physically handicapped in some way and had great fun together , but by the time i graduated , i wanted to move out into the wider world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " a lot of people do n't even notice my handicap anymore " do you get frustrated about your physical limitations when you see others performing simple tasks that you struggle with ? markus schlömann : i wish i could have been born otherwise .
i would have liked to play the guitar .
i would have liked to be a marine biologist or a forester .
i wish that i could hold my daughter 's hand when we walk down the street .
but this is my body and i have to live with its limitations . there are so many thalidomide adults who are much worse off than me .
i have a good , well-paying job .

but when performed by two politicians , it could threaten civilization . just as models and hotel heiresses should never become actors ; neither should politicians become pop stars .
it is an unwritten rule that has kept the fragile state of the planet intact for many centuries .
when people who excel at what they do in one field , and paris hilton , decide that they would like to branch out , it can have a very damaging effect on the delicate balance of existence . of all those who think that adding a " slash " somewhere in the job title - " actor-slash-model , " " singer-slash-human rights campaigner " - is a good idea , politicians are among those who should receive the least encouragement . however , it seems that someone forgot to tell german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier and his french counterpart bernard kouchner to stick to diplomacy . in an act of ill-conceived detente , the two foreign ministers recorded a " rhythm and blues " song in berlin on monday , nov .
12 . unlikely soundtrack for romantic evenings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : things went from bad to worse when he played the steinmeier / kouchner song if that 's not enough to get true music fans on their knees praying for deafness , the song is about european integration and is expected to have the complete opposite effect of a barry white record by seriously adding to europe 's birth-rate crisis . " the two foreign ministers want to make their contribution to the debate but in a somewhat unconventional way , " german foreign ministry spokesman martin jäger told a news conference . in an effort to show that they 're " down with the kids , " steinmeier and kouchner slipped away from the franco-german summit held in the governmental quarter to record their ode to europe with a backing group of young people in berlin 's kreuzberg district , a heavily turkish section of the german capital . " no one has ever heard a french and german foreign minister singing together , " jäger added before the recording .
" on monday , this will happen . " unfortunately for almost everyone , this is n't the first time that politicians have revealed that their hearts belong to rock 'n'roll . bill blows , robert plucks , tony strums bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair 's " stairway to heaven " was a popular turn who can ever forget bill clinton 's shameless milking of his mediocre saxophone talent during campaign rallies ? and from the fringe is sure that robert mugabe 's double-bass skills would have attracted a much larger audience had the zimbabwean dictator not silenced the country 's music press along with everyone else . then there 's former british prime minister tony blair who was just plain old tony blair when he started playing guitar for his university rock band " ugly rumours . " unfortunately , his career in politics failed to dull the ex-labour party leader 's dream of making it big and he could never resist going through his repertoire of licks whenever an unsuspecting guitar was at hand .
even becoming the middle east quartet 's special envoy has failed to shake the stars from blair 's eyes . -lsb- ugly -rsb- rumours are rife that blair may be considering joining us president george w. bush and secretary of state condoleezza rice , a proficient pianist , in a performance at the upcoming middle east quartet 's meeting in annapolis this month . while the rumors suggest that no song has yet been chosen , it is believed that bush , blair and rice have vetoed a proposed reworking of pink floyd 's " get your filthy hands off my desert .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 12.11.2007 fictional thalidomide victim haunts germans after 50 years großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a single sedative was enough to cause severe birth defects after a protracted legal battle , producers of a drama about germany 's thalidomide disaster from 1958-1962 won the right to air their two-part film on prime time television . contergan , a sedative that contained thalidomide , caused severe birth defects in 10,000 children worldwide when it was introduced on the market 50 years ago . the drug was sold over-the-counter and was also used by mothers-to-be as a remedy for morning sickness , but had devastating consequences for the developing embryo .
thalidomide babies developed abnormally short limbs - typically flipper-like fingers emerging from the shoulders .
other infants had eye and ear defects and no legs . a two-part tv film on public television , called " a single tablet " in german , dramatized one of the worst blunders by a drug company .
warner home video germany picked up the us rights to the film and released it as a double dvd under the new title " side effects " on friday , nov .
9 . thalidomide linked to birth defects bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thalidomide victims suffered varying degrees of deformity grünenthal , a private german drug company with an annual turnover of 800 million euros -lrb- $ 1.2 billion -rrb- , started selling thalidomide in october 1957 and only withdraw it as a sedative when findings linking it to birth defects were published by the german press in november 1961 .
the company 's owners are among the 30 wealthiest families in germany with a personal fortune estimated at about 3.3 billion euros according to manager magazin . widukind lenz , a hamburg pediatrician and geneticist , was one of the first to link thalidomide to the sudden surge in birth defects in the late 1950s and early 1960s .
he noticed that thalidomide babies were virtually non-existent in communist east germany , where contergan had not been approved for use . most cases in west germany west germany was hardest hit by thalidomide , with about half , or 5,000 , of all cases worldwide .
contergan was sold in almost 50 countries , but not in the united states , where the fda regulatory authorities refused to give it the green light . thalidomide was sold in canada , however , and it was fda newcomer frances kelsey , a canadian physician , who had resisted intense pressure to put thalidomide on the american market .
she was later decorated by president john f. kennedy in 1962 for her courage .
in 1970 , grünenthal paid a total of 100 million deutschmarks -lrb- $ 75 million , 51.1 million euros -rrb- in a settlement with germany 's thalidomide victims shortly after the civil settlement , the criminal trial of hermann wirtz , the company owner , and eight grünenthal executives was abandoned in december 1970 on the grounds that their guilt was impossible to establish . the german government had contributed a matching amount to the relief fund , which paid modest monthly sums to the survivors until it dried up 10 years ago .
since 1997 the government alone has continued to pay survivors up to 545 euros per month . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german victims are bitter about the 1970 settlement grünenthal is under no legal obligation to continue compensating the victims and has never issued an apology to thalidomide survivors or their families . higher compensation outside germany other countries , including canada , britain and sweden , had ensured more generous compensation .
now in their mid to late 40s , the survivors often suffer from arthritis and back problems resulting from a lifetime of awkward movement .
some of them are forced to retire early for health reasons and many live on social welfare . the two-part tv dramatization tells the story of a fictitious lawyer whose wife takes " just one tablet " of contergan , and gives birth to a daughter with no arms and only one leg . " what 's the matter ?
show me my baby , " says the mother , vera wegener , amid a ghastly silence in the delivery room .
" do n't worry , you can put it in an orphanage , " a doctor replies . another doctor calls the " deformed " daughter " horrible . " " in those days people did not speak of a ' disability , " ' adolf winkelmann of german public broadcaster wdr television told the german dpa news agency .
" the terms they used were pretty insensitive . " part one of the film had showed the lawyer gradually becoming convinced that contergan was responsible for his daughter 's condition .
the second part of the tv movie re-enacted the legal battle for compensating the victims . producers won legal battle to air tv film bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fda approved thalidomide to treat leprosy under strict regulations the film producers had spent 18 months in court with grünenthal executives and the real-life lawyer who led the compensation fight against the drug maker .
both the company and lawyer claimed they had been misrepresented by the film .
the dramatization was changed and now comes with disclaimers insisting that the characters do not represent actual people . several weeks ago , germany 's federal constitutional court struck down temporary injunctions aimed at keeping the tv film off the air .
it was aired on prime time last week with each episode drawing about 7 million viewers . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but when performed by two politicians , it could threaten civilization . just as models and hotel heiresses should never become actors ; neither should politicians become pop stars .
it is an unwritten rule that has kept the fragile state of the planet intact for many centuries .
when people who excel at what they do in one field , and paris hilton , decide that they would like to branch out , it can have a very damaging effect on the delicate balance of existence . of all those who think that adding a " slash " somewhere in the job title - " actor-slash-model , " " singer-slash-human rights campaigner " - is a good idea , politicians are among those who should receive the least encouragement . however , it seems that someone forgot to tell german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier and his french counterpart bernard kouchner to stick to diplomacy . in an act of ill-conceived detente , the two foreign ministers recorded a " rhythm and blues " song in berlin on monday , nov .
12 . unlikely soundtrack for romantic evenings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : things went from bad to worse when he played the steinmeier / kouchner song if that 's not enough to get true music fans on their knees praying for deafness , the song is about european integration and is expected to have the complete opposite effect of a barry white record by seriously adding to europe 's birth-rate crisis . " the two foreign ministers want to make their contribution to the debate but in a somewhat unconventional way , " german foreign ministry spokesman martin jäger told a news conference . in an effort to show that they 're " down with the kids , " steinmeier and kouchner slipped away from the franco-german summit held in the governmental quarter to record their ode to europe with a backing group of young people in berlin 's kreuzberg district , a heavily turkish section of the german capital . " no one has ever heard a french and german foreign minister singing together , " jäger added before the recording .
" on monday , this will happen . " unfortunately for almost everyone , this is n't the first time that politicians have revealed that their hearts belong to rock 'n'roll . bill blows , robert plucks , tony strums bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair 's " stairway to heaven " was a popular turn who can ever forget bill clinton 's shameless milking of his mediocre saxophone talent during campaign rallies ? and from the fringe is sure that robert mugabe 's double-bass skills would have attracted a much larger audience had the zimbabwean dictator not silenced the country 's music press along with everyone else . then there 's former british prime minister tony blair who was just plain old tony blair when he started playing guitar for his university rock band " ugly rumours . " unfortunately , his career in politics failed to dull the ex-labour party leader 's dream of making it big and he could never resist going through his repertoire of licks whenever an unsuspecting guitar was at hand .
even becoming the middle east quartet 's special envoy has failed to shake the stars from blair 's eyes . -lsb- ugly -rsb- rumours are rife that blair may be considering joining us president george w. bush and secretary of state condoleezza rice , a proficient pianist , in a performance at the upcoming middle east quartet 's meeting in annapolis this month . while the rumors suggest that no song has yet been chosen , it is believed that bush , blair and rice have vetoed a proposed reworking of pink floyd 's " get your filthy hands off my desert .

" targeted sanctions against individuals or specific groups are , in principle , preferable to general sanctions imposed on states .
general sanctions often have dire consequences for vulnerable population groups in the countries concerned , and generally not for their leadership , " marty said in a report released sunday , nov .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marty : the lists are " unworthy " of the eu and un 's " lofty goals " " the present system of blacklists flouts the fundamental principles which are the basis of human rights , " he said in the report , which is due to be presented to the strasbourg-based council of europe on monday .
the un security council first established a list of al-qaeda and taliban suspects in 1999 .
it contains the names of 368 individuals and 124 entities .
the united nations said its members must freeze the assets , and prevent the entry into their territories , of anyone on the lists .
also , it must prevent the sale and transfer of arms to them .
the european union has set up its own blacklist .
marty said both organizations must respect " minimal norms of procedure and juridical safeguards " before imposing restrictions .
these norms included giving suspects the right to appeal to an independent and impartial organization and the right to compensation in the case of any miscarriage of justice .
attacks on cia practices he said the council of europe 's 47 member states should make sure such guarantees were offered .
in the past , the swiss senator has attacked the us practice of " extraordinary rendition " of terror suspects and secret cia prisons in countries with little regard for human rights .
while blacklisting " may be a useful instrument in certain circumstances and , in any event , for a limited period of time , " marty said it is unacceptable that no clear procedure is foreseen for getting off the blacklist .
" if one adds to this picture the practice of abductions -lsb- " extraordinary renditions " -rsb- , secret detention centers and the trivialization of torture , this provides a worrying , devastating message : principles that are as fundamental as the rule of law and the protection of human rights are optional accessories applicable only in fair weather .

marty highlighted the case of the people 's mujahedeen of iran , which forms part of the national council of resistance of iran and is on an eu blacklist despite a european court ruling in 2006 saying it should be removed from the list .
" despite recent procedural improvements it remains almost impossible , in practice , to be removed from the blacklist - a situation that is illegal and unacceptable , " marty wrote .

" targeted sanctions against individuals or specific groups are , in principle , preferable to general sanctions imposed on states .
general sanctions often have dire consequences for vulnerable population groups in the countries concerned , and generally not for their leadership , " marty said in a report released sunday , nov .
11 .
lost credibility but , marty said , individual suspects placed on the lists did not have the right to reply and found it virtually impossible to clear their names .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marty : the lists are " unworthy " of the eu and un 's " lofty goals " " the present system of blacklists flouts the fundamental principles which are the basis of human rights , " he said in the report , which is due to be presented to the strasbourg-based council of europe on monday .
the un security council first established a list of al-qaeda and taliban suspects in 1999 .
it contains the names of 368 individuals and 124 entities .
the united nations said its members must freeze the assets , and prevent the entry into their territories , of anyone on the lists .
also , it must prevent the sale and transfer of arms to them .
the european union has set up its own blacklist .
marty said both organizations must respect " minimal norms of procedure and juridical safeguards " before imposing restrictions .
these norms included giving suspects the right to appeal to an independent and impartial organization and the right to compensation in the case of any miscarriage of justice .
attacks on cia practices he said the council of europe 's 47 member states should make sure such guarantees were offered .
in the past , the swiss senator has attacked the us practice of " extraordinary rendition " of terror suspects and secret cia prisons in countries with little regard for human rights .
while blacklisting " may be a useful instrument in certain circumstances and , in any event , for a limited period of time , " marty said it is unacceptable that no clear procedure is foreseen for getting off the blacklist .
" if one adds to this picture the practice of abductions -lsb- " extraordinary renditions " -rsb- , secret detention centers and the trivialization of torture , this provides a worrying , devastating message : principles that are as fundamental as the rule of law and the protection of human rights are optional accessories applicable only in fair weather . "

marty highlighted the case of the people 's mujahedeen of iran , which forms part of the national council of resistance of iran and is on an eu blacklist despite a european court ruling in 2006 saying it should be removed from the list .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de aviation -pipe- 12.11.2007 airbus overshadows boeing with multi-billion dollar order großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : emirates airlines will buy 70 a350 's as well as 11 a380 superjumbos from airbus aviation rivals airbus and boeing went head-to-head with each other at the dubai air show this weekend with both companies hoping to secure orders for their new models : the a380 superjumbo and the boeing dreamliner . the european company appears to have won the latest round in the heavyweight airline championship bout between the airbus a380 and the boeing dreamliner .
airbus announced over the weekend that the emirates airline had placed an order that will net airbus over $ 20 billion -lrb- 13.8 billion euros -rrb- . us manufacturer boeing was pushed into the background at the dubai air show on sunday , nov .
11 , when the dubai-owned carrier announced it would buy 11 a380 superjumbos plus 70 midsized a350 xwb -lrb- extra wide body -rrb- aircraft in what airbus executives called the biggest order in the european constructor 's history . the total value of the new firm orders for the 70 a350s and 11 a380s is 20.2 billion dollars , according to airbus . an upbeat airbus sales chief john leahy raised forecast sales of the a350 xwb to " more than 300 " by year 's end .
he had expected 200 orders at the start of the year . boeing , whose b787 dreamliner is the major competitor to the a350 , won a comparatively modest $ 3.2 billion order from emirates for 12 of its b777-300s , bringing the dubai airline 's total outlay for new planes to over $ 23 billion at the show . seattle-based boeing also said in a statement it had signed an agreement with qatar airways for 30 787 dreamliners and five 777 cargo planes in a deal valued at over $ 6.1 billion at list prices . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : enders was happy and proud of emirates ' faith in airbus but the lion 's share of new orders announced sunday went to airbus , a fact welcomed by the company 's ceo tom enders . " emirates airline is placing great faith in our a350 xwb and a380 programs as well as our company and we are rightfully proud , " he said . the latest orders mark a dramatic turnaround for airbus , which was overtaken by rival boeing in the race for new business in 2006 .
the european plane maker had made a spectacular plunge into the red last year and has been beset this year by plane production woes . trade union warns cutbacks may affect orders however , some caution was added to the euphoria on monday when a leading french trade union warned that planned job cuts and site sales at airbus could jeopardize the company 's ability to fill the new orders . " we see a paradox in the accumulation of new orders ... and management 's implementation of power8 , with its job cuts and site sales , " jean-francois knepper , an organizer with force ouvriere -lrb- fo -rrb- , told reporters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus has committed to a plan of cuts and restructuring power8 is a sweeping - and contested - restructuring campaign launched by airbus last february in the face of costly production and delivery delays .
it calls notably for the elimination of 10,000 jobs over four years and the sale of certain production sites in order to achieve savings of 5 billion euros by 2010 . " how are we going to honor these -lsb- emirates -rsb- orders for the a350 when the plan to sell certain sites is not yet finalized ? "
knepper asked .
" time is passing and we are getting orders , but if our leaders do not reconsider the plan to sell sites under power8 , we will not be able to fill the orders on time . " with power8 , he added , " the company is temporarily de-stabilized at a time when we have to hold together . " emirates committing to long-term airbus orders as well as the 70 firm orders for the a350s - which are scheduled to come into service in 2013 - emirates chairman and chief executive sheikh ahmed bin saeed al-maktoum said the company had taken an option to buy a further 50 of the new-generation planes down the line .
he added that the airline had decided to order three more a380 superjumbos , and to firm up a previous option to buy a further eight . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first commercial a380 took off in singapore livery " the a350 xwb and a380 will play an important role in supporting emirates ' and dubai 's growth plans , " maktoum said .
" as the leading airline for the 21st century , it made sense for emirates to choose the a350 xwb - an aircraft designed with 21st century technologies . " the 70 firm orders - for 50 a350-900s and 20 a350-1000s - will make emirates the second biggest customer for the long-haul planes after qatar airways announced an order for 80 in june . the contract brings the number of a380s ordered by emirates to 58 , making it the world 's biggest customer for the superjumbo , which made its first commercial flight in the livery of singapore airlines last month . airbus also announced a $ 2-billion order from saudi business carrier nas for 20 airbus a320s , as well as an option to buy a further 18 of the short-haul planes . private superjumbo buyer revealed as saudi prince it was also revealed at the dubai air show that saudi billionaire prince alwaleed bin talal will be the first private buyer of an a380 superjumbo . the prospective buyer 's identity had been kept secret for months but was unveiled to coincide with the dubai air show . alwaleed , whose interests span kingdom holding to euro disney , hotels and banking , has ordered a vip version of the a380 dubbed the flying palace .

airbus announced over the weekend that the emirates airline had placed an order that will net airbus over $ 20 billion -lrb- 13.8 billion euros -rrb- . us manufacturer boeing was pushed into the background at the dubai air show on sunday , nov .
11 , when the dubai-owned carrier announced it would buy 11 a380 superjumbos plus 70 midsized a350 xwb -lrb- extra wide body -rrb- aircraft in what airbus executives called the biggest order in the european constructor 's history . the total value of the new firm orders for the 70 a350s and 11 a380s is 20.2 billion dollars , according to airbus . an upbeat airbus sales chief john leahy raised forecast sales of the a350 xwb to " more than 300 " by year 's end .
he had expected 200 orders at the start of the year . boeing , whose b787 dreamliner is the major competitor to the a350 , won a comparatively modest $ 3.2 billion order from emirates for 12 of its b777-300s , bringing the dubai airline 's total outlay for new planes to over $ 23 billion at the show . seattle-based boeing also said in a statement it had signed an agreement with qatar airways for 30 787 dreamliners and five 777 cargo planes in a deal valued at over $ 6.1 billion at list prices . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : enders was happy and proud of emirates ' faith in airbus but the lion 's share of new orders announced sunday went to airbus , a fact welcomed by the company 's ceo tom enders . " emirates airline is placing great faith in our a350 xwb and a380 programs as well as our company and we are rightfully proud , " he said . the latest orders mark a dramatic turnaround for airbus , which was overtaken by rival boeing in the race for new business in 2006 .
the european plane maker had made a spectacular plunge into the red last year and has been beset this year by plane production woes . trade union warns cutbacks may affect orders however , some caution was added to the euphoria on monday when a leading french trade union warned that planned job cuts and site sales at airbus could jeopardize the company 's ability to fill the new orders . " we see a paradox in the accumulation of new orders ... and management 's implementation of power8 , with its job cuts and site sales , " jean-francois knepper , an organizer with force ouvriere -lrb- fo -rrb- , told reporters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus has committed to a plan of cuts and restructuring power8 is a sweeping - and contested - restructuring campaign launched by airbus last february in the face of costly production and delivery delays .
it calls notably for the elimination of 10,000 jobs over four years and the sale of certain production sites in order to achieve savings of 5 billion euros by 2010 . " how are we going to honor these -lsb- emirates -rsb- orders for the a350 when the plan to sell certain sites is not yet finalized ? "
knepper asked .
" time is passing and we are getting orders , but if our leaders do not reconsider the plan to sell sites under power8 , we will not be able to fill the orders on time . " with power8 , he added , " the company is temporarily de-stabilized at a time when we have to hold together . " emirates committing to long-term airbus orders as well as the 70 firm orders for the a350s - which are scheduled to come into service in 2013 - emirates chairman and chief executive sheikh ahmed bin saeed al-maktoum said the company had taken an option to buy a further 50 of the new-generation planes down the line .
he added that the airline had decided to order three more a380 superjumbos , and to firm up a previous option to buy a further eight . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first commercial a380 took off in singapore livery " the a350 xwb and a380 will play an important role in supporting emirates ' and dubai 's growth plans , " maktoum said .
" as the leading airline for the 21st century , it made sense for emirates to choose the a350 xwb - an aircraft designed with 21st century technologies . " the 70 firm orders - for 50 a350-900s and 20 a350-1000s - will make emirates the second biggest customer for the long-haul planes after qatar airways announced an order for 80 in june . the contract brings the number of a380s ordered by emirates to 58 , making it the world 's biggest customer for the superjumbo , which made its first commercial flight in the livery of singapore airlines last month . airbus also announced a $ 2-billion order from saudi business carrier nas for 20 airbus a320s , as well as an option to buy a further 18 of the short-haul planes . private superjumbo buyer revealed as saudi prince it was also revealed at the dubai air show that saudi billionaire prince alwaleed bin talal will be the first private buyer of an a380 superjumbo . the prospective buyer 's identity had been kept secret for months but was unveiled to coincide with the dubai air show . alwaleed , whose interests span kingdom holding to euro disney , hotels and banking , has ordered a vip version of the a380 dubbed the flying palace .

" how are we going to honor these -lsb- emirates -rsb- orders for the a350 when the plan to sell certain sites is not yet finalized ? "
knepper asked .
" time is passing and we are getting orders , but if our leaders do not reconsider the plan to sell sites under power8 , we will not be able to fill the orders on time . " with power8 , he added , " the company is temporarily de-stabilized at a time when we have to hold together . " emirates committing to long-term airbus orders as well as the 70 firm orders for the a350s - which are scheduled to come into service in 2013 - emirates chairman and chief executive sheikh ahmed bin saeed al-maktoum said the company had taken an option to buy a further 50 of the new-generation planes down the line .
he added that the airline had decided to order three more a380 superjumbos , and to firm up a previous option to buy a further eight . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first commercial a380 took off in singapore livery " the a350 xwb and a380 will play an important role in supporting emirates ' and dubai 's growth plans , " maktoum said .
" as the leading airline for the 21st century , it made sense for emirates to choose the a350 xwb - an aircraft designed with 21st century technologies . " the 70 firm orders - for 50 a350-900s and 20 a350-1000s - will make emirates the second biggest customer for the long-haul planes after qatar airways announced an order for 80 in june . the contract brings the number of a380s ordered by emirates to 58 , making it the world 's biggest customer for the superjumbo , which made its first commercial flight in the livery of singapore airlines last month . airbus also announced a $ 2-billion order from saudi business carrier nas for 20 airbus a320s , as well as an option to buy a further 18 of the short-haul planes . private superjumbo buyer revealed as saudi prince it was also revealed at the dubai air show that saudi billionaire prince alwaleed bin talal will be the first private buyer of an a380 superjumbo . the prospective buyer 's identity had been kept secret for months but was unveiled to coincide with the dubai air show . alwaleed , whose interests span kingdom holding to euro disney , hotels and banking , has ordered a vip version of the a380 dubbed the flying palace .
he already owns a boeing 747-400 , the newest type of the original jumbo jet currently in service . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the meetings took different tones , but both show the gap is closing over the atlantic , said dw 's christina bergmann . the trans-atlantic ice age is over .
if anyone still needed proof that the us on one side , and france and germany on the other , want to start a new chapter in their respective bilateral relationships , then they got it this past week . the east german physicist , german chancellor angela merkel , and the son of a hungarian immigrant , french president nicolas sarkozy , each took different approaches to their meetings with us president george w. bush . in a speech to the us congress , sarkozy pointed out that the two countries had had a long history together prior to the disagreement over the iraq war .
he practically fell over himself with enthusiasm for the united states and left out the iraq topic altogether , just to be on the safe side .
he has to be careful , however , not to take former british prime minister tony blair 's place as the american president 's " poodle . "
after all , those who wish to have influence on someone must be able to look them in the eye . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel is cleverer .
she did n't accept the invitation to the ranch - and its accompanying presidential honor - until her relationship to bush had solidified and she had given him her opinion on numerous occasions .
the president has no problem with that .
he 's proven more than once that he sticks by those who he 's taken a liking to - in good times and bad . it 's not only merkel and sarkozy 's differing personalities and destinies that contribute to the closing of ranks .
everyone knows that bush 's days are numbered .
both sarkozy and merkel will most likely have to do deal with his successor and are interested in setting the course now . in his last year in office , the american president is trying to save what 's left to save .
he continually emphasizes that he does n't make decisions based on opinion polls and that conclusions are n't made until much later .
nevertheless , he does n't want to leave with nothing to show for his time in office . both sides have recognized that things do n't work without the other .
the us is and will remain the only superpower that has the resources and the will to get involved in crisis areas .

the meetings took different tones , but both show the gap is closing over the atlantic , said dw 's christina bergmann . the trans-atlantic ice age is over .
if anyone still needed proof that the us on one side , and france and germany on the other , want to start a new chapter in their respective bilateral relationships , then they got it this past week . the east german physicist , german chancellor angela merkel , and the son of a hungarian immigrant , french president nicolas sarkozy , each took different approaches to their meetings with us president george w. bush . in a speech to the us congress , sarkozy pointed out that the two countries had had a long history together prior to the disagreement over the iraq war .
he practically fell over himself with enthusiasm for the united states and left out the iraq topic altogether , just to be on the safe side .
he has to be careful , however , not to take former british prime minister tony blair 's place as the american president 's " poodle . "
after all , those who wish to have influence on someone must be able to look them in the eye . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel is cleverer .
she did n't accept the invitation to the ranch - and its accompanying presidential honor - until her relationship to bush had solidified and she had given him her opinion on numerous occasions .
the president has no problem with that .
he 's proven more than once that he sticks by those who he 's taken a liking to - in good times and bad . it 's not only merkel and sarkozy 's differing personalities and destinies that contribute to the closing of ranks .
everyone knows that bush 's days are numbered .
both sarkozy and merkel will most likely have to do deal with his successor and are interested in setting the course now . in his last year in office , the american president is trying to save what 's left to save .
he continually emphasizes that he does n't make decisions based on opinion polls and that conclusions are n't made until much later .
nevertheless , he does n't want to leave with nothing to show for his time in office . both sides have recognized that things do n't work without the other .
the us is and will remain the only superpower that has the resources and the will to get involved in crisis areas .
but without influential allies , it ca n't be successful .
simply writing off " old " europe , as former us defense minister donald rumsfeld did , does n't work .
still , the countries of " new " europe - with all due respect - have a long road ahead of them before they even remotely attain the political clout that germany and france have . europeans have recognized that they ca n't solve crises alone - from kosovo 's status and the conflict in the middle east to global climate change .
they need the united states .
even in the nuclear conflict with iran .
those who take the path of diplomacy are more successful when they have a nation on their side that , if all else fails , wo n't be afraid to send its soldiers to war . christina bergmann is a correspondent for deutsche welle in washington , dc -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 12.11.2007 fictional thalidomide victim haunts germans after 50 years großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a single sedative was enough to cause severe birth defects after a protracted legal battle , producers of a drama about germany 's thalidomide disaster from 1958-1962 won the right to air their two-part film on prime time television . contergan , a sedative that contained thalidomide , caused severe birth defects in 10,000 children worldwide when it was introduced on the market 50 years ago . the drug was sold over-the-counter and was also used by mothers-to-be as a remedy for morning sickness , but had devastating consequences for the developing embryo .
thalidomide babies developed abnormally short limbs - typically flipper-like fingers emerging from the shoulders .
other infants had eye and ear defects and no legs . a two-part tv film on public television , called " a single tablet " in german , dramatized one of the worst blunders by a drug company .
warner home video germany picked up the us rights to the film and released it as a double dvd under the new title " side effects " on friday , nov .
9 . thalidomide linked to birth defects bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thalidomide victims suffered varying degrees of deformity grünenthal , a private german drug company with an annual turnover of 800 million euros -lrb- $ 1.2 billion -rrb- , started selling thalidomide in october 1957 and only withdraw it as a sedative when findings linking it to birth defects were published by the german press in november 1961 .
the company 's owners are among the 30 wealthiest families in germany with a personal fortune estimated at about 3.3 billion euros according to manager magazin . widukind lenz , a hamburg pediatrician and geneticist , was one of the first to link thalidomide to the sudden surge in birth defects in the late 1950s and early 1960s .
he noticed that thalidomide babies were virtually non-existent in communist east germany , where contergan had not been approved for use . most cases in west germany west germany was hardest hit by thalidomide , with about half , or 5,000 , of all cases worldwide .
contergan was sold in almost 50 countries , but not in the united states , where the fda regulatory authorities refused to give it the green light . thalidomide was sold in canada , however , and it was fda newcomer frances kelsey , a canadian physician , who had resisted intense pressure to put thalidomide on the american market .
she was later decorated by president john f. kennedy in 1962 for her courage .
in 1970 , grünenthal paid a total of 100 million deutschmarks -lrb- $ 75 million , 51.1 million euros -rrb- in a settlement with germany 's thalidomide victims shortly after the civil settlement , the criminal trial of hermann wirtz , the company owner , and eight grünenthal executives was abandoned in december 1970 on the grounds that their guilt was impossible to establish . the german government had contributed a matching amount to the relief fund , which paid modest monthly sums to the survivors until it dried up 10 years ago .
since 1997 the government alone has continued to pay survivors up to 545 euros per month . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german victims are bitter about the 1970 settlement grünenthal is under no legal obligation to continue compensating the victims and has never issued an apology to thalidomide survivors or their families . higher compensation outside germany other countries , including canada , britain and sweden , had ensured more generous compensation .
now in their mid to late 40s , the survivors often suffer from arthritis and back problems resulting from a lifetime of awkward movement .
some of them are forced to retire early for health reasons and many live on social welfare . the two-part tv dramatization tells the story of a fictitious lawyer whose wife takes " just one tablet " of contergan , and gives birth to a daughter with no arms and only one leg . " what 's the matter ?
show me my baby , " says the mother , vera wegener , amid a ghastly silence in the delivery room .
" do n't worry , you can put it in an orphanage , " a doctor replies . another doctor calls the " deformed " daughter " horrible . " " in those days people did not speak of a ' disability , " ' adolf winkelmann of german public broadcaster wdr television told the german dpa news agency .
" the terms they used were pretty insensitive . " part one of the film had showed the lawyer gradually becoming convinced that contergan was responsible for his daughter 's condition .
the second part of the tv movie re-enacted the legal battle for compensating the victims . producers won legal battle to air tv film bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fda approved thalidomide to treat leprosy under strict regulations the film producers had spent 18 months in court with grünenthal executives and the real-life lawyer who led the compensation fight against the drug maker .
both the company and lawyer claimed they had been misrepresented by the film .
the dramatization was changed and now comes with disclaimers insisting that the characters do not represent actual people . several weeks ago , germany 's federal constitutional court struck down temporary injunctions aimed at keeping the tv film off the air .
it was aired on prime time last week with each episode drawing about 7 million viewers . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the company 's owners are among the 30 wealthiest families in germany with a personal fortune estimated at about 3.3 billion euros according to manager magazin . widukind lenz , a hamburg pediatrician and geneticist , was one of the first to link thalidomide to the sudden surge in birth defects in the late 1950s and early 1960s .
he noticed that thalidomide babies were virtually non-existent in communist east germany , where contergan had not been approved for use . most cases in west germany west germany was hardest hit by thalidomide , with about half , or 5,000 , of all cases worldwide .
contergan was sold in almost 50 countries , but not in the united states , where the fda regulatory authorities refused to give it the green light . thalidomide was sold in canada , however , and it was fda newcomer frances kelsey , a canadian physician , who had resisted intense pressure to put thalidomide on the american market .

now in their mid to late 40s , the survivors often suffer from arthritis and back problems resulting from a lifetime of awkward movement .
some of them are forced to retire early for health reasons and many live on social welfare . the two-part tv dramatization tells the story of a fictitious lawyer whose wife takes " just one tablet " of contergan , and gives birth to a daughter with no arms and only one leg . " what 's the matter ?
show me my baby , " says the mother , vera wegener , amid a ghastly silence in the delivery room .
" do n't worry , you can put it in an orphanage , " a doctor replies . another doctor calls the " deformed " daughter " horrible . " " in those days people did not speak of a ' disability , " ' adolf winkelmann of german public broadcaster wdr television told the german dpa news agency .
" the terms they used were pretty insensitive . " part one of the film had showed the lawyer gradually becoming convinced that contergan was responsible for his daughter 's condition .

" you are always talking about russia but the real threat is coming from the european commission , " the chief executive of german energy giant eon wulf bernotat told the financial times on monday , nov .
12 . many in europe have rung alarms over what they see as russian intentions to dominate the european energy sector through investments by groups such as the state-controlled gas monopoly gazprom . bernotat added , however , that he did not think commission plans to increase competition by breaking up big power groups through a process called unbundling would succeed because they were opposed by major eu members . " i am pretty sure unbundling is not coming , " he said .
" such processes in brussels take time especially if important member states such as france and germany are against it . " hesse minister joins calls for more competition meanwhile , the german state of hesse 's minister for economic affairs alois rhiel called for germany 's federal cartel office to have more power and to increase energy competition in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rwe and eon have the lion 's share rhiel called on the federal regulator to step up efforts to force the four big german energy groups - e.on , rwe , enbw and vattenfall - to put power stations up for sale in a bid to allow other companies into the sector .
together the four firms own over 75 percent of germany 's power stations .
e.on and rival rwe have a particularly dominant position in the country . he also called on germany 's minister for economic affairs michael glos to extend the law against competitive restrictions , so that the cartel office could control the prices of the energy and gas groups more strictly . a ministry spokesperson said separating energy production and delivery would be reserved as the last possible option in dealing with energy companies .
the german finance ministry also does not have plans to break up german energy companies , ministry spokesman torsten albig told reporters . but opening up the market to competition , energy prices in germany could be reduced to by 10 percent to 15 percent , a target that the hesse minister said he was pursuing in his own state commission concerned about energy prices in germany these views are shared by those in the european commission who are concerned at the amount of market control exerted by the four german energy companies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kroes said that liberalization was needed in germany eu competition commissioner neelie kroes argued again over the weekend for liberalization measures , saying that " in germany , prices are higher than you might expect in a market that was fully competitive . " the eu has started investigations into possible price fixing agreement between e.on and rwe . she added that the commission 's plan to break-up the two key activities of production and distribution was " indispensable " if consumers were to benefit from the lower prices for gas and electricity that an open market could provide . the german government has backed its big energy groups in the stand-off with eu officials , but berlin has said that position could change if power groups did not make a bigger effort to increase competition and transparency within their operations . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the meetings took different tones , but both show the gap is closing over the atlantic , said dw 's christina bergmann . the trans-atlantic ice age is over .
if anyone still needed proof that the us on one side , and france and germany on the other , want to start a new chapter in their respective bilateral relationships , then they got it this past week . the east german physicist , german chancellor angela merkel , and the son of a hungarian immigrant , french president nicolas sarkozy , each took different approaches to their meetings with us president george w. bush . in a speech to the us congress , sarkozy pointed out that the two countries had had a long history together prior to the disagreement over the iraq war .
he practically fell over himself with enthusiasm for the united states and left out the iraq topic altogether , just to be on the safe side .
he has to be careful , however , not to take former british prime minister tony blair 's place as the american president 's " poodle . "
after all , those who wish to have influence on someone must be able to look them in the eye . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel is cleverer .
she did n't accept the invitation to the ranch - and its accompanying presidential honor - until her relationship to bush had solidified and she had given him her opinion on numerous occasions .
the president has no problem with that .
he 's proven more than once that he sticks by those who he 's taken a liking to - in good times and bad . it 's not only merkel and sarkozy 's differing personalities and destinies that contribute to the closing of ranks .
everyone knows that bush 's days are numbered .
both sarkozy and merkel will most likely have to do deal with his successor and are interested in setting the course now . in his last year in office , the american president is trying to save what 's left to save .
he continually emphasizes that he does n't make decisions based on opinion polls and that conclusions are n't made until much later .
nevertheless , he does n't want to leave with nothing to show for his time in office . both sides have recognized that things do n't work without the other .
the us is and will remain the only superpower that has the resources and the will to get involved in crisis areas .
but without influential allies , it ca n't be successful .
simply writing off " old " europe , as former us defense minister donald rumsfeld did , does n't work .
still , the countries of " new " europe - with all due respect - have a long road ahead of them before they even remotely attain the political clout that germany and france have . europeans have recognized that they ca n't solve crises alone - from kosovo 's status and the conflict in the middle east to global climate change .
they need the united states .
even in the nuclear conflict with iran .
those who take the path of diplomacy are more successful when they have a nation on their side that , if all else fails , wo n't be afraid to send its soldiers to war . christina bergmann is a correspondent for deutsche welle in washington , dc -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but when performed by two politicians , it could threaten civilization . just as models and hotel heiresses should never become actors ; neither should politicians become pop stars .
it is an unwritten rule that has kept the fragile state of the planet intact for many centuries .
when people who excel at what they do in one field , and paris hilton , decide that they would like to branch out , it can have a very damaging effect on the delicate balance of existence . of all those who think that adding a " slash " somewhere in the job title - " actor-slash-model , " " singer-slash-human rights campaigner " - is a good idea , politicians are among those who should receive the least encouragement . however , it seems that someone forgot to tell german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier and his french counterpart bernard kouchner to stick to diplomacy . in an act of ill-conceived detente , the two foreign ministers recorded a " rhythm and blues " song in berlin on monday , nov .
12 . unlikely soundtrack for romantic evenings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : things went from bad to worse when he played the steinmeier / kouchner song if that 's not enough to get true music fans on their knees praying for deafness , the song is about european integration and is expected to have the complete opposite effect of a barry white record by seriously adding to europe 's birth-rate crisis . " the two foreign ministers want to make their contribution to the debate but in a somewhat unconventional way , " german foreign ministry spokesman martin jäger told a news conference . in an effort to show that they 're " down with the kids , " steinmeier and kouchner slipped away from the franco-german summit held in the governmental quarter to record their ode to europe with a backing group of young people in berlin 's kreuzberg district , a heavily turkish section of the german capital . " no one has ever heard a french and german foreign minister singing together , " jäger added before the recording .
" on monday , this will happen . " unfortunately for almost everyone , this is n't the first time that politicians have revealed that their hearts belong to rock 'n'roll . bill blows , robert plucks , tony strums bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair 's " stairway to heaven " was a popular turn who can ever forget bill clinton 's shameless milking of his mediocre saxophone talent during campaign rallies ? and from the fringe is sure that robert mugabe 's double-bass skills would have attracted a much larger audience had the zimbabwean dictator not silenced the country 's music press along with everyone else . then there 's former british prime minister tony blair who was just plain old tony blair when he started playing guitar for his university rock band " ugly rumours . " unfortunately , his career in politics failed to dull the ex-labour party leader 's dream of making it big and he could never resist going through his repertoire of licks whenever an unsuspecting guitar was at hand .
even becoming the middle east quartet 's special envoy has failed to shake the stars from blair 's eyes . -lsb- ugly -rsb- rumours are rife that blair may be considering joining us president george w. bush and secretary of state condoleezza rice , a proficient pianist , in a performance at the upcoming middle east quartet 's meeting in annapolis this month . while the rumors suggest that no song has yet been chosen , it is believed that bush , blair and rice have vetoed a proposed reworking of pink floyd 's " get your filthy hands off my desert .

the meetings took different tones , but both show the gap is closing over the atlantic , said dw 's christina bergmann . the trans-atlantic ice age is over .
if anyone still needed proof that the us on one side , and france and germany on the other , want to start a new chapter in their respective bilateral relationships , then they got it this past week . the east german physicist , german chancellor angela merkel , and the son of a hungarian immigrant , french president nicolas sarkozy , each took different approaches to their meetings with us president george w. bush . in a speech to the us congress , sarkozy pointed out that the two countries had had a long history together prior to the disagreement over the iraq war .
he practically fell over himself with enthusiasm for the united states and left out the iraq topic altogether , just to be on the safe side .
he has to be careful , however , not to take former british prime minister tony blair 's place as the american president 's " poodle . "
after all , those who wish to have influence on someone must be able to look them in the eye . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel is cleverer .
she did n't accept the invitation to the ranch - and its accompanying presidential honor - until her relationship to bush had solidified and she had given him her opinion on numerous occasions .
the president has no problem with that .
he 's proven more than once that he sticks by those who he 's taken a liking to - in good times and bad . it 's not only merkel and sarkozy 's differing personalities and destinies that contribute to the closing of ranks .
everyone knows that bush 's days are numbered .
both sarkozy and merkel will most likely have to do deal with his successor and are interested in setting the course now . in his last year in office , the american president is trying to save what 's left to save .
he continually emphasizes that he does n't make decisions based on opinion polls and that conclusions are n't made until much later .
nevertheless , he does n't want to leave with nothing to show for his time in office . both sides have recognized that things do n't work without the other .
the us is and will remain the only superpower that has the resources and the will to get involved in crisis areas .
but without influential allies , it ca n't be successful .
simply writing off " old " europe , as former us defense minister donald rumsfeld did , does n't work .
still , the countries of " new " europe - with all due respect - have a long road ahead of them before they even remotely attain the political clout that germany and france have . europeans have recognized that they ca n't solve crises alone - from kosovo 's status and the conflict in the middle east to global climate change .
they need the united states .
even in the nuclear conflict with iran .
those who take the path of diplomacy are more successful when they have a nation on their side that , if all else fails , wo n't be afraid to send its soldiers to war . christina bergmann is a correspondent for deutsche welle in washington , dc -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

sunday 's violence mirrored riots outside a catania match in sicily in february , where a policeman was killed .

" painful day " for italian soccer " it is another very sad and painful day for all of italian soccer , " italian soccer federation president giancarlo abete said in a statement to the press .

airbus announced over the weekend that the emirates airline had placed an order that will net airbus over $ 20 billion -lrb- 13.8 billion euros -rrb- . us manufacturer boeing was pushed into the background at the dubai air show on sunday , nov .
11 , when the dubai-owned carrier announced it would buy 11 a380 superjumbos plus 70 midsized a350 xwb -lrb- extra wide body -rrb- aircraft in what airbus executives called the biggest order in the european constructor 's history . the total value of the new firm orders for the 70 a350s and 11 a380s is 20.2 billion dollars , according to airbus . an upbeat airbus sales chief john leahy raised forecast sales of the a350 xwb to " more than 300 " by year 's end .
he had expected 200 orders at the start of the year . boeing , whose b787 dreamliner is the major competitor to the a350 , won a comparatively modest $ 3.2 billion order from emirates for 12 of its b777-300s , bringing the dubai airline 's total outlay for new planes to over $ 23 billion at the show . seattle-based boeing also said in a statement it had signed an agreement with qatar airways for 30 787 dreamliners and five 777 cargo planes in a deal valued at over $ 6.1 billion at list prices . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : enders was happy and proud of emirates ' faith in airbus but the lion 's share of new orders announced sunday went to airbus , a fact welcomed by the company 's ceo tom enders . " emirates airline is placing great faith in our a350 xwb and a380 programs as well as our company and we are rightfully proud , " he said . the latest orders mark a dramatic turnaround for airbus , which was overtaken by rival boeing in the race for new business in 2006 .
the european plane maker had made a spectacular plunge into the red last year and has been beset this year by plane production woes . trade union warns cutbacks may affect orders however , some caution was added to the euphoria on monday when a leading french trade union warned that planned job cuts and site sales at airbus could jeopardize the company 's ability to fill the new orders . " we see a paradox in the accumulation of new orders ... and management 's implementation of power8 , with its job cuts and site sales , " jean-francois knepper , an organizer with force ouvriere -lrb- fo -rrb- , told reporters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus has committed to a plan of cuts and restructuring power8 is a sweeping - and contested - restructuring campaign launched by airbus last february in the face of costly production and delivery delays .
it calls notably for the elimination of 10,000 jobs over four years and the sale of certain production sites in order to achieve savings of 5 billion euros by 2010 . " how are we going to honor these -lsb- emirates -rsb- orders for the a350 when the plan to sell certain sites is not yet finalized ? "
knepper asked .
" time is passing and we are getting orders , but if our leaders do not reconsider the plan to sell sites under power8 , we will not be able to fill the orders on time . " with power8 , he added , " the company is temporarily de-stabilized at a time when we have to hold together . " emirates committing to long-term airbus orders as well as the 70 firm orders for the a350s - which are scheduled to come into service in 2013 - emirates chairman and chief executive sheikh ahmed bin saeed al-maktoum said the company had taken an option to buy a further 50 of the new-generation planes down the line .
he added that the airline had decided to order three more a380 superjumbos , and to firm up a previous option to buy a further eight . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first commercial a380 took off in singapore livery " the a350 xwb and a380 will play an important role in supporting emirates ' and dubai 's growth plans , " maktoum said .
" as the leading airline for the 21st century , it made sense for emirates to choose the a350 xwb - an aircraft designed with 21st century technologies . " the 70 firm orders - for 50 a350-900s and 20 a350-1000s - will make emirates the second biggest customer for the long-haul planes after qatar airways announced an order for 80 in june . the contract brings the number of a380s ordered by emirates to 58 , making it the world 's biggest customer for the superjumbo , which made its first commercial flight in the livery of singapore airlines last month . airbus also announced a $ 2-billion order from saudi business carrier nas for 20 airbus a320s , as well as an option to buy a further 18 of the short-haul planes . private superjumbo buyer revealed as saudi prince it was also revealed at the dubai air show that saudi billionaire prince alwaleed bin talal will be the first private buyer of an a380 superjumbo . the prospective buyer 's identity had been kept secret for months but was unveiled to coincide with the dubai air show . alwaleed , whose interests span kingdom holding to euro disney , hotels and banking , has ordered a vip version of the a380 dubbed the flying palace .

airbus announced over the weekend that the emirates airline had placed an order that will net airbus over $ 20 billion -lrb- 13.8 billion euros -rrb- . us manufacturer boeing was pushed into the background at the dubai air show on sunday , nov .
11 , when the dubai-owned carrier announced it would buy 11 a380 superjumbos plus 70 midsized a350 xwb -lrb- extra wide body -rrb- aircraft in what airbus executives called the biggest order in the european constructor 's history . the total value of the new firm orders for the 70 a350s and 11 a380s is 20.2 billion dollars , according to airbus . an upbeat airbus sales chief john leahy raised forecast sales of the a350 xwb to " more than 300 " by year 's end .
he had expected 200 orders at the start of the year . boeing , whose b787 dreamliner is the major competitor to the a350 , won a comparatively modest $ 3.2 billion order from emirates for 12 of its b777-300s , bringing the dubai airline 's total outlay for new planes to over $ 23 billion at the show . seattle-based boeing also said in a statement it had signed an agreement with qatar airways for 30 787 dreamliners and five 777 cargo planes in a deal valued at over $ 6.1 billion at list prices . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : enders was happy and proud of emirates ' faith in airbus but the lion 's share of new orders announced sunday went to airbus , a fact welcomed by the company 's ceo tom enders . " emirates airline is placing great faith in our a350 xwb and a380 programs as well as our company and we are rightfully proud , " he said . the latest orders mark a dramatic turnaround for airbus , which was overtaken by rival boeing in the race for new business in 2006 .
the european plane maker had made a spectacular plunge into the red last year and has been beset this year by plane production woes . trade union warns cutbacks may affect orders however , some caution was added to the euphoria on monday when a leading french trade union warned that planned job cuts and site sales at airbus could jeopardize the company 's ability to fill the new orders . " we see a paradox in the accumulation of new orders ... and management 's implementation of power8 , with its job cuts and site sales , " jean-francois knepper , an organizer with force ouvriere -lrb- fo -rrb- , told reporters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus has committed to a plan of cuts and restructuring power8 is a sweeping - and contested - restructuring campaign launched by airbus last february in the face of costly production and delivery delays .
it calls notably for the elimination of 10,000 jobs over four years and the sale of certain production sites in order to achieve savings of 5 billion euros by 2010 . " how are we going to honor these -lsb- emirates -rsb- orders for the a350 when the plan to sell certain sites is not yet finalized ? "
knepper asked .
" time is passing and we are getting orders , but if our leaders do not reconsider the plan to sell sites under power8 , we will not be able to fill the orders on time . " with power8 , he added , " the company is temporarily de-stabilized at a time when we have to hold together .

thalidomide babies developed abnormally short limbs - typically flipper-like fingers emerging from the shoulders .
other infants had eye and ear defects and no legs . a two-part tv film on public television , called " a single tablet " in german , dramatized one of the worst blunders by a drug company .
warner home video germany picked up the us rights to the film and released it as a double dvd under the new title " side effects " on friday , nov .
9 . thalidomide linked to birth defects bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thalidomide victims suffered varying degrees of deformity grünenthal , a private german drug company with an annual turnover of 800 million euros -lrb- $ 1.2 billion -rrb- , started selling thalidomide in october 1957 and only withdraw it as a sedative when findings linking it to birth defects were published by the german press in november 1961 .
the company 's owners are among the 30 wealthiest families in germany with a personal fortune estimated at about 3.3 billion euros according to manager magazin . widukind lenz , a hamburg pediatrician and geneticist , was one of the first to link thalidomide to the sudden surge in birth defects in the late 1950s and early 1960s .
he noticed that thalidomide babies were virtually non-existent in communist east germany , where contergan had not been approved for use . most cases in west germany west germany was hardest hit by thalidomide , with about half , or 5,000 , of all cases worldwide .
contergan was sold in almost 50 countries , but not in the united states , where the fda regulatory authorities refused to give it the green light . thalidomide was sold in canada , however , and it was fda newcomer frances kelsey , a canadian physician , who had resisted intense pressure to put thalidomide on the american market .
she was later decorated by president john f. kennedy in 1962 for her courage .
in 1970 , grünenthal paid a total of 100 million deutschmarks -lrb- $ 75 million , 51.1 million euros -rrb- in a settlement with germany 's thalidomide victims shortly after the civil settlement , the criminal trial of hermann wirtz , the company owner , and eight grünenthal executives was abandoned in december 1970 on the grounds that their guilt was impossible to establish . the german government had contributed a matching amount to the relief fund , which paid modest monthly sums to the survivors until it dried up 10 years ago .
since 1997 the government alone has continued to pay survivors up to 545 euros per month . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german victims are bitter about the 1970 settlement grünenthal is under no legal obligation to continue compensating the victims and has never issued an apology to thalidomide survivors or their families . higher compensation outside germany other countries , including canada , britain and sweden , had ensured more generous compensation .
now in their mid to late 40s , the survivors often suffer from arthritis and back problems resulting from a lifetime of awkward movement .
some of them are forced to retire early for health reasons and many live on social welfare . the two-part tv dramatization tells the story of a fictitious lawyer whose wife takes " just one tablet " of contergan , and gives birth to a daughter with no arms and only one leg . " what 's the matter ?
show me my baby , " says the mother , vera wegener , amid a ghastly silence in the delivery room .
" do n't worry , you can put it in an orphanage , " a doctor replies . another doctor calls the " deformed " daughter " horrible . " " in those days people did not speak of a ' disability , " ' adolf winkelmann of german public broadcaster wdr television told the german dpa news agency .
" the terms they used were pretty insensitive . " part one of the film had showed the lawyer gradually becoming convinced that contergan was responsible for his daughter 's condition .
the second part of the tv movie re-enacted the legal battle for compensating the victims . producers won legal battle to air tv film bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fda approved thalidomide to treat leprosy under strict regulations the film producers had spent 18 months in court with grünenthal executives and the real-life lawyer who led the compensation fight against the drug maker .
both the company and lawyer claimed they had been misrepresented by the film .
the dramatization was changed and now comes with disclaimers insisting that the characters do not represent actual people . several weeks ago , germany 's federal constitutional court struck down temporary injunctions aimed at keeping the tv film off the air .
it was aired on prime time last week with each episode drawing about 7 million viewers . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

on friday , nov .
9 , " side effects " was also released in english .
dw-world.de spoke to a thalidomide survivor and his mother . in the autumn of 1960 , margret schlömann , now 75 , had trouble sleeping during her pregnancy and had taken an over-the-counter sedative called contergan , which was produced by the privately owned german drug maker grünenthal . what schlömann and thousands of other pregnant women did not know was that contergan 's active ingredient was thalidomide , a toxic substance that severely stunts the growth of a developing embryo 's limbs .
in june 1961 , her son markus was born without arms and thumbs and fingers that jutted out from each shoulder . today markus schlömann , 46 , is one of around 2,800 thalidomide survivors living in germany .
born in bonn , he works for a bank , is an avid world traveler and has a seven-year-old daughter , lena . his mother also lives in bonn and helps look after lena . dw-world.de : frau schlömann , what was it like for you after giving birth to markus ? margret schlömann : markus was my first child , so i did n't know what to expect .
he also came six weeks early .
pre-maturity was common for thalidomide babies .
after a normal hospital delivery , he was whisked away and put in an incubator .
i did n't get to see my son .
nobody congratulated me .
no one spoke to me . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : without arms , markus needed the help of a harness to balance my husband herbert had arrived , bringing flowers , but he was intercepted by the doctor before seeing me .
i knew something was wrong .
" is the baby dead ? "
i asked herbert .
he broke the news to me .
i was in shock , physically exhausted from the birth , and suddenly overwhelmed with grief . i saw markus four days later .
my maternal instincts took over , and i held him close .
there was another mother in the ward with her perfectly normal baby .
she saw markus there without any arms , and shrieked " what is that thing ? " you must have wondered what caused your child to be born without arms . margret schlömann : a tiny percentage of babies have always been born with birth defects , and i thought that mother nature singled markus out to be that one random statistic . what i did n't know at the time was that clinics all over west germany were seeing a sudden , drastic boom in the number of babies born without arms or legs or any limbs at all . i joined a thalidomide support group for parents .
it became clear that some outside factor must have been responsible for the limb deformities , but what ? was it radioactivity from nuclear testing ?
the shampoo i was using ? then in november 1961 , it came out in the newspapers .
it was contergan .
i was hysterical .
my doctor had urged me to take contergan .
in those days , you simply did n't challenge doctors or authority figures . i took maybe two tablets throughout the pregnancy , but i was too busy to dwell on my feelings of guilt , which surfaced in later years .
after markus , the twins -lsb- who were healthy -rsb- came 18 months later , and restored a sense of normality in our lives . how did people react to markus ? margret schlömann : some were voyeurs - they were either fascinated or repulsed by his armless torso .
one old woman made such a nasty remark , " how could you bring such a freak into this world , " she hollered .
others pitied him .
his appearance obviously made people feel squeamish or uncomfortable . when he was a small child , the neighborhood kids taunted him , but the worst insults were directed at another thalidomide boy , who had no limbs , only extremities .
the kids flapped their arms and chanted , " penguin , penguin , see that penguin , ha , ha . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : markus ' brother -lrb- right -rrb- is 18 months younger .
by 1963 , thalidomide was off the market markus , have attitudes toward the disabled changed in germany ? markus schlömann : yes , definitely .
in the past , families felt ashamed of their disabled relatives and hid them from view , so handicapped people were far more isolated in the 60s than they are today . germans have become much more open talking about disability now .
this is in part due to the aids / hiv revolution and greater awareness of the so-called diseases of civilization in the last decades , when those afflicted came out of the closet . a lot of people do n't even notice my handicap anymore .
one colleague said , " can you get that folder on the top shelf ? "
then they realize i do n't have the arms to reach for it . it 's only when lena was born and started going to school that my disability became an issue again .
lena 's schoolmates are not cruel and insensitive as kids in the 60s were , but they get on my nerves .
" why are your arms so short ? " they keep asking over and over , even when they know the answer . but kids are like that ... markus schlömann : yes , but they can ask me other questions .
i do n't want to be defined by my disability . mostly adults , on the other hand , try to be helpful towards me .
one guy offered to bag my groceries even though i am perfectly capable of doing it myself .
i tried to be gracious about it , although i have some thalidomide friends who feel offended , even hostile towards such well-meaning gestures . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : markus had attended a special needs school you 've also traveled quite a bit .
you 've taken a greyhound bus across america , you 've been to india seven times , and taken trips to latin america , vietnam , thailand , indonesia , fiji , australia .
how do reactions toward your disability differ in those places in comparison to germany ? markus schlömann : i have never had a negative experience .
i 've always been a communicative person , and people respond in kind .
someone might be impressed by the way i can lift a coffee cup , but i do n't know how to do it any other way . in thailand , where extended family structures are part of the culture , people are astounded that i have a regular banking job .
they ask me , " why does n't your family take care of you ? " in some countries though , the infrastructure for handicapped people is not great .
germany is much further along in that respect .
the increasing acceptance of disabled people here is reflected in how our special needs are addressed .
public buildings are equipped with wheelchair ramps and cars are specially designed for people like me to drive . but in german schools , the physically handicapped are not exactly mainstreamed into the system .
there 's the so-called special needs school , which you attended . markus schlömann : there was no alternative when i went to school in the 60s and 70s .
the advantage of a special school is that the entire curriculum is geared towards your needs .
in the afternoons we had gymnastic training to strengthen our back muscles for example . we were all physically handicapped in some way and had great fun together , but by the time i graduated , i wanted to move out into the wider world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " a lot of people do n't even notice my handicap anymore " do you get frustrated about your physical limitations when you see others performing simple tasks that you struggle with ? markus schlömann : i wish i could have been born otherwise .
i would have liked to play the guitar .
i would have liked to be a marine biologist or a forester .
i wish that i could hold my daughter 's hand when we walk down the street .
but this is my body and i have to live with its limitations . there are so many thalidomide adults who are much worse off than me .
i have a good , well-paying job .
i can walk , ride a bike and play soccer . some of my friends have physical limitations that make them unemployable .
many people i have known have died from their severe disabilities , others committed suicide .
i think i 've come to terms with my life . diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-world.de spoke to a thalidomide survivor and his mother . in the autumn of 1960 , margret schlömann , now 75 , had trouble sleeping during her pregnancy and had taken an over-the-counter sedative called contergan , which was produced by the privately owned german drug maker grünenthal . what schlömann and thousands of other pregnant women did not know was that contergan 's active ingredient was thalidomide , a toxic substance that severely stunts the growth of a developing embryo 's limbs .
in june 1961 , her son markus was born without arms and thumbs and fingers that jutted out from each shoulder . today markus schlömann , 46 , is one of around 2,800 thalidomide survivors living in germany .
born in bonn , he works for a bank , is an avid world traveler and has a seven-year-old daughter , lena . his mother also lives in bonn and helps look after lena . dw-world.de : frau schlömann , what was it like for you after giving birth to markus ? margret schlömann : markus was my first child , so i did n't know what to expect .
he also came six weeks early .
pre-maturity was common for thalidomide babies .
after a normal hospital delivery , he was whisked away and put in an incubator .
i did n't get to see my son .
nobody congratulated me .
no one spoke to me . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : without arms , markus needed the help of a harness to balance my husband herbert had arrived , bringing flowers , but he was intercepted by the doctor before seeing me .
i knew something was wrong .
" is the baby dead ? "
i asked herbert .
he broke the news to me .
i was in shock , physically exhausted from the birth , and suddenly overwhelmed with grief . i saw markus four days later .
my maternal instincts took over , and i held him close .
there was another mother in the ward with her perfectly normal baby .
she saw markus there without any arms , and shrieked " what is that thing ? " you must have wondered what caused your child to be born without arms . margret schlömann : a tiny percentage of babies have always been born with birth defects , and i thought that mother nature singled markus out to be that one random statistic . what i did n't know at the time was that clinics all over west germany were seeing a sudden , drastic boom in the number of babies born without arms or legs or any limbs at all . i joined a thalidomide support group for parents .
it became clear that some outside factor must have been responsible for the limb deformities , but what ? was it radioactivity from nuclear testing ?
the shampoo i was using ? then in november 1961 , it came out in the newspapers .
it was contergan .
i was hysterical .
my doctor had urged me to take contergan .
in those days , you simply did n't challenge doctors or authority figures . i took maybe two tablets throughout the pregnancy , but i was too busy to dwell on my feelings of guilt , which surfaced in later years .
after markus , the twins -lsb- who were healthy -rsb- came 18 months later , and restored a sense of normality in our lives . how did people react to markus ? margret schlömann : some were voyeurs - they were either fascinated or repulsed by his armless torso .
one old woman made such a nasty remark , " how could you bring such a freak into this world , " she hollered .
others pitied him .
his appearance obviously made people feel squeamish or uncomfortable . when he was a small child , the neighborhood kids taunted him , but the worst insults were directed at another thalidomide boy , who had no limbs , only extremities .
the kids flapped their arms and chanted , " penguin , penguin , see that penguin , ha , ha . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : markus ' brother -lrb- right -rrb- is 18 months younger .
by 1963 , thalidomide was off the market markus , have attitudes toward the disabled changed in germany ? markus schlömann : yes , definitely .
in the past , families felt ashamed of their disabled relatives and hid them from view , so handicapped people were far more isolated in the 60s than they are today . germans have become much more open talking about disability now .
this is in part due to the aids / hiv revolution and greater awareness of the so-called diseases of civilization in the last decades , when those afflicted came out of the closet . a lot of people do n't even notice my handicap anymore .
one colleague said , " can you get that folder on the top shelf ? "
then they realize i do n't have the arms to reach for it . it 's only when lena was born and started going to school that my disability became an issue again .
lena 's schoolmates are not cruel and insensitive as kids in the 60s were , but they get on my nerves .
" why are your arms so short ? " they keep asking over and over , even when they know the answer . but kids are like that ... markus schlömann : yes , but they can ask me other questions .
i do n't want to be defined by my disability . mostly adults , on the other hand , try to be helpful towards me .
one guy offered to bag my groceries even though i am perfectly capable of doing it myself .
i tried to be gracious about it , although i have some thalidomide friends who feel offended , even hostile towards such well-meaning gestures . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : markus had attended a special needs school you 've also traveled quite a bit .
you 've taken a greyhound bus across america , you 've been to india seven times , and taken trips to latin america , vietnam , thailand , indonesia , fiji , australia .
how do reactions toward your disability differ in those places in comparison to germany ? markus schlömann : i have never had a negative experience .
i 've always been a communicative person , and people respond in kind .
someone might be impressed by the way i can lift a coffee cup , but i do n't know how to do it any other way . in thailand , where extended family structures are part of the culture , people are astounded that i have a regular banking job .
they ask me , " why does n't your family take care of you ? " in some countries though , the infrastructure for handicapped people is not great .
germany is much further along in that respect .
the increasing acceptance of disabled people here is reflected in how our special needs are addressed .
public buildings are equipped with wheelchair ramps and cars are specially designed for people like me to drive . but in german schools , the physically handicapped are not exactly mainstreamed into the system .
there 's the so-called special needs school , which you attended . markus schlömann : there was no alternative when i went to school in the 60s and 70s .
the advantage of a special school is that the entire curriculum is geared towards your needs .
in the afternoons we had gymnastic training to strengthen our back muscles for example . we were all physically handicapped in some way and had great fun together , but by the time i graduated , i wanted to move out into the wider world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " a lot of people do n't even notice my handicap anymore " do you get frustrated about your physical limitations when you see others performing simple tasks that you struggle with ? markus schlömann : i wish i could have been born otherwise .
i would have liked to play the guitar .
i would have liked to be a marine biologist or a forester .
i wish that i could hold my daughter 's hand when we walk down the street .
but this is my body and i have to live with its limitations . there are so many thalidomide adults who are much worse off than me .
i have a good , well-paying job .
i can walk , ride a bike and play soccer . some of my friends have physical limitations that make them unemployable .
many people i have known have died from their severe disabilities , others committed suicide .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 12.11.2007 living with germany 's biggest pharmaceutical disaster großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : markus with his sister : " this is my body and i have to live with its limitations " millions watched a controversial german tv film based on the thalidomide legacy last week .
on friday , nov .
9 , " side effects " was also released in english .
dw-world.de spoke to a thalidomide survivor and his mother . in the autumn of 1960 , margret schlömann , now 75 , had trouble sleeping during her pregnancy and had taken an over-the-counter sedative called contergan , which was produced by the privately owned german drug maker grünenthal . what schlömann and thousands of other pregnant women did not know was that contergan 's active ingredient was thalidomide , a toxic substance that severely stunts the growth of a developing embryo 's limbs .
in june 1961 , her son markus was born without arms and thumbs and fingers that jutted out from each shoulder . today markus schlömann , 46 , is one of around 2,800 thalidomide survivors living in germany .
born in bonn , he works for a bank , is an avid world traveler and has a seven-year-old daughter , lena . his mother also lives in bonn and helps look after lena . dw-world.de : frau schlömann , what was it like for you after giving birth to markus ? margret schlömann : markus was my first child , so i did n't know what to expect .
he also came six weeks early .
pre-maturity was common for thalidomide babies .
after a normal hospital delivery , he was whisked away and put in an incubator .
i did n't get to see my son .
nobody congratulated me .
no one spoke to me . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : without arms , markus needed the help of a harness to balance my husband herbert had arrived , bringing flowers , but he was intercepted by the doctor before seeing me .
i knew something was wrong .
" is the baby dead ? "
i asked herbert .
he broke the news to me .
i was in shock , physically exhausted from the birth , and suddenly overwhelmed with grief . i saw markus four days later .
my maternal instincts took over , and i held him close .
there was another mother in the ward with her perfectly normal baby .
she saw markus there without any arms , and shrieked " what is that thing ? " you must have wondered what caused your child to be born without arms . margret schlömann : a tiny percentage of babies have always been born with birth defects , and i thought that mother nature singled markus out to be that one random statistic . what i did n't know at the time was that clinics all over west germany were seeing a sudden , drastic boom in the number of babies born without arms or legs or any limbs at all . i joined a thalidomide support group for parents .
it became clear that some outside factor must have been responsible for the limb deformities , but what ? was it radioactivity from nuclear testing ?
the shampoo i was using ? then in november 1961 , it came out in the newspapers .
it was contergan .
i was hysterical .
my doctor had urged me to take contergan .
in those days , you simply did n't challenge doctors or authority figures . i took maybe two tablets throughout the pregnancy , but i was too busy to dwell on my feelings of guilt , which surfaced in later years .
after markus , the twins -lsb- who were healthy -rsb- came 18 months later , and restored a sense of normality in our lives . how did people react to markus ? margret schlömann : some were voyeurs - they were either fascinated or repulsed by his armless torso .
one old woman made such a nasty remark , " how could you bring such a freak into this world , " she hollered .
others pitied him .
his appearance obviously made people feel squeamish or uncomfortable . when he was a small child , the neighborhood kids taunted him , but the worst insults were directed at another thalidomide boy , who had no limbs , only extremities .
the kids flapped their arms and chanted , " penguin , penguin , see that penguin , ha , ha . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : markus ' brother -lrb- right -rrb- is 18 months younger .
by 1963 , thalidomide was off the market markus , have attitudes toward the disabled changed in germany ? markus schlömann : yes , definitely .
in the past , families felt ashamed of their disabled relatives and hid them from view , so handicapped people were far more isolated in the 60s than they are today . germans have become much more open talking about disability now .
this is in part due to the aids / hiv revolution and greater awareness of the so-called diseases of civilization in the last decades , when those afflicted came out of the closet . a lot of people do n't even notice my handicap anymore .
one colleague said , " can you get that folder on the top shelf ? "
then they realize i do n't have the arms to reach for it . it 's only when lena was born and started going to school that my disability became an issue again .
lena 's schoolmates are not cruel and insensitive as kids in the 60s were , but they get on my nerves .
" why are your arms so short ? " they keep asking over and over , even when they know the answer . but kids are like that ... markus schlömann : yes , but they can ask me other questions .
i do n't want to be defined by my disability . mostly adults , on the other hand , try to be helpful towards me .
one guy offered to bag my groceries even though i am perfectly capable of doing it myself .
i tried to be gracious about it , although i have some thalidomide friends who feel offended , even hostile towards such well-meaning gestures . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : markus had attended a special needs school you 've also traveled quite a bit .
you 've taken a greyhound bus across america , you 've been to india seven times , and taken trips to latin america , vietnam , thailand , indonesia , fiji , australia .
how do reactions toward your disability differ in those places in comparison to germany ? markus schlömann : i have never had a negative experience .
i 've always been a communicative person , and people respond in kind .
someone might be impressed by the way i can lift a coffee cup , but i do n't know how to do it any other way . in thailand , where extended family structures are part of the culture , people are astounded that i have a regular banking job .
they ask me , " why does n't your family take care of you ? " in some countries though , the infrastructure for handicapped people is not great .
germany is much further along in that respect .
the increasing acceptance of disabled people here is reflected in how our special needs are addressed .
public buildings are equipped with wheelchair ramps and cars are specially designed for people like me to drive . but in german schools , the physically handicapped are not exactly mainstreamed into the system .
there 's the so-called special needs school , which you attended . markus schlömann : there was no alternative when i went to school in the 60s and 70s .
the advantage of a special school is that the entire curriculum is geared towards your needs .
in the afternoons we had gymnastic training to strengthen our back muscles for example . we were all physically handicapped in some way and had great fun together , but by the time i graduated , i wanted to move out into the wider world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " a lot of people do n't even notice my handicap anymore " do you get frustrated about your physical limitations when you see others performing simple tasks that you struggle with ? markus schlömann : i wish i could have been born otherwise .
i would have liked to play the guitar .
i would have liked to be a marine biologist or a forester .
i wish that i could hold my daughter 's hand when we walk down the street .
but this is my body and i have to live with its limitations . there are so many thalidomide adults who are much worse off than me .
i have a good , well-paying job .
i can walk , ride a bike and play soccer . some of my friends have physical limitations that make them unemployable .
many people i have known have died from their severe disabilities , others committed suicide .
i think i 've come to terms with my life . diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but when performed by two politicians , it could threaten civilization . just as models and hotel heiresses should never become actors ; neither should politicians become pop stars .
it is an unwritten rule that has kept the fragile state of the planet intact for many centuries .
when people who excel at what they do in one field , and paris hilton , decide that they would like to branch out , it can have a very damaging effect on the delicate balance of existence . of all those who think that adding a " slash " somewhere in the job title - " actor-slash-model , " " singer-slash-human rights campaigner " - is a good idea , politicians are among those who should receive the least encouragement . however , it seems that someone forgot to tell german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier and his french counterpart bernard kouchner to stick to diplomacy . in an act of ill-conceived detente , the two foreign ministers recorded a " rhythm and blues " song in berlin on monday , nov .
12 . unlikely soundtrack for romantic evenings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : things went from bad to worse when he played the steinmeier / kouchner song if that 's not enough to get true music fans on their knees praying for deafness , the song is about european integration and is expected to have the complete opposite effect of a barry white record by seriously adding to europe 's birth-rate crisis . " the two foreign ministers want to make their contribution to the debate but in a somewhat unconventional way , " german foreign ministry spokesman martin jäger told a news conference . in an effort to show that they 're " down with the kids , " steinmeier and kouchner slipped away from the franco-german summit held in the governmental quarter to record their ode to europe with a backing group of young people in berlin 's kreuzberg district , a heavily turkish section of the german capital . " no one has ever heard a french and german foreign minister singing together , " jäger added before the recording .
" on monday , this will happen . " unfortunately for almost everyone , this is n't the first time that politicians have revealed that their hearts belong to rock 'n'roll . bill blows , robert plucks , tony strums bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair 's " stairway to heaven " was a popular turn who can ever forget bill clinton 's shameless milking of his mediocre saxophone talent during campaign rallies ? and from the fringe is sure that robert mugabe 's double-bass skills would have attracted a much larger audience had the zimbabwean dictator not silenced the country 's music press along with everyone else . then there 's former british prime minister tony blair who was just plain old tony blair when he started playing guitar for his university rock band " ugly rumours . " unfortunately , his career in politics failed to dull the ex-labour party leader 's dream of making it big and he could never resist going through his repertoire of licks whenever an unsuspecting guitar was at hand .
even becoming the middle east quartet 's special envoy has failed to shake the stars from blair 's eyes . -lsb- ugly -rsb- rumours are rife that blair may be considering joining us president george w. bush and secretary of state condoleezza rice , a proficient pianist , in a performance at the upcoming middle east quartet 's meeting in annapolis this month . while the rumors suggest that no song has yet been chosen , it is believed that bush , blair and rice have vetoed a proposed reworking of pink floyd 's " get your filthy hands off my desert .

" targeted sanctions against individuals or specific groups are , in principle , preferable to general sanctions imposed on states .
general sanctions often have dire consequences for vulnerable population groups in the countries concerned , and generally not for their leadership , " marty said in a report released sunday , nov .
11 .
lost credibility but , marty said , individual suspects placed on the lists did not have the right to reply and found it virtually impossible to clear their names .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marty : the lists are " unworthy " of the eu and un 's " lofty goals " " the present system of blacklists flouts the fundamental principles which are the basis of human rights , " he said in the report , which is due to be presented to the strasbourg-based council of europe on monday .
the un security council first established a list of al-qaeda and taliban suspects in 1999 .
it contains the names of 368 individuals and 124 entities .
the united nations said its members must freeze the assets , and prevent the entry into their territories , of anyone on the lists .
also , it must prevent the sale and transfer of arms to them .
the european union has set up its own blacklist .
marty said both organizations must respect " minimal norms of procedure and juridical safeguards " before imposing restrictions .
these norms included giving suspects the right to appeal to an independent and impartial organization and the right to compensation in the case of any miscarriage of justice .
attacks on cia practices he said the council of europe 's 47 member states should make sure such guarantees were offered .
in the past , the swiss senator has attacked the us practice of " extraordinary rendition " of terror suspects and secret cia prisons in countries with little regard for human rights .
while blacklisting " may be a useful instrument in certain circumstances and , in any event , for a limited period of time , " marty said it is unacceptable that no clear procedure is foreseen for getting off the blacklist .
" if one adds to this picture the practice of abductions -lsb- " extraordinary renditions " -rsb- , secret detention centers and the trivialization of torture , this provides a worrying , devastating message : principles that are as fundamental as the rule of law and the protection of human rights are optional accessories applicable only in fair weather . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the council of europe guarantee the rights of those blacklisted ?
marty highlighted the case of the people 's mujahedeen of iran , which forms part of the national council of resistance of iran and is on an eu blacklist despite a european court ruling in 2006 saying it should be removed from the list .
" despite recent procedural improvements it remains almost impossible , in practice , to be removed from the blacklist - a situation that is illegal and unacceptable , " marty wrote .
in another example , yussef nada , an italian businessman of egyptian origin living in switzerland for three decades , was placed on such a blacklist in 2001 on suspicion of having financed the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks .
his assets were seized and his freedom of movement was severely restricted .
he was not informed and was unable to appeal the decision , he has said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de from the fringe -pipe- 12.11.2007 music lovers flee as foreign ministers record ode to europe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : considering all the crises in the world , it 's no surprise that no one thought to stop these guys in the right hands , a song about europe could be a musical oddity - at best .
but when performed by two politicians , it could threaten civilization . just as models and hotel heiresses should never become actors ; neither should politicians become pop stars .
it is an unwritten rule that has kept the fragile state of the planet intact for many centuries .
when people who excel at what they do in one field , and paris hilton , decide that they would like to branch out , it can have a very damaging effect on the delicate balance of existence . of all those who think that adding a " slash " somewhere in the job title - " actor-slash-model , " " singer-slash-human rights campaigner " - is a good idea , politicians are among those who should receive the least encouragement . however , it seems that someone forgot to tell german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier and his french counterpart bernard kouchner to stick to diplomacy . in an act of ill-conceived detente , the two foreign ministers recorded a " rhythm and blues " song in berlin on monday , nov .
12 . unlikely soundtrack for romantic evenings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : things went from bad to worse when he played the steinmeier / kouchner song if that 's not enough to get true music fans on their knees praying for deafness , the song is about european integration and is expected to have the complete opposite effect of a barry white record by seriously adding to europe 's birth-rate crisis . " the two foreign ministers want to make their contribution to the debate but in a somewhat unconventional way , " german foreign ministry spokesman martin jäger told a news conference . in an effort to show that they 're " down with the kids , " steinmeier and kouchner slipped away from the franco-german summit held in the governmental quarter to record their ode to europe with a backing group of young people in berlin 's kreuzberg district , a heavily turkish section of the german capital . " no one has ever heard a french and german foreign minister singing together , " jäger added before the recording .
" on monday , this will happen . " unfortunately for almost everyone , this is n't the first time that politicians have revealed that their hearts belong to rock 'n'roll . bill blows , robert plucks , tony strums bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair 's " stairway to heaven " was a popular turn who can ever forget bill clinton 's shameless milking of his mediocre saxophone talent during campaign rallies ? and from the fringe is sure that robert mugabe 's double-bass skills would have attracted a much larger audience had the zimbabwean dictator not silenced the country 's music press along with everyone else . then there 's former british prime minister tony blair who was just plain old tony blair when he started playing guitar for his university rock band " ugly rumours . " unfortunately , his career in politics failed to dull the ex-labour party leader 's dream of making it big and he could never resist going through his repertoire of licks whenever an unsuspecting guitar was at hand .

since 1997 the government alone has continued to pay survivors up to 545 euros per month . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german victims are bitter about the 1970 settlement grünenthal is under no legal obligation to continue compensating the victims and has never issued an apology to thalidomide survivors or their families . higher compensation outside germany other countries , including canada , britain and sweden , had ensured more generous compensation .
now in their mid to late 40s , the survivors often suffer from arthritis and back problems resulting from a lifetime of awkward movement .
some of them are forced to retire early for health reasons and many live on social welfare . the two-part tv dramatization tells the story of a fictitious lawyer whose wife takes " just one tablet " of contergan , and gives birth to a daughter with no arms and only one leg . " what 's the matter ?
show me my baby , " says the mother , vera wegener , amid a ghastly silence in the delivery room .
" do n't worry , you can put it in an orphanage , " a doctor replies . another doctor calls the " deformed " daughter " horrible . " " in those days people did not speak of a ' disability , " ' adolf winkelmann of german public broadcaster wdr television told the german dpa news agency .
" the terms they used were pretty insensitive . " part one of the film had showed the lawyer gradually becoming convinced that contergan was responsible for his daughter 's condition .
the second part of the tv movie re-enacted the legal battle for compensating the victims . producers won legal battle to air tv film bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fda approved thalidomide to treat leprosy under strict regulations the film producers had spent 18 months in court with grünenthal executives and the real-life lawyer who led the compensation fight against the drug maker .
both the company and lawyer claimed they had been misrepresented by the film .
the dramatization was changed and now comes with disclaimers insisting that the characters do not represent actual people . several weeks ago , germany 's federal constitutional court struck down temporary injunctions aimed at keeping the tv film off the air .
it was aired on prime time last week with each episode drawing about 7 million viewers . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" targeted sanctions against individuals or specific groups are , in principle , preferable to general sanctions imposed on states .
general sanctions often have dire consequences for vulnerable population groups in the countries concerned , and generally not for their leadership , " marty said in a report released sunday , nov .
11 .
lost credibility but , marty said , individual suspects placed on the lists did not have the right to reply and found it virtually impossible to clear their names .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marty : the lists are " unworthy " of the eu and un 's " lofty goals " " the present system of blacklists flouts the fundamental principles which are the basis of human rights , " he said in the report , which is due to be presented to the strasbourg-based council of europe on monday .
the un security council first established a list of al-qaeda and taliban suspects in 1999 .
it contains the names of 368 individuals and 124 entities .
the united nations said its members must freeze the assets , and prevent the entry into their territories , of anyone on the lists .
also , it must prevent the sale and transfer of arms to them .
the european union has set up its own blacklist .
marty said both organizations must respect " minimal norms of procedure and juridical safeguards " before imposing restrictions .
these norms included giving suspects the right to appeal to an independent and impartial organization and the right to compensation in the case of any miscarriage of justice .
attacks on cia practices he said the council of europe 's 47 member states should make sure such guarantees were offered .
in the past , the swiss senator has attacked the us practice of " extraordinary rendition " of terror suspects and secret cia prisons in countries with little regard for human rights .
while blacklisting " may be a useful instrument in certain circumstances and , in any event , for a limited period of time , " marty said it is unacceptable that no clear procedure is foreseen for getting off the blacklist .
" if one adds to this picture the practice of abductions -lsb- " extraordinary renditions " -rsb- , secret detention centers and the trivialization of torture , this provides a worrying , devastating message : principles that are as fundamental as the rule of law and the protection of human rights are optional accessories applicable only in fair weather . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the council of europe guarantee the rights of those blacklisted ?
marty highlighted the case of the people 's mujahedeen of iran , which forms part of the national council of resistance of iran and is on an eu blacklist despite a european court ruling in 2006 saying it should be removed from the list .
" despite recent procedural improvements it remains almost impossible , in practice , to be removed from the blacklist - a situation that is illegal and unacceptable , " marty wrote .
in another example , yussef nada , an italian businessman of egyptian origin living in switzerland for three decades , was placed on such a blacklist in 2001 on suspicion of having financed the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks .
his assets were seized and his freedom of movement was severely restricted .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 12.11.2007 fictional thalidomide victim haunts germans after 50 years großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a single sedative was enough to cause severe birth defects after a protracted legal battle , producers of a drama about germany 's thalidomide disaster from 1958-1962 won the right to air their two-part film on prime time television . contergan , a sedative that contained thalidomide , caused severe birth defects in 10,000 children worldwide when it was introduced on the market 50 years ago . the drug was sold over-the-counter and was also used by mothers-to-be as a remedy for morning sickness , but had devastating consequences for the developing embryo .
thalidomide babies developed abnormally short limbs - typically flipper-like fingers emerging from the shoulders .
other infants had eye and ear defects and no legs . a two-part tv film on public television , called " a single tablet " in german , dramatized one of the worst blunders by a drug company .
warner home video germany picked up the us rights to the film and released it as a double dvd under the new title " side effects " on friday , nov .
9 . thalidomide linked to birth defects bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thalidomide victims suffered varying degrees of deformity grünenthal , a private german drug company with an annual turnover of 800 million euros -lrb- $ 1.2 billion -rrb- , started selling thalidomide in october 1957 and only withdraw it as a sedative when findings linking it to birth defects were published by the german press in november 1961 .
the company 's owners are among the 30 wealthiest families in germany with a personal fortune estimated at about 3.3 billion euros according to manager magazin . widukind lenz , a hamburg pediatrician and geneticist , was one of the first to link thalidomide to the sudden surge in birth defects in the late 1950s and early 1960s .
he noticed that thalidomide babies were virtually non-existent in communist east germany , where contergan had not been approved for use . most cases in west germany west germany was hardest hit by thalidomide , with about half , or 5,000 , of all cases worldwide .
contergan was sold in almost 50 countries , but not in the united states , where the fda regulatory authorities refused to give it the green light . thalidomide was sold in canada , however , and it was fda newcomer frances kelsey , a canadian physician , who had resisted intense pressure to put thalidomide on the american market .
she was later decorated by president john f. kennedy in 1962 for her courage .
in 1970 , grünenthal paid a total of 100 million deutschmarks -lrb- $ 75 million , 51.1 million euros -rrb- in a settlement with germany 's thalidomide victims shortly after the civil settlement , the criminal trial of hermann wirtz , the company owner , and eight grünenthal executives was abandoned in december 1970 on the grounds that their guilt was impossible to establish . the german government had contributed a matching amount to the relief fund , which paid modest monthly sums to the survivors until it dried up 10 years ago .
since 1997 the government alone has continued to pay survivors up to 545 euros per month . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german victims are bitter about the 1970 settlement grünenthal is under no legal obligation to continue compensating the victims and has never issued an apology to thalidomide survivors or their families . higher compensation outside germany other countries , including canada , britain and sweden , had ensured more generous compensation .
now in their mid to late 40s , the survivors often suffer from arthritis and back problems resulting from a lifetime of awkward movement .
some of them are forced to retire early for health reasons and many live on social welfare . the two-part tv dramatization tells the story of a fictitious lawyer whose wife takes " just one tablet " of contergan , and gives birth to a daughter with no arms and only one leg . " what 's the matter ?
show me my baby , " says the mother , vera wegener , amid a ghastly silence in the delivery room .
" do n't worry , you can put it in an orphanage , " a doctor replies . another doctor calls the " deformed " daughter " horrible . " " in those days people did not speak of a ' disability , " ' adolf winkelmann of german public broadcaster wdr television told the german dpa news agency .
" the terms they used were pretty insensitive . " part one of the film had showed the lawyer gradually becoming convinced that contergan was responsible for his daughter 's condition .
the second part of the tv movie re-enacted the legal battle for compensating the victims . producers won legal battle to air tv film bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fda approved thalidomide to treat leprosy under strict regulations the film producers had spent 18 months in court with grünenthal executives and the real-life lawyer who led the compensation fight against the drug maker .
both the company and lawyer claimed they had been misrepresented by the film .
the dramatization was changed and now comes with disclaimers insisting that the characters do not represent actual people . several weeks ago , germany 's federal constitutional court struck down temporary injunctions aimed at keeping the tv film off the air .
it was aired on prime time last week with each episode drawing about 7 million viewers . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the meetings took different tones , but both show the gap is closing over the atlantic , said dw 's christina bergmann . the trans-atlantic ice age is over .
if anyone still needed proof that the us on one side , and france and germany on the other , want to start a new chapter in their respective bilateral relationships , then they got it this past week . the east german physicist , german chancellor angela merkel , and the son of a hungarian immigrant , french president nicolas sarkozy , each took different approaches to their meetings with us president george w. bush . in a speech to the us congress , sarkozy pointed out that the two countries had had a long history together prior to the disagreement over the iraq war .
he practically fell over himself with enthusiasm for the united states and left out the iraq topic altogether , just to be on the safe side .
he has to be careful , however , not to take former british prime minister tony blair 's place as the american president 's " poodle . "
after all , those who wish to have influence on someone must be able to look them in the eye . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel is cleverer .
she did n't accept the invitation to the ranch - and its accompanying presidential honor - until her relationship to bush had solidified and she had given him her opinion on numerous occasions .
the president has no problem with that .
he 's proven more than once that he sticks by those who he 's taken a liking to - in good times and bad . it 's not only merkel and sarkozy 's differing personalities and destinies that contribute to the closing of ranks .
everyone knows that bush 's days are numbered .
both sarkozy and merkel will most likely have to do deal with his successor and are interested in setting the course now . in his last year in office , the american president is trying to save what 's left to save .
he continually emphasizes that he does n't make decisions based on opinion polls and that conclusions are n't made until much later .
nevertheless , he does n't want to leave with nothing to show for his time in office . both sides have recognized that things do n't work without the other .
the us is and will remain the only superpower that has the resources and the will to get involved in crisis areas .
but without influential allies , it ca n't be successful .
simply writing off " old " europe , as former us defense minister donald rumsfeld did , does n't work .
still , the countries of " new " europe - with all due respect - have a long road ahead of them before they even remotely attain the political clout that germany and france have . europeans have recognized that they ca n't solve crises alone - from kosovo 's status and the conflict in the middle east to global climate change .
they need the united states .
even in the nuclear conflict with iran .
those who take the path of diplomacy are more successful when they have a nation on their side that , if all else fails , wo n't be afraid to send its soldiers to war . christina bergmann is a correspondent for deutsche welle in washington , dc -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

airbus announced over the weekend that the emirates airline had placed an order that will net airbus over $ 20 billion -lrb- 13.8 billion euros -rrb- . us manufacturer boeing was pushed into the background at the dubai air show on sunday , nov .
11 , when the dubai-owned carrier announced it would buy 11 a380 superjumbos plus 70 midsized a350 xwb -lrb- extra wide body -rrb- aircraft in what airbus executives called the biggest order in the european constructor 's history . the total value of the new firm orders for the 70 a350s and 11 a380s is 20.2 billion dollars , according to airbus . an upbeat airbus sales chief john leahy raised forecast sales of the a350 xwb to " more than 300 " by year 's end .
he had expected 200 orders at the start of the year . boeing , whose b787 dreamliner is the major competitor to the a350 , won a comparatively modest $ 3.2 billion order from emirates for 12 of its b777-300s , bringing the dubai airline 's total outlay for new planes to over $ 23 billion at the show . seattle-based boeing also said in a statement it had signed an agreement with qatar airways for 30 787 dreamliners and five 777 cargo planes in a deal valued at over $ 6.1 billion at list prices . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : enders was happy and proud of emirates ' faith in airbus but the lion 's share of new orders announced sunday went to airbus , a fact welcomed by the company 's ceo tom enders . " emirates airline is placing great faith in our a350 xwb and a380 programs as well as our company and we are rightfully proud , " he said . the latest orders mark a dramatic turnaround for airbus , which was overtaken by rival boeing in the race for new business in 2006 .
the european plane maker had made a spectacular plunge into the red last year and has been beset this year by plane production woes . trade union warns cutbacks may affect orders however , some caution was added to the euphoria on monday when a leading french trade union warned that planned job cuts and site sales at airbus could jeopardize the company 's ability to fill the new orders . " we see a paradox in the accumulation of new orders ... and management 's implementation of power8 , with its job cuts and site sales , " jean-francois knepper , an organizer with force ouvriere -lrb- fo -rrb- , told reporters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus has committed to a plan of cuts and restructuring power8 is a sweeping - and contested - restructuring campaign launched by airbus last february in the face of costly production and delivery delays .
it calls notably for the elimination of 10,000 jobs over four years and the sale of certain production sites in order to achieve savings of 5 billion euros by 2010 . " how are we going to honor these -lsb- emirates -rsb- orders for the a350 when the plan to sell certain sites is not yet finalized ? "
knepper asked .
" time is passing and we are getting orders , but if our leaders do not reconsider the plan to sell sites under power8 , we will not be able to fill the orders on time . " with power8 , he added , " the company is temporarily de-stabilized at a time when we have to hold together . " emirates committing to long-term airbus orders as well as the 70 firm orders for the a350s - which are scheduled to come into service in 2013 - emirates chairman and chief executive sheikh ahmed bin saeed al-maktoum said the company had taken an option to buy a further 50 of the new-generation planes down the line .
he added that the airline had decided to order three more a380 superjumbos , and to firm up a previous option to buy a further eight . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first commercial a380 took off in singapore livery " the a350 xwb and a380 will play an important role in supporting emirates ' and dubai 's growth plans , " maktoum said .
" as the leading airline for the 21st century , it made sense for emirates to choose the a350 xwb - an aircraft designed with 21st century technologies . " the 70 firm orders - for 50 a350-900s and 20 a350-1000s - will make emirates the second biggest customer for the long-haul planes after qatar airways announced an order for 80 in june . the contract brings the number of a380s ordered by emirates to 58 , making it the world 's biggest customer for the superjumbo , which made its first commercial flight in the livery of singapore airlines last month . airbus also announced a $ 2-billion order from saudi business carrier nas for 20 airbus a320s , as well as an option to buy a further 18 of the short-haul planes . private superjumbo buyer revealed as saudi prince it was also revealed at the dubai air show that saudi billionaire prince alwaleed bin talal will be the first private buyer of an a380 superjumbo . the prospective buyer 's identity had been kept secret for months but was unveiled to coincide with the dubai air show . alwaleed , whose interests span kingdom holding to euro disney , hotels and banking , has ordered a vip version of the a380 dubbed the flying palace .
he already owns a boeing 747-400 , the newest type of the original jumbo jet currently in service . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-world.de spoke to a thalidomide survivor and his mother . in the autumn of 1960 , margret schlömann , now 75 , had trouble sleeping during her pregnancy and had taken an over-the-counter sedative called contergan , which was produced by the privately owned german drug maker grünenthal . what schlömann and thousands of other pregnant women did not know was that contergan 's active ingredient was thalidomide , a toxic substance that severely stunts the growth of a developing embryo 's limbs .
in june 1961 , her son markus was born without arms and thumbs and fingers that jutted out from each shoulder . today markus schlömann , 46 , is one of around 2,800 thalidomide survivors living in germany .
born in bonn , he works for a bank , is an avid world traveler and has a seven-year-old daughter , lena . his mother also lives in bonn and helps look after lena . dw-world.de : frau schlömann , what was it like for you after giving birth to markus ? margret schlömann : markus was my first child , so i did n't know what to expect .
he also came six weeks early .
pre-maturity was common for thalidomide babies .
after a normal hospital delivery , he was whisked away and put in an incubator .
i did n't get to see my son .
nobody congratulated me .
no one spoke to me . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : without arms , markus needed the help of a harness to balance my husband herbert had arrived , bringing flowers , but he was intercepted by the doctor before seeing me .
i knew something was wrong .
" is the baby dead ? "
i asked herbert .
he broke the news to me .
i was in shock , physically exhausted from the birth , and suddenly overwhelmed with grief . i saw markus four days later .
my maternal instincts took over , and i held him close .
there was another mother in the ward with her perfectly normal baby .
she saw markus there without any arms , and shrieked " what is that thing ? " you must have wondered what caused your child to be born without arms . margret schlömann : a tiny percentage of babies have always been born with birth defects , and i thought that mother nature singled markus out to be that one random statistic . what i did n't know at the time was that clinics all over west germany were seeing a sudden , drastic boom in the number of babies born without arms or legs or any limbs at all . i joined a thalidomide support group for parents .
it became clear that some outside factor must have been responsible for the limb deformities , but what ? was it radioactivity from nuclear testing ?
the shampoo i was using ? then in november 1961 , it came out in the newspapers .
it was contergan .
i was hysterical .
my doctor had urged me to take contergan .
in those days , you simply did n't challenge doctors or authority figures . i took maybe two tablets throughout the pregnancy , but i was too busy to dwell on my feelings of guilt , which surfaced in later years .
after markus , the twins -lsb- who were healthy -rsb- came 18 months later , and restored a sense of normality in our lives . how did people react to markus ? margret schlömann : some were voyeurs - they were either fascinated or repulsed by his armless torso .
one old woman made such a nasty remark , " how could you bring such a freak into this world , " she hollered .
others pitied him .
his appearance obviously made people feel squeamish or uncomfortable . when he was a small child , the neighborhood kids taunted him , but the worst insults were directed at another thalidomide boy , who had no limbs , only extremities .
the kids flapped their arms and chanted , " penguin , penguin , see that penguin , ha , ha . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : markus ' brother -lrb- right -rrb- is 18 months younger .
by 1963 , thalidomide was off the market markus , have attitudes toward the disabled changed in germany ? markus schlömann : yes , definitely .
in the past , families felt ashamed of their disabled relatives and hid them from view , so handicapped people were far more isolated in the 60s than they are today . germans have become much more open talking about disability now .
this is in part due to the aids / hiv revolution and greater awareness of the so-called diseases of civilization in the last decades , when those afflicted came out of the closet . a lot of people do n't even notice my handicap anymore .
one colleague said , " can you get that folder on the top shelf ? "
then they realize i do n't have the arms to reach for it . it 's only when lena was born and started going to school that my disability became an issue again .
lena 's schoolmates are not cruel and insensitive as kids in the 60s were , but they get on my nerves .
" why are your arms so short ? " they keep asking over and over , even when they know the answer . but kids are like that ... markus schlömann : yes , but they can ask me other questions .
i do n't want to be defined by my disability . mostly adults , on the other hand , try to be helpful towards me .
one guy offered to bag my groceries even though i am perfectly capable of doing it myself .
i tried to be gracious about it , although i have some thalidomide friends who feel offended , even hostile towards such well-meaning gestures . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : markus had attended a special needs school you 've also traveled quite a bit .
you 've taken a greyhound bus across america , you 've been to india seven times , and taken trips to latin america , vietnam , thailand , indonesia , fiji , australia .
how do reactions toward your disability differ in those places in comparison to germany ? markus schlömann : i have never had a negative experience .
i 've always been a communicative person , and people respond in kind .
someone might be impressed by the way i can lift a coffee cup , but i do n't know how to do it any other way . in thailand , where extended family structures are part of the culture , people are astounded that i have a regular banking job .
they ask me , " why does n't your family take care of you ? " in some countries though , the infrastructure for handicapped people is not great .
germany is much further along in that respect .
the increasing acceptance of disabled people here is reflected in how our special needs are addressed .
public buildings are equipped with wheelchair ramps and cars are specially designed for people like me to drive . but in german schools , the physically handicapped are not exactly mainstreamed into the system .
there 's the so-called special needs school , which you attended . markus schlömann : there was no alternative when i went to school in the 60s and 70s .
the advantage of a special school is that the entire curriculum is geared towards your needs .
in the afternoons we had gymnastic training to strengthen our back muscles for example . we were all physically handicapped in some way and had great fun together , but by the time i graduated , i wanted to move out into the wider world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " a lot of people do n't even notice my handicap anymore " do you get frustrated about your physical limitations when you see others performing simple tasks that you struggle with ? markus schlömann : i wish i could have been born otherwise .
i would have liked to play the guitar .
i would have liked to be a marine biologist or a forester .
i wish that i could hold my daughter 's hand when we walk down the street .
but this is my body and i have to live with its limitations . there are so many thalidomide adults who are much worse off than me .
i have a good , well-paying job .
i can walk , ride a bike and play soccer . some of my friends have physical limitations that make them unemployable .
many people i have known have died from their severe disabilities , others committed suicide .

dw-world.de spoke to a thalidomide survivor and his mother . in the autumn of 1960 , margret schlömann , now 75 , had trouble sleeping during her pregnancy and had taken an over-the-counter sedative called contergan , which was produced by the privately owned german drug maker grünenthal . what schlömann and thousands of other pregnant women did not know was that contergan 's active ingredient was thalidomide , a toxic substance that severely stunts the growth of a developing embryo 's limbs .
in june 1961 , her son markus was born without arms and thumbs and fingers that jutted out from each shoulder . today markus schlömann , 46 , is one of around 2,800 thalidomide survivors living in germany .
born in bonn , he works for a bank , is an avid world traveler and has a seven-year-old daughter , lena . his mother also lives in bonn and helps look after lena . dw-world.de : frau schlömann , what was it like for you after giving birth to markus ? margret schlömann : markus was my first child , so i did n't know what to expect .
he also came six weeks early .
pre-maturity was common for thalidomide babies .
after a normal hospital delivery , he was whisked away and put in an incubator .
i did n't get to see my son .
nobody congratulated me .
no one spoke to me . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : without arms , markus needed the help of a harness to balance my husband herbert had arrived , bringing flowers , but he was intercepted by the doctor before seeing me .
i knew something was wrong .
" is the baby dead ? "
i asked herbert .
he broke the news to me .
i was in shock , physically exhausted from the birth , and suddenly overwhelmed with grief . i saw markus four days later .
my maternal instincts took over , and i held him close .
there was another mother in the ward with her perfectly normal baby .
she saw markus there without any arms , and shrieked " what is that thing ? " you must have wondered what caused your child to be born without arms . margret schlömann : a tiny percentage of babies have always been born with birth defects , and i thought that mother nature singled markus out to be that one random statistic . what i did n't know at the time was that clinics all over west germany were seeing a sudden , drastic boom in the number of babies born without arms or legs or any limbs at all . i joined a thalidomide support group for parents .
it became clear that some outside factor must have been responsible for the limb deformities , but what ? was it radioactivity from nuclear testing ?
the shampoo i was using ? then in november 1961 , it came out in the newspapers .
it was contergan .
i was hysterical .
my doctor had urged me to take contergan .
in those days , you simply did n't challenge doctors or authority figures . i took maybe two tablets throughout the pregnancy , but i was too busy to dwell on my feelings of guilt , which surfaced in later years .
after markus , the twins -lsb- who were healthy -rsb- came 18 months later , and restored a sense of normality in our lives . how did people react to markus ? margret schlömann : some were voyeurs - they were either fascinated or repulsed by his armless torso .
one old woman made such a nasty remark , " how could you bring such a freak into this world , " she hollered .
others pitied him .
his appearance obviously made people feel squeamish or uncomfortable . when he was a small child , the neighborhood kids taunted him , but the worst insults were directed at another thalidomide boy , who had no limbs , only extremities .
the kids flapped their arms and chanted , " penguin , penguin , see that penguin , ha , ha . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : markus ' brother -lrb- right -rrb- is 18 months younger .
by 1963 , thalidomide was off the market markus , have attitudes toward the disabled changed in germany ? markus schlömann : yes , definitely .
in the past , families felt ashamed of their disabled relatives and hid them from view , so handicapped people were far more isolated in the 60s than they are today . germans have become much more open talking about disability now .
this is in part due to the aids / hiv revolution and greater awareness of the so-called diseases of civilization in the last decades , when those afflicted came out of the closet . a lot of people do n't even notice my handicap anymore .
one colleague said , " can you get that folder on the top shelf ? "
then they realize i do n't have the arms to reach for it . it 's only when lena was born and started going to school that my disability became an issue again .
lena 's schoolmates are not cruel and insensitive as kids in the 60s were , but they get on my nerves .
" why are your arms so short ? " they keep asking over and over , even when they know the answer . but kids are like that ... markus schlömann : yes , but they can ask me other questions .
i do n't want to be defined by my disability . mostly adults , on the other hand , try to be helpful towards me .
one guy offered to bag my groceries even though i am perfectly capable of doing it myself .
i tried to be gracious about it , although i have some thalidomide friends who feel offended , even hostile towards such well-meaning gestures . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : markus had attended a special needs school you 've also traveled quite a bit .
you 've taken a greyhound bus across america , you 've been to india seven times , and taken trips to latin america , vietnam , thailand , indonesia , fiji , australia .
how do reactions toward your disability differ in those places in comparison to germany ? markus schlömann : i have never had a negative experience .
i 've always been a communicative person , and people respond in kind .
someone might be impressed by the way i can lift a coffee cup , but i do n't know how to do it any other way . in thailand , where extended family structures are part of the culture , people are astounded that i have a regular banking job .
they ask me , " why does n't your family take care of you ? " in some countries though , the infrastructure for handicapped people is not great .
germany is much further along in that respect .
the increasing acceptance of disabled people here is reflected in how our special needs are addressed .
public buildings are equipped with wheelchair ramps and cars are specially designed for people like me to drive . but in german schools , the physically handicapped are not exactly mainstreamed into the system .
there 's the so-called special needs school , which you attended . markus schlömann : there was no alternative when i went to school in the 60s and 70s .
the advantage of a special school is that the entire curriculum is geared towards your needs .
in the afternoons we had gymnastic training to strengthen our back muscles for example . we were all physically handicapped in some way and had great fun together , but by the time i graduated , i wanted to move out into the wider world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " a lot of people do n't even notice my handicap anymore " do you get frustrated about your physical limitations when you see others performing simple tasks that you struggle with ? markus schlömann : i wish i could have been born otherwise .
i would have liked to play the guitar .
i would have liked to be a marine biologist or a forester .
i wish that i could hold my daughter 's hand when we walk down the street .
but this is my body and i have to live with its limitations . there are so many thalidomide adults who are much worse off than me .
i have a good , well-paying job .
i can walk , ride a bike and play soccer . some of my friends have physical limitations that make them unemployable .
many people i have known have died from their severe disabilities , others committed suicide .

on friday , nov .
9 , " side effects " was also released in english .
dw-world.de spoke to a thalidomide survivor and his mother . in the autumn of 1960 , margret schlömann , now 75 , had trouble sleeping during her pregnancy and had taken an over-the-counter sedative called contergan , which was produced by the privately owned german drug maker grünenthal . what schlömann and thousands of other pregnant women did not know was that contergan 's active ingredient was thalidomide , a toxic substance that severely stunts the growth of a developing embryo 's limbs .
in june 1961 , her son markus was born without arms and thumbs and fingers that jutted out from each shoulder . today markus schlömann , 46 , is one of around 2,800 thalidomide survivors living in germany .
born in bonn , he works for a bank , is an avid world traveler and has a seven-year-old daughter , lena . his mother also lives in bonn and helps look after lena . dw-world.de : frau schlömann , what was it like for you after giving birth to markus ? margret schlömann : markus was my first child , so i did n't know what to expect .
he also came six weeks early .
pre-maturity was common for thalidomide babies .
after a normal hospital delivery , he was whisked away and put in an incubator .
i did n't get to see my son .
nobody congratulated me .
no one spoke to me . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : without arms , markus needed the help of a harness to balance my husband herbert had arrived , bringing flowers , but he was intercepted by the doctor before seeing me .
i knew something was wrong .
" is the baby dead ? "
i asked herbert .
he broke the news to me .
i was in shock , physically exhausted from the birth , and suddenly overwhelmed with grief . i saw markus four days later .
my maternal instincts took over , and i held him close .
there was another mother in the ward with her perfectly normal baby .
she saw markus there without any arms , and shrieked " what is that thing ? " you must have wondered what caused your child to be born without arms . margret schlömann : a tiny percentage of babies have always been born with birth defects , and i thought that mother nature singled markus out to be that one random statistic . what i did n't know at the time was that clinics all over west germany were seeing a sudden , drastic boom in the number of babies born without arms or legs or any limbs at all . i joined a thalidomide support group for parents .
it became clear that some outside factor must have been responsible for the limb deformities , but what ? was it radioactivity from nuclear testing ?
the shampoo i was using ? then in november 1961 , it came out in the newspapers .
it was contergan .
i was hysterical .
my doctor had urged me to take contergan .
in those days , you simply did n't challenge doctors or authority figures . i took maybe two tablets throughout the pregnancy , but i was too busy to dwell on my feelings of guilt , which surfaced in later years .
after markus , the twins -lsb- who were healthy -rsb- came 18 months later , and restored a sense of normality in our lives . how did people react to markus ? margret schlömann : some were voyeurs - they were either fascinated or repulsed by his armless torso .
one old woman made such a nasty remark , " how could you bring such a freak into this world , " she hollered .
others pitied him .
his appearance obviously made people feel squeamish or uncomfortable . when he was a small child , the neighborhood kids taunted him , but the worst insults were directed at another thalidomide boy , who had no limbs , only extremities .
the kids flapped their arms and chanted , " penguin , penguin , see that penguin , ha , ha . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : markus ' brother -lrb- right -rrb- is 18 months younger .
by 1963 , thalidomide was off the market markus , have attitudes toward the disabled changed in germany ? markus schlömann : yes , definitely .
in the past , families felt ashamed of their disabled relatives and hid them from view , so handicapped people were far more isolated in the 60s than they are today . germans have become much more open talking about disability now .
this is in part due to the aids / hiv revolution and greater awareness of the so-called diseases of civilization in the last decades , when those afflicted came out of the closet . a lot of people do n't even notice my handicap anymore .
one colleague said , " can you get that folder on the top shelf ? "
then they realize i do n't have the arms to reach for it . it 's only when lena was born and started going to school that my disability became an issue again .
lena 's schoolmates are not cruel and insensitive as kids in the 60s were , but they get on my nerves .
" why are your arms so short ? " they keep asking over and over , even when they know the answer . but kids are like that ... markus schlömann : yes , but they can ask me other questions .
i do n't want to be defined by my disability . mostly adults , on the other hand , try to be helpful towards me .
one guy offered to bag my groceries even though i am perfectly capable of doing it myself .
i tried to be gracious about it , although i have some thalidomide friends who feel offended , even hostile towards such well-meaning gestures . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : markus had attended a special needs school you 've also traveled quite a bit .
you 've taken a greyhound bus across america , you 've been to india seven times , and taken trips to latin america , vietnam , thailand , indonesia , fiji , australia .
how do reactions toward your disability differ in those places in comparison to germany ? markus schlömann : i have never had a negative experience .
i 've always been a communicative person , and people respond in kind .
someone might be impressed by the way i can lift a coffee cup , but i do n't know how to do it any other way . in thailand , where extended family structures are part of the culture , people are astounded that i have a regular banking job .
they ask me , " why does n't your family take care of you ? " in some countries though , the infrastructure for handicapped people is not great .
germany is much further along in that respect .
the increasing acceptance of disabled people here is reflected in how our special needs are addressed .
public buildings are equipped with wheelchair ramps and cars are specially designed for people like me to drive . but in german schools , the physically handicapped are not exactly mainstreamed into the system .
there 's the so-called special needs school , which you attended . markus schlömann : there was no alternative when i went to school in the 60s and 70s .
the advantage of a special school is that the entire curriculum is geared towards your needs .
in the afternoons we had gymnastic training to strengthen our back muscles for example . we were all physically handicapped in some way and had great fun together , but by the time i graduated , i wanted to move out into the wider world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " a lot of people do n't even notice my handicap anymore " do you get frustrated about your physical limitations when you see others performing simple tasks that you struggle with ? markus schlömann : i wish i could have been born otherwise .

thalidomide babies developed abnormally short limbs - typically flipper-like fingers emerging from the shoulders .
other infants had eye and ear defects and no legs . a two-part tv film on public television , called " a single tablet " in german , dramatized one of the worst blunders by a drug company .

9 . thalidomide linked to birth defects bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thalidomide victims suffered varying degrees of deformity grünenthal , a private german drug company with an annual turnover of 800 million euros -lrb- $ 1.2 billion -rrb- , started selling thalidomide in october 1957 and only withdraw it as a sedative when findings linking it to birth defects were published by the german press in november 1961 .
the company 's owners are among the 30 wealthiest families in germany with a personal fortune estimated at about 3.3 billion euros according to manager magazin . widukind lenz , a hamburg pediatrician and geneticist , was one of the first to link thalidomide to the sudden surge in birth defects in the late 1950s and early 1960s .
he noticed that thalidomide babies were virtually non-existent in communist east germany , where contergan had not been approved for use . most cases in west germany west germany was hardest hit by thalidomide , with about half , or 5,000 , of all cases worldwide .
contergan was sold in almost 50 countries , but not in the united states , where the fda regulatory authorities refused to give it the green light . thalidomide was sold in canada , however , and it was fda newcomer frances kelsey , a canadian physician , who had resisted intense pressure to put thalidomide on the american market .
she was later decorated by president john f. kennedy in 1962 for her courage .
in 1970 , grünenthal paid a total of 100 million deutschmarks -lrb- $ 75 million , 51.1 million euros -rrb- in a settlement with germany 's thalidomide victims shortly after the civil settlement , the criminal trial of hermann wirtz , the company owner , and eight grünenthal executives was abandoned in december 1970 on the grounds that their guilt was impossible to establish . the german government had contributed a matching amount to the relief fund , which paid modest monthly sums to the survivors until it dried up 10 years ago .
since 1997 the government alone has continued to pay survivors up to 545 euros per month . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german victims are bitter about the 1970 settlement grünenthal is under no legal obligation to continue compensating the victims and has never issued an apology to thalidomide survivors or their families . higher compensation outside germany other countries , including canada , britain and sweden , had ensured more generous compensation .
now in their mid to late 40s , the survivors often suffer from arthritis and back problems resulting from a lifetime of awkward movement .
some of them are forced to retire early for health reasons and many live on social welfare . the two-part tv dramatization tells the story of a fictitious lawyer whose wife takes " just one tablet " of contergan , and gives birth to a daughter with no arms and only one leg . " what 's the matter ?
show me my baby , " says the mother , vera wegener , amid a ghastly silence in the delivery room .
" do n't worry , you can put it in an orphanage , " a doctor replies . another doctor calls the " deformed " daughter " horrible . " " in those days people did not speak of a ' disability , " ' adolf winkelmann of german public broadcaster wdr television told the german dpa news agency .
" the terms they used were pretty insensitive . " part one of the film had showed the lawyer gradually becoming convinced that contergan was responsible for his daughter 's condition .

now in their mid to late 40s , the survivors often suffer from arthritis and back problems resulting from a lifetime of awkward movement .
some of them are forced to retire early for health reasons and many live on social welfare . the two-part tv dramatization tells the story of a fictitious lawyer whose wife takes " just one tablet " of contergan , and gives birth to a daughter with no arms and only one leg . " what 's the matter ?
show me my baby , " says the mother , vera wegener , amid a ghastly silence in the delivery room .

thalidomide babies developed abnormally short limbs - typically flipper-like fingers emerging from the shoulders .
other infants had eye and ear defects and no legs . a two-part tv film on public television , called " a single tablet " in german , dramatized one of the worst blunders by a drug company .
warner home video germany picked up the us rights to the film and released it as a double dvd under the new title " side effects " on friday , nov .
9 . thalidomide linked to birth defects bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thalidomide victims suffered varying degrees of deformity grünenthal , a private german drug company with an annual turnover of 800 million euros -lrb- $ 1.2 billion -rrb- , started selling thalidomide in october 1957 and only withdraw it as a sedative when findings linking it to birth defects were published by the german press in november 1961 .
the company 's owners are among the 30 wealthiest families in germany with a personal fortune estimated at about 3.3 billion euros according to manager magazin . widukind lenz , a hamburg pediatrician and geneticist , was one of the first to link thalidomide to the sudden surge in birth defects in the late 1950s and early 1960s .
he noticed that thalidomide babies were virtually non-existent in communist east germany , where contergan had not been approved for use . most cases in west germany west germany was hardest hit by thalidomide , with about half , or 5,000 , of all cases worldwide .
contergan was sold in almost 50 countries , but not in the united states , where the fda regulatory authorities refused to give it the green light . thalidomide was sold in canada , however , and it was fda newcomer frances kelsey , a canadian physician , who had resisted intense pressure to put thalidomide on the american market .
she was later decorated by president john f. kennedy in 1962 for her courage .
in 1970 , grünenthal paid a total of 100 million deutschmarks -lrb- $ 75 million , 51.1 million euros -rrb- in a settlement with germany 's thalidomide victims shortly after the civil settlement , the criminal trial of hermann wirtz , the company owner , and eight grünenthal executives was abandoned in december 1970 on the grounds that their guilt was impossible to establish . the german government had contributed a matching amount to the relief fund , which paid modest monthly sums to the survivors until it dried up 10 years ago .
since 1997 the government alone has continued to pay survivors up to 545 euros per month . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german victims are bitter about the 1970 settlement grünenthal is under no legal obligation to continue compensating the victims and has never issued an apology to thalidomide survivors or their families . higher compensation outside germany other countries , including canada , britain and sweden , had ensured more generous compensation .
now in their mid to late 40s , the survivors often suffer from arthritis and back problems resulting from a lifetime of awkward movement .
some of them are forced to retire early for health reasons and many live on social welfare . the two-part tv dramatization tells the story of a fictitious lawyer whose wife takes " just one tablet " of contergan , and gives birth to a daughter with no arms and only one leg . " what 's the matter ?
show me my baby , " says the mother , vera wegener , amid a ghastly silence in the delivery room .
" do n't worry , you can put it in an orphanage , " a doctor replies . another doctor calls the " deformed " daughter " horrible . " " in those days people did not speak of a ' disability , " ' adolf winkelmann of german public broadcaster wdr television told the german dpa news agency .
" the terms they used were pretty insensitive . " part one of the film had showed the lawyer gradually becoming convinced that contergan was responsible for his daughter 's condition .
the second part of the tv movie re-enacted the legal battle for compensating the victims . producers won legal battle to air tv film bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fda approved thalidomide to treat leprosy under strict regulations the film producers had spent 18 months in court with grünenthal executives and the real-life lawyer who led the compensation fight against the drug maker .
both the company and lawyer claimed they had been misrepresented by the film .
the dramatization was changed and now comes with disclaimers insisting that the characters do not represent actual people . several weeks ago , germany 's federal constitutional court struck down temporary injunctions aimed at keeping the tv film off the air .
it was aired on prime time last week with each episode drawing about 7 million viewers . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" targeted sanctions against individuals or specific groups are , in principle , preferable to general sanctions imposed on states .
general sanctions often have dire consequences for vulnerable population groups in the countries concerned , and generally not for their leadership , " marty said in a report released sunday , nov .
11 .
lost credibility but , marty said , individual suspects placed on the lists did not have the right to reply and found it virtually impossible to clear their names .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marty : the lists are " unworthy " of the eu and un 's " lofty goals " " the present system of blacklists flouts the fundamental principles which are the basis of human rights , " he said in the report , which is due to be presented to the strasbourg-based council of europe on monday .
the un security council first established a list of al-qaeda and taliban suspects in 1999 .
it contains the names of 368 individuals and 124 entities .
the united nations said its members must freeze the assets , and prevent the entry into their territories , of anyone on the lists .
also , it must prevent the sale and transfer of arms to them .
the european union has set up its own blacklist .
marty said both organizations must respect " minimal norms of procedure and juridical safeguards " before imposing restrictions .
these norms included giving suspects the right to appeal to an independent and impartial organization and the right to compensation in the case of any miscarriage of justice .
attacks on cia practices he said the council of europe 's 47 member states should make sure such guarantees were offered .
in the past , the swiss senator has attacked the us practice of " extraordinary rendition " of terror suspects and secret cia prisons in countries with little regard for human rights .
while blacklisting " may be a useful instrument in certain circumstances and , in any event , for a limited period of time , " marty said it is unacceptable that no clear procedure is foreseen for getting off the blacklist .
" if one adds to this picture the practice of abductions -lsb- " extraordinary renditions " -rsb- , secret detention centers and the trivialization of torture , this provides a worrying , devastating message : principles that are as fundamental as the rule of law and the protection of human rights are optional accessories applicable only in fair weather . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the council of europe guarantee the rights of those blacklisted ?
marty highlighted the case of the people 's mujahedeen of iran , which forms part of the national council of resistance of iran and is on an eu blacklist despite a european court ruling in 2006 saying it should be removed from the list .
" despite recent procedural improvements it remains almost impossible , in practice , to be removed from the blacklist - a situation that is illegal and unacceptable , " marty wrote .
in another example , yussef nada , an italian businessman of egyptian origin living in switzerland for three decades , was placed on such a blacklist in 2001 on suspicion of having financed the sept .

his assets were seized and his freedom of movement was severely restricted .

" targeted sanctions against individuals or specific groups are , in principle , preferable to general sanctions imposed on states .
general sanctions often have dire consequences for vulnerable population groups in the countries concerned , and generally not for their leadership , " marty said in a report released sunday , nov .
11 .
lost credibility but , marty said , individual suspects placed on the lists did not have the right to reply and found it virtually impossible to clear their names .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marty : the lists are " unworthy " of the eu and un 's " lofty goals " " the present system of blacklists flouts the fundamental principles which are the basis of human rights , " he said in the report , which is due to be presented to the strasbourg-based council of europe on monday .
the un security council first established a list of al-qaeda and taliban suspects in 1999 .
it contains the names of 368 individuals and 124 entities .
the united nations said its members must freeze the assets , and prevent the entry into their territories , of anyone on the lists .
also , it must prevent the sale and transfer of arms to them .
the european union has set up its own blacklist .
marty said both organizations must respect " minimal norms of procedure and juridical safeguards " before imposing restrictions .
these norms included giving suspects the right to appeal to an independent and impartial organization and the right to compensation in the case of any miscarriage of justice .
attacks on cia practices he said the council of europe 's 47 member states should make sure such guarantees were offered .
in the past , the swiss senator has attacked the us practice of " extraordinary rendition " of terror suspects and secret cia prisons in countries with little regard for human rights .
while blacklisting " may be a useful instrument in certain circumstances and , in any event , for a limited period of time , " marty said it is unacceptable that no clear procedure is foreseen for getting off the blacklist .
" if one adds to this picture the practice of abductions -lsb- " extraordinary renditions " -rsb- , secret detention centers and the trivialization of torture , this provides a worrying , devastating message : principles that are as fundamental as the rule of law and the protection of human rights are optional accessories applicable only in fair weather .

marty highlighted the case of the people 's mujahedeen of iran , which forms part of the national council of resistance of iran and is on an eu blacklist despite a european court ruling in 2006 saying it should be removed from the list .
" despite recent procedural improvements it remains almost impossible , in practice , to be removed from the blacklist - a situation that is illegal and unacceptable , " marty wrote .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 12.11.2007 opinion : europe and the us need each other großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : george bush received nicolas sarkozy in the white house and angela merkel at his texas ranch last week .
the meetings took different tones , but both show the gap is closing over the atlantic , said dw 's christina bergmann . the trans-atlantic ice age is over .
if anyone still needed proof that the us on one side , and france and germany on the other , want to start a new chapter in their respective bilateral relationships , then they got it this past week . the east german physicist , german chancellor angela merkel , and the son of a hungarian immigrant , french president nicolas sarkozy , each took different approaches to their meetings with us president george w. bush . in a speech to the us congress , sarkozy pointed out that the two countries had had a long history together prior to the disagreement over the iraq war .
he practically fell over himself with enthusiasm for the united states and left out the iraq topic altogether , just to be on the safe side .
he has to be careful , however , not to take former british prime minister tony blair 's place as the american president 's " poodle . "
after all , those who wish to have influence on someone must be able to look them in the eye . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel is cleverer .
she did n't accept the invitation to the ranch - and its accompanying presidential honor - until her relationship to bush had solidified and she had given him her opinion on numerous occasions .
the president has no problem with that .
he 's proven more than once that he sticks by those who he 's taken a liking to - in good times and bad . it 's not only merkel and sarkozy 's differing personalities and destinies that contribute to the closing of ranks .
everyone knows that bush 's days are numbered .
both sarkozy and merkel will most likely have to do deal with his successor and are interested in setting the course now . in his last year in office , the american president is trying to save what 's left to save .
he continually emphasizes that he does n't make decisions based on opinion polls and that conclusions are n't made until much later .
nevertheless , he does n't want to leave with nothing to show for his time in office . both sides have recognized that things do n't work without the other .
the us is and will remain the only superpower that has the resources and the will to get involved in crisis areas .
but without influential allies , it ca n't be successful .
simply writing off " old " europe , as former us defense minister donald rumsfeld did , does n't work .
still , the countries of " new " europe - with all due respect - have a long road ahead of them before they even remotely attain the political clout that germany and france have . europeans have recognized that they ca n't solve crises alone - from kosovo 's status and the conflict in the middle east to global climate change .
they need the united states .

the meetings took different tones , but both show the gap is closing over the atlantic , said dw 's christina bergmann . the trans-atlantic ice age is over .
if anyone still needed proof that the us on one side , and france and germany on the other , want to start a new chapter in their respective bilateral relationships , then they got it this past week . the east german physicist , german chancellor angela merkel , and the son of a hungarian immigrant , french president nicolas sarkozy , each took different approaches to their meetings with us president george w. bush . in a speech to the us congress , sarkozy pointed out that the two countries had had a long history together prior to the disagreement over the iraq war .
he practically fell over himself with enthusiasm for the united states and left out the iraq topic altogether , just to be on the safe side .
he has to be careful , however , not to take former british prime minister tony blair 's place as the american president 's " poodle . "
after all , those who wish to have influence on someone must be able to look them in the eye . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel is cleverer .
she did n't accept the invitation to the ranch - and its accompanying presidential honor - until her relationship to bush had solidified and she had given him her opinion on numerous occasions .
the president has no problem with that .
he 's proven more than once that he sticks by those who he 's taken a liking to - in good times and bad . it 's not only merkel and sarkozy 's differing personalities and destinies that contribute to the closing of ranks .
everyone knows that bush 's days are numbered .
both sarkozy and merkel will most likely have to do deal with his successor and are interested in setting the course now . in his last year in office , the american president is trying to save what 's left to save .
he continually emphasizes that he does n't make decisions based on opinion polls and that conclusions are n't made until much later .
nevertheless , he does n't want to leave with nothing to show for his time in office . both sides have recognized that things do n't work without the other .
the us is and will remain the only superpower that has the resources and the will to get involved in crisis areas .
but without influential allies , it ca n't be successful .
simply writing off " old " europe , as former us defense minister donald rumsfeld did , does n't work .
still , the countries of " new " europe - with all due respect - have a long road ahead of them before they even remotely attain the political clout that germany and france have . europeans have recognized that they ca n't solve crises alone - from kosovo 's status and the conflict in the middle east to global climate change .

the president has no problem with that .
he 's proven more than once that he sticks by those who he 's taken a liking to - in good times and bad . it 's not only merkel and sarkozy 's differing personalities and destinies that contribute to the closing of ranks .
everyone knows that bush 's days are numbered .
both sarkozy and merkel will most likely have to do deal with his successor and are interested in setting the course now . in his last year in office , the american president is trying to save what 's left to save .
he continually emphasizes that he does n't make decisions based on opinion polls and that conclusions are n't made until much later .

simply writing off " old " europe , as former us defense minister donald rumsfeld did , does n't work .
still , the countries of " new " europe - with all due respect - have a long road ahead of them before they even remotely attain the political clout that germany and france have . europeans have recognized that they ca n't solve crises alone - from kosovo 's status and the conflict in the middle east to global climate change .
they need the united states .
even in the nuclear conflict with iran .
those who take the path of diplomacy are more successful when they have a nation on their side that , if all else fails , wo n't be afraid to send its soldiers to war . christina bergmann is a correspondent for deutsche welle in washington , dc -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

airbus announced over the weekend that the emirates airline had placed an order that will net airbus over $ 20 billion -lrb- 13.8 billion euros -rrb- . us manufacturer boeing was pushed into the background at the dubai air show on sunday , nov .
11 , when the dubai-owned carrier announced it would buy 11 a380 superjumbos plus 70 midsized a350 xwb -lrb- extra wide body -rrb- aircraft in what airbus executives called the biggest order in the european constructor 's history . the total value of the new firm orders for the 70 a350s and 11 a380s is 20.2 billion dollars , according to airbus . an upbeat airbus sales chief john leahy raised forecast sales of the a350 xwb to " more than 300 " by year 's end .
he had expected 200 orders at the start of the year . boeing , whose b787 dreamliner is the major competitor to the a350 , won a comparatively modest $ 3.2 billion order from emirates for 12 of its b777-300s , bringing the dubai airline 's total outlay for new planes to over $ 23 billion at the show . seattle-based boeing also said in a statement it had signed an agreement with qatar airways for 30 787 dreamliners and five 777 cargo planes in a deal valued at over $ 6.1 billion at list prices . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : enders was happy and proud of emirates ' faith in airbus but the lion 's share of new orders announced sunday went to airbus , a fact welcomed by the company 's ceo tom enders . " emirates airline is placing great faith in our a350 xwb and a380 programs as well as our company and we are rightfully proud , " he said . the latest orders mark a dramatic turnaround for airbus , which was overtaken by rival boeing in the race for new business in 2006 .
the european plane maker had made a spectacular plunge into the red last year and has been beset this year by plane production woes . trade union warns cutbacks may affect orders however , some caution was added to the euphoria on monday when a leading french trade union warned that planned job cuts and site sales at airbus could jeopardize the company 's ability to fill the new orders . " we see a paradox in the accumulation of new orders ... and management 's implementation of power8 , with its job cuts and site sales , " jean-francois knepper , an organizer with force ouvriere -lrb- fo -rrb- , told reporters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus has committed to a plan of cuts and restructuring power8 is a sweeping - and contested - restructuring campaign launched by airbus last february in the face of costly production and delivery delays .
it calls notably for the elimination of 10,000 jobs over four years and the sale of certain production sites in order to achieve savings of 5 billion euros by 2010 . " how are we going to honor these -lsb- emirates -rsb- orders for the a350 when the plan to sell certain sites is not yet finalized ? "
knepper asked .
" time is passing and we are getting orders , but if our leaders do not reconsider the plan to sell sites under power8 , we will not be able to fill the orders on time . " with power8 , he added , " the company is temporarily de-stabilized at a time when we have to hold together . " emirates committing to long-term airbus orders as well as the 70 firm orders for the a350s - which are scheduled to come into service in 2013 - emirates chairman and chief executive sheikh ahmed bin saeed al-maktoum said the company had taken an option to buy a further 50 of the new-generation planes down the line .
he added that the airline had decided to order three more a380 superjumbos , and to firm up a previous option to buy a further eight . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first commercial a380 took off in singapore livery " the a350 xwb and a380 will play an important role in supporting emirates ' and dubai 's growth plans , " maktoum said .
" as the leading airline for the 21st century , it made sense for emirates to choose the a350 xwb - an aircraft designed with 21st century technologies . " the 70 firm orders - for 50 a350-900s and 20 a350-1000s - will make emirates the second biggest customer for the long-haul planes after qatar airways announced an order for 80 in june . the contract brings the number of a380s ordered by emirates to 58 , making it the world 's biggest customer for the superjumbo , which made its first commercial flight in the livery of singapore airlines last month . airbus also announced a $ 2-billion order from saudi business carrier nas for 20 airbus a320s , as well as an option to buy a further 18 of the short-haul planes . private superjumbo buyer revealed as saudi prince it was also revealed at the dubai air show that saudi billionaire prince alwaleed bin talal will be the first private buyer of an a380 superjumbo . the prospective buyer 's identity had been kept secret for months but was unveiled to coincide with the dubai air show . alwaleed , whose interests span kingdom holding to euro disney , hotels and banking , has ordered a vip version of the a380 dubbed the flying palace .
he already owns a boeing 747-400 , the newest type of the original jumbo jet currently in service . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

airbus announced over the weekend that the emirates airline had placed an order that will net airbus over $ 20 billion -lrb- 13.8 billion euros -rrb- . us manufacturer boeing was pushed into the background at the dubai air show on sunday , nov .
11 , when the dubai-owned carrier announced it would buy 11 a380 superjumbos plus 70 midsized a350 xwb -lrb- extra wide body -rrb- aircraft in what airbus executives called the biggest order in the european constructor 's history . the total value of the new firm orders for the 70 a350s and 11 a380s is 20.2 billion dollars , according to airbus . an upbeat airbus sales chief john leahy raised forecast sales of the a350 xwb to " more than 300 " by year 's end .
he had expected 200 orders at the start of the year . boeing , whose b787 dreamliner is the major competitor to the a350 , won a comparatively modest $ 3.2 billion order from emirates for 12 of its b777-300s , bringing the dubai airline 's total outlay for new planes to over $ 23 billion at the show . seattle-based boeing also said in a statement it had signed an agreement with qatar airways for 30 787 dreamliners and five 777 cargo planes in a deal valued at over $ 6.1 billion at list prices . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : enders was happy and proud of emirates ' faith in airbus but the lion 's share of new orders announced sunday went to airbus , a fact welcomed by the company 's ceo tom enders . " emirates airline is placing great faith in our a350 xwb and a380 programs as well as our company and we are rightfully proud , " he said . the latest orders mark a dramatic turnaround for airbus , which was overtaken by rival boeing in the race for new business in 2006 .
the european plane maker had made a spectacular plunge into the red last year and has been beset this year by plane production woes . trade union warns cutbacks may affect orders however , some caution was added to the euphoria on monday when a leading french trade union warned that planned job cuts and site sales at airbus could jeopardize the company 's ability to fill the new orders . " we see a paradox in the accumulation of new orders ... and management 's implementation of power8 , with its job cuts and site sales , " jean-francois knepper , an organizer with force ouvriere -lrb- fo -rrb- , told reporters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus has committed to a plan of cuts and restructuring power8 is a sweeping - and contested - restructuring campaign launched by airbus last february in the face of costly production and delivery delays .
it calls notably for the elimination of 10,000 jobs over four years and the sale of certain production sites in order to achieve savings of 5 billion euros by 2010 . " how are we going to honor these -lsb- emirates -rsb- orders for the a350 when the plan to sell certain sites is not yet finalized ? "
knepper asked .
" time is passing and we are getting orders , but if our leaders do not reconsider the plan to sell sites under power8 , we will not be able to fill the orders on time . " with power8 , he added , " the company is temporarily de-stabilized at a time when we have to hold together . " emirates committing to long-term airbus orders as well as the 70 firm orders for the a350s - which are scheduled to come into service in 2013 - emirates chairman and chief executive sheikh ahmed bin saeed al-maktoum said the company had taken an option to buy a further 50 of the new-generation planes down the line .
he added that the airline had decided to order three more a380 superjumbos , and to firm up a previous option to buy a further eight . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first commercial a380 took off in singapore livery " the a350 xwb and a380 will play an important role in supporting emirates ' and dubai 's growth plans , " maktoum said .
" as the leading airline for the 21st century , it made sense for emirates to choose the a350 xwb - an aircraft designed with 21st century technologies . " the 70 firm orders - for 50 a350-900s and 20 a350-1000s - will make emirates the second biggest customer for the long-haul planes after qatar airways announced an order for 80 in june . the contract brings the number of a380s ordered by emirates to 58 , making it the world 's biggest customer for the superjumbo , which made its first commercial flight in the livery of singapore airlines last month . airbus also announced a $ 2-billion order from saudi business carrier nas for 20 airbus a320s , as well as an option to buy a further 18 of the short-haul planes . private superjumbo buyer revealed as saudi prince it was also revealed at the dubai air show that saudi billionaire prince alwaleed bin talal will be the first private buyer of an a380 superjumbo . the prospective buyer 's identity had been kept secret for months but was unveiled to coincide with the dubai air show . alwaleed , whose interests span kingdom holding to euro disney , hotels and banking , has ordered a vip version of the a380 dubbed the flying palace .

but when performed by two politicians , it could threaten civilization . just as models and hotel heiresses should never become actors ; neither should politicians become pop stars .
it is an unwritten rule that has kept the fragile state of the planet intact for many centuries .
when people who excel at what they do in one field , and paris hilton , decide that they would like to branch out , it can have a very damaging effect on the delicate balance of existence . of all those who think that adding a " slash " somewhere in the job title - " actor-slash-model , " " singer-slash-human rights campaigner " - is a good idea , politicians are among those who should receive the least encouragement . however , it seems that someone forgot to tell german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier and his french counterpart bernard kouchner to stick to diplomacy . in an act of ill-conceived detente , the two foreign ministers recorded a " rhythm and blues " song in berlin on monday , nov .
12 . unlikely soundtrack for romantic evenings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : things went from bad to worse when he played the steinmeier / kouchner song if that 's not enough to get true music fans on their knees praying for deafness , the song is about european integration and is expected to have the complete opposite effect of a barry white record by seriously adding to europe 's birth-rate crisis . " the two foreign ministers want to make their contribution to the debate but in a somewhat unconventional way , " german foreign ministry spokesman martin jäger told a news conference . in an effort to show that they 're " down with the kids , " steinmeier and kouchner slipped away from the franco-german summit held in the governmental quarter to record their ode to europe with a backing group of young people in berlin 's kreuzberg district , a heavily turkish section of the german capital . " no one has ever heard a french and german foreign minister singing together , " jäger added before the recording .
" on monday , this will happen . " unfortunately for almost everyone , this is n't the first time that politicians have revealed that their hearts belong to rock 'n'roll . bill blows , robert plucks , tony strums bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair 's " stairway to heaven " was a popular turn who can ever forget bill clinton 's shameless milking of his mediocre saxophone talent during campaign rallies ? and from the fringe is sure that robert mugabe 's double-bass skills would have attracted a much larger audience had the zimbabwean dictator not silenced the country 's music press along with everyone else . then there 's former british prime minister tony blair who was just plain old tony blair when he started playing guitar for his university rock band " ugly rumours . " unfortunately , his career in politics failed to dull the ex-labour party leader 's dream of making it big and he could never resist going through his repertoire of licks whenever an unsuspecting guitar was at hand .
even becoming the middle east quartet 's special envoy has failed to shake the stars from blair 's eyes . -lsb- ugly -rsb- rumours are rife that blair may be considering joining us president george w. bush and secretary of state condoleezza rice , a proficient pianist , in a performance at the upcoming middle east quartet 's meeting in annapolis this month . while the rumors suggest that no song has yet been chosen , it is believed that bush , blair and rice have vetoed a proposed reworking of pink floyd 's " get your filthy hands off my desert .

the german finance ministry also does not have plans to break up german energy companies , ministry spokesman torsten albig told reporters . but opening up the market to competition , energy prices in germany could be reduced to by 10 percent to 15 percent , a target that the hesse minister said he was pursuing in his own state commission concerned about energy prices in germany these views are shared by those in the european commission who are concerned at the amount of market control exerted by the four german energy companies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kroes said that liberalization was needed in germany eu competition commissioner neelie kroes argued again over the weekend for liberalization measures , saying that " in germany , prices are higher than you might expect in a market that was fully competitive .

" you are always talking about russia but the real threat is coming from the european commission , " the chief executive of german energy giant eon wulf bernotat told the financial times on monday , nov .
12 . many in europe have rung alarms over what they see as russian intentions to dominate the european energy sector through investments by groups such as the state-controlled gas monopoly gazprom . bernotat added , however , that he did not think commission plans to increase competition by breaking up big power groups through a process called unbundling would succeed because they were opposed by major eu members . " i am pretty sure unbundling is not coming , " he said .
" such processes in brussels take time especially if important member states such as france and germany are against it . " hesse minister joins calls for more competition meanwhile , the german state of hesse 's minister for economic affairs alois rhiel called for germany 's federal cartel office to have more power and to increase energy competition in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rwe and eon have the lion 's share rhiel called on the federal regulator to step up efforts to force the four big german energy groups - e.on , rwe , enbw and vattenfall - to put power stations up for sale in a bid to allow other companies into the sector .
together the four firms own over 75 percent of germany 's power stations .
e.on and rival rwe have a particularly dominant position in the country . he also called on germany 's minister for economic affairs michael glos to extend the law against competitive restrictions , so that the cartel office could control the prices of the energy and gas groups more strictly . a ministry spokesperson said separating energy production and delivery would be reserved as the last possible option in dealing with energy companies .
the german finance ministry also does not have plans to break up german energy companies , ministry spokesman torsten albig told reporters . but opening up the market to competition , energy prices in germany could be reduced to by 10 percent to 15 percent , a target that the hesse minister said he was pursuing in his own state commission concerned about energy prices in germany these views are shared by those in the european commission who are concerned at the amount of market control exerted by the four german energy companies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kroes said that liberalization was needed in germany eu competition commissioner neelie kroes argued again over the weekend for liberalization measures , saying that " in germany , prices are higher than you might expect in a market that was fully competitive . " the eu has started investigations into possible price fixing agreement between e.on and rwe . she added that the commission 's plan to break-up the two key activities of production and distribution was " indispensable " if consumers were to benefit from the lower prices for gas and electricity that an open market could provide . the german government has backed its big energy groups in the stand-off with eu officials , but berlin has said that position could change if power groups did not make a bigger effort to increase competition and transparency within their operations . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

airbus announced over the weekend that the emirates airline had placed an order that will net airbus over $ 20 billion -lrb- 13.8 billion euros -rrb- . us manufacturer boeing was pushed into the background at the dubai air show on sunday , nov .
11 , when the dubai-owned carrier announced it would buy 11 a380 superjumbos plus 70 midsized a350 xwb -lrb- extra wide body -rrb- aircraft in what airbus executives called the biggest order in the european constructor 's history . the total value of the new firm orders for the 70 a350s and 11 a380s is 20.2 billion dollars , according to airbus . an upbeat airbus sales chief john leahy raised forecast sales of the a350 xwb to " more than 300 " by year 's end .
he had expected 200 orders at the start of the year . boeing , whose b787 dreamliner is the major competitor to the a350 , won a comparatively modest $ 3.2 billion order from emirates for 12 of its b777-300s , bringing the dubai airline 's total outlay for new planes to over $ 23 billion at the show . seattle-based boeing also said in a statement it had signed an agreement with qatar airways for 30 787 dreamliners and five 777 cargo planes in a deal valued at over $ 6.1 billion at list prices . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : enders was happy and proud of emirates ' faith in airbus but the lion 's share of new orders announced sunday went to airbus , a fact welcomed by the company 's ceo tom enders . " emirates airline is placing great faith in our a350 xwb and a380 programs as well as our company and we are rightfully proud , " he said . the latest orders mark a dramatic turnaround for airbus , which was overtaken by rival boeing in the race for new business in 2006 .
the european plane maker had made a spectacular plunge into the red last year and has been beset this year by plane production woes . trade union warns cutbacks may affect orders however , some caution was added to the euphoria on monday when a leading french trade union warned that planned job cuts and site sales at airbus could jeopardize the company 's ability to fill the new orders . " we see a paradox in the accumulation of new orders ... and management 's implementation of power8 , with its job cuts and site sales , " jean-francois knepper , an organizer with force ouvriere -lrb- fo -rrb- , told reporters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus has committed to a plan of cuts and restructuring power8 is a sweeping - and contested - restructuring campaign launched by airbus last february in the face of costly production and delivery delays .
it calls notably for the elimination of 10,000 jobs over four years and the sale of certain production sites in order to achieve savings of 5 billion euros by 2010 . " how are we going to honor these -lsb- emirates -rsb- orders for the a350 when the plan to sell certain sites is not yet finalized ? "
knepper asked .
" time is passing and we are getting orders , but if our leaders do not reconsider the plan to sell sites under power8 , we will not be able to fill the orders on time . " with power8 , he added , " the company is temporarily de-stabilized at a time when we have to hold together . " emirates committing to long-term airbus orders as well as the 70 firm orders for the a350s - which are scheduled to come into service in 2013 - emirates chairman and chief executive sheikh ahmed bin saeed al-maktoum said the company had taken an option to buy a further 50 of the new-generation planes down the line .
he added that the airline had decided to order three more a380 superjumbos , and to firm up a previous option to buy a further eight . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first commercial a380 took off in singapore livery " the a350 xwb and a380 will play an important role in supporting emirates ' and dubai 's growth plans , " maktoum said .
" as the leading airline for the 21st century , it made sense for emirates to choose the a350 xwb - an aircraft designed with 21st century technologies . " the 70 firm orders - for 50 a350-900s and 20 a350-1000s - will make emirates the second biggest customer for the long-haul planes after qatar airways announced an order for 80 in june . the contract brings the number of a380s ordered by emirates to 58 , making it the world 's biggest customer for the superjumbo , which made its first commercial flight in the livery of singapore airlines last month . airbus also announced a $ 2-billion order from saudi business carrier nas for 20 airbus a320s , as well as an option to buy a further 18 of the short-haul planes . private superjumbo buyer revealed as saudi prince it was also revealed at the dubai air show that saudi billionaire prince alwaleed bin talal will be the first private buyer of an a380 superjumbo . the prospective buyer 's identity had been kept secret for months but was unveiled to coincide with the dubai air show . alwaleed , whose interests span kingdom holding to euro disney , hotels and banking , has ordered a vip version of the a380 dubbed the flying palace .
he already owns a boeing 747-400 , the newest type of the original jumbo jet currently in service . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 12.11.2007 living with germany 's biggest pharmaceutical disaster großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : markus with his sister : " this is my body and i have to live with its limitations " millions watched a controversial german tv film based on the thalidomide legacy last week .
on friday , nov .
9 , " side effects " was also released in english .
dw-world.de spoke to a thalidomide survivor and his mother . in the autumn of 1960 , margret schlömann , now 75 , had trouble sleeping during her pregnancy and had taken an over-the-counter sedative called contergan , which was produced by the privately owned german drug maker grünenthal . what schlömann and thousands of other pregnant women did not know was that contergan 's active ingredient was thalidomide , a toxic substance that severely stunts the growth of a developing embryo 's limbs .
in june 1961 , her son markus was born without arms and thumbs and fingers that jutted out from each shoulder . today markus schlömann , 46 , is one of around 2,800 thalidomide survivors living in germany .
born in bonn , he works for a bank , is an avid world traveler and has a seven-year-old daughter , lena . his mother also lives in bonn and helps look after lena . dw-world.de : frau schlömann , what was it like for you after giving birth to markus ? margret schlömann : markus was my first child , so i did n't know what to expect .
he also came six weeks early .
pre-maturity was common for thalidomide babies .
after a normal hospital delivery , he was whisked away and put in an incubator .
i did n't get to see my son .
nobody congratulated me .
no one spoke to me . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : without arms , markus needed the help of a harness to balance my husband herbert had arrived , bringing flowers , but he was intercepted by the doctor before seeing me .
i knew something was wrong .
" is the baby dead ? "
i asked herbert .
he broke the news to me .
i was in shock , physically exhausted from the birth , and suddenly overwhelmed with grief . i saw markus four days later .
my maternal instincts took over , and i held him close .
there was another mother in the ward with her perfectly normal baby .
she saw markus there without any arms , and shrieked " what is that thing ? " you must have wondered what caused your child to be born without arms . margret schlömann : a tiny percentage of babies have always been born with birth defects , and i thought that mother nature singled markus out to be that one random statistic . what i did n't know at the time was that clinics all over west germany were seeing a sudden , drastic boom in the number of babies born without arms or legs or any limbs at all . i joined a thalidomide support group for parents .
it became clear that some outside factor must have been responsible for the limb deformities , but what ? was it radioactivity from nuclear testing ?
the shampoo i was using ? then in november 1961 , it came out in the newspapers .
it was contergan .
i was hysterical .
my doctor had urged me to take contergan .
in those days , you simply did n't challenge doctors or authority figures . i took maybe two tablets throughout the pregnancy , but i was too busy to dwell on my feelings of guilt , which surfaced in later years .
after markus , the twins -lsb- who were healthy -rsb- came 18 months later , and restored a sense of normality in our lives . how did people react to markus ? margret schlömann : some were voyeurs - they were either fascinated or repulsed by his armless torso .
one old woman made such a nasty remark , " how could you bring such a freak into this world , " she hollered .
others pitied him .
his appearance obviously made people feel squeamish or uncomfortable . when he was a small child , the neighborhood kids taunted him , but the worst insults were directed at another thalidomide boy , who had no limbs , only extremities .
the kids flapped their arms and chanted , " penguin , penguin , see that penguin , ha , ha . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : markus ' brother -lrb- right -rrb- is 18 months younger .
by 1963 , thalidomide was off the market markus , have attitudes toward the disabled changed in germany ? markus schlömann : yes , definitely .
in the past , families felt ashamed of their disabled relatives and hid them from view , so handicapped people were far more isolated in the 60s than they are today . germans have become much more open talking about disability now .
this is in part due to the aids / hiv revolution and greater awareness of the so-called diseases of civilization in the last decades , when those afflicted came out of the closet . a lot of people do n't even notice my handicap anymore .
one colleague said , " can you get that folder on the top shelf ? "
then they realize i do n't have the arms to reach for it . it 's only when lena was born and started going to school that my disability became an issue again .
lena 's schoolmates are not cruel and insensitive as kids in the 60s were , but they get on my nerves .
" why are your arms so short ? " they keep asking over and over , even when they know the answer . but kids are like that ... markus schlömann : yes , but they can ask me other questions .
i do n't want to be defined by my disability . mostly adults , on the other hand , try to be helpful towards me .
one guy offered to bag my groceries even though i am perfectly capable of doing it myself .
i tried to be gracious about it , although i have some thalidomide friends who feel offended , even hostile towards such well-meaning gestures . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : markus had attended a special needs school you 've also traveled quite a bit .
you 've taken a greyhound bus across america , you 've been to india seven times , and taken trips to latin america , vietnam , thailand , indonesia , fiji , australia .
how do reactions toward your disability differ in those places in comparison to germany ? markus schlömann : i have never had a negative experience .
i 've always been a communicative person , and people respond in kind .
someone might be impressed by the way i can lift a coffee cup , but i do n't know how to do it any other way . in thailand , where extended family structures are part of the culture , people are astounded that i have a regular banking job .
they ask me , " why does n't your family take care of you ? " in some countries though , the infrastructure for handicapped people is not great .
germany is much further along in that respect .
the increasing acceptance of disabled people here is reflected in how our special needs are addressed .
public buildings are equipped with wheelchair ramps and cars are specially designed for people like me to drive . but in german schools , the physically handicapped are not exactly mainstreamed into the system .
there 's the so-called special needs school , which you attended . markus schlömann : there was no alternative when i went to school in the 60s and 70s .
the advantage of a special school is that the entire curriculum is geared towards your needs .
in the afternoons we had gymnastic training to strengthen our back muscles for example . we were all physically handicapped in some way and had great fun together , but by the time i graduated , i wanted to move out into the wider world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " a lot of people do n't even notice my handicap anymore " do you get frustrated about your physical limitations when you see others performing simple tasks that you struggle with ? markus schlömann : i wish i could have been born otherwise .
i would have liked to play the guitar .
i would have liked to be a marine biologist or a forester .
i wish that i could hold my daughter 's hand when we walk down the street .
but this is my body and i have to live with its limitations . there are so many thalidomide adults who are much worse off than me .
i have a good , well-paying job .
i can walk , ride a bike and play soccer . some of my friends have physical limitations that make them unemployable .
many people i have known have died from their severe disabilities , others committed suicide .
i think i 've come to terms with my life . diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" targeted sanctions against individuals or specific groups are , in principle , preferable to general sanctions imposed on states .
general sanctions often have dire consequences for vulnerable population groups in the countries concerned , and generally not for their leadership , " marty said in a report released sunday , nov .
11 .
lost credibility but , marty said , individual suspects placed on the lists did not have the right to reply and found it virtually impossible to clear their names .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marty : the lists are " unworthy " of the eu and un 's " lofty goals " " the present system of blacklists flouts the fundamental principles which are the basis of human rights , " he said in the report , which is due to be presented to the strasbourg-based council of europe on monday .
the un security council first established a list of al-qaeda and taliban suspects in 1999 .
it contains the names of 368 individuals and 124 entities .
the united nations said its members must freeze the assets , and prevent the entry into their territories , of anyone on the lists .
also , it must prevent the sale and transfer of arms to them .
the european union has set up its own blacklist .
marty said both organizations must respect " minimal norms of procedure and juridical safeguards " before imposing restrictions .
these norms included giving suspects the right to appeal to an independent and impartial organization and the right to compensation in the case of any miscarriage of justice .
attacks on cia practices he said the council of europe 's 47 member states should make sure such guarantees were offered .
in the past , the swiss senator has attacked the us practice of " extraordinary rendition " of terror suspects and secret cia prisons in countries with little regard for human rights .
while blacklisting " may be a useful instrument in certain circumstances and , in any event , for a limited period of time , " marty said it is unacceptable that no clear procedure is foreseen for getting off the blacklist .
" if one adds to this picture the practice of abductions -lsb- " extraordinary renditions " -rsb- , secret detention centers and the trivialization of torture , this provides a worrying , devastating message : principles that are as fundamental as the rule of law and the protection of human rights are optional accessories applicable only in fair weather .

marty highlighted the case of the people 's mujahedeen of iran , which forms part of the national council of resistance of iran and is on an eu blacklist despite a european court ruling in 2006 saying it should be removed from the list .
" despite recent procedural improvements it remains almost impossible , in practice , to be removed from the blacklist - a situation that is illegal and unacceptable , " marty wrote .

thalidomide babies developed abnormally short limbs - typically flipper-like fingers emerging from the shoulders .
other infants had eye and ear defects and no legs . a two-part tv film on public television , called " a single tablet " in german , dramatized one of the worst blunders by a drug company .
warner home video germany picked up the us rights to the film and released it as a double dvd under the new title " side effects " on friday , nov .
9 . thalidomide linked to birth defects bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thalidomide victims suffered varying degrees of deformity grünenthal , a private german drug company with an annual turnover of 800 million euros -lrb- $ 1.2 billion -rrb- , started selling thalidomide in october 1957 and only withdraw it as a sedative when findings linking it to birth defects were published by the german press in november 1961 .
the company 's owners are among the 30 wealthiest families in germany with a personal fortune estimated at about 3.3 billion euros according to manager magazin . widukind lenz , a hamburg pediatrician and geneticist , was one of the first to link thalidomide to the sudden surge in birth defects in the late 1950s and early 1960s .
he noticed that thalidomide babies were virtually non-existent in communist east germany , where contergan had not been approved for use . most cases in west germany west germany was hardest hit by thalidomide , with about half , or 5,000 , of all cases worldwide .
contergan was sold in almost 50 countries , but not in the united states , where the fda regulatory authorities refused to give it the green light . thalidomide was sold in canada , however , and it was fda newcomer frances kelsey , a canadian physician , who had resisted intense pressure to put thalidomide on the american market .
she was later decorated by president john f. kennedy in 1962 for her courage .
in 1970 , grünenthal paid a total of 100 million deutschmarks -lrb- $ 75 million , 51.1 million euros -rrb- in a settlement with germany 's thalidomide victims shortly after the civil settlement , the criminal trial of hermann wirtz , the company owner , and eight grünenthal executives was abandoned in december 1970 on the grounds that their guilt was impossible to establish . the german government had contributed a matching amount to the relief fund , which paid modest monthly sums to the survivors until it dried up 10 years ago .
since 1997 the government alone has continued to pay survivors up to 545 euros per month . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german victims are bitter about the 1970 settlement grünenthal is under no legal obligation to continue compensating the victims and has never issued an apology to thalidomide survivors or their families . higher compensation outside germany other countries , including canada , britain and sweden , had ensured more generous compensation .
now in their mid to late 40s , the survivors often suffer from arthritis and back problems resulting from a lifetime of awkward movement .
some of them are forced to retire early for health reasons and many live on social welfare . the two-part tv dramatization tells the story of a fictitious lawyer whose wife takes " just one tablet " of contergan , and gives birth to a daughter with no arms and only one leg . " what 's the matter ?
show me my baby , " says the mother , vera wegener , amid a ghastly silence in the delivery room .
" do n't worry , you can put it in an orphanage , " a doctor replies . another doctor calls the " deformed " daughter " horrible . " " in those days people did not speak of a ' disability , " ' adolf winkelmann of german public broadcaster wdr television told the german dpa news agency .
" the terms they used were pretty insensitive . " part one of the film had showed the lawyer gradually becoming convinced that contergan was responsible for his daughter 's condition .
the second part of the tv movie re-enacted the legal battle for compensating the victims . producers won legal battle to air tv film bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fda approved thalidomide to treat leprosy under strict regulations the film producers had spent 18 months in court with grünenthal executives and the real-life lawyer who led the compensation fight against the drug maker .
both the company and lawyer claimed they had been misrepresented by the film .
the dramatization was changed and now comes with disclaimers insisting that the characters do not represent actual people . several weeks ago , germany 's federal constitutional court struck down temporary injunctions aimed at keeping the tv film off the air .
it was aired on prime time last week with each episode drawing about 7 million viewers . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

on friday , nov .
9 , " side effects " was also released in english .
dw-world.de spoke to a thalidomide survivor and his mother . in the autumn of 1960 , margret schlömann , now 75 , had trouble sleeping during her pregnancy and had taken an over-the-counter sedative called contergan , which was produced by the privately owned german drug maker grünenthal . what schlömann and thousands of other pregnant women did not know was that contergan 's active ingredient was thalidomide , a toxic substance that severely stunts the growth of a developing embryo 's limbs .
in june 1961 , her son markus was born without arms and thumbs and fingers that jutted out from each shoulder . today markus schlömann , 46 , is one of around 2,800 thalidomide survivors living in germany .
born in bonn , he works for a bank , is an avid world traveler and has a seven-year-old daughter , lena . his mother also lives in bonn and helps look after lena . dw-world.de : frau schlömann , what was it like for you after giving birth to markus ? margret schlömann : markus was my first child , so i did n't know what to expect .
he also came six weeks early .
pre-maturity was common for thalidomide babies .
after a normal hospital delivery , he was whisked away and put in an incubator .
i did n't get to see my son .
nobody congratulated me .
no one spoke to me . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : without arms , markus needed the help of a harness to balance my husband herbert had arrived , bringing flowers , but he was intercepted by the doctor before seeing me .
i knew something was wrong .
" is the baby dead ? "
i asked herbert .
he broke the news to me .
i was in shock , physically exhausted from the birth , and suddenly overwhelmed with grief . i saw markus four days later .
my maternal instincts took over , and i held him close .
there was another mother in the ward with her perfectly normal baby .
she saw markus there without any arms , and shrieked " what is that thing ? " you must have wondered what caused your child to be born without arms . margret schlömann : a tiny percentage of babies have always been born with birth defects , and i thought that mother nature singled markus out to be that one random statistic . what i did n't know at the time was that clinics all over west germany were seeing a sudden , drastic boom in the number of babies born without arms or legs or any limbs at all . i joined a thalidomide support group for parents .
it became clear that some outside factor must have been responsible for the limb deformities , but what ? was it radioactivity from nuclear testing ?
the shampoo i was using ? then in november 1961 , it came out in the newspapers .
it was contergan .
i was hysterical .
my doctor had urged me to take contergan .
in those days , you simply did n't challenge doctors or authority figures . i took maybe two tablets throughout the pregnancy , but i was too busy to dwell on my feelings of guilt , which surfaced in later years .
after markus , the twins -lsb- who were healthy -rsb- came 18 months later , and restored a sense of normality in our lives . how did people react to markus ? margret schlömann : some were voyeurs - they were either fascinated or repulsed by his armless torso .
one old woman made such a nasty remark , " how could you bring such a freak into this world , " she hollered .
others pitied him .
his appearance obviously made people feel squeamish or uncomfortable . when he was a small child , the neighborhood kids taunted him , but the worst insults were directed at another thalidomide boy , who had no limbs , only extremities .
the kids flapped their arms and chanted , " penguin , penguin , see that penguin , ha , ha . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : markus ' brother -lrb- right -rrb- is 18 months younger .
by 1963 , thalidomide was off the market markus , have attitudes toward the disabled changed in germany ? markus schlömann : yes , definitely .
in the past , families felt ashamed of their disabled relatives and hid them from view , so handicapped people were far more isolated in the 60s than they are today . germans have become much more open talking about disability now .
this is in part due to the aids / hiv revolution and greater awareness of the so-called diseases of civilization in the last decades , when those afflicted came out of the closet . a lot of people do n't even notice my handicap anymore .
one colleague said , " can you get that folder on the top shelf ? "
then they realize i do n't have the arms to reach for it . it 's only when lena was born and started going to school that my disability became an issue again .
lena 's schoolmates are not cruel and insensitive as kids in the 60s were , but they get on my nerves .
" why are your arms so short ? " they keep asking over and over , even when they know the answer . but kids are like that ... markus schlömann : yes , but they can ask me other questions .
i do n't want to be defined by my disability . mostly adults , on the other hand , try to be helpful towards me .
one guy offered to bag my groceries even though i am perfectly capable of doing it myself .
i tried to be gracious about it , although i have some thalidomide friends who feel offended , even hostile towards such well-meaning gestures . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : markus had attended a special needs school you 've also traveled quite a bit .
you 've taken a greyhound bus across america , you 've been to india seven times , and taken trips to latin america , vietnam , thailand , indonesia , fiji , australia .
how do reactions toward your disability differ in those places in comparison to germany ? markus schlömann : i have never had a negative experience .
i 've always been a communicative person , and people respond in kind .
someone might be impressed by the way i can lift a coffee cup , but i do n't know how to do it any other way . in thailand , where extended family structures are part of the culture , people are astounded that i have a regular banking job .
they ask me , " why does n't your family take care of you ? " in some countries though , the infrastructure for handicapped people is not great .
germany is much further along in that respect .
the increasing acceptance of disabled people here is reflected in how our special needs are addressed .
public buildings are equipped with wheelchair ramps and cars are specially designed for people like me to drive . but in german schools , the physically handicapped are not exactly mainstreamed into the system .
there 's the so-called special needs school , which you attended . markus schlömann : there was no alternative when i went to school in the 60s and 70s .
the advantage of a special school is that the entire curriculum is geared towards your needs .
in the afternoons we had gymnastic training to strengthen our back muscles for example . we were all physically handicapped in some way and had great fun together , but by the time i graduated , i wanted to move out into the wider world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " a lot of people do n't even notice my handicap anymore " do you get frustrated about your physical limitations when you see others performing simple tasks that you struggle with ? markus schlömann : i wish i could have been born otherwise .
i would have liked to play the guitar .
i would have liked to be a marine biologist or a forester .
i wish that i could hold my daughter 's hand when we walk down the street .
but this is my body and i have to live with its limitations . there are so many thalidomide adults who are much worse off than me .
i have a good , well-paying job .
i can walk , ride a bike and play soccer . some of my friends have physical limitations that make them unemployable .
many people i have known have died from their severe disabilities , others committed suicide .
i think i 've come to terms with my life . diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 12.11.2007 fictional thalidomide victim haunts germans after 50 years großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a single sedative was enough to cause severe birth defects after a protracted legal battle , producers of a drama about germany 's thalidomide disaster from 1958-1962 won the right to air their two-part film on prime time television . contergan , a sedative that contained thalidomide , caused severe birth defects in 10,000 children worldwide when it was introduced on the market 50 years ago . the drug was sold over-the-counter and was also used by mothers-to-be as a remedy for morning sickness , but had devastating consequences for the developing embryo .
thalidomide babies developed abnormally short limbs - typically flipper-like fingers emerging from the shoulders .
other infants had eye and ear defects and no legs . a two-part tv film on public television , called " a single tablet " in german , dramatized one of the worst blunders by a drug company .
warner home video germany picked up the us rights to the film and released it as a double dvd under the new title " side effects " on friday , nov .
9 . thalidomide linked to birth defects bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thalidomide victims suffered varying degrees of deformity grünenthal , a private german drug company with an annual turnover of 800 million euros -lrb- $ 1.2 billion -rrb- , started selling thalidomide in october 1957 and only withdraw it as a sedative when findings linking it to birth defects were published by the german press in november 1961 .
the company 's owners are among the 30 wealthiest families in germany with a personal fortune estimated at about 3.3 billion euros according to manager magazin . widukind lenz , a hamburg pediatrician and geneticist , was one of the first to link thalidomide to the sudden surge in birth defects in the late 1950s and early 1960s .
he noticed that thalidomide babies were virtually non-existent in communist east germany , where contergan had not been approved for use . most cases in west germany west germany was hardest hit by thalidomide , with about half , or 5,000 , of all cases worldwide .
contergan was sold in almost 50 countries , but not in the united states , where the fda regulatory authorities refused to give it the green light . thalidomide was sold in canada , however , and it was fda newcomer frances kelsey , a canadian physician , who had resisted intense pressure to put thalidomide on the american market .
she was later decorated by president john f. kennedy in 1962 for her courage .
in 1970 , grünenthal paid a total of 100 million deutschmarks -lrb- $ 75 million , 51.1 million euros -rrb- in a settlement with germany 's thalidomide victims shortly after the civil settlement , the criminal trial of hermann wirtz , the company owner , and eight grünenthal executives was abandoned in december 1970 on the grounds that their guilt was impossible to establish . the german government had contributed a matching amount to the relief fund , which paid modest monthly sums to the survivors until it dried up 10 years ago .
since 1997 the government alone has continued to pay survivors up to 545 euros per month . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german victims are bitter about the 1970 settlement grünenthal is under no legal obligation to continue compensating the victims and has never issued an apology to thalidomide survivors or their families . higher compensation outside germany other countries , including canada , britain and sweden , had ensured more generous compensation .
now in their mid to late 40s , the survivors often suffer from arthritis and back problems resulting from a lifetime of awkward movement .
some of them are forced to retire early for health reasons and many live on social welfare . the two-part tv dramatization tells the story of a fictitious lawyer whose wife takes " just one tablet " of contergan , and gives birth to a daughter with no arms and only one leg . " what 's the matter ?
show me my baby , " says the mother , vera wegener , amid a ghastly silence in the delivery room .
" do n't worry , you can put it in an orphanage , " a doctor replies . another doctor calls the " deformed " daughter " horrible . " " in those days people did not speak of a ' disability , " ' adolf winkelmann of german public broadcaster wdr television told the german dpa news agency .
" the terms they used were pretty insensitive . " part one of the film had showed the lawyer gradually becoming convinced that contergan was responsible for his daughter 's condition .
the second part of the tv movie re-enacted the legal battle for compensating the victims . producers won legal battle to air tv film bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fda approved thalidomide to treat leprosy under strict regulations the film producers had spent 18 months in court with grünenthal executives and the real-life lawyer who led the compensation fight against the drug maker .
both the company and lawyer claimed they had been misrepresented by the film .
the dramatization was changed and now comes with disclaimers insisting that the characters do not represent actual people . several weeks ago , germany 's federal constitutional court struck down temporary injunctions aimed at keeping the tv film off the air .
it was aired on prime time last week with each episode drawing about 7 million viewers . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

on friday , nov .
9 , " side effects " was also released in english .
dw-world.de spoke to a thalidomide survivor and his mother . in the autumn of 1960 , margret schlömann , now 75 , had trouble sleeping during her pregnancy and had taken an over-the-counter sedative called contergan , which was produced by the privately owned german drug maker grünenthal . what schlömann and thousands of other pregnant women did not know was that contergan 's active ingredient was thalidomide , a toxic substance that severely stunts the growth of a developing embryo 's limbs .
in june 1961 , her son markus was born without arms and thumbs and fingers that jutted out from each shoulder . today markus schlömann , 46 , is one of around 2,800 thalidomide survivors living in germany .
born in bonn , he works for a bank , is an avid world traveler and has a seven-year-old daughter , lena . his mother also lives in bonn and helps look after lena . dw-world.de : frau schlömann , what was it like for you after giving birth to markus ? margret schlömann : markus was my first child , so i did n't know what to expect .
he also came six weeks early .
pre-maturity was common for thalidomide babies .
after a normal hospital delivery , he was whisked away and put in an incubator .
i did n't get to see my son .
nobody congratulated me .
no one spoke to me . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : without arms , markus needed the help of a harness to balance my husband herbert had arrived , bringing flowers , but he was intercepted by the doctor before seeing me .
i knew something was wrong .
" is the baby dead ? "
i asked herbert .
he broke the news to me .
i was in shock , physically exhausted from the birth , and suddenly overwhelmed with grief . i saw markus four days later .
my maternal instincts took over , and i held him close .
there was another mother in the ward with her perfectly normal baby .
she saw markus there without any arms , and shrieked " what is that thing ? " you must have wondered what caused your child to be born without arms . margret schlömann : a tiny percentage of babies have always been born with birth defects , and i thought that mother nature singled markus out to be that one random statistic . what i did n't know at the time was that clinics all over west germany were seeing a sudden , drastic boom in the number of babies born without arms or legs or any limbs at all . i joined a thalidomide support group for parents .
it became clear that some outside factor must have been responsible for the limb deformities , but what ? was it radioactivity from nuclear testing ?
the shampoo i was using ? then in november 1961 , it came out in the newspapers .
it was contergan .
i was hysterical .
my doctor had urged me to take contergan .
in those days , you simply did n't challenge doctors or authority figures . i took maybe two tablets throughout the pregnancy , but i was too busy to dwell on my feelings of guilt , which surfaced in later years .
after markus , the twins -lsb- who were healthy -rsb- came 18 months later , and restored a sense of normality in our lives . how did people react to markus ? margret schlömann : some were voyeurs - they were either fascinated or repulsed by his armless torso .
one old woman made such a nasty remark , " how could you bring such a freak into this world , " she hollered .
others pitied him .
his appearance obviously made people feel squeamish or uncomfortable . when he was a small child , the neighborhood kids taunted him , but the worst insults were directed at another thalidomide boy , who had no limbs , only extremities .
the kids flapped their arms and chanted , " penguin , penguin , see that penguin , ha , ha . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : markus ' brother -lrb- right -rrb- is 18 months younger .
by 1963 , thalidomide was off the market markus , have attitudes toward the disabled changed in germany ? markus schlömann : yes , definitely .
in the past , families felt ashamed of their disabled relatives and hid them from view , so handicapped people were far more isolated in the 60s than they are today . germans have become much more open talking about disability now .
this is in part due to the aids / hiv revolution and greater awareness of the so-called diseases of civilization in the last decades , when those afflicted came out of the closet . a lot of people do n't even notice my handicap anymore .
one colleague said , " can you get that folder on the top shelf ? "
then they realize i do n't have the arms to reach for it . it 's only when lena was born and started going to school that my disability became an issue again .
lena 's schoolmates are not cruel and insensitive as kids in the 60s were , but they get on my nerves .
" why are your arms so short ? " they keep asking over and over , even when they know the answer . but kids are like that ... markus schlömann : yes , but they can ask me other questions .
i do n't want to be defined by my disability . mostly adults , on the other hand , try to be helpful towards me .
one guy offered to bag my groceries even though i am perfectly capable of doing it myself .
i tried to be gracious about it , although i have some thalidomide friends who feel offended , even hostile towards such well-meaning gestures . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : markus had attended a special needs school you 've also traveled quite a bit .
you 've taken a greyhound bus across america , you 've been to india seven times , and taken trips to latin america , vietnam , thailand , indonesia , fiji , australia .
how do reactions toward your disability differ in those places in comparison to germany ? markus schlömann : i have never had a negative experience .
i 've always been a communicative person , and people respond in kind .
someone might be impressed by the way i can lift a coffee cup , but i do n't know how to do it any other way . in thailand , where extended family structures are part of the culture , people are astounded that i have a regular banking job .
they ask me , " why does n't your family take care of you ? " in some countries though , the infrastructure for handicapped people is not great .
germany is much further along in that respect .
the increasing acceptance of disabled people here is reflected in how our special needs are addressed .
public buildings are equipped with wheelchair ramps and cars are specially designed for people like me to drive . but in german schools , the physically handicapped are not exactly mainstreamed into the system .
there 's the so-called special needs school , which you attended . markus schlömann : there was no alternative when i went to school in the 60s and 70s .
the advantage of a special school is that the entire curriculum is geared towards your needs .
in the afternoons we had gymnastic training to strengthen our back muscles for example . we were all physically handicapped in some way and had great fun together , but by the time i graduated , i wanted to move out into the wider world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " a lot of people do n't even notice my handicap anymore " do you get frustrated about your physical limitations when you see others performing simple tasks that you struggle with ? markus schlömann : i wish i could have been born otherwise .
i would have liked to play the guitar .
i would have liked to be a marine biologist or a forester .
i wish that i could hold my daughter 's hand when we walk down the street .
but this is my body and i have to live with its limitations . there are so many thalidomide adults who are much worse off than me .
i have a good , well-paying job .
i can walk , ride a bike and play soccer . some of my friends have physical limitations that make them unemployable .
many people i have known have died from their severe disabilities , others committed suicide .
i think i 've come to terms with my life . diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" targeted sanctions against individuals or specific groups are , in principle , preferable to general sanctions imposed on states .
general sanctions often have dire consequences for vulnerable population groups in the countries concerned , and generally not for their leadership , " marty said in a report released sunday , nov .
11 .
lost credibility but , marty said , individual suspects placed on the lists did not have the right to reply and found it virtually impossible to clear their names .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marty : the lists are " unworthy " of the eu and un 's " lofty goals " " the present system of blacklists flouts the fundamental principles which are the basis of human rights , " he said in the report , which is due to be presented to the strasbourg-based council of europe on monday .
the un security council first established a list of al-qaeda and taliban suspects in 1999 .
it contains the names of 368 individuals and 124 entities .
the united nations said its members must freeze the assets , and prevent the entry into their territories , of anyone on the lists .
also , it must prevent the sale and transfer of arms to them .
the european union has set up its own blacklist .
marty said both organizations must respect " minimal norms of procedure and juridical safeguards " before imposing restrictions .
these norms included giving suspects the right to appeal to an independent and impartial organization and the right to compensation in the case of any miscarriage of justice .
attacks on cia practices he said the council of europe 's 47 member states should make sure such guarantees were offered .
in the past , the swiss senator has attacked the us practice of " extraordinary rendition " of terror suspects and secret cia prisons in countries with little regard for human rights .
while blacklisting " may be a useful instrument in certain circumstances and , in any event , for a limited period of time , " marty said it is unacceptable that no clear procedure is foreseen for getting off the blacklist .
" if one adds to this picture the practice of abductions -lsb- " extraordinary renditions " -rsb- , secret detention centers and the trivialization of torture , this provides a worrying , devastating message : principles that are as fundamental as the rule of law and the protection of human rights are optional accessories applicable only in fair weather . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the council of europe guarantee the rights of those blacklisted ?
marty highlighted the case of the people 's mujahedeen of iran , which forms part of the national council of resistance of iran and is on an eu blacklist despite a european court ruling in 2006 saying it should be removed from the list .
" despite recent procedural improvements it remains almost impossible , in practice , to be removed from the blacklist - a situation that is illegal and unacceptable , " marty wrote .
in another example , yussef nada , an italian businessman of egyptian origin living in switzerland for three decades , was placed on such a blacklist in 2001 on suspicion of having financed the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks .
his assets were seized and his freedom of movement was severely restricted .
he was not informed and was unable to appeal the decision , he has said .
six years later , the 78-year-old remains blacklisted despite law enforcement agencies in two countries " not finding a shred of evidence of any wrongdoing , " marty said . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

thalidomide babies developed abnormally short limbs - typically flipper-like fingers emerging from the shoulders .
other infants had eye and ear defects and no legs . a two-part tv film on public television , called " a single tablet " in german , dramatized one of the worst blunders by a drug company .
warner home video germany picked up the us rights to the film and released it as a double dvd under the new title " side effects " on friday , nov .
9 . thalidomide linked to birth defects bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thalidomide victims suffered varying degrees of deformity grünenthal , a private german drug company with an annual turnover of 800 million euros -lrb- $ 1.2 billion -rrb- , started selling thalidomide in october 1957 and only withdraw it as a sedative when findings linking it to birth defects were published by the german press in november 1961 .
the company 's owners are among the 30 wealthiest families in germany with a personal fortune estimated at about 3.3 billion euros according to manager magazin . widukind lenz , a hamburg pediatrician and geneticist , was one of the first to link thalidomide to the sudden surge in birth defects in the late 1950s and early 1960s .
he noticed that thalidomide babies were virtually non-existent in communist east germany , where contergan had not been approved for use . most cases in west germany west germany was hardest hit by thalidomide , with about half , or 5,000 , of all cases worldwide .
contergan was sold in almost 50 countries , but not in the united states , where the fda regulatory authorities refused to give it the green light . thalidomide was sold in canada , however , and it was fda newcomer frances kelsey , a canadian physician , who had resisted intense pressure to put thalidomide on the american market .
she was later decorated by president john f. kennedy in 1962 for her courage .
in 1970 , grünenthal paid a total of 100 million deutschmarks -lrb- $ 75 million , 51.1 million euros -rrb- in a settlement with germany 's thalidomide victims shortly after the civil settlement , the criminal trial of hermann wirtz , the company owner , and eight grünenthal executives was abandoned in december 1970 on the grounds that their guilt was impossible to establish . the german government had contributed a matching amount to the relief fund , which paid modest monthly sums to the survivors until it dried up 10 years ago .
since 1997 the government alone has continued to pay survivors up to 545 euros per month . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german victims are bitter about the 1970 settlement grünenthal is under no legal obligation to continue compensating the victims and has never issued an apology to thalidomide survivors or their families . higher compensation outside germany other countries , including canada , britain and sweden , had ensured more generous compensation .
now in their mid to late 40s , the survivors often suffer from arthritis and back problems resulting from a lifetime of awkward movement .
some of them are forced to retire early for health reasons and many live on social welfare . the two-part tv dramatization tells the story of a fictitious lawyer whose wife takes " just one tablet " of contergan , and gives birth to a daughter with no arms and only one leg . " what 's the matter ?
show me my baby , " says the mother , vera wegener , amid a ghastly silence in the delivery room .
" do n't worry , you can put it in an orphanage , " a doctor replies . another doctor calls the " deformed " daughter " horrible . " " in those days people did not speak of a ' disability , " ' adolf winkelmann of german public broadcaster wdr television told the german dpa news agency .
" the terms they used were pretty insensitive . " part one of the film had showed the lawyer gradually becoming convinced that contergan was responsible for his daughter 's condition .
the second part of the tv movie re-enacted the legal battle for compensating the victims . producers won legal battle to air tv film bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fda approved thalidomide to treat leprosy under strict regulations the film producers had spent 18 months in court with grünenthal executives and the real-life lawyer who led the compensation fight against the drug maker .
both the company and lawyer claimed they had been misrepresented by the film .
the dramatization was changed and now comes with disclaimers insisting that the characters do not represent actual people . several weeks ago , germany 's federal constitutional court struck down temporary injunctions aimed at keeping the tv film off the air .
it was aired on prime time last week with each episode drawing about 7 million viewers . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the meetings took different tones , but both show the gap is closing over the atlantic , said dw 's christina bergmann . the trans-atlantic ice age is over .
if anyone still needed proof that the us on one side , and france and germany on the other , want to start a new chapter in their respective bilateral relationships , then they got it this past week . the east german physicist , german chancellor angela merkel , and the son of a hungarian immigrant , french president nicolas sarkozy , each took different approaches to their meetings with us president george w. bush . in a speech to the us congress , sarkozy pointed out that the two countries had had a long history together prior to the disagreement over the iraq war .
he practically fell over himself with enthusiasm for the united states and left out the iraq topic altogether , just to be on the safe side .
he has to be careful , however , not to take former british prime minister tony blair 's place as the american president 's " poodle . "
after all , those who wish to have influence on someone must be able to look them in the eye . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel is cleverer .
she did n't accept the invitation to the ranch - and its accompanying presidential honor - until her relationship to bush had solidified and she had given him her opinion on numerous occasions .
the president has no problem with that .
he 's proven more than once that he sticks by those who he 's taken a liking to - in good times and bad . it 's not only merkel and sarkozy 's differing personalities and destinies that contribute to the closing of ranks .
everyone knows that bush 's days are numbered .
both sarkozy and merkel will most likely have to do deal with his successor and are interested in setting the course now . in his last year in office , the american president is trying to save what 's left to save .
he continually emphasizes that he does n't make decisions based on opinion polls and that conclusions are n't made until much later .
nevertheless , he does n't want to leave with nothing to show for his time in office . both sides have recognized that things do n't work without the other .
the us is and will remain the only superpower that has the resources and the will to get involved in crisis areas .
but without influential allies , it ca n't be successful .
simply writing off " old " europe , as former us defense minister donald rumsfeld did , does n't work .
still , the countries of " new " europe - with all due respect - have a long road ahead of them before they even remotely attain the political clout that germany and france have . europeans have recognized that they ca n't solve crises alone - from kosovo 's status and the conflict in the middle east to global climate change .
they need the united states .
even in the nuclear conflict with iran .

airbus announced over the weekend that the emirates airline had placed an order that will net airbus over $ 20 billion -lrb- 13.8 billion euros -rrb- . us manufacturer boeing was pushed into the background at the dubai air show on sunday , nov .
11 , when the dubai-owned carrier announced it would buy 11 a380 superjumbos plus 70 midsized a350 xwb -lrb- extra wide body -rrb- aircraft in what airbus executives called the biggest order in the european constructor 's history . the total value of the new firm orders for the 70 a350s and 11 a380s is 20.2 billion dollars , according to airbus . an upbeat airbus sales chief john leahy raised forecast sales of the a350 xwb to " more than 300 " by year 's end .
he had expected 200 orders at the start of the year . boeing , whose b787 dreamliner is the major competitor to the a350 , won a comparatively modest $ 3.2 billion order from emirates for 12 of its b777-300s , bringing the dubai airline 's total outlay for new planes to over $ 23 billion at the show . seattle-based boeing also said in a statement it had signed an agreement with qatar airways for 30 787 dreamliners and five 777 cargo planes in a deal valued at over $ 6.1 billion at list prices . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : enders was happy and proud of emirates ' faith in airbus but the lion 's share of new orders announced sunday went to airbus , a fact welcomed by the company 's ceo tom enders . " emirates airline is placing great faith in our a350 xwb and a380 programs as well as our company and we are rightfully proud , " he said . the latest orders mark a dramatic turnaround for airbus , which was overtaken by rival boeing in the race for new business in 2006 .
the european plane maker had made a spectacular plunge into the red last year and has been beset this year by plane production woes . trade union warns cutbacks may affect orders however , some caution was added to the euphoria on monday when a leading french trade union warned that planned job cuts and site sales at airbus could jeopardize the company 's ability to fill the new orders . " we see a paradox in the accumulation of new orders ... and management 's implementation of power8 , with its job cuts and site sales , " jean-francois knepper , an organizer with force ouvriere -lrb- fo -rrb- , told reporters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus has committed to a plan of cuts and restructuring power8 is a sweeping - and contested - restructuring campaign launched by airbus last february in the face of costly production and delivery delays .
it calls notably for the elimination of 10,000 jobs over four years and the sale of certain production sites in order to achieve savings of 5 billion euros by 2010 . " how are we going to honor these -lsb- emirates -rsb- orders for the a350 when the plan to sell certain sites is not yet finalized ? "
knepper asked .
" time is passing and we are getting orders , but if our leaders do not reconsider the plan to sell sites under power8 , we will not be able to fill the orders on time . " with power8 , he added , " the company is temporarily de-stabilized at a time when we have to hold together . " emirates committing to long-term airbus orders as well as the 70 firm orders for the a350s - which are scheduled to come into service in 2013 - emirates chairman and chief executive sheikh ahmed bin saeed al-maktoum said the company had taken an option to buy a further 50 of the new-generation planes down the line .
he added that the airline had decided to order three more a380 superjumbos , and to firm up a previous option to buy a further eight . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first commercial a380 took off in singapore livery " the a350 xwb and a380 will play an important role in supporting emirates ' and dubai 's growth plans , " maktoum said .
" as the leading airline for the 21st century , it made sense for emirates to choose the a350 xwb - an aircraft designed with 21st century technologies . " the 70 firm orders - for 50 a350-900s and 20 a350-1000s - will make emirates the second biggest customer for the long-haul planes after qatar airways announced an order for 80 in june . the contract brings the number of a380s ordered by emirates to 58 , making it the world 's biggest customer for the superjumbo , which made its first commercial flight in the livery of singapore airlines last month . airbus also announced a $ 2-billion order from saudi business carrier nas for 20 airbus a320s , as well as an option to buy a further 18 of the short-haul planes . private superjumbo buyer revealed as saudi prince it was also revealed at the dubai air show that saudi billionaire prince alwaleed bin talal will be the first private buyer of an a380 superjumbo . the prospective buyer 's identity had been kept secret for months but was unveiled to coincide with the dubai air show . alwaleed , whose interests span kingdom holding to euro disney , hotels and banking , has ordered a vip version of the a380 dubbed the flying palace .

" emirates committing to long-term airbus orders as well as the 70 firm orders for the a350s - which are scheduled to come into service in 2013 - emirates chairman and chief executive sheikh ahmed bin saeed al-maktoum said the company had taken an option to buy a further 50 of the new-generation planes down the line .

airbus announced over the weekend that the emirates airline had placed an order that will net airbus over $ 20 billion -lrb- 13.8 billion euros -rrb- . us manufacturer boeing was pushed into the background at the dubai air show on sunday , nov .
11 , when the dubai-owned carrier announced it would buy 11 a380 superjumbos plus 70 midsized a350 xwb -lrb- extra wide body -rrb- aircraft in what airbus executives called the biggest order in the european constructor 's history . the total value of the new firm orders for the 70 a350s and 11 a380s is 20.2 billion dollars , according to airbus . an upbeat airbus sales chief john leahy raised forecast sales of the a350 xwb to " more than 300 " by year 's end .
he had expected 200 orders at the start of the year . boeing , whose b787 dreamliner is the major competitor to the a350 , won a comparatively modest $ 3.2 billion order from emirates for 12 of its b777-300s , bringing the dubai airline 's total outlay for new planes to over $ 23 billion at the show . seattle-based boeing also said in a statement it had signed an agreement with qatar airways for 30 787 dreamliners and five 777 cargo planes in a deal valued at over $ 6.1 billion at list prices . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : enders was happy and proud of emirates ' faith in airbus but the lion 's share of new orders announced sunday went to airbus , a fact welcomed by the company 's ceo tom enders . " emirates airline is placing great faith in our a350 xwb and a380 programs as well as our company and we are rightfully proud , " he said . the latest orders mark a dramatic turnaround for airbus , which was overtaken by rival boeing in the race for new business in 2006 .
the european plane maker had made a spectacular plunge into the red last year and has been beset this year by plane production woes . trade union warns cutbacks may affect orders however , some caution was added to the euphoria on monday when a leading french trade union warned that planned job cuts and site sales at airbus could jeopardize the company 's ability to fill the new orders . " we see a paradox in the accumulation of new orders ... and management 's implementation of power8 , with its job cuts and site sales , " jean-francois knepper , an organizer with force ouvriere -lrb- fo -rrb- , told reporters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus has committed to a plan of cuts and restructuring power8 is a sweeping - and contested - restructuring campaign launched by airbus last february in the face of costly production and delivery delays .
it calls notably for the elimination of 10,000 jobs over four years and the sale of certain production sites in order to achieve savings of 5 billion euros by 2010 . " how are we going to honor these -lsb- emirates -rsb- orders for the a350 when the plan to sell certain sites is not yet finalized ? "
knepper asked .
" time is passing and we are getting orders , but if our leaders do not reconsider the plan to sell sites under power8 , we will not be able to fill the orders on time . " with power8 , he added , " the company is temporarily de-stabilized at a time when we have to hold together . " emirates committing to long-term airbus orders as well as the 70 firm orders for the a350s - which are scheduled to come into service in 2013 - emirates chairman and chief executive sheikh ahmed bin saeed al-maktoum said the company had taken an option to buy a further 50 of the new-generation planes down the line .

" you are always talking about russia but the real threat is coming from the european commission , " the chief executive of german energy giant eon wulf bernotat told the financial times on monday , nov .
12 . many in europe have rung alarms over what they see as russian intentions to dominate the european energy sector through investments by groups such as the state-controlled gas monopoly gazprom . bernotat added , however , that he did not think commission plans to increase competition by breaking up big power groups through a process called unbundling would succeed because they were opposed by major eu members . " i am pretty sure unbundling is not coming , " he said .
" such processes in brussels take time especially if important member states such as france and germany are against it . " hesse minister joins calls for more competition meanwhile , the german state of hesse 's minister for economic affairs alois rhiel called for germany 's federal cartel office to have more power and to increase energy competition in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rwe and eon have the lion 's share rhiel called on the federal regulator to step up efforts to force the four big german energy groups - e.on , rwe , enbw and vattenfall - to put power stations up for sale in a bid to allow other companies into the sector .
together the four firms own over 75 percent of germany 's power stations .
e.on and rival rwe have a particularly dominant position in the country . he also called on germany 's minister for economic affairs michael glos to extend the law against competitive restrictions , so that the cartel office could control the prices of the energy and gas groups more strictly . a ministry spokesperson said separating energy production and delivery would be reserved as the last possible option in dealing with energy companies .
the german finance ministry also does not have plans to break up german energy companies , ministry spokesman torsten albig told reporters . but opening up the market to competition , energy prices in germany could be reduced to by 10 percent to 15 percent , a target that the hesse minister said he was pursuing in his own state commission concerned about energy prices in germany these views are shared by those in the european commission who are concerned at the amount of market control exerted by the four german energy companies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kroes said that liberalization was needed in germany eu competition commissioner neelie kroes argued again over the weekend for liberalization measures , saying that " in germany , prices are higher than you might expect in a market that was fully competitive . " the eu has started investigations into possible price fixing agreement between e.on and rwe . she added that the commission 's plan to break-up the two key activities of production and distribution was " indispensable " if consumers were to benefit from the lower prices for gas and electricity that an open market could provide . the german government has backed its big energy groups in the stand-off with eu officials , but berlin has said that position could change if power groups did not make a bigger effort to increase competition and transparency within their operations . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

airbus announced over the weekend that the emirates airline had placed an order that will net airbus over $ 20 billion -lrb- 13.8 billion euros -rrb- . us manufacturer boeing was pushed into the background at the dubai air show on sunday , nov .
11 , when the dubai-owned carrier announced it would buy 11 a380 superjumbos plus 70 midsized a350 xwb -lrb- extra wide body -rrb- aircraft in what airbus executives called the biggest order in the european constructor 's history . the total value of the new firm orders for the 70 a350s and 11 a380s is 20.2 billion dollars , according to airbus . an upbeat airbus sales chief john leahy raised forecast sales of the a350 xwb to " more than 300 " by year 's end .
he had expected 200 orders at the start of the year . boeing , whose b787 dreamliner is the major competitor to the a350 , won a comparatively modest $ 3.2 billion order from emirates for 12 of its b777-300s , bringing the dubai airline 's total outlay for new planes to over $ 23 billion at the show . seattle-based boeing also said in a statement it had signed an agreement with qatar airways for 30 787 dreamliners and five 777 cargo planes in a deal valued at over $ 6.1 billion at list prices . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : enders was happy and proud of emirates ' faith in airbus but the lion 's share of new orders announced sunday went to airbus , a fact welcomed by the company 's ceo tom enders . " emirates airline is placing great faith in our a350 xwb and a380 programs as well as our company and we are rightfully proud , " he said . the latest orders mark a dramatic turnaround for airbus , which was overtaken by rival boeing in the race for new business in 2006 .
the european plane maker had made a spectacular plunge into the red last year and has been beset this year by plane production woes . trade union warns cutbacks may affect orders however , some caution was added to the euphoria on monday when a leading french trade union warned that planned job cuts and site sales at airbus could jeopardize the company 's ability to fill the new orders . " we see a paradox in the accumulation of new orders ... and management 's implementation of power8 , with its job cuts and site sales , " jean-francois knepper , an organizer with force ouvriere -lrb- fo -rrb- , told reporters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus has committed to a plan of cuts and restructuring power8 is a sweeping - and contested - restructuring campaign launched by airbus last february in the face of costly production and delivery delays .
it calls notably for the elimination of 10,000 jobs over four years and the sale of certain production sites in order to achieve savings of 5 billion euros by 2010 . " how are we going to honor these -lsb- emirates -rsb- orders for the a350 when the plan to sell certain sites is not yet finalized ? "
knepper asked .
" time is passing and we are getting orders , but if our leaders do not reconsider the plan to sell sites under power8 , we will not be able to fill the orders on time . " with power8 , he added , " the company is temporarily de-stabilized at a time when we have to hold together . " emirates committing to long-term airbus orders as well as the 70 firm orders for the a350s - which are scheduled to come into service in 2013 - emirates chairman and chief executive sheikh ahmed bin saeed al-maktoum said the company had taken an option to buy a further 50 of the new-generation planes down the line .
he added that the airline had decided to order three more a380 superjumbos , and to firm up a previous option to buy a further eight . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first commercial a380 took off in singapore livery " the a350 xwb and a380 will play an important role in supporting emirates ' and dubai 's growth plans , " maktoum said .
" as the leading airline for the 21st century , it made sense for emirates to choose the a350 xwb - an aircraft designed with 21st century technologies . " the 70 firm orders - for 50 a350-900s and 20 a350-1000s - will make emirates the second biggest customer for the long-haul planes after qatar airways announced an order for 80 in june . the contract brings the number of a380s ordered by emirates to 58 , making it the world 's biggest customer for the superjumbo , which made its first commercial flight in the livery of singapore airlines last month . airbus also announced a $ 2-billion order from saudi business carrier nas for 20 airbus a320s , as well as an option to buy a further 18 of the short-haul planes . private superjumbo buyer revealed as saudi prince it was also revealed at the dubai air show that saudi billionaire prince alwaleed bin talal will be the first private buyer of an a380 superjumbo . the prospective buyer 's identity had been kept secret for months but was unveiled to coincide with the dubai air show . alwaleed , whose interests span kingdom holding to euro disney , hotels and banking , has ordered a vip version of the a380 dubbed the flying palace .

too many flats and too few houses are being built in wales 's biggest cities , claims a leading planning expert .
cardiff has seen the largest increase , with the number of new flats more than doubling in the past five years .
a decade ago , about 20 % of new homes in cardiff were flats ; now it is nearly 70 % in some developments .
professor john punter , of cardiff university , said wales 's greenbelt land south of the m4 should be seen as the " natural repository of family housing " .
" we 're turning into a kind of ' apartment city ' , " said the professor of urban design and director of design commission wales .
he said : " in effect , what is happening to our housing market is it is becoming all apartments . "
they do n't make the little estates they used to have , it 's just a lot of high-rise apartment blocks " house hunter claire smith " it does not cater for large sections of the community .
most apartments are one- and two-bedroom , so they are good for couples and people co-habiting and things like that .
" but as soon as people have children , they 'd have to move out .
and where would they go ?
where would the new housing be ?
" what 's happening is that we 're really not going to be building any new housing in cardiff , the new family housing is going to be built up the valleys .
" that would be ok if the transport network linking cardiff to the valleys was adequate to take that demand . "
he called for a " more balanced allocation " of land for housing as a predominance of building on brownfield sites " almost invariably means apartments " .
he said swansea and newport were " just beginning " the property-building boom cardiff underwent from 2001 .
one couple , patrick and claire smith , are renting a flat in cardiff bay but are looking to buy , ideally a two- or three-bedroomed house with a back garden .
mrs smith said : " for us it 's impossible at the moment .
it 's so expensive , over-inflated .
there 're very little affordable houses around .
" they do n't make the little estates they used to have , it 's just a lot of high-rise apartment blocks .
" we just feel we 're banging our head against the wall trying to find something that 's affordable . "

in a speech in aberystwyth , assembly member kirsty williams will attack what she calls the " gloopy grey consensus " of the " cardiff bay bubble " .
it is seen as a bid to regain momentum for the party following the collapse of the " rainbow coalition " this summer .
the brecon and radnorshire am is seen as the most likely contender to follow mike german as welsh lib dem leader .
ms williams , her party 's assembly spokesperson for enterprise , transport and education , will deliver her rallying call in a speech to the institute of welsh politics in aberystwyth later .
the liberal democrats held talks with other opposition parties about forming a coalition after may 's welsh assembly election .
a closed system where the same people meet in the same rooms to discuss the same ideas kirsty williams am labour and plaid cymru agreed their own partnership for power based around the one wales document .
the lib dems won six seats in the last three assembly elections .
ms williams is expected to hit out at the " rugby club blazer " culture , attack the labour party 's " patrician smugness " and say welsh politics has lost the excitement and drama generated by devolution .
ms williams will warn in her speech that people are " frustrated by the gloopy grey consensus that welsh politics has become " .
she will criticise " a closed system where the same people meet in the same rooms to discuss the same ideas - a system which does n't embrace the radical or the alternative " .
she will go on to appeal for the lib dems to become the " radical , cutting edge of welsh politics " .
she will also urge the party to become one of " principle with practical policies to improve life for the welsh people - all based on liberal ideals " .

writing in a " throw-away " journal , gordon moore accurately imagined a future filled with mobile phones , home computers , and even intelligent cars .
but it was a much more prosaic prediction that has come to dominate his life and the industry that he helped found .
" i could see a change coming that the electronics were going to get significantly cheaper , " says the co-founder of intel , the largest maker of computer chips .
in the article in electronics magazine , he predicted that the number of transistors on a silicon chip would double every year for ten years .
he later revised the forecast to doubling every two years or so , as the initial breakneck speed of development and shrinkage waned .
it was a prediction that became known as moore 's law and it has helped drive the computer revolution over the last four decades .
modest growth at first glance it is not the kind of observation that would catapult a person to fame .
but the day i meet him , a now silver haired dr moore has just given a talk to a packed auditorium of people and he is surrounded by crowds of autograph hunters who were not even born when he made his off the cuff observations .
moore 's law has become shorthand for the pace of technological change .
it set a standard for the chip industry 's phenomenal growth and has in turn underpinned the world 's digital awakening .
transistors transistors are basic electronic switches found in silicon chips each transistor can be switched on or off , representing a " 1 " or " 0 " , known as binary code all computation is done using different combinations of these two outputs to do calculations the number of transistors on a chip determine its speed modern chips contain millions of transistors allowing them to execute millions of calculations per second the tiny devices consist of a source , drain and gate a voltage applied to the gate and drain turns the device on removing the gate voltage switches it off again " it was an exciting technology in the beginning .
it had so much potential , we just had no idea how much potential , " he says .
" when intel was formed -lsb- in 1968 -rsb- the total semiconductor industry was only a couple of billion dollars worldwide - today it is 300 billion . "
and as the industry has delivered each successive generation of faster , smaller , cheaper chips , it has opened up rafts of new possibilities for silicon that have ultimately delivered the technologies he predicted more than 40 years ago .
reflecting on his prophesies today , a retired and quietly-spoken dr moore is characteristically modest .
" when i went back and read that i was amazed that i predicted all of those things , " he says .
but , as a young engineer , he was at least uniquely placed to make his key observation , having co-founded fairchild semiconductors , maker of the first commercial integrated circuit , or chip .
" i was directing a lab where we were trying to advance the technology and from my perspective i could see some of these things coming that were n't generally visible to the rest of the population , " he says .
force for change at the time , computers were mainly used by the military and pcs were unheard of , he says .
" computers were in glass rooms tended to by a core of monks that knew how to do the proper incantations . "
but as the silicon chip industry took hold and computer makers learnt how to exploit the technology everything changed .
" shortly after that the commercial market just completely dwarfed anything in the military , " he says .
and what had originally been just a prediction by dr moore became a self-fulfilling prophesy .
" it has become a driving force for the industry , " he says .
" competitors have realised that if they do n't move at least that rate they are going to fall behind . "
so far silicon producers have managed to keep on or ahead of the curve for more than four decades by continually shrinking the technology and packing more and more components inside a chip .
moore 's law the number of transistors on a chip doubles every two years first outlined by gordon moore , co-founder of intel published in electronics magazine on 19 april , 1965 moore 's law in action " it 's a peculiar feature of this technology that by making things smaller everything gets better , " says dr moore .
" the transistors get faster , you can put more of a system on a chip . "
but more importantly , and perhaps more curiously , the chips also become cheaper .
and this is the key point of his 1965 paper , he says .
moore 's law is an economic law and would probably have driven the industry regardless of whether or not he had made his prediction .
" i am not sure that having moore 's law held up there as a yardstick increases the pressure -lsb- on chip manufacturers -rsb- because the need to remain competitive is so strong . "
chip future as a result , the industry has grown " far beyond " what he could have imagined in 1965 , he says .
moore interview " it is surprising that any of the things we predicted are still valid . "
he is most impressed with the industry 's inventiveness , he says , allowing it to overcome a series of seemingly insurmountable technical hurdles as it grew .
" the industry has succeeded in getting around all of the ones that have been thrown in front of it , " he says .
" it has been much more successful than i probably would have predicted . "
but , dr moore says , the industry can only go on shrinking transistors for so long .
eventually , the features will become so small that the atomic structure of the materials will be a limitation , possibly spelling the end of moore 's law so what does he think will happen in the next 40 years ?
" i 'm through with making predictions , " he chuckles .
" get it right once and quit . "

but it was a much more prosaic prediction that has come to dominate his life and the industry that he helped found .
" i could see a change coming that the electronics were going to get significantly cheaper , " says the co-founder of intel , the largest maker of computer chips .
in the article in electronics magazine , he predicted that the number of transistors on a silicon chip would double every year for ten years .
he later revised the forecast to doubling every two years or so , as the initial breakneck speed of development and shrinkage waned .
it was a prediction that became known as moore 's law and it has helped drive the computer revolution over the last four decades .
modest growth at first glance it is not the kind of observation that would catapult a person to fame .
but the day i meet him , a now silver haired dr moore has just given a talk to a packed auditorium of people and he is surrounded by crowds of autograph hunters who were not even born when he made his off the cuff observations .
moore 's law has become shorthand for the pace of technological change .
it set a standard for the chip industry 's phenomenal growth and has in turn underpinned the world 's digital awakening .
transistors transistors are basic electronic switches found in silicon chips each transistor can be switched on or off , representing a " 1 " or " 0 " , known as binary code all computation is done using different combinations of these two outputs to do calculations the number of transistors on a chip determine its speed modern chips contain millions of transistors allowing them to execute millions of calculations per second the tiny devices consist of a source , drain and gate a voltage applied to the gate and drain turns the device on removing the gate voltage switches it off again " it was an exciting technology in the beginning .
it had so much potential , we just had no idea how much potential , " he says .
" when intel was formed -lsb- in 1968 -rsb- the total semiconductor industry was only a couple of billion dollars worldwide - today it is 300 billion . "
and as the industry has delivered each successive generation of faster , smaller , cheaper chips , it has opened up rafts of new possibilities for silicon that have ultimately delivered the technologies he predicted more than 40 years ago .
reflecting on his prophesies today , a retired and quietly-spoken dr moore is characteristically modest .
" when i went back and read that i was amazed that i predicted all of those things , " he says .
but , as a young engineer , he was at least uniquely placed to make his key observation , having co-founded fairchild semiconductors , maker of the first commercial integrated circuit , or chip .
" i was directing a lab where we were trying to advance the technology and from my perspective i could see some of these things coming that were n't generally visible to the rest of the population , " he says .
force for change at the time , computers were mainly used by the military and pcs were unheard of , he says .
" computers were in glass rooms tended to by a core of monks that knew how to do the proper incantations . "
but as the silicon chip industry took hold and computer makers learnt how to exploit the technology everything changed .
" shortly after that the commercial market just completely dwarfed anything in the military , " he says .
and what had originally been just a prediction by dr moore became a self-fulfilling prophesy .
" it has become a driving force for the industry , " he says .
" competitors have realised that if they do n't move at least that rate they are going to fall behind . "
so far silicon producers have managed to keep on or ahead of the curve for more than four decades by continually shrinking the technology and packing more and more components inside a chip .
moore 's law the number of transistors on a chip doubles every two years first outlined by gordon moore , co-founder of intel published in electronics magazine on 19 april , 1965 moore 's law in action " it 's a peculiar feature of this technology that by making things smaller everything gets better , " says dr moore .
" the transistors get faster , you can put more of a system on a chip . "
but more importantly , and perhaps more curiously , the chips also become cheaper .
and this is the key point of his 1965 paper , he says .
moore 's law is an economic law and would probably have driven the industry regardless of whether or not he had made his prediction .
" i am not sure that having moore 's law held up there as a yardstick increases the pressure -lsb- on chip manufacturers -rsb- because the need to remain competitive is so strong . "
chip future as a result , the industry has grown " far beyond " what he could have imagined in 1965 , he says .
moore interview " it is surprising that any of the things we predicted are still valid . "
he is most impressed with the industry 's inventiveness , he says , allowing it to overcome a series of seemingly insurmountable technical hurdles as it grew .
" the industry has succeeded in getting around all of the ones that have been thrown in front of it , " he says .
" it has been much more successful than i probably would have predicted . "
but , dr moore says , the industry can only go on shrinking transistors for so long .
eventually , the features will become so small that the atomic structure of the materials will be a limitation , possibly spelling the end of moore 's law so what does he think will happen in the next 40 years ?
" i 'm through with making predictions , " he chuckles .
" get it right once and quit . "

" competitors have realised that if they do n't move at least that rate they are going to fall behind . "
so far silicon producers have managed to keep on or ahead of the curve for more than four decades by continually shrinking the technology and packing more and more components inside a chip .
moore 's law the number of transistors on a chip doubles every two years first outlined by gordon moore , co-founder of intel published in electronics magazine on 19 april , 1965 moore 's law in action " it 's a peculiar feature of this technology that by making things smaller everything gets better , " says dr moore .
" the transistors get faster , you can put more of a system on a chip . "
but more importantly , and perhaps more curiously , the chips also become cheaper .
and this is the key point of his 1965 paper , he says .
moore 's law is an economic law and would probably have driven the industry regardless of whether or not he had made his prediction .
" i am not sure that having moore 's law held up there as a yardstick increases the pressure -lsb- on chip manufacturers -rsb- because the need to remain competitive is so strong . "
chip future as a result , the industry has grown " far beyond " what he could have imagined in 1965 , he says .
moore interview " it is surprising that any of the things we predicted are still valid . "
he is most impressed with the industry 's inventiveness , he says , allowing it to overcome a series of seemingly insurmountable technical hurdles as it grew .
" the industry has succeeded in getting around all of the ones that have been thrown in front of it , " he says .
" it has been much more successful than i probably would have predicted . "
but , dr moore says , the industry can only go on shrinking transistors for so long .
eventually , the features will become so small that the atomic structure of the materials will be a limitation , possibly spelling the end of moore 's law so what does he think will happen in the next 40 years ?
" i 'm through with making predictions , " he chuckles .
" get it right once and quit . "

writing in a " throw-away " journal , gordon moore accurately imagined a future filled with mobile phones , home computers , and even intelligent cars .
but it was a much more prosaic prediction that has come to dominate his life and the industry that he helped found .
" i could see a change coming that the electronics were going to get significantly cheaper , " says the co-founder of intel , the largest maker of computer chips .
in the article in electronics magazine , he predicted that the number of transistors on a silicon chip would double every year for ten years .
he later revised the forecast to doubling every two years or so , as the initial breakneck speed of development and shrinkage waned .
it was a prediction that became known as moore 's law and it has helped drive the computer revolution over the last four decades .
modest growth at first glance it is not the kind of observation that would catapult a person to fame .
but the day i meet him , a now silver haired dr moore has just given a talk to a packed auditorium of people and he is surrounded by crowds of autograph hunters who were not even born when he made his off the cuff observations .
moore 's law has become shorthand for the pace of technological change .
it set a standard for the chip industry 's phenomenal growth and has in turn underpinned the world 's digital awakening .
transistors transistors are basic electronic switches found in silicon chips each transistor can be switched on or off , representing a " 1 " or " 0 " , known as binary code all computation is done using different combinations of these two outputs to do calculations the number of transistors on a chip determine its speed modern chips contain millions of transistors allowing them to execute millions of calculations per second the tiny devices consist of a source , drain and gate a voltage applied to the gate and drain turns the device on removing the gate voltage switches it off again " it was an exciting technology in the beginning .
it had so much potential , we just had no idea how much potential , " he says .
" when intel was formed -lsb- in 1968 -rsb- the total semiconductor industry was only a couple of billion dollars worldwide - today it is 300 billion . "
and as the industry has delivered each successive generation of faster , smaller , cheaper chips , it has opened up rafts of new possibilities for silicon that have ultimately delivered the technologies he predicted more than 40 years ago .
reflecting on his prophesies today , a retired and quietly-spoken dr moore is characteristically modest .
" when i went back and read that i was amazed that i predicted all of those things , " he says .
but , as a young engineer , he was at least uniquely placed to make his key observation , having co-founded fairchild semiconductors , maker of the first commercial integrated circuit , or chip .
" i was directing a lab where we were trying to advance the technology and from my perspective i could see some of these things coming that were n't generally visible to the rest of the population , " he says .
force for change at the time , computers were mainly used by the military and pcs were unheard of , he says .
" computers were in glass rooms tended to by a core of monks that knew how to do the proper incantations . "
but as the silicon chip industry took hold and computer makers learnt how to exploit the technology everything changed .
" shortly after that the commercial market just completely dwarfed anything in the military , " he says .

bbc news -pipe- technology -pipe- meeting the man behind moore 's law bbc news / technology graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- monday , 12 november 2007 , 07:50 gmt meeting the man behind moore 's law by jonathan fildes science and technology reporter , bbc news in april 1965 a 36-year old electronics buff jotted down his thoughts on the future of the juvenile silicon chip industry .
writing in a " throw-away " journal , gordon moore accurately imagined a future filled with mobile phones , home computers , and even intelligent cars .
but it was a much more prosaic prediction that has come to dominate his life and the industry that he helped found .
" i could see a change coming that the electronics were going to get significantly cheaper , " says the co-founder of intel , the largest maker of computer chips .
in the article in electronics magazine , he predicted that the number of transistors on a silicon chip would double every year for ten years .
he later revised the forecast to doubling every two years or so , as the initial breakneck speed of development and shrinkage waned .
it was a prediction that became known as moore 's law and it has helped drive the computer revolution over the last four decades .
modest growth at first glance it is not the kind of observation that would catapult a person to fame .
but the day i meet him , a now silver haired dr moore has just given a talk to a packed auditorium of people and he is surrounded by crowds of autograph hunters who were not even born when he made his off the cuff observations .
moore 's law has become shorthand for the pace of technological change .
it set a standard for the chip industry 's phenomenal growth and has in turn underpinned the world 's digital awakening .
transistors transistors are basic electronic switches found in silicon chips each transistor can be switched on or off , representing a " 1 " or " 0 " , known as binary code all computation is done using different combinations of these two outputs to do calculations the number of transistors on a chip determine its speed modern chips contain millions of transistors allowing them to execute millions of calculations per second the tiny devices consist of a source , drain and gate a voltage applied to the gate and drain turns the device on removing the gate voltage switches it off again " it was an exciting technology in the beginning .
it had so much potential , we just had no idea how much potential , " he says .
" when intel was formed -lsb- in 1968 -rsb- the total semiconductor industry was only a couple of billion dollars worldwide - today it is 300 billion . "
and as the industry has delivered each successive generation of faster , smaller , cheaper chips , it has opened up rafts of new possibilities for silicon that have ultimately delivered the technologies he predicted more than 40 years ago .
reflecting on his prophesies today , a retired and quietly-spoken dr moore is characteristically modest .
" when i went back and read that i was amazed that i predicted all of those things , " he says .
but , as a young engineer , he was at least uniquely placed to make his key observation , having co-founded fairchild semiconductors , maker of the first commercial integrated circuit , or chip .
" i was directing a lab where we were trying to advance the technology and from my perspective i could see some of these things coming that were n't generally visible to the rest of the population , " he says .
force for change at the time , computers were mainly used by the military and pcs were unheard of , he says .
" computers were in glass rooms tended to by a core of monks that knew how to do the proper incantations . "
but as the silicon chip industry took hold and computer makers learnt how to exploit the technology everything changed .
" shortly after that the commercial market just completely dwarfed anything in the military , " he says .
and what had originally been just a prediction by dr moore became a self-fulfilling prophesy .
" it has become a driving force for the industry , " he says .
" competitors have realised that if they do n't move at least that rate they are going to fall behind . "
so far silicon producers have managed to keep on or ahead of the curve for more than four decades by continually shrinking the technology and packing more and more components inside a chip .
moore 's law the number of transistors on a chip doubles every two years first outlined by gordon moore , co-founder of intel published in electronics magazine on 19 april , 1965 moore 's law in action " it 's a peculiar feature of this technology that by making things smaller everything gets better , " says dr moore .
" the transistors get faster , you can put more of a system on a chip . "
but more importantly , and perhaps more curiously , the chips also become cheaper .
and this is the key point of his 1965 paper , he says .
moore 's law is an economic law and would probably have driven the industry regardless of whether or not he had made his prediction .
" i am not sure that having moore 's law held up there as a yardstick increases the pressure -lsb- on chip manufacturers -rsb- because the need to remain competitive is so strong . "
chip future as a result , the industry has grown " far beyond " what he could have imagined in 1965 , he says .
" it is surprising that any of the things we predicted are still valid . "
he is most impressed with the industry 's inventiveness , he says , allowing it to overcome a series of seemingly insurmountable technical hurdles as it grew .
" the industry has succeeded in getting around all of the ones that have been thrown in front of it , " he says .
" it has been much more successful than i probably would have predicted . "
but , dr moore says , the industry can only go on shrinking transistors for so long .
eventually , the features will become so small that the atomic structure of the materials will be a limitation , possibly spelling the end of moore 's law so what does he think will happen in the next 40 years ?
" i 'm through with making predictions , " he chuckles .
" get it right once and quit . "

he will head a taskforce for iain duncan smith 's centre for social justice , which gives advice to tory leader david cameron issues .
mr aitken was jailed in 1999 for perjury during a libel action which he had left the cabinet to fight .
he told the bbc that " poachers " sometimes made " useful gamekeepers " .
he told bbc radio 4 's today on monday that among the ideas he would look at to cut reoffending rates was post-release mentoring , as used in new zealand and some parts of the us .
he said they would be looking at " more community involvement in prisons , more volunteers coming in to help with literacy of prisoners or the after-care of prisoners " .
' heavy price ' asked if he was making a political comeback , he replied : " no , and i do n't ever expect to .
" i made a bad mistake - i paid a heavy price for it and i expect to go on paying a price for it .
" and that 's life and i have to live with that . "
mr aitken earlier told the observer newspaper : " it is an assignment well worth taking extremely seriously .
" this is n't an ego trip for me .
this is a job to be done .
i have a very good team who i think will help to do it well . "
mr aitken resigned as chief secretary to the treasury in 1995 so he could sue the guardian over allegations that a saudi businessman had paid for him to stay at the paris ritz in breach of ministerial rules . "
there was a personal rehabilitation for jonathan aitken during his time in jail " nick wood centre for social justice launching the action , he insisted that the " simple sword of truth " would help him win .
but the case collapsed in 1997 and mr aitken was later found guilty of perjury and perverting the course of justice in 1999 .
he served almost seven months of his 18-month sentence before being released in january 2000 .
former tory leader mr duncan smith will formally unveil the appointment on monday .
' direct experience ' nick wood , media adviser to the centre for social justice , told the bbc : " there was a personal rehabilitation for jonathan aitken during his time in jail .
" he has written about this , he has talked about it and he has campaigned for prison reform . "
explaining mr duncan smith 's thinking , he said : " one of the things that iain is keen on is that people leading political groups should have some direct experience of the subjects they are working on .
" i think jonathan aitken certainly has the experience of jail and he has shown a great deal of thought and interest in it since . "
peter preston , who edited the guardian at the time of the court case , told bbc 5 live that mr aitken 's appointment could send out the wrong signals .
" basically , had we lost on all that false testimony , we would have been out as an organisation well over £ 1m in damages and legal costs . "

he will head a taskforce for iain duncan smith 's centre for social justice , which gives advice to tory leader david cameron issues .
mr aitken was jailed in 1999 for perjury during a libel action which he had left the cabinet to fight .
he told the bbc that " poachers " sometimes made " useful gamekeepers " .
he told bbc radio 4 's today on monday that among the ideas he would look at to cut reoffending rates was post-release mentoring , as used in new zealand and some parts of the us .
he said they would be looking at " more community involvement in prisons , more volunteers coming in to help with literacy of prisoners or the after-care of prisoners " .
' heavy price ' asked if he was making a political comeback , he replied : " no , and i do n't ever expect to .
" i made a bad mistake - i paid a heavy price for it and i expect to go on paying a price for it .
" and that 's life and i have to live with that . "
mr aitken earlier told the observer newspaper : " it is an assignment well worth taking extremely seriously .
" this is n't an ego trip for me .
this is a job to be done .
i have a very good team who i think will help to do it well . "
mr aitken resigned as chief secretary to the treasury in 1995 so he could sue the guardian over allegations that a saudi businessman had paid for him to stay at the paris ritz in breach of ministerial rules .
there was a personal rehabilitation for jonathan aitken during his time in jail nick wood centre for social justice launching the action , he insisted that the " simple sword of truth " would help him win .
but the case collapsed in 1997 and mr aitken was later found guilty of perjury and perverting the course of justice in 1999 .
he served almost seven months of his 18-month sentence before being released in january 2000 .
former tory leader mr duncan smith will formally unveil the appointment on monday .
' direct experience ' nick wood , media adviser to the centre for social justice , told the bbc : " there was a personal rehabilitation for jonathan aitken during his time in jail .
" he has written about this , he has talked about it and he has campaigned for prison reform . "
explaining mr duncan smith 's thinking , he said : " one of the things that iain is keen on is that people leading political groups should have some direct experience of the subjects they are working on .
" i think jonathan aitken certainly has the experience of jail and he has shown a great deal of thought and interest in it since . "
peter preston , who edited the guardian at the time of the court case , told bbc 5 live that mr aitken 's appointment could send out the wrong signals .
" basically , had we lost on all that false testimony , we would have been out as an organisation well over £ 1m in damages and legal costs . "
a conservative party spokeswoman said : " the csj and the conservative party are two separate entities and they make their appointments independently .
" the csj has done some excellent work for us in the past and we look forward to seeing more of their findings in due course . "

get safe online , a government-backed campaign group , is warning against posting personal details online .
its research also showed eight million people leave home wireless networks unprotected against intruders .
and more than half of the over-65s polled use a single password for every website they visit , the group said .
the group is advising older internet users to change their passwords more often .
' rich pickings ' tony neate , managing director of getsafeonline.org , said a date of birth and address details were enough for someone to set up a credit card in another name .
" although some of these details may seem harmless , they actually provide rich pickings for criminals , " he said .
cabinet office minister gillian merron said the risks can be easily fixed and did not mean people should stop using social networking sites , and wireless networks .
the poll of 2,000 adults also showed that nearly 30 % admitted searching for former girlfriends and boyfriends on the sites , and almost one in three used them to find out about their boss , colleagues or a job candidate .
the survey also found 13 % of social networkers had posted information about or photos of other people without their consent .
while 80 % of people now have firewalls , anti-virus and anti-spyware products installed on their pcs , the usage of wireless networks is far more lax .
at part of the campaign , get safe online and the serious organised crime agency demonstrated how easy it was to break into an unsecured wireless network .
high profile cases it showed that not only was it easy to freeload on an unsecured network but also to hack into it and ' steal ' potentially valuable information .
securing wireless networks refer to the documentation that came with your hardware to find out how to protect the machine set up encryption to prevent eavesdropping make sure that every machine on the network has a firewall use public access points with care switch off ssid broadcast - this is the name of your wireless network use a unique , obscure password to access the wireless network restrict access to the machines you want to access the network by using its mac address more tips about staying safe take the online safety test a soca officer , taking part in the mocked-up demonstration for the bbc , took just a quarter of an hour to access and " steal " passwords and other personal information from a nearby laptop .
according to a survey conducted by the government and soca-backed get safe online campaign , over 7.8 million people in the uk have left their internet access open for anyone to use .
" it took just 15 minutes to break into the network but it would take less than that to make the machine safe , " said tony neate , managing director of the get safe online campaign .
there have been several high profile cases this year of individuals piggybacking on other people 's unsecured wireless connections .
such freeloading is generally harmless and invisible to the user , unless the person stealing it is using large amounts of bandwidth which will noticeably slow the network down .
stealing passwords the mocked up soca demonstration showed that anyone with a wireless-enabled laptop could scan for unsecured networks and , if one was found , use it to surf the internet and send emails at someone else 's expense .
the demonstration also showed that it only takes a limited amount of technical know-how to take the free usage of someone else 's network to a different level .
" i am running a tool which is freely available from the internet which will scan the computer to see if it is vulnerable to any exploitation , " explained the soca officer , who was only known as stuart .
" a red x on the screen shows that a microsoft patch for a known vulnerability -lsb- in this case , the sasser worm -rsb- has n't been applied so now i just need to use this information with another program - also freely available - which will allow me to input commands and gain control of the machine , " he said .
in this particular demonstration , stuart was able to access the victim 's my documents ' folder which contained a document listing passwords for banking , e-mail accounts and social networking sites .
a get safe online campaign earlier in the year found that 12 % of the uk 's net users had experienced online fraud during 2006 with an average loss of £ 875 .
as part of this week 's campaign the get safe online team will be travelling around the country offering advice on how to stay safe and secure when using the internet .

its research also showed eight million people leave home wireless networks unprotected against intruders .
and more than half of the over-65s polled use a single password for every website they visit , the group said .
the group is advising older internet users to change their passwords more often .
' rich pickings ' tony neate , managing director of getsafeonline.org , said a date of birth and address details were enough for someone to set up a credit card in another name .
" although some of these details may seem harmless , they actually provide rich pickings for criminals , " he said .
people need to take care when using public wi-fi cabinet office minister gillian merron said the risks can be easily fixed and did not mean people should stop using social networking sites , and wireless networks .
the poll of 2,000 adults also showed that nearly 30 % admitted searching for former girlfriends and boyfriends on the sites , and almost one in three used them to find out about their boss , colleagues or a job candidate .
the survey also found 13 % of social networkers had posted information about or photos of other people without their consent .
while 80 % of people now have firewalls , anti-virus and anti-spyware products installed on their pcs , the usage of wireless networks is far more lax .
at part of the campaign , get safe online and the serious organised crime agency demonstrated how easy it was to break into an unsecured wireless network .
high profile cases it showed that not only was it easy to freeload on an unsecured network but also to hack into it and ' steal ' potentially valuable information .
securing wireless networks refer to the documentation that came with your hardware to find out how to protect the machine set up encryption to prevent eavesdropping make sure that every machine on the network has a firewall use public access points with care switch off ssid broadcast - this is the name of your wireless network use a unique , obscure password to access the wireless network restrict access to the machines you want to access the network by using its mac address more tips about staying safe take the online safety test a soca officer , taking part in the mocked-up demonstration for the bbc , took just a quarter of an hour to access and " steal " passwords and other personal information from a nearby laptop .
according to a survey conducted by the government and soca-backed get safe online campaign , over 7.8 million people in the uk have left their internet access open for anyone to use .
" it took just 15 minutes to break into the network but it would take less than that to make the machine safe , " said tony neate , managing director of the get safe online campaign .
there have been several high profile cases this year of individuals piggybacking on other people 's unsecured wireless connections .
such freeloading is generally harmless and invisible to the user , unless the person stealing it is using large amounts of bandwidth which will noticeably slow the network down .
stealing passwords the mocked up soca demonstration showed that anyone with a wireless-enabled laptop could scan for unsecured networks and , if one was found , use it to surf the internet and send emails at someone else 's expense .
the demonstration also showed that it only takes a limited amount of technical know-how to take the free usage of someone else 's network to a different level .
" i am running a tool which is freely available from the internet which will scan the computer to see if it is vulnerable to any exploitation , " explained the soca officer , who was only known as stuart .
" a red x on the screen shows that a microsoft patch for a known vulnerability -lsb- in this case , the sasser worm -rsb- has n't been applied so now i just need to use this information with another program - also freely available - which will allow me to input commands and gain control of the machine , " he said .
in this particular demonstration , stuart was able to access the victim 's my documents ' folder which contained a document listing passwords for banking , e-mail accounts and social networking sites .
a get safe online campaign earlier in the year found that 12 % of the uk 's net users had experienced online fraud during 2006 with an average loss of £ 875 .
as part of this week 's campaign the get safe online team will be travelling around the country offering advice on how to stay safe and secure when using the internet .
