his promotion was announced at the end of last week after veteran spd politician franz müntefering resigned from the position in order to care for his wife , who has cancer .
in an interview with germany 's bild newspaper , steinmeier said he was ready to engage in the trench warfare of daily politics with merkel 's conservatives , who rule in a grand coalition together with the spd .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : müntefering decided his wife ankepetra was more important than politics " there will always be differences of opinion in the coalition .
that means i will have to take a clear stand even if that means there is a real clash , " he said .
steinmeier , who has a reputation as a prudent and reliable diplomat , warned that he will " definitely not be the friendly gentleman from the foreign ministry . "
in contrast to müntefering , steinmeier has been sharply critical of merkel on foreign policy recently , especially in regards to russia .
governance more important than campaigning in his interview with bild , steinmeier also warned that the social democrats and the conservatives ran the risk of gridlock before the next general election in 2009 if they opt to campaign rather than govern .
" we should avoid giving voters the feeling that we will be running a two-year-long election campaign .
that would be disastrous , " he was quoted as saying .
steinmeier also made it clear his party would n't back down on the issue of minimum wages , saying that everyone should " benefit from the recovering economy . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spat over a minimum wage is dividing the coaltion merkel 's conservatives continue to reject an overall national minimum wage proposed by the social democrats .
in addition , although the two sides have agreed in principle to introduce a minimum wage for postal workers , they remain deadlocked on the details .
" if -lsb- the coalition -rsb- ca n't reach a decision on an issue , then we have the right to say ; ' the voters should decide in 2009 ' , " steinmeier said .
" a minimum wage is important , and it will be introduced - if not with this government , then with the next . "
steinmeier more popular than spd leader beck steinmeier told bild he supported spd leader kurt beck as the party 's challenger to merkel in the next national election .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : last month , the spd under kurt beck voted to move to the left however , according to an emnid survey undertaken for bild 's sunday edition , voters prefer steinmeier , who has served as germany 's foreign minister since 2005 , over beck .
thirty-seven percent said steinmeier would be the better candidate , with 35 percent opting for beck ; 28 percent did n't have an opinion .
the actual spd candidate for the 2009 elections wo n't be announced until the end of 2008 . dw staff -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

his promotion was announced at the end of last week after veteran spd politician franz müntefering resigned from the position in order to care for his wife , who has cancer .
in an interview with germany 's bild newspaper , steinmeier said he was ready to engage in the trench warfare of daily politics with merkel 's conservatives , who rule in a grand coalition together with the spd .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : müntefering decided his wife ankepetra was more important than politics " there will always be differences of opinion in the coalition .
that means i will have to take a clear stand even if that means there is a real clash , " he said .
steinmeier , who has a reputation as a prudent and reliable diplomat , warned that he will " definitely not be the friendly gentleman from the foreign ministry . "
in contrast to müntefering , steinmeier has been sharply critical of merkel on foreign policy recently , especially in regards to russia .
governance more important than campaigning in his interview with bild , steinmeier also warned that the social democrats and the conservatives ran the risk of gridlock before the next general election in 2009 if they opt to campaign rather than govern .
" we should avoid giving voters the feeling that we will be running a two-year-long election campaign .
that would be disastrous , " he was quoted as saying .
steinmeier also made it clear his party would n't back down on the issue of minimum wages , saying that everyone should " benefit from the recovering economy . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spat over a minimum wage is dividing the coaltion merkel 's conservatives continue to reject an overall national minimum wage proposed by the social democrats .
in addition , although the two sides have agreed in principle to introduce a minimum wage for postal workers , they remain deadlocked on the details .
" if -lsb- the coalition -rsb- ca n't reach a decision on an issue , then we have the right to say ; ' the voters should decide in 2009 ' , " steinmeier said .
" a minimum wage is important , and it will be introduced - if not with this government , then with the next . "
steinmeier more popular than spd leader beck steinmeier told bild he supported spd leader kurt beck as the party 's challenger to merkel in the next national election .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : last month , the spd under kurt beck voted to move to the left however , according to an emnid survey undertaken for bild 's sunday edition , voters prefer steinmeier , who has served as germany 's foreign minister since 2005 , over beck .
thirty-seven percent said steinmeier would be the better candidate , with 35 percent opting for beck ; 28 percent did n't have an opinion .
the actual spd candidate for the 2009 elections wo n't be announced until the end of 2008 . dw staff -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

one of the two suspects took his own life after police uncovered the plot . according to police , two high school students , aged 17 and 18 , had made plans to kill other students and then themselves on tuesday , nov .
20 - the one-year anniversary of a school massacre in the german town of emsdetten in which an 18-year-old had injured 37 people before taking his own life . " they wanted to injure and kill people and then kill themselves , " said leading police investigator norbert wagner on sunday in cologne . other students alerted police to the plot at the cologne high school in western germany by pointing out pictures of the 1999 columbine high school shooting in the us state of colorado that the 17-year-old had posted to the internet . suspect commits suicide after plans uncovered the boy threw himself in front of a tram , later dying of injuries , after police had visited the school on friday to confront him about the online massacre pictures .
a police spokesman said monday that the student had immediately agreed to remove the photos and gave no indication of being suicidal when officers spoke with him . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police said the suspect did n't appear suicidal an 18-year-old accomplice was taken into custody and confessed to the plot , said police .
motives for the massacre were unclear , though the 18-year-old had reportedly said he was bullied at school . police found crossbows and air guns in the boys ' possession , along with a list of 17 students and teachers thought to be potential victims .
investigators said they suspect the two may have intended to build pipe bombs , though none had been found . experts urge schools to beware of warning signals " unfortunately , we have to assume that shootings at schools and universities will be copied , " rainer wendt , chairman of the german police union -lrb- dpolg -rrb- , said on monday in duisburg . schools and police should pay close attention to the warning signals , said wendt , adding that acts of this kind are often made known beforehand on the internet . rudolf egg , director of the central for criminology in wiesbaden , said in a television interview monday broadcast on public station zdf that the foiled plot in cologne had similarities to recent school shootings in the us , german and finland . most often , the culprits are loners who " want to direct violence externally and then against themselves " in a crisis situation , said egg . the foiled massacre planned for tuesday in cologne follows a shooting in a small finish town earlier this month , where an 18-year-old gunman killed seven fellow students , the head teacher and himself . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de kosovo -pipe- 19.11.2007 eu faces embarrassing split over kosovo independence großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kosovo question is threatening to divide the european union member states eu foreign ministers on monday appeared resigned to an embarrassing split over an independent kosovo after diplomatic efforts to find a negotiated settlement with serbia moved closer to failure . the ministers ' meeting in brussels came just hours after hashim thaci , a former kosovar guerilla leader , reiterated calls for a split from belgrade after winning saturday 's elections in the serbian breakaway province .
all but a handful of the eu 's 27 member states are ready to recognize supervised independence for kosovo , a predominantly ethnic-albanian province of around 2 million people .
spain , greece , cyprus , romania and slovakia have all expressed reservations over the move , fearing that an independent kosovo could inspire other minorities in their own territories to do the same .
and with a united nations december 10 deadline for concluding diplomatic efforts looming , efforts to find a united eu front are rapidly running out of time .
kosovo threatens eu common foreign policy aim lack of unity over kosovo would deal a serious blow to the eu 's ambitions of forging a common foreign policy on the most pressing issues facing the bloc .
" a substantial majority -lrb- of eu countries -rrb- want to recognize -lrb- an independent -rrb- kosovo ... certainly well above 20 , but we have n't got to 27 yet , " said britain 's minister of state for europe , jim murphy .
but murphy then stressed that individual eu states , not the eu as a whole , were ultimately responsible for recognizing an independent kosovo .
" and -lrb- ministers -rrb- have made it clear that they will make their own assessment , " he added .
kosovo independence is strongly opposed by serbia , which enjoys the support of russia in the un security council .
a troika of eu , us and russian mediators , led by german diplomat wolfgang ischinger , has been given until december 10 to find an agreement between the two sides .
troika leader admits agreement unlikely but ischinger , speaking a day before another round of troika talks was due to be held in brussels , admitted his efforts were unlikely to succeed .
" we have explored almost every humanly known option for squaring the circle of the kosovo status issue , " ischinger said .
" the troika process , even if it were terminated today , has not been window dressing .
it was a genuine and intense negotiating process , " he added .
in an interview published monday by germany 's frankfurter allgemeine zeitung -lrb- faz -rrb- , democratic party of kosovo -lrb- pdk -rrb- leader thaci said that while he would respect the december 10 deadline , he did not expect " a compromise between kosovo and serbia . "
kosovo has been under un administration since 1999 , when nato bombing raids drove serbian troops out of the province .
nato has since been leading a peacekeeping operation in the area , and its kfor mission currently totals about 16,000 troops .
eu presidency to pursue all avenues speaking at the end of monday 's meeting in brussels , portuguese foreign minister luis amado , whose country holds the rotating presidency of the eu , said ministers would continue to pursue " all the possibilities to have a common position . "
but german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , while insisting that " a negotiated and agreed solution " to kosovo 's status would also be good for russia , admitted that his country was already getting prepared for " possible alternatives . "
and austrian foreign minister ursula plassnik said it was time eu ministers began giving serious thought to " the possibility that there will be no agreement " come december 10 . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de eu ministers call for patience over kosovo independence following kosovo 's weekend elections , european union countries have urged the new kosovo leadership not to rush into a unilateral declaration of independence from serbia .

all but a handful of the eu 's 27 member states are ready to recognize supervised independence for kosovo , a predominantly ethnic-albanian province of around 2 million people .
spain , greece , cyprus , romania and slovakia have all expressed reservations over the move , fearing that an independent kosovo could inspire other minorities in their own territories to do the same .
and with a united nations december 10 deadline for concluding diplomatic efforts looming , efforts to find a united eu front are rapidly running out of time .
kosovo threatens eu common foreign policy aim lack of unity over kosovo would deal a serious blow to the eu 's ambitions of forging a common foreign policy on the most pressing issues facing the bloc .
" a substantial majority -lrb- of eu countries -rrb- want to recognize -lrb- an independent -rrb- kosovo ... certainly well above 20 , but we have n't got to 27 yet , " said britain 's minister of state for europe , jim murphy .
but murphy then stressed that individual eu states , not the eu as a whole , were ultimately responsible for recognizing an independent kosovo .
" and -lrb- ministers -rrb- have made it clear that they will make their own assessment , " he added .
kosovo independence is strongly opposed by serbia , which enjoys the support of russia in the un security council .
a troika of eu , us and russian mediators , led by german diplomat wolfgang ischinger , has been given until december 10 to find an agreement between the two sides .
troika leader admits agreement unlikely but ischinger , speaking a day before another round of troika talks was due to be held in brussels , admitted his efforts were unlikely to succeed .
" we have explored almost every humanly known option for squaring the circle of the kosovo status issue , " ischinger said .
" the troika process , even if it were terminated today , has not been window dressing .
it was a genuine and intense negotiating process , " he added .
in an interview published monday by germany 's frankfurter allgemeine zeitung -lrb- faz -rrb- , democratic party of kosovo -lrb- pdk -rrb- leader thaci said that while he would respect the december 10 deadline , he did not expect " a compromise between kosovo and serbia . "
kosovo has been under un administration since 1999 , when nato bombing raids drove serbian troops out of the province .
nato has since been leading a peacekeeping operation in the area , and its kfor mission currently totals about 16,000 troops .
eu presidency to pursue all avenues speaking at the end of monday 's meeting in brussels , portuguese foreign minister luis amado , whose country holds the rotating presidency of the eu , said ministers would continue to pursue " all the possibilities to have a common position . "
but german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , while insisting that " a negotiated and agreed solution " to kosovo 's status would also be good for russia , admitted that his country was already getting prepared for " possible alternatives . "
and austrian foreign minister ursula plassnik said it was time eu ministers began giving serious thought to " the possibility that there will be no agreement " come december 10 . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the troika process , even if it were terminated today , has not been window dressing .
it was a genuine and intense negotiating process , " he added .
in an interview published monday by germany 's frankfurter allgemeine zeitung -lrb- faz -rrb- , democratic party of kosovo -lrb- pdk -rrb- leader thaci said that while he would respect the december 10 deadline , he did not expect " a compromise between kosovo and serbia . "
kosovo has been under un administration since 1999 , when nato bombing raids drove serbian troops out of the province .
nato has since been leading a peacekeeping operation in the area , and its kfor mission currently totals about 16,000 troops .
eu presidency to pursue all avenues speaking at the end of monday 's meeting in brussels , portuguese foreign minister luis amado , whose country holds the rotating presidency of the eu , said ministers would continue to pursue " all the possibilities to have a common position . "
but german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , while insisting that " a negotiated and agreed solution " to kosovo 's status would also be good for russia , admitted that his country was already getting prepared for " possible alternatives . "
and austrian foreign minister ursula plassnik said it was time eu ministers began giving serious thought to " the possibility that there will be no agreement " come december 10 . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

one of the two suspects took his own life after police uncovered the plot . according to police , two high school students , aged 17 and 18 , had made plans to kill other students and then themselves on tuesday , nov .
20 - the one-year anniversary of a school massacre in the german town of emsdetten in which an 18-year-old had injured 37 people before taking his own life . " they wanted to injure and kill people and then kill themselves , " said leading police investigator norbert wagner on sunday in cologne . other students alerted police to the plot at the cologne high school in western germany by pointing out pictures of the 1999 columbine high school shooting in the us state of colorado that the 17-year-old had posted to the internet . suspect commits suicide after plans uncovered the boy threw himself in front of a tram , later dying of injuries , after police had visited the school on friday to confront him about the online massacre pictures .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 19.11.2007 new german vice chancellor says he 's ready to take on merkel großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier is germany 's second most popular politician after merkel foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , who is set to become the second most powerful politician in germany , has said he will not shy away from clashes with chancellor angela merkel and her christian democrats . steinmeier , a member of the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , is to be officially inaugurated as vice chancellor on wednesday .
his promotion was announced at the end of last week after veteran spd politician franz müntefering resigned from the position in order to care for his wife , who has cancer .
in an interview with germany 's bild newspaper , steinmeier said he was ready to engage in the trench warfare of daily politics with merkel 's conservatives , who rule in a grand coalition together with the spd .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : müntefering decided his wife ankepetra was more important than politics " there will always be differences of opinion in the coalition .
that means i will have to take a clear stand even if that means there is a real clash , " he said .
steinmeier , who has a reputation as a prudent and reliable diplomat , warned that he will " definitely not be the friendly gentleman from the foreign ministry . "
in contrast to müntefering , steinmeier has been sharply critical of merkel on foreign policy recently , especially in regards to russia .
governance more important than campaigning in his interview with bild , steinmeier also warned that the social democrats and the conservatives ran the risk of gridlock before the next general election in 2009 if they opt to campaign rather than govern .

all but a handful of the eu 's 27 member states are ready to recognize supervised independence for kosovo , a predominantly ethnic-albanian province of around 2 million people .
spain , greece , cyprus , romania and slovakia have all expressed reservations over the move , fearing that an independent kosovo could inspire other minorities in their own territories to do the same .
and with a united nations december 10 deadline for concluding diplomatic efforts looming , efforts to find a united eu front are rapidly running out of time .
kosovo threatens eu common foreign policy aim lack of unity over kosovo would deal a serious blow to the eu 's ambitions of forging a common foreign policy on the most pressing issues facing the bloc .
" a substantial majority -lrb- of eu countries -rrb- want to recognize -lrb- an independent -rrb- kosovo ... certainly well above 20 , but we have n't got to 27 yet , " said britain 's minister of state for europe , jim murphy .
but murphy then stressed that individual eu states , not the eu as a whole , were ultimately responsible for recognizing an independent kosovo .
" and -lrb- ministers -rrb- have made it clear that they will make their own assessment , " he added .
kosovo independence is strongly opposed by serbia , which enjoys the support of russia in the un security council .
a troika of eu , us and russian mediators , led by german diplomat wolfgang ischinger , has been given until december 10 to find an agreement between the two sides .
troika leader admits agreement unlikely but ischinger , speaking a day before another round of troika talks was due to be held in brussels , admitted his efforts were unlikely to succeed .
" we have explored almost every humanly known option for squaring the circle of the kosovo status issue , " ischinger said .
" the troika process , even if it were terminated today , has not been window dressing .
it was a genuine and intense negotiating process , " he added .
in an interview published monday by germany 's frankfurter allgemeine zeitung -lrb- faz -rrb- , democratic party of kosovo -lrb- pdk -rrb- leader thaci said that while he would respect the december 10 deadline , he did not expect " a compromise between kosovo and serbia . "
kosovo has been under un administration since 1999 , when nato bombing raids drove serbian troops out of the province .
nato has since been leading a peacekeeping operation in the area , and its kfor mission currently totals about 16,000 troops .
eu presidency to pursue all avenues speaking at the end of monday 's meeting in brussels , portuguese foreign minister luis amado , whose country holds the rotating presidency of the eu , said ministers would continue to pursue " all the possibilities to have a common position . "
but german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , while insisting that " a negotiated and agreed solution " to kosovo 's status would also be good for russia , admitted that his country was already getting prepared for " possible alternatives . "
and austrian foreign minister ursula plassnik said it was time eu ministers began giving serious thought to " the possibility that there will be no agreement " come december 10 . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

spain , greece , cyprus , romania and slovakia have all expressed reservations over the move , fearing that an independent kosovo could inspire other minorities in their own territories to do the same .
and with a united nations december 10 deadline for concluding diplomatic efforts looming , efforts to find a united eu front are rapidly running out of time .
kosovo threatens eu common foreign policy aim lack of unity over kosovo would deal a serious blow to the eu 's ambitions of forging a common foreign policy on the most pressing issues facing the bloc .
" a substantial majority -lrb- of eu countries -rrb- want to recognize -lrb- an independent -rrb- kosovo ... certainly well above 20 , but we have n't got to 27 yet , " said britain 's minister of state for europe , jim murphy .
but murphy then stressed that individual eu states , not the eu as a whole , were ultimately responsible for recognizing an independent kosovo .
" and -lrb- ministers -rrb- have made it clear that they will make their own assessment , " he added .
kosovo independence is strongly opposed by serbia , which enjoys the support of russia in the un security council .
a troika of eu , us and russian mediators , led by german diplomat wolfgang ischinger , has been given until december 10 to find an agreement between the two sides .
troika leader admits agreement unlikely but ischinger , speaking a day before another round of troika talks was due to be held in brussels , admitted his efforts were unlikely to succeed .
" we have explored almost every humanly known option for squaring the circle of the kosovo status issue , " ischinger said .
" the troika process , even if it were terminated today , has not been window dressing .
it was a genuine and intense negotiating process , " he added .
in an interview published monday by germany 's frankfurter allgemeine zeitung -lrb- faz -rrb- , democratic party of kosovo -lrb- pdk -rrb- leader thaci said that while he would respect the december 10 deadline , he did not expect " a compromise between kosovo and serbia . "
kosovo has been under un administration since 1999 , when nato bombing raids drove serbian troops out of the province .
nato has since been leading a peacekeeping operation in the area , and its kfor mission currently totals about 16,000 troops .
eu presidency to pursue all avenues speaking at the end of monday 's meeting in brussels , portuguese foreign minister luis amado , whose country holds the rotating presidency of the eu , said ministers would continue to pursue " all the possibilities to have a common position . "
but german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , while insisting that " a negotiated and agreed solution " to kosovo 's status would also be good for russia , admitted that his country was already getting prepared for " possible alternatives . "
and austrian foreign minister ursula plassnik said it was time eu ministers began giving serious thought to " the possibility that there will be no agreement " come december 10 . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de eu ministers call for patience over kosovo independence following kosovo 's weekend elections , european union countries have urged the new kosovo leadership not to rush into a unilateral declaration of independence from serbia .

his promotion was announced at the end of last week after veteran spd politician franz müntefering resigned from the position in order to care for his wife , who has cancer .
in an interview with germany 's bild newspaper , steinmeier said he was ready to engage in the trench warfare of daily politics with merkel 's conservatives , who rule in a grand coalition together with the spd .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : müntefering decided his wife ankepetra was more important than politics " there will always be differences of opinion in the coalition .
that means i will have to take a clear stand even if that means there is a real clash , " he said .
steinmeier , who has a reputation as a prudent and reliable diplomat , warned that he will " definitely not be the friendly gentleman from the foreign ministry . "
in contrast to müntefering , steinmeier has been sharply critical of merkel on foreign policy recently , especially in regards to russia .
governance more important than campaigning in his interview with bild , steinmeier also warned that the social democrats and the conservatives ran the risk of gridlock before the next general election in 2009 if they opt to campaign rather than govern .
" we should avoid giving voters the feeling that we will be running a two-year-long election campaign .
that would be disastrous , " he was quoted as saying .
steinmeier also made it clear his party would n't back down on the issue of minimum wages , saying that everyone should " benefit from the recovering economy . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spat over a minimum wage is dividing the coaltion merkel 's conservatives continue to reject an overall national minimum wage proposed by the social democrats .
in addition , although the two sides have agreed in principle to introduce a minimum wage for postal workers , they remain deadlocked on the details .
" if -lsb- the coalition -rsb- ca n't reach a decision on an issue , then we have the right to say ; ' the voters should decide in 2009 ' , " steinmeier said .
" a minimum wage is important , and it will be introduced - if not with this government , then with the next . "
steinmeier more popular than spd leader beck steinmeier told bild he supported spd leader kurt beck as the party 's challenger to merkel in the next national election .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : last month , the spd under kurt beck voted to move to the left however , according to an emnid survey undertaken for bild 's sunday edition , voters prefer steinmeier , who has served as germany 's foreign minister since 2005 , over beck .
thirty-seven percent said steinmeier would be the better candidate , with 35 percent opting for beck ; 28 percent did n't have an opinion .
the actual spd candidate for the 2009 elections wo n't be announced until the end of 2008 . dw staff -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

his promotion was announced at the end of last week after veteran spd politician franz müntefering resigned from the position in order to care for his wife , who has cancer .
in an interview with germany 's bild newspaper , steinmeier said he was ready to engage in the trench warfare of daily politics with merkel 's conservatives , who rule in a grand coalition together with the spd .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : müntefering decided his wife ankepetra was more important than politics " there will always be differences of opinion in the coalition .
that means i will have to take a clear stand even if that means there is a real clash , " he said .
steinmeier , who has a reputation as a prudent and reliable diplomat , warned that he will " definitely not be the friendly gentleman from the foreign ministry . "
in contrast to müntefering , steinmeier has been sharply critical of merkel on foreign policy recently , especially in regards to russia .
governance more important than campaigning in his interview with bild , steinmeier also warned that the social democrats and the conservatives ran the risk of gridlock before the next general election in 2009 if they opt to campaign rather than govern .
" we should avoid giving voters the feeling that we will be running a two-year-long election campaign .
that would be disastrous , " he was quoted as saying .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spat over a minimum wage is dividing the coaltion merkel 's conservatives continue to reject an overall national minimum wage proposed by the social democrats .
in addition , although the two sides have agreed in principle to introduce a minimum wage for postal workers , they remain deadlocked on the details .
" if -lsb- the coalition -rsb- ca n't reach a decision on an issue , then we have the right to say ; ' the voters should decide in 2009 ' , " steinmeier said .
" a minimum wage is important , and it will be introduced - if not with this government , then with the next . "

all but a handful of the eu 's 27 member states are ready to recognize supervised independence for kosovo , a predominantly ethnic-albanian province of around 2 million people .
spain , greece , cyprus , romania and slovakia have all expressed reservations over the move , fearing that an independent kosovo could inspire other minorities in their own territories to do the same .
and with a united nations december 10 deadline for concluding diplomatic efforts looming , efforts to find a united eu front are rapidly running out of time .
kosovo threatens eu common foreign policy aim lack of unity over kosovo would deal a serious blow to the eu 's ambitions of forging a common foreign policy on the most pressing issues facing the bloc .
" a substantial majority -lrb- of eu countries -rrb- want to recognize -lrb- an independent -rrb- kosovo ... certainly well above 20 , but we have n't got to 27 yet , " said britain 's minister of state for europe , jim murphy .
but murphy then stressed that individual eu states , not the eu as a whole , were ultimately responsible for recognizing an independent kosovo .
" and -lrb- ministers -rrb- have made it clear that they will make their own assessment , " he added .
kosovo independence is strongly opposed by serbia , which enjoys the support of russia in the un security council .
a troika of eu , us and russian mediators , led by german diplomat wolfgang ischinger , has been given until december 10 to find an agreement between the two sides .
troika leader admits agreement unlikely but ischinger , speaking a day before another round of troika talks was due to be held in brussels , admitted his efforts were unlikely to succeed .
" we have explored almost every humanly known option for squaring the circle of the kosovo status issue , " ischinger said .
" the troika process , even if it were terminated today , has not been window dressing .
it was a genuine and intense negotiating process , " he added .
in an interview published monday by germany 's frankfurter allgemeine zeitung -lrb- faz -rrb- , democratic party of kosovo -lrb- pdk -rrb- leader thaci said that while he would respect the december 10 deadline , he did not expect " a compromise between kosovo and serbia . "
kosovo has been under un administration since 1999 , when nato bombing raids drove serbian troops out of the province .
nato has since been leading a peacekeeping operation in the area , and its kfor mission currently totals about 16,000 troops .
eu presidency to pursue all avenues speaking at the end of monday 's meeting in brussels , portuguese foreign minister luis amado , whose country holds the rotating presidency of the eu , said ministers would continue to pursue " all the possibilities to have a common position . "
but german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , while insisting that " a negotiated and agreed solution " to kosovo 's status would also be good for russia , admitted that his country was already getting prepared for " possible alternatives . "

his promotion was announced at the end of last week after veteran spd politician franz müntefering resigned from the position in order to care for his wife , who has cancer .
in an interview with germany 's bild newspaper , steinmeier said he was ready to engage in the trench warfare of daily politics with merkel 's conservatives , who rule in a grand coalition together with the spd .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : müntefering decided his wife ankepetra was more important than politics " there will always be differences of opinion in the coalition .
that means i will have to take a clear stand even if that means there is a real clash , " he said .
steinmeier , who has a reputation as a prudent and reliable diplomat , warned that he will " definitely not be the friendly gentleman from the foreign ministry . "
in contrast to müntefering , steinmeier has been sharply critical of merkel on foreign policy recently , especially in regards to russia .
governance more important than campaigning in his interview with bild , steinmeier also warned that the social democrats and the conservatives ran the risk of gridlock before the next general election in 2009 if they opt to campaign rather than govern .
" we should avoid giving voters the feeling that we will be running a two-year-long election campaign .
that would be disastrous , " he was quoted as saying .
steinmeier also made it clear his party would n't back down on the issue of minimum wages , saying that everyone should " benefit from the recovering economy . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spat over a minimum wage is dividing the coaltion merkel 's conservatives continue to reject an overall national minimum wage proposed by the social democrats .
in addition , although the two sides have agreed in principle to introduce a minimum wage for postal workers , they remain deadlocked on the details .
" if -lsb- the coalition -rsb- ca n't reach a decision on an issue , then we have the right to say ; ' the voters should decide in 2009 ' , " steinmeier said .
" a minimum wage is important , and it will be introduced - if not with this government , then with the next . "
steinmeier more popular than spd leader beck steinmeier told bild he supported spd leader kurt beck as the party 's challenger to merkel in the next national election .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : last month , the spd under kurt beck voted to move to the left however , according to an emnid survey undertaken for bild 's sunday edition , voters prefer steinmeier , who has served as germany 's foreign minister since 2005 , over beck .
thirty-seven percent said steinmeier would be the better candidate , with 35 percent opting for beck ; 28 percent did n't have an opinion .

all but a handful of the eu 's 27 member states are ready to recognize supervised independence for kosovo , a predominantly ethnic-albanian province of around 2 million people .
spain , greece , cyprus , romania and slovakia have all expressed reservations over the move , fearing that an independent kosovo could inspire other minorities in their own territories to do the same .
and with a united nations december 10 deadline for concluding diplomatic efforts looming , efforts to find a united eu front are rapidly running out of time .
kosovo threatens eu common foreign policy aim lack of unity over kosovo would deal a serious blow to the eu 's ambitions of forging a common foreign policy on the most pressing issues facing the bloc .
" a substantial majority -lrb- of eu countries -rrb- want to recognize -lrb- an independent -rrb- kosovo ... certainly well above 20 , but we have n't got to 27 yet , " said britain 's minister of state for europe , jim murphy .
but murphy then stressed that individual eu states , not the eu as a whole , were ultimately responsible for recognizing an independent kosovo .
" and -lrb- ministers -rrb- have made it clear that they will make their own assessment , " he added .
kosovo independence is strongly opposed by serbia , which enjoys the support of russia in the un security council .
a troika of eu , us and russian mediators , led by german diplomat wolfgang ischinger , has been given until december 10 to find an agreement between the two sides .
troika leader admits agreement unlikely but ischinger , speaking a day before another round of troika talks was due to be held in brussels , admitted his efforts were unlikely to succeed .
" we have explored almost every humanly known option for squaring the circle of the kosovo status issue , " ischinger said .
" the troika process , even if it were terminated today , has not been window dressing .
it was a genuine and intense negotiating process , " he added .
in an interview published monday by germany 's frankfurter allgemeine zeitung -lrb- faz -rrb- , democratic party of kosovo -lrb- pdk -rrb- leader thaci said that while he would respect the december 10 deadline , he did not expect " a compromise between kosovo and serbia . "
kosovo has been under un administration since 1999 , when nato bombing raids drove serbian troops out of the province .
nato has since been leading a peacekeeping operation in the area , and its kfor mission currently totals about 16,000 troops .
eu presidency to pursue all avenues speaking at the end of monday 's meeting in brussels , portuguese foreign minister luis amado , whose country holds the rotating presidency of the eu , said ministers would continue to pursue " all the possibilities to have a common position . "
but german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , while insisting that " a negotiated and agreed solution " to kosovo 's status would also be good for russia , admitted that his country was already getting prepared for " possible alternatives . "

all but a handful of the eu 's 27 member states are ready to recognize supervised independence for kosovo , a predominantly ethnic-albanian province of around 2 million people .
spain , greece , cyprus , romania and slovakia have all expressed reservations over the move , fearing that an independent kosovo could inspire other minorities in their own territories to do the same .
and with a united nations december 10 deadline for concluding diplomatic efforts looming , efforts to find a united eu front are rapidly running out of time .
kosovo threatens eu common foreign policy aim lack of unity over kosovo would deal a serious blow to the eu 's ambitions of forging a common foreign policy on the most pressing issues facing the bloc .
" a substantial majority -lrb- of eu countries -rrb- want to recognize -lrb- an independent -rrb- kosovo ... certainly well above 20 , but we have n't got to 27 yet , " said britain 's minister of state for europe , jim murphy .
but murphy then stressed that individual eu states , not the eu as a whole , were ultimately responsible for recognizing an independent kosovo .
" and -lrb- ministers -rrb- have made it clear that they will make their own assessment , " he added .
kosovo independence is strongly opposed by serbia , which enjoys the support of russia in the un security council .
a troika of eu , us and russian mediators , led by german diplomat wolfgang ischinger , has been given until december 10 to find an agreement between the two sides .
troika leader admits agreement unlikely but ischinger , speaking a day before another round of troika talks was due to be held in brussels , admitted his efforts were unlikely to succeed .
" we have explored almost every humanly known option for squaring the circle of the kosovo status issue , " ischinger said .
" the troika process , even if it were terminated today , has not been window dressing .
it was a genuine and intense negotiating process , " he added .
in an interview published monday by germany 's frankfurter allgemeine zeitung -lrb- faz -rrb- , democratic party of kosovo -lrb- pdk -rrb- leader thaci said that while he would respect the december 10 deadline , he did not expect " a compromise between kosovo and serbia . "
kosovo has been under un administration since 1999 , when nato bombing raids drove serbian troops out of the province .
nato has since been leading a peacekeeping operation in the area , and its kfor mission currently totals about 16,000 troops .
eu presidency to pursue all avenues speaking at the end of monday 's meeting in brussels , portuguese foreign minister luis amado , whose country holds the rotating presidency of the eu , said ministers would continue to pursue " all the possibilities to have a common position . "
but german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , while insisting that " a negotiated and agreed solution " to kosovo 's status would also be good for russia , admitted that his country was already getting prepared for " possible alternatives . "
and austrian foreign minister ursula plassnik said it was time eu ministers began giving serious thought to " the possibility that there will be no agreement " come december 10 . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we need a soft landing on this issue or we 'll have a hard crash , " swedish foreign minister carl bildt told reporters before an eu foreign ministers meeting in brussels on monday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un administration is to certify the final election results on dec .
4 former kosovo albanian guerrilla leader hashim thaci , who looks likely to become the province 's new leader , vowed to declare independence from serbia after exit polls showed his pdk party won saturday 's election .
austrian foreign minister ursula plassnik said thaci 's call did n't come as a surprise but urged kosovo albanians and serbs not to exacerbate their already growing tensions .
" the eu has asked all parties in this climate to behave carefully .
that applies to both belgrade and pristina , " plassnik said .

following the deadline , kosovo would set its own agenda , thaci said .
" it will take the decision about its own independence and i expect international support for this , " he told the faz .
un backing preferred the us has previously signaled it supports kosovo independence , but many eu member states are reluctant to support such a move without backing from the united nations .
" kosovo should have her independence -lrb- but -rrb- it should n't be an unmanaged unilateral declaration , " british europe minister jim murphy said on monday in brussels .
" it should be one that is coordinated with the international community . "
he also urged the eu not to let russia block statehood , as it did once before in the un security council .

" regardless of how exactly this process will end ... it is clear no one will be able to say that this was not a meaningful and intense and working negotiating process , " he added .
election criticism council of europe monitors said the weekend 's election complied with international standards , but in a preliminary statement criticized the " alarmingly low turnout " of 43 percent , saying that this demonstrated the " profound dissatisfaction " of the province 's 1.5 million eligible voters .

his promotion was announced at the end of last week after veteran spd politician franz müntefering resigned from the position in order to care for his wife , who has cancer .
in an interview with germany 's bild newspaper , steinmeier said he was ready to engage in the trench warfare of daily politics with merkel 's conservatives , who rule in a grand coalition together with the spd .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : müntefering decided his wife ankepetra was more important than politics " there will always be differences of opinion in the coalition .
that means i will have to take a clear stand even if that means there is a real clash , " he said .
steinmeier , who has a reputation as a prudent and reliable diplomat , warned that he will " definitely not be the friendly gentleman from the foreign ministry . "
in contrast to müntefering , steinmeier has been sharply critical of merkel on foreign policy recently , especially in regards to russia .
governance more important than campaigning in his interview with bild , steinmeier also warned that the social democrats and the conservatives ran the risk of gridlock before the next general election in 2009 if they opt to campaign rather than govern .
" we should avoid giving voters the feeling that we will be running a two-year-long election campaign .
that would be disastrous , " he was quoted as saying .
steinmeier also made it clear his party would n't back down on the issue of minimum wages , saying that everyone should " benefit from the recovering economy . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spat over a minimum wage is dividing the coaltion merkel 's conservatives continue to reject an overall national minimum wage proposed by the social democrats .
in addition , although the two sides have agreed in principle to introduce a minimum wage for postal workers , they remain deadlocked on the details .
" if -lsb- the coalition -rsb- ca n't reach a decision on an issue , then we have the right to say ; ' the voters should decide in 2009 ' , " steinmeier said .
" a minimum wage is important , and it will be introduced - if not with this government , then with the next . "
steinmeier more popular than spd leader beck steinmeier told bild he supported spd leader kurt beck as the party 's challenger to merkel in the next national election .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : last month , the spd under kurt beck voted to move to the left however , according to an emnid survey undertaken for bild 's sunday edition , voters prefer steinmeier , who has served as germany 's foreign minister since 2005 , over beck .
thirty-seven percent said steinmeier would be the better candidate , with 35 percent opting for beck ; 28 percent did n't have an opinion .

20 - the one-year anniversary of a school massacre in the german town of emsdetten in which an 18-year-old had injured 37 people before taking his own life . " they wanted to injure and kill people and then kill themselves , " said leading police investigator norbert wagner on sunday in cologne . other students alerted police to the plot at the cologne high school in western germany by pointing out pictures of the 1999 columbine high school shooting in the us state of colorado that the 17-year-old had posted to the internet . suspect commits suicide after plans uncovered the boy threw himself in front of a tram , later dying of injuries , after police had visited the school on friday to confront him about the online massacre pictures .
a police spokesman said monday that the student had immediately agreed to remove the photos and gave no indication of being suicidal when officers spoke with him . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police said the suspect did n't appear suicidal an 18-year-old accomplice was taken into custody and confessed to the plot , said police .

all but a handful of the eu 's 27 member states are ready to recognize supervised independence for kosovo , a predominantly ethnic-albanian province of around 2 million people .
spain , greece , cyprus , romania and slovakia have all expressed reservations over the move , fearing that an independent kosovo could inspire other minorities in their own territories to do the same .
and with a united nations december 10 deadline for concluding diplomatic efforts looming , efforts to find a united eu front are rapidly running out of time .
kosovo threatens eu common foreign policy aim lack of unity over kosovo would deal a serious blow to the eu 's ambitions of forging a common foreign policy on the most pressing issues facing the bloc .
" a substantial majority -lrb- of eu countries -rrb- want to recognize -lrb- an independent -rrb- kosovo ... certainly well above 20 , but we have n't got to 27 yet , " said britain 's minister of state for europe , jim murphy .
but murphy then stressed that individual eu states , not the eu as a whole , were ultimately responsible for recognizing an independent kosovo .
" and -lrb- ministers -rrb- have made it clear that they will make their own assessment , " he added .
kosovo independence is strongly opposed by serbia , which enjoys the support of russia in the un security council .
a troika of eu , us and russian mediators , led by german diplomat wolfgang ischinger , has been given until december 10 to find an agreement between the two sides .
troika leader admits agreement unlikely but ischinger , speaking a day before another round of troika talks was due to be held in brussels , admitted his efforts were unlikely to succeed .
" we have explored almost every humanly known option for squaring the circle of the kosovo status issue , " ischinger said .
" the troika process , even if it were terminated today , has not been window dressing .
it was a genuine and intense negotiating process , " he added .
in an interview published monday by germany 's frankfurter allgemeine zeitung -lrb- faz -rrb- , democratic party of kosovo -lrb- pdk -rrb- leader thaci said that while he would respect the december 10 deadline , he did not expect " a compromise between kosovo and serbia . "
kosovo has been under un administration since 1999 , when nato bombing raids drove serbian troops out of the province .
nato has since been leading a peacekeeping operation in the area , and its kfor mission currently totals about 16,000 troops .
eu presidency to pursue all avenues speaking at the end of monday 's meeting in brussels , portuguese foreign minister luis amado , whose country holds the rotating presidency of the eu , said ministers would continue to pursue " all the possibilities to have a common position . "
but german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , while insisting that " a negotiated and agreed solution " to kosovo 's status would also be good for russia , admitted that his country was already getting prepared for " possible alternatives . "

all but a handful of the eu 's 27 member states are ready to recognize supervised independence for kosovo , a predominantly ethnic-albanian province of around 2 million people .
spain , greece , cyprus , romania and slovakia have all expressed reservations over the move , fearing that an independent kosovo could inspire other minorities in their own territories to do the same .
and with a united nations december 10 deadline for concluding diplomatic efforts looming , efforts to find a united eu front are rapidly running out of time .
kosovo threatens eu common foreign policy aim lack of unity over kosovo would deal a serious blow to the eu 's ambitions of forging a common foreign policy on the most pressing issues facing the bloc .
" a substantial majority -lrb- of eu countries -rrb- want to recognize -lrb- an independent -rrb- kosovo ... certainly well above 20 , but we have n't got to 27 yet , " said britain 's minister of state for europe , jim murphy .
but murphy then stressed that individual eu states , not the eu as a whole , were ultimately responsible for recognizing an independent kosovo .
" and -lrb- ministers -rrb- have made it clear that they will make their own assessment , " he added .
kosovo independence is strongly opposed by serbia , which enjoys the support of russia in the un security council .
a troika of eu , us and russian mediators , led by german diplomat wolfgang ischinger , has been given until december 10 to find an agreement between the two sides .
troika leader admits agreement unlikely but ischinger , speaking a day before another round of troika talks was due to be held in brussels , admitted his efforts were unlikely to succeed .
" we have explored almost every humanly known option for squaring the circle of the kosovo status issue , " ischinger said .
" the troika process , even if it were terminated today , has not been window dressing .
it was a genuine and intense negotiating process , " he added .
in an interview published monday by germany 's frankfurter allgemeine zeitung -lrb- faz -rrb- , democratic party of kosovo -lrb- pdk -rrb- leader thaci said that while he would respect the december 10 deadline , he did not expect " a compromise between kosovo and serbia . "
kosovo has been under un administration since 1999 , when nato bombing raids drove serbian troops out of the province .
nato has since been leading a peacekeeping operation in the area , and its kfor mission currently totals about 16,000 troops .
eu presidency to pursue all avenues speaking at the end of monday 's meeting in brussels , portuguese foreign minister luis amado , whose country holds the rotating presidency of the eu , said ministers would continue to pursue " all the possibilities to have a common position . "
but german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , while insisting that " a negotiated and agreed solution " to kosovo 's status would also be good for russia , admitted that his country was already getting prepared for " possible alternatives . "
and austrian foreign minister ursula plassnik said it was time eu ministers began giving serious thought to " the possibility that there will be no agreement " come december 10 . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

18 , edition of britain 's the sunday times asserted that german military pilots in afghanistan are obliged to return to base by sunset - no matter what . the paper said bundeswehr medical evacuation helicopters that were participating in an offensive against the taliban with norwegian and afghan troops the pilots pulled out in the middle of the battle , forcing the norwegians to follow suit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the germans were accused of abandoning their allies " we were attacking the bad guys , then at three or four o 'clock the helicopters are leaving , " a norwegian soldier told the sunday times .
" we had to go back to base .
we should have had norwegian helicopters .
at least they can fly at night . " the remaining 600 afghan soldiers had to retreat until they could be reinforced the following day by a convoy of american humvees . in addition , the british paper claimed that germany 's refusal to fly at night was hindering operation desert eagle , an allied offensive involving 500 nato-led troops and 1,000 afghan soldiers and police . bundeswehr says night flights possible " there is no ban on night flights , " a bundeswehr spokesman told the online version of the german newsmagazine der spiegel .

the bundeswehr is mainly active in civilian reconstruction projects and peacekeeping in the relatively nonviolent northern region of afghanistan .
the german military has also contributed six reconnaissance jets that fly missions over the country 's southern regions . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we need a soft landing on this issue or we 'll have a hard crash , " swedish foreign minister carl bildt told reporters before an eu foreign ministers meeting in brussels on monday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un administration is to certify the final election results on dec .
4 former kosovo albanian guerrilla leader hashim thaci , who looks likely to become the province 's new leader , vowed to declare independence from serbia after exit polls showed his pdk party won saturday 's election .
austrian foreign minister ursula plassnik said thaci 's call did n't come as a surprise but urged kosovo albanians and serbs not to exacerbate their already growing tensions .
" the eu has asked all parties in this climate to behave carefully .
that applies to both belgrade and pristina , " plassnik said .
thaci vows to respect deadline however , in an interview published on monday in the german daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung -lrb- faz -rrb- , thaci said that he would respect the agenda set by mediators from the eu , us and russia up to december 10 , when a united nations deadline on the status of the albanian-majority province runs out .
" i do not expect a compromise between kosovo and serbia , but we will respect the agenda of the troika up to december 10 , " said thaci .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un has administered kosovo since 1999 serbia , with russian support , is strongly opposed to any form of independence and is only prepared to offer broad autonomy for kosovo , which is currently administered by the united nations and policed by 16,000 nato peacekeepers .
following the deadline , kosovo would set its own agenda , thaci said .
" it will take the decision about its own independence and i expect international support for this , " he told the faz .
un backing preferred the us has previously signaled it supports kosovo independence , but many eu member states are reluctant to support such a move without backing from the united nations .
" kosovo should have her independence -lrb- but -rrb- it should n't be an unmanaged unilateral declaration , " british europe minister jim murphy said on monday in brussels .
" it should be one that is coordinated with the international community . "
he also urged the eu not to let russia block statehood , as it did once before in the un security council .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ischinger hopes that all the hard work will be worth it international negotiators are due to hold a further round of talks with serb and kosovo leaders in brussels on tuesday .
" we have explored almost every humanly known option for squaring the circle of the kosovo status issue , " wolfgang ischinger , a german diplomat leading the troika 's mediation , told a breakfast conference in brussels .
" regardless of how exactly this process will end ... it is clear no one will be able to say that this was not a meaningful and intense and working negotiating process , " he added .
election criticism council of europe monitors said the weekend 's election complied with international standards , but in a preliminary statement criticized the " alarmingly low turnout " of 43 percent , saying that this demonstrated the " profound dissatisfaction " of the province 's 1.5 million eligible voters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unemployment in kosovo is sixty percent " the people in kosovo are fed up with their political situation , " said german mep doris pack , who acted as an election observer .
pressured by the serbian government , saturday 's elections were boycotted by kosovo 's serb minority , who number around 120,000 .
thaci 's democratic party of kosovo scored 35 percent of the vote , beating the 22 percent of the democratic league of kosovo according to preliminary results .

following the deadline , kosovo would set its own agenda , thaci said .
" it will take the decision about its own independence and i expect international support for this , " he told the faz .
un backing preferred the us has previously signaled it supports kosovo independence , but many eu member states are reluctant to support such a move without backing from the united nations .
" kosovo should have her independence -lrb- but -rrb- it should n't be an unmanaged unilateral declaration , " british europe minister jim murphy said on monday in brussels .
" it should be one that is coordinated with the international community . "

" regardless of how exactly this process will end ... it is clear no one will be able to say that this was not a meaningful and intense and working negotiating process , " he added .
election criticism council of europe monitors said the weekend 's election complied with international standards , but in a preliminary statement criticized the " alarmingly low turnout " of 43 percent , saying that this demonstrated the " profound dissatisfaction " of the province 's 1.5 million eligible voters .

his promotion was announced at the end of last week after veteran spd politician franz müntefering resigned from the position in order to care for his wife , who has cancer .
in an interview with germany 's bild newspaper , steinmeier said he was ready to engage in the trench warfare of daily politics with merkel 's conservatives , who rule in a grand coalition together with the spd .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : müntefering decided his wife ankepetra was more important than politics " there will always be differences of opinion in the coalition .
that means i will have to take a clear stand even if that means there is a real clash , " he said .
steinmeier , who has a reputation as a prudent and reliable diplomat , warned that he will " definitely not be the friendly gentleman from the foreign ministry . "
in contrast to müntefering , steinmeier has been sharply critical of merkel on foreign policy recently , especially in regards to russia .
governance more important than campaigning in his interview with bild , steinmeier also warned that the social democrats and the conservatives ran the risk of gridlock before the next general election in 2009 if they opt to campaign rather than govern .
" we should avoid giving voters the feeling that we will be running a two-year-long election campaign .
that would be disastrous , " he was quoted as saying .
steinmeier also made it clear his party would n't back down on the issue of minimum wages , saying that everyone should " benefit from the recovering economy . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spat over a minimum wage is dividing the coaltion merkel 's conservatives continue to reject an overall national minimum wage proposed by the social democrats .
in addition , although the two sides have agreed in principle to introduce a minimum wage for postal workers , they remain deadlocked on the details .
" if -lsb- the coalition -rsb- ca n't reach a decision on an issue , then we have the right to say ; ' the voters should decide in 2009 ' , " steinmeier said .
" a minimum wage is important , and it will be introduced - if not with this government , then with the next . "
steinmeier more popular than spd leader beck steinmeier told bild he supported spd leader kurt beck as the party 's challenger to merkel in the next national election .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : last month , the spd under kurt beck voted to move to the left however , according to an emnid survey undertaken for bild 's sunday edition , voters prefer steinmeier , who has served as germany 's foreign minister since 2005 , over beck .
thirty-seven percent said steinmeier would be the better candidate , with 35 percent opting for beck ; 28 percent did n't have an opinion .
the actual spd candidate for the 2009 elections wo n't be announced until the end of 2008 . dw staff -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

his promotion was announced at the end of last week after veteran spd politician franz müntefering resigned from the position in order to care for his wife , who has cancer .
in an interview with germany 's bild newspaper , steinmeier said he was ready to engage in the trench warfare of daily politics with merkel 's conservatives , who rule in a grand coalition together with the spd .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : müntefering decided his wife ankepetra was more important than politics " there will always be differences of opinion in the coalition .
that means i will have to take a clear stand even if that means there is a real clash , " he said .

" if -lsb- the coalition -rsb- ca n't reach a decision on an issue , then we have the right to say ; ' the voters should decide in 2009 ' , " steinmeier said .
" a minimum wage is important , and it will be introduced - if not with this government , then with the next . "
steinmeier more popular than spd leader beck steinmeier told bild he supported spd leader kurt beck as the party 's challenger to merkel in the next national election .

governance more important than campaigning in his interview with bild , steinmeier also warned that the social democrats and the conservatives ran the risk of gridlock before the next general election in 2009 if they opt to campaign rather than govern .
" we should avoid giving voters the feeling that we will be running a two-year-long election campaign .
that would be disastrous , " he was quoted as saying .

in addition , although the two sides have agreed in principle to introduce a minimum wage for postal workers , they remain deadlocked on the details .
" if -lsb- the coalition -rsb- ca n't reach a decision on an issue , then we have the right to say ; ' the voters should decide in 2009 ' , " steinmeier said .
" a minimum wage is important , and it will be introduced - if not with this government , then with the next . "

his promotion was announced at the end of last week after veteran spd politician franz müntefering resigned from the position in order to care for his wife , who has cancer .
in an interview with germany 's bild newspaper , steinmeier said he was ready to engage in the trench warfare of daily politics with merkel 's conservatives , who rule in a grand coalition together with the spd .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : müntefering decided his wife ankepetra was more important than politics " there will always be differences of opinion in the coalition .

all but a handful of the eu 's 27 member states are ready to recognize supervised independence for kosovo , a predominantly ethnic-albanian province of around 2 million people .
spain , greece , cyprus , romania and slovakia have all expressed reservations over the move , fearing that an independent kosovo could inspire other minorities in their own territories to do the same .
and with a united nations december 10 deadline for concluding diplomatic efforts looming , efforts to find a united eu front are rapidly running out of time .
kosovo threatens eu common foreign policy aim lack of unity over kosovo would deal a serious blow to the eu 's ambitions of forging a common foreign policy on the most pressing issues facing the bloc .
" a substantial majority -lrb- of eu countries -rrb- want to recognize -lrb- an independent -rrb- kosovo ... certainly well above 20 , but we have n't got to 27 yet , " said britain 's minister of state for europe , jim murphy .
but murphy then stressed that individual eu states , not the eu as a whole , were ultimately responsible for recognizing an independent kosovo .
" and -lrb- ministers -rrb- have made it clear that they will make their own assessment , " he added .
kosovo independence is strongly opposed by serbia , which enjoys the support of russia in the un security council .
a troika of eu , us and russian mediators , led by german diplomat wolfgang ischinger , has been given until december 10 to find an agreement between the two sides .
troika leader admits agreement unlikely but ischinger , speaking a day before another round of troika talks was due to be held in brussels , admitted his efforts were unlikely to succeed .
" we have explored almost every humanly known option for squaring the circle of the kosovo status issue , " ischinger said .
" the troika process , even if it were terminated today , has not been window dressing .
it was a genuine and intense negotiating process , " he added .
in an interview published monday by germany 's frankfurter allgemeine zeitung -lrb- faz -rrb- , democratic party of kosovo -lrb- pdk -rrb- leader thaci said that while he would respect the december 10 deadline , he did not expect " a compromise between kosovo and serbia . "
kosovo has been under un administration since 1999 , when nato bombing raids drove serbian troops out of the province .
nato has since been leading a peacekeeping operation in the area , and its kfor mission currently totals about 16,000 troops .
eu presidency to pursue all avenues speaking at the end of monday 's meeting in brussels , portuguese foreign minister luis amado , whose country holds the rotating presidency of the eu , said ministers would continue to pursue " all the possibilities to have a common position . "
but german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , while insisting that " a negotiated and agreed solution " to kosovo 's status would also be good for russia , admitted that his country was already getting prepared for " possible alternatives . "
and austrian foreign minister ursula plassnik said it was time eu ministers began giving serious thought to " the possibility that there will be no agreement " come december 10 . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

kosovo threatens eu common foreign policy aim lack of unity over kosovo would deal a serious blow to the eu 's ambitions of forging a common foreign policy on the most pressing issues facing the bloc .
" a substantial majority -lrb- of eu countries -rrb- want to recognize -lrb- an independent -rrb- kosovo ... certainly well above 20 , but we have n't got to 27 yet , " said britain 's minister of state for europe , jim murphy .
but murphy then stressed that individual eu states , not the eu as a whole , were ultimately responsible for recognizing an independent kosovo .
" and -lrb- ministers -rrb- have made it clear that they will make their own assessment , " he added .
kosovo independence is strongly opposed by serbia , which enjoys the support of russia in the un security council .
a troika of eu , us and russian mediators , led by german diplomat wolfgang ischinger , has been given until december 10 to find an agreement between the two sides .
troika leader admits agreement unlikely but ischinger , speaking a day before another round of troika talks was due to be held in brussels , admitted his efforts were unlikely to succeed .
" we have explored almost every humanly known option for squaring the circle of the kosovo status issue , " ischinger said .
" the troika process , even if it were terminated today , has not been window dressing .
it was a genuine and intense negotiating process , " he added .
in an interview published monday by germany 's frankfurter allgemeine zeitung -lrb- faz -rrb- , democratic party of kosovo -lrb- pdk -rrb- leader thaci said that while he would respect the december 10 deadline , he did not expect " a compromise between kosovo and serbia . "
kosovo has been under un administration since 1999 , when nato bombing raids drove serbian troops out of the province .
nato has since been leading a peacekeeping operation in the area , and its kfor mission currently totals about 16,000 troops .
eu presidency to pursue all avenues speaking at the end of monday 's meeting in brussels , portuguese foreign minister luis amado , whose country holds the rotating presidency of the eu , said ministers would continue to pursue " all the possibilities to have a common position . "
but german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , while insisting that " a negotiated and agreed solution " to kosovo 's status would also be good for russia , admitted that his country was already getting prepared for " possible alternatives . "
and austrian foreign minister ursula plassnik said it was time eu ministers began giving serious thought to " the possibility that there will be no agreement " come december 10 . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

his promotion was announced at the end of last week after veteran spd politician franz müntefering resigned from the position in order to care for his wife , who has cancer .
in an interview with germany 's bild newspaper , steinmeier said he was ready to engage in the trench warfare of daily politics with merkel 's conservatives , who rule in a grand coalition together with the spd .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : müntefering decided his wife ankepetra was more important than politics " there will always be differences of opinion in the coalition .
that means i will have to take a clear stand even if that means there is a real clash , " he said .
steinmeier , who has a reputation as a prudent and reliable diplomat , warned that he will " definitely not be the friendly gentleman from the foreign ministry . "
in contrast to müntefering , steinmeier has been sharply critical of merkel on foreign policy recently , especially in regards to russia .
governance more important than campaigning in his interview with bild , steinmeier also warned that the social democrats and the conservatives ran the risk of gridlock before the next general election in 2009 if they opt to campaign rather than govern .
" we should avoid giving voters the feeling that we will be running a two-year-long election campaign .
that would be disastrous , " he was quoted as saying .
steinmeier also made it clear his party would n't back down on the issue of minimum wages , saying that everyone should " benefit from the recovering economy . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spat over a minimum wage is dividing the coaltion merkel 's conservatives continue to reject an overall national minimum wage proposed by the social democrats .
in addition , although the two sides have agreed in principle to introduce a minimum wage for postal workers , they remain deadlocked on the details .
" if -lsb- the coalition -rsb- ca n't reach a decision on an issue , then we have the right to say ; ' the voters should decide in 2009 ' , " steinmeier said .
" a minimum wage is important , and it will be introduced - if not with this government , then with the next . "
steinmeier more popular than spd leader beck steinmeier told bild he supported spd leader kurt beck as the party 's challenger to merkel in the next national election .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : last month , the spd under kurt beck voted to move to the left however , according to an emnid survey undertaken for bild 's sunday edition , voters prefer steinmeier , who has served as germany 's foreign minister since 2005 , over beck .
thirty-seven percent said steinmeier would be the better candidate , with 35 percent opting for beck ; 28 percent did n't have an opinion .

his promotion was announced at the end of last week after veteran spd politician franz müntefering resigned from the position in order to care for his wife , who has cancer .
in an interview with germany 's bild newspaper , steinmeier said he was ready to engage in the trench warfare of daily politics with merkel 's conservatives , who rule in a grand coalition together with the spd .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : müntefering decided his wife ankepetra was more important than politics " there will always be differences of opinion in the coalition .
that means i will have to take a clear stand even if that means there is a real clash , " he said .
steinmeier , who has a reputation as a prudent and reliable diplomat , warned that he will " definitely not be the friendly gentleman from the foreign ministry . "
in contrast to müntefering , steinmeier has been sharply critical of merkel on foreign policy recently , especially in regards to russia .
governance more important than campaigning in his interview with bild , steinmeier also warned that the social democrats and the conservatives ran the risk of gridlock before the next general election in 2009 if they opt to campaign rather than govern .
" we should avoid giving voters the feeling that we will be running a two-year-long election campaign .
that would be disastrous , " he was quoted as saying .
steinmeier also made it clear his party would n't back down on the issue of minimum wages , saying that everyone should " benefit from the recovering economy . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spat over a minimum wage is dividing the coaltion merkel 's conservatives continue to reject an overall national minimum wage proposed by the social democrats .
in addition , although the two sides have agreed in principle to introduce a minimum wage for postal workers , they remain deadlocked on the details .
" if -lsb- the coalition -rsb- ca n't reach a decision on an issue , then we have the right to say ; ' the voters should decide in 2009 ' , " steinmeier said .
" a minimum wage is important , and it will be introduced - if not with this government , then with the next . "
steinmeier more popular than spd leader beck steinmeier told bild he supported spd leader kurt beck as the party 's challenger to merkel in the next national election .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : last month , the spd under kurt beck voted to move to the left however , according to an emnid survey undertaken for bild 's sunday edition , voters prefer steinmeier , who has served as germany 's foreign minister since 2005 , over beck .
thirty-seven percent said steinmeier would be the better candidate , with 35 percent opting for beck ; 28 percent did n't have an opinion .

all but a handful of the eu 's 27 member states are ready to recognize supervised independence for kosovo , a predominantly ethnic-albanian province of around 2 million people .
spain , greece , cyprus , romania and slovakia have all expressed reservations over the move , fearing that an independent kosovo could inspire other minorities in their own territories to do the same .
and with a united nations december 10 deadline for concluding diplomatic efforts looming , efforts to find a united eu front are rapidly running out of time .
kosovo threatens eu common foreign policy aim lack of unity over kosovo would deal a serious blow to the eu 's ambitions of forging a common foreign policy on the most pressing issues facing the bloc .
" a substantial majority -lrb- of eu countries -rrb- want to recognize -lrb- an independent -rrb- kosovo ... certainly well above 20 , but we have n't got to 27 yet , " said britain 's minister of state for europe , jim murphy .
but murphy then stressed that individual eu states , not the eu as a whole , were ultimately responsible for recognizing an independent kosovo .
" and -lrb- ministers -rrb- have made it clear that they will make their own assessment , " he added .
kosovo independence is strongly opposed by serbia , which enjoys the support of russia in the un security council .
a troika of eu , us and russian mediators , led by german diplomat wolfgang ischinger , has been given until december 10 to find an agreement between the two sides .
troika leader admits agreement unlikely but ischinger , speaking a day before another round of troika talks was due to be held in brussels , admitted his efforts were unlikely to succeed .
" we have explored almost every humanly known option for squaring the circle of the kosovo status issue , " ischinger said .
" the troika process , even if it were terminated today , has not been window dressing .
it was a genuine and intense negotiating process , " he added .
in an interview published monday by germany 's frankfurter allgemeine zeitung -lrb- faz -rrb- , democratic party of kosovo -lrb- pdk -rrb- leader thaci said that while he would respect the december 10 deadline , he did not expect " a compromise between kosovo and serbia . "
kosovo has been under un administration since 1999 , when nato bombing raids drove serbian troops out of the province .
nato has since been leading a peacekeeping operation in the area , and its kfor mission currently totals about 16,000 troops .
eu presidency to pursue all avenues speaking at the end of monday 's meeting in brussels , portuguese foreign minister luis amado , whose country holds the rotating presidency of the eu , said ministers would continue to pursue " all the possibilities to have a common position . "
but german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , while insisting that " a negotiated and agreed solution " to kosovo 's status would also be good for russia , admitted that his country was already getting prepared for " possible alternatives . "
and austrian foreign minister ursula plassnik said it was time eu ministers began giving serious thought to " the possibility that there will be no agreement " come december 10 . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

all but a handful of the eu 's 27 member states are ready to recognize supervised independence for kosovo , a predominantly ethnic-albanian province of around 2 million people .
spain , greece , cyprus , romania and slovakia have all expressed reservations over the move , fearing that an independent kosovo could inspire other minorities in their own territories to do the same .
and with a united nations december 10 deadline for concluding diplomatic efforts looming , efforts to find a united eu front are rapidly running out of time .
kosovo threatens eu common foreign policy aim lack of unity over kosovo would deal a serious blow to the eu 's ambitions of forging a common foreign policy on the most pressing issues facing the bloc .
" a substantial majority -lrb- of eu countries -rrb- want to recognize -lrb- an independent -rrb- kosovo ... certainly well above 20 , but we have n't got to 27 yet , " said britain 's minister of state for europe , jim murphy .
but murphy then stressed that individual eu states , not the eu as a whole , were ultimately responsible for recognizing an independent kosovo .
" and -lrb- ministers -rrb- have made it clear that they will make their own assessment , " he added .
kosovo independence is strongly opposed by serbia , which enjoys the support of russia in the un security council .

his promotion was announced at the end of last week after veteran spd politician franz müntefering resigned from the position in order to care for his wife , who has cancer .
in an interview with germany 's bild newspaper , steinmeier said he was ready to engage in the trench warfare of daily politics with merkel 's conservatives , who rule in a grand coalition together with the spd .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : müntefering decided his wife ankepetra was more important than politics " there will always be differences of opinion in the coalition .
that means i will have to take a clear stand even if that means there is a real clash , " he said .
steinmeier , who has a reputation as a prudent and reliable diplomat , warned that he will " definitely not be the friendly gentleman from the foreign ministry . "
in contrast to müntefering , steinmeier has been sharply critical of merkel on foreign policy recently , especially in regards to russia .
governance more important than campaigning in his interview with bild , steinmeier also warned that the social democrats and the conservatives ran the risk of gridlock before the next general election in 2009 if they opt to campaign rather than govern .
" we should avoid giving voters the feeling that we will be running a two-year-long election campaign .
that would be disastrous , " he was quoted as saying .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spat over a minimum wage is dividing the coaltion merkel 's conservatives continue to reject an overall national minimum wage proposed by the social democrats .
in addition , although the two sides have agreed in principle to introduce a minimum wage for postal workers , they remain deadlocked on the details .
" if -lsb- the coalition -rsb- ca n't reach a decision on an issue , then we have the right to say ; ' the voters should decide in 2009 ' , " steinmeier said .
" a minimum wage is important , and it will be introduced - if not with this government , then with the next . "
steinmeier more popular than spd leader beck steinmeier told bild he supported spd leader kurt beck as the party 's challenger to merkel in the next national election .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : last month , the spd under kurt beck voted to move to the left however , according to an emnid survey undertaken for bild 's sunday edition , voters prefer steinmeier , who has served as germany 's foreign minister since 2005 , over beck .
thirty-seven percent said steinmeier would be the better candidate , with 35 percent opting for beck ; 28 percent did n't have an opinion .
the actual spd candidate for the 2009 elections wo n't be announced until the end of 2008 . dw staff -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

his promotion was announced at the end of last week after veteran spd politician franz müntefering resigned from the position in order to care for his wife , who has cancer .
in an interview with germany 's bild newspaper , steinmeier said he was ready to engage in the trench warfare of daily politics with merkel 's conservatives , who rule in a grand coalition together with the spd .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : müntefering decided his wife ankepetra was more important than politics " there will always be differences of opinion in the coalition .
that means i will have to take a clear stand even if that means there is a real clash , " he said .
steinmeier , who has a reputation as a prudent and reliable diplomat , warned that he will " definitely not be the friendly gentleman from the foreign ministry . "
in contrast to müntefering , steinmeier has been sharply critical of merkel on foreign policy recently , especially in regards to russia .
governance more important than campaigning in his interview with bild , steinmeier also warned that the social democrats and the conservatives ran the risk of gridlock before the next general election in 2009 if they opt to campaign rather than govern .
" we should avoid giving voters the feeling that we will be running a two-year-long election campaign .
that would be disastrous , " he was quoted as saying .
steinmeier also made it clear his party would n't back down on the issue of minimum wages , saying that everyone should " benefit from the recovering economy . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spat over a minimum wage is dividing the coaltion merkel 's conservatives continue to reject an overall national minimum wage proposed by the social democrats .

all but a handful of the eu 's 27 member states are ready to recognize supervised independence for kosovo , a predominantly ethnic-albanian province of around 2 million people .
spain , greece , cyprus , romania and slovakia have all expressed reservations over the move , fearing that an independent kosovo could inspire other minorities in their own territories to do the same .
and with a united nations december 10 deadline for concluding diplomatic efforts looming , efforts to find a united eu front are rapidly running out of time .
kosovo threatens eu common foreign policy aim lack of unity over kosovo would deal a serious blow to the eu 's ambitions of forging a common foreign policy on the most pressing issues facing the bloc .
" a substantial majority -lrb- of eu countries -rrb- want to recognize -lrb- an independent -rrb- kosovo ... certainly well above 20 , but we have n't got to 27 yet , " said britain 's minister of state for europe , jim murphy .
but murphy then stressed that individual eu states , not the eu as a whole , were ultimately responsible for recognizing an independent kosovo .
" and -lrb- ministers -rrb- have made it clear that they will make their own assessment , " he added .
kosovo independence is strongly opposed by serbia , which enjoys the support of russia in the un security council .
a troika of eu , us and russian mediators , led by german diplomat wolfgang ischinger , has been given until december 10 to find an agreement between the two sides .
troika leader admits agreement unlikely but ischinger , speaking a day before another round of troika talks was due to be held in brussels , admitted his efforts were unlikely to succeed .
" we have explored almost every humanly known option for squaring the circle of the kosovo status issue , " ischinger said .
" the troika process , even if it were terminated today , has not been window dressing .
it was a genuine and intense negotiating process , " he added .
in an interview published monday by germany 's frankfurter allgemeine zeitung -lrb- faz -rrb- , democratic party of kosovo -lrb- pdk -rrb- leader thaci said that while he would respect the december 10 deadline , he did not expect " a compromise between kosovo and serbia . "
kosovo has been under un administration since 1999 , when nato bombing raids drove serbian troops out of the province .
nato has since been leading a peacekeeping operation in the area , and its kfor mission currently totals about 16,000 troops .
eu presidency to pursue all avenues speaking at the end of monday 's meeting in brussels , portuguese foreign minister luis amado , whose country holds the rotating presidency of the eu , said ministers would continue to pursue " all the possibilities to have a common position . "
but german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , while insisting that " a negotiated and agreed solution " to kosovo 's status would also be good for russia , admitted that his country was already getting prepared for " possible alternatives . "

all but a handful of the eu 's 27 member states are ready to recognize supervised independence for kosovo , a predominantly ethnic-albanian province of around 2 million people .
spain , greece , cyprus , romania and slovakia have all expressed reservations over the move , fearing that an independent kosovo could inspire other minorities in their own territories to do the same .
and with a united nations december 10 deadline for concluding diplomatic efforts looming , efforts to find a united eu front are rapidly running out of time .
kosovo threatens eu common foreign policy aim lack of unity over kosovo would deal a serious blow to the eu 's ambitions of forging a common foreign policy on the most pressing issues facing the bloc .
" a substantial majority -lrb- of eu countries -rrb- want to recognize -lrb- an independent -rrb- kosovo ... certainly well above 20 , but we have n't got to 27 yet , " said britain 's minister of state for europe , jim murphy .
but murphy then stressed that individual eu states , not the eu as a whole , were ultimately responsible for recognizing an independent kosovo .
" and -lrb- ministers -rrb- have made it clear that they will make their own assessment , " he added .
kosovo independence is strongly opposed by serbia , which enjoys the support of russia in the un security council .
a troika of eu , us and russian mediators , led by german diplomat wolfgang ischinger , has been given until december 10 to find an agreement between the two sides .
troika leader admits agreement unlikely but ischinger , speaking a day before another round of troika talks was due to be held in brussels , admitted his efforts were unlikely to succeed .
" we have explored almost every humanly known option for squaring the circle of the kosovo status issue , " ischinger said .
" the troika process , even if it were terminated today , has not been window dressing .
it was a genuine and intense negotiating process , " he added .
in an interview published monday by germany 's frankfurter allgemeine zeitung -lrb- faz -rrb- , democratic party of kosovo -lrb- pdk -rrb- leader thaci said that while he would respect the december 10 deadline , he did not expect " a compromise between kosovo and serbia . "
kosovo has been under un administration since 1999 , when nato bombing raids drove serbian troops out of the province .
nato has since been leading a peacekeeping operation in the area , and its kfor mission currently totals about 16,000 troops .
eu presidency to pursue all avenues speaking at the end of monday 's meeting in brussels , portuguese foreign minister luis amado , whose country holds the rotating presidency of the eu , said ministers would continue to pursue " all the possibilities to have a common position . "
but german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , while insisting that " a negotiated and agreed solution " to kosovo 's status would also be good for russia , admitted that his country was already getting prepared for " possible alternatives . "
and austrian foreign minister ursula plassnik said it was time eu ministers began giving serious thought to " the possibility that there will be no agreement " come december 10 . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

18 , edition of britain 's the sunday times asserted that german military pilots in afghanistan are obliged to return to base by sunset - no matter what . the paper said bundeswehr medical evacuation helicopters that were participating in an offensive against the taliban with norwegian and afghan troops the pilots pulled out in the middle of the battle , forcing the norwegians to follow suit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the germans were accused of abandoning their allies " we were attacking the bad guys , then at three or four o 'clock the helicopters are leaving , " a norwegian soldier told the sunday times .
" we had to go back to base .
we should have had norwegian helicopters .
at least they can fly at night . " the remaining 600 afghan soldiers had to retreat until they could be reinforced the following day by a convoy of american humvees . in addition , the british paper claimed that germany 's refusal to fly at night was hindering operation desert eagle , an allied offensive involving 500 nato-led troops and 1,000 afghan soldiers and police . bundeswehr says night flights possible " there is no ban on night flights , " a bundeswehr spokesman told the online version of the german newsmagazine der spiegel .

the bundeswehr is mainly active in civilian reconstruction projects and peacekeeping in the relatively nonviolent northern region of afghanistan .

the figures , from april 2006 to april 2007 , were revealed at the start of wales ' anti-bullying week which is run by the welsh assembly government .
this year 's theme highlights the role schools play in dealing with bullying .
this will be the starting point for schools and others to explore cyber-bullying , safer routes for pupils , engaging parents and carers in school life , and racist and homophobic bullying . "
teachers play a key role in stopping bullying , so it 's vital that children feel confident about talking to their teacher and know that action will be taken " gwen axford , of the nspcc schools across the country will be holding events for students to highlight the issue , while staff will be briefed and workshops held for parents and carers .
gemma lang , who set up her own anti-bullying group full stop 2 bullying after being bullied herself , said the week was important as it raised awareness .
" i think there are various reasons why so many people are calling childline about bullying , " said ms lang , who is also an ambassador for childline cymru / wales .
" there are so many more forms of bullying these days .
with new media they can get bullied at any time , in any place now .
" when i was bullied there was n't the problem of cyber-bullies .

the nspcc cymru / wales is using the week to call on head teachers to sign their school up to its new defeat bullying campaign , which gives teachers lesson plans to explore issues around bullying .
nspcc schools ' fundraising manager for wales gwen axford said : " teachers play a key role in stopping bullying , so it 's vital that children feel confident about talking to their teacher and know that action will be taken . "
barnardo 's cymru has also published research which suggests problems could be reduced if more work was done with those who act as back-ups to a bully , and the passers-by who witness bullying but do not get involved .
barnardo 's research and policy officer vikki butler said : " bullies tend to have groups of friends who do not carry out bullying themselves , but act as " back-up " .
" young people who take on this role are often scared of the bullies themselves , but feel they are protected from being bullied themselves by being part of the group . "
launching the campaign , education minister jane hutt said : " we must confront the issue in our schools and our communities and tackle bullying together , not just for one week , but for every week in the lives of our young citizens . "

the 26-year-old landed the star role in andrew lloyd webber 's musical , joseph and the amazing technicolor dreamcoat , in london 's west end .
he is now about to embark on a different career thread with the release of his self-titled debut album .
what sort of music is on the album ?
it has a very live band feel .
it 's nice to do an album that was more contemporary because i think it was expected i would do a musical theatre album .
it was nice to do a different genre as such , just to show what else i can do .
there 's about four or five covers , but they 're not your typical covers that you would expect , like gonna make you a star , by david essex .
take that 's gary barlow wrote a song for mead 's album it has a good vibe and we 've cut no corners .
there 's about five brand new songs as well and one of the songs was agreed by gary barlow .
he came and watched the show with his kids and enjoyed it .
he agreed to put a song on the album which is great for an artist like myself to have someone like him give me a song .
it 's called i need you the most and it 's a really nice ballad .
why did you decide to record several covers instead of putting out new music ?
i think it was the time-scale really , what with doing the show eight times a week .
i 'm still learning as an artist and i 'm writing at the moment .
we 're hoping for a second album , if that goes ahead it would be nice to write more songs , make it more of a full album of new material .
as a winner of a tv talent show and a west end performer are you worried whether fans and fellow musical artists are going to accept you ?
i know it 's within me and i just hope that it gets received well , and that i do get accepted .
lee mead is hoping to tour the uk with his new material if i do n't then it 's not meant to be , but i really want people to give me a chance to see what i can do .
the obvious choice for me would have been to release a big musical theatre album , but we decided not to do that .
i sat down with polydor and we had a big talk about what was the best direction for me to go in .
it 's not a cheesy album , it 's very well put together .
also it 's not too dark or off the wall which would n't be me really .
it 's still commercial and it 's very much me .
i 'm slightly anxious because i want it to do well and i 'm very proud of the album as well .
i just want people to like it really and enjoy it .
do you want to be a pop star ?
i 've always wanted to do my own music , being a leading man in the west end was a dream of mine , but i 'd be lying if i said i did n't want to make my own music in the future .
it would be nice to do a tour if things go well and the album does well .
you recorded the album during six day weeks and 18 hour days - how did you cope ?
it was crazy - eight shows a week , plus all the pr for the shows and the rehearsals .
mead beat 10,000 hopefuls in any dream will do i was recording from 10am , until 5pm , then going into the show at 6pm .
and when i got home i was practising songs .
i 've been very , very tired , but i think it will be worth it .
who do you aspire to be like ?
there 's no one i like to copy and i think it 's important that i am myself .
i 'm very much a live performer anyway , i think where i shine more is on the stage but i try not to copy other artists too much .
i 've got huge respect for lots of other artists and i love their music .
i like green day , keane and the stereophonics .
it 's down to me as an artist to find my own journey and my own style and sound .
that 's what i 'll be doing in this album and hopefully in future albums as well .
i 'm sure i 'll grow as an artist .
lee mead is released in the uk on 19 november .
his single , gonna makes you a star , is due out 3 december .
lee mead was talking to bbc news entertainment reporter fiona pryor .

the 26-year-old landed the star role in andrew lloyd webber 's musical , joseph and the amazing technicolor dreamcoat , in london 's west end .
he is now about to embark on a different career thread with the release of his self-titled debut album .
what sort of music is on the album ?
it has a very live band feel .
it 's nice to do an album that was more contemporary because i think it was expected i would do a musical theatre album .
it was nice to do a different genre as such , just to show what else i can do .
there 's about four or five covers , but they 're not your typical covers that you would expect , like gonna make you a star , by david essex .
take that 's gary barlow wrote a song for mead 's album it has a good vibe and we 've cut no corners .
there 's about five brand new songs as well and one of the songs was agreed by gary barlow .
he came and watched the show with his kids and enjoyed it .
he agreed to put a song on the album which is great for an artist like myself to have someone like him give me a song .
it 's called i need you the most and it 's a really nice ballad .
why did you decide to record several covers instead of putting out new music ?
i think it was the time-scale really , what with doing the show eight times a week .
i 'm still learning as an artist and i 'm writing at the moment .
we 're hoping for a second album , if that goes ahead it would be nice to write more songs , make it more of a full album of new material .
as a winner of a tv talent show and a west end performer are you worried whether fans and fellow musical artists are going to accept you ?
i know it 's within me and i just hope that it gets received well , and that i do get accepted .
lee mead is hoping to tour the uk with his new material if i do n't then it 's not meant to be , but i really want people to give me a chance to see what i can do .
the obvious choice for me would have been to release a big musical theatre album , but we decided not to do that .
i sat down with polydor and we had a big talk about what was the best direction for me to go in .
it 's not a cheesy album , it 's very well put together .
also it 's not too dark or off the wall which would n't be me really .
it 's still commercial and it 's very much me .
i 'm slightly anxious because i want it to do well and i 'm very proud of the album as well .
i just want people to like it really and enjoy it .
do you want to be a pop star ?
i 've always wanted to do my own music , being a leading man in the west end was a dream of mine , but i 'd be lying if i said i did n't want to make my own music in the future .
it would be nice to do a tour if things go well and the album does well .
you recorded the album during six day weeks and 18 hour days - how did you cope ?
it was crazy - eight shows a week , plus all the pr for the shows and the rehearsals .
mead beat 10,000 hopefuls in any dream will do i was recording from 10am , until 5pm , then going into the show at 6pm .
and when i got home i was practising songs .
i 've been very , very tired , but i think it will be worth it .
who do you aspire to be like ?
there 's no one i like to copy and i think it 's important that i am myself .
i 'm very much a live performer anyway , i think where i shine more is on the stage but i try not to copy other artists too much .
i 've got huge respect for lots of other artists and i love their music .
i like green day , keane and the stereophonics .
it 's down to me as an artist to find my own journey and my own style and sound .
that 's what i 'll be doing in this album and hopefully in future albums as well .
i 'm sure i 'll grow as an artist .
lee mead is released in the uk on 19 november .
his single , gonna makes you a star , is due out 3 december .

the co-op wants to build the eco-town near leicester but locals believe it would overwhelm existing services .
some fear it may get direct government planning approval under a national scheme and thus bypass local scrutiny .
but the co-op said it was holding a private briefing this week for concerned councillors and mps .

the co-op wants to build the eco-town near leicester but locals believe it would overwhelm existing services .
some fear it may get direct government planning approval under a national scheme and thus bypass local scrutiny .
but the co-op said it was holding a private briefing this week for concerned councillors and mps .
the government wants to build 10 carbon-neutral , self-contained soc-alled eco-towns around the country .
the co-op and english partnerships are bidding to create about 20,000 homes along with services on land between houghton on the hill , oadby and great glen .
harborough council leader graham hart said : " normally they come into the district council and our officers deal with it and we as local politicians are brought into the loop and the public are .
" this one is going to central government and coming down to us - it could be as a fait accompli . "

the 26-year-old landed the star role in andrew lloyd webber 's musical , joseph and the amazing technicolor dreamcoat , in london 's west end .
he is now about to embark on a different career thread with the release of his self-titled debut album .
what sort of music is on the album ?
it has a very live band feel .
it 's nice to do an album that was more contemporary because i think it was expected i would do a musical theatre album .
it was nice to do a different genre as such , just to show what else i can do .
there 's about four or five covers , but they 're not your typical covers that you would expect , like gonna make you a star , by david essex .
it has a good vibe and we 've cut no corners .
there 's about five brand new songs as well and one of the songs was agreed by gary barlow .
he came and watched the show with his kids and enjoyed it .
he agreed to put a song on the album which is great for an artist like myself to have someone like him give me a song .
it 's called i need you the most and it 's a really nice ballad .
why did you decide to record several covers instead of putting out new music ?
i think it was the time-scale really , what with doing the show eight times a week .
i 'm still learning as an artist and i 'm writing at the moment .
we 're hoping for a second album , if that goes ahead it would be nice to write more songs , make it more of a full album of new material .
as a winner of a tv talent show and a west end performer are you worried whether fans and fellow musical artists are going to accept you ?
i know it 's within me and i just hope that it gets received well , and that i do get accepted .
if i do n't then it 's not meant to be , but i really want people to give me a chance to see what i can do .
the obvious choice for me would have been to release a big musical theatre album , but we decided not to do that .
i sat down with polydor and we had a big talk about what was the best direction for me to go in .
it 's not a cheesy album , it 's very well put together .
also it 's not too dark or off the wall which would n't be me really .
it 's still commercial and it 's very much me .
i 'm slightly anxious because i want it to do well and i 'm very proud of the album as well .
i just want people to like it really and enjoy it .
do you want to be a pop star ?
i 've always wanted to do my own music , being a leading man in the west end was a dream of mine , but i 'd be lying if i said i did n't want to make my own music in the future .
it would be nice to do a tour if things go well and the album does well .
you recorded the album during six day weeks and 18 hour days - how did you cope ?
it was crazy - eight shows a week , plus all the pr for the shows and the rehearsals .
i was recording from 10am , until 5pm , then going into the show at 6pm .
and when i got home i was practising songs .
i 've been very , very tired , but i think it will be worth it .
who do you aspire to be like ?
there 's no one i like to copy and i think it 's important that i am myself .
i 'm very much a live performer anyway , i think where i shine more is on the stage but i try not to copy other artists too much .
i 've got huge respect for lots of other artists and i love their music .
i like green day , keane and the stereophonics .
it 's down to me as an artist to find my own journey and my own style and sound .
that 's what i 'll be doing in this album and hopefully in future albums as well .
i 'm sure i 'll grow as an artist .
lee mead is released in the uk on 19 november .
his single , gonna makes you a star , is due out 3 december .
lee mead was talking to bbc news entertainment reporter fiona pryor .

clinics in brighton and darlington also form part of the trial .
the injecting clinics , intended for hardened heroin addicts for whom conventional treatment has failed , have operated for about two years .
the scheme , which has so far cost £ 2.5m , is funded by both the home office and the department of health .
during the trial , a third of addicts are using heroin substitute methadone orally and a third will inject methadone under supervision .
the remaining third , observed by nurses , are injecting themselves with diamorphine - unadulterated heroin - imported from switzerland and provided by the clinic .
some 150 users will take part in the trial overall .
the reduction in crime is not perfect but is a great deal better for them and crucially a great deal better for society professor john strang national addiction centre behind scenes at clinic final results will not be known for another year but , in london , doctors and nursing staff say drug use has fallen significantly .
they also say the lives of those on the scheme have stabilised because they are not buying from street dealers and getting involved in crime .
trial leader professor john strang , of the national addiction centre , based at london 's institute of psychiatry , told bbc news that about 40 % of users had " quit their involvement with the street scene completely " .
" of those who have continued , which obviously is a disappointment , it goes down from every day to about four days per month , " he added .
" their crimes , for example , have gone from 40 a month to perhaps four crimes per month .
" the reduction in crime is not perfect but is a great deal better for them and crucially a great deal better for society . "
people on the trial also attend regular counselling sessions and regular appointments with their gp .
' better relationships ' bbc correspondent danny shaw said initial results suggested the experiment was having a profound effect on hardened heroin addicts .
many were leading much more stable lives and were enjoying better family relationships because they were no longer in and out of prison , our correspondent added .
he said that , although these were very early days , there had been a dramatic effect on the lives of people for whom heroin had been a daily part of their lives for 20 or 30 years .
the cost of the treatment , including providing heroin , is between £ 9,000 and £ 15,000 per patient - about three times as much as a year 's course of methadone .
last year , howard roberts , the deputy chief constable of nottinghamshire , said heroin should be prescribed to drug addicts to curb crime .
and earlier this year the number of people treated for heroin addiction in scotland reached record levels , with about 21,000 people said to be using heroin substitute methadone - 10 % more than previously thought .
similar heroin injection schemes in holland and switzerland have reported some users turning away from crime .

many were leading much more stable lives and were enjoying better family relationships because they were no longer in and out of prison , our correspondent added .
he said that , although these were very early days , there had been a dramatic effect on the lives of people for whom heroin had been a daily part of their lives for 20 or 30 years .
the cost of the treatment , including providing heroin , is between £ 9,000 and £ 15,000 per patient - about three times as much as a year 's course of methadone .
last year , howard roberts , the deputy chief constable of nottinghamshire , said heroin should be prescribed to drug addicts to curb crime .

clinics in brighton and darlington also form part of the trial .
the injecting clinics , intended for hardened heroin addicts for whom conventional treatment has failed , have operated for about two years .
the scheme , which has so far cost £ 2.5m , is funded by both the home office and the department of health .
during the trial , a third of addicts are using heroin substitute methadone orally and a third will inject methadone under supervision .
the remaining third , observed by nurses , are injecting themselves with diamorphine - unadulterated heroin - imported from switzerland and provided by the clinic .
some 150 users will take part in the trial overall .
the reduction in crime is not perfect but is a great deal better for them and crucially a great deal better for society professor john strang national addiction centre behind scenes at clinic final results will not be known for another year but , in london , doctors and nursing staff say drug use has fallen significantly .
they also say the lives of those on the scheme have stabilised because they are not buying from street dealers and getting involved in crime .
trial leader professor john strang , of the national addiction centre , based at london 's institute of psychiatry , told bbc news that about 40 % of users had " quit their involvement with the street scene completely " .
" of those who have continued , which obviously is a disappointment , it goes down from every day to about four days per month , " he added .
" their crimes , for example , have gone from 40 a month to perhaps four crimes per month .

clinics in brighton and darlington also form part of the trial .
the injecting clinics , intended for hardened heroin addicts for whom conventional treatment has failed , have operated for about two years .
the scheme , which has so far cost £ 2.5m , is funded by both the home office and the department of health .
during the trial , a third of addicts are using heroin substitute methadone orally and a third will inject methadone under supervision .
the remaining third , observed by nurses , are injecting themselves with diamorphine - unadulterated heroin - imported from switzerland and provided by the clinic .
some 150 users will take part in the trial overall .
the reduction in crime is not perfect but is a great deal better for them and crucially a great deal better for society professor john strang national addiction centre behind scenes at clinic final results will not be known for another year but , in london , doctors and nursing staff say drug use has fallen significantly .
they also say the lives of those on the scheme have stabilised because they are not buying from street dealers and getting involved in crime .
trial leader professor john strang , of the national addiction centre , based at london 's institute of psychiatry , told bbc news that about 40 % of users had " quit their involvement with the street scene completely " .
" of those who have continued , which obviously is a disappointment , it goes down from every day to about four days per month , " he added .
" their crimes , for example , have gone from 40 a month to perhaps four crimes per month .
" the reduction in crime is not perfect but is a great deal better for them and crucially a great deal better for society . "
people on the trial also attend regular counselling sessions and regular appointments with their gp .
' better relationships ' bbc correspondent danny shaw said initial results suggested the experiment was having a profound effect on hardened heroin addicts .
many were leading much more stable lives and were enjoying better family relationships because they were no longer in and out of prison , our correspondent added .
he said that , although these were very early days , there had been a dramatic effect on the lives of people for whom heroin had been a daily part of their lives for 20 or 30 years .
the cost of the treatment , including providing heroin , is between £ 9,000 and £ 15,000 per patient - about three times as much as a year 's course of methadone .
last year , howard roberts , the deputy chief constable of nottinghamshire , said heroin should be prescribed to drug addicts to curb crime .
and earlier this year the number of people treated for heroin addiction in scotland reached record levels , with about 21,000 people said to be using heroin substitute methadone - 10 % more than previously thought .
similar heroin injection schemes in holland and switzerland have reported some users turning away from crime .
