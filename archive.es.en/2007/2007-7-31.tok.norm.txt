analysts are happy now , but worried for the future .
despite a slight rise in the ranks of unemployed in july , by 28,000 to 3.7 million , germany 's job market has shown significant improvements in an inter-eu comparison . the number of unemployed people in germany rose slightly in july from the month earlier , by 28,000 jobless , to 3.7 million , according to the federal employment agency in nuremberg .
the 0.1 percent rise in unemployment - to 8.9 percent of the work force from 8.8 percent - was smaller than in the previous year , showing the strength of the german economy , analysts said .
positive indicators the seasonally adjusted jobless figures , considered a more important indication of the state of the economy , were actually down 45,000 from june .
seasonal adjustment takes into account the number of school-leavers and job-trainees taking an expected break for the summer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : employment agency 's wiese is delighted with ' positive changes ' the head of the employment agency , frank-jürgen weise , was content .
" the three most important indicators - unemployment , jobs subject to social security and vacant jobs - have all shown positive changes , " he said .
unemployment in germany tipped over the five-million mark in 2006 but dropped below four million this year .
but analysts warned however that despite another set of impressive figures , the german labour market appeared to be running out of steam .
losing momentum ?
sylvain broyer of ixis-cib said he believed the unemployment rate would bottom out next year to about 8.4 percent .
" the german labour market is losing momentum : vacancies now stagnate more or less after having rocketed up to 80 percent year on year in the past years , and regular employment , i.e. employment subject to social security , barely rises above two percent year on year . "
according to european statistics agency eurostat , their calculation of german unemployment figures for june , at 6.4 percent , were 0.5 percent below the eu average of 6.9 percent .
this was a solid improvement from a year earlier , when german unemployment was at 8.3 percent , and well above the then-eu average of 7.9 percent .
eu improves overall germany , known as the economic motor of the eu , was not the only country to see improvement .
eurostat said 22 of the 27 member states managed to reduce unemployment for the year .
the largest drops were in poland -lrb- down to 10.2 percent from 13.9 percent , -rrb- and sweden -lrb- down to 5.3 percent , from 7.2 percent . -rrb-

the group was most active in 1977 , when it was responsible for a spate of murders including german federal prosecutor siegfried buback and jürgen ponto , chief executive of dresdner bank ag . baader criticizes prison conditions the recordings include ensslin stating that the raf was responsible for attacks on the cia headquarters as well as the fifth us division in frankfurt , and the us headquarters in heidelberg . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the defendants were sentenced to life in prison " what embodies the policies of the raf is the obligation to resistance in the federal republic of germany , " ensslin said in the recording .
a responsibility towards imperialistic policies could only be met with resistance , she said . baader talked about suffering under solitary confinement .
he criticized that the prisoners were not allowed to walk in the prison yard during the three days of trial per week , although this had been promised .
baader said the accused were forced to spend several hours per day in soundproof and windowless solitary cells . the tapes also include meinhof 's last testimony prior to her suicide in may 1976 . " it is , of course , a police tactic in counter-insurgency conflicts , in guerilla warfare , to take out the leaders , " meinhof , a journalist-turned-terrorist says on the tape . film to air in september the group unleashed a wave of terror across the country in the 1970s and 1980s , which climaxed in the so-called " german autumn " of 1977 .
it ended with the suicides of the raf 's core leadership and the brutal kidnapping and murder of the president of the german employers ' association , hanns martin schleyer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baader and his girlfriend ensslin had already been convicted of a bombing in 1968 according to gemran state network ndr , which is co-producing the documentary film , the authors came across parts of the tapes in secondary rooms at the higher regional court in stuttgart during their research . lengthy negotiations between the authors stefan aust und helmar büchel and the court , as well as the federal prosecutor in karlsruhe followed .
the prosecutor initially wanted the documents destroyed .
but copies of the tapes were then handed over to the journalists via the public records office in ludwigsburg . the raf film by aust and büchel will air on german public television in september . article based on news reports -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the berlin government says it is doing its utmost to free the german engineer being held hostage in afghanistan .

currently , the isaf mission there enjoys broad support , but two other engagements seem likely to face resistance . german politicians said they would first decide whether to send more troops to afghanistan after discussing the matter with the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- there and nato partners , and once the army has determined whether or not it has the capacity to expand .
senior politicians from germany 's two main parties have come out solidly behind the training and reconstruction role played by the 3,000 german isaf troops in northern afghanistan , ahead of a parliamentary decision on renewing their mandate this autumn .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cdu 's kauder says he is prepared to boost troops but support for two other german missions to afghanistan - elite troops are deployed to the us-led operation enduring freedom -lrb- oef -rrb- and reconnaissance aircraft are assisting combat operations in the south - is wavering .
volker kauder , who heads the parliamentary caucus backing christian democratic chancellor angela merkel , says he is prepared to consider sending more troops to buttress the isaf mission led by nato .
pullout is unlikely " if the government considers it necessary to augment the german contingent , then that is right in my view , " said kauder .
" the -lsb- social democrats -rsb- will certainly hold intense discussions .
but i do n't expect much opposition , " kauder said .
and as long as the taliban has n't been conquered , there is no question of a pullout , he said .
" that would lead to a dramatic increase in the danger of terrorism in europe , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spd leader beck has taken a keen interest in afghanistan he was speaking after kurt beck , chairman of the social democrats , who recently paid a visit to afghanistan and has taken a keen interest in afghan affairs , said he backed sending more troops .
the aim was to stabilize the afghan government by creating effective security , beck said .
" and then we have to discuss the question whether we should dispatch more troops and police officers . "
before she left last week on her summer vacation , chancellor merkel made her commitment clear .
" germany 's engagement in afghanistan must continue .
we need all three components to be extended , " the chancellor said .
growing concern over missions backing his chief , kauder advocated rolling the three missions into one and pushing through a decision on all three simultaneously in the bundestag .
but the social democrats are not keen on this idea .
party defense spokesman rainer arnold says there is growing concern about oef which mounts counter-terrorism operations against the taliban in the south and east of afghanistan .
the mandate for the deployment - about which little is made public - should be allowed to lapse when it comes up for renewal in mid-november , he said .
mandates for the tornado reconnaisance deployment and the isaf reconstruction mission come up for renewal in the bundestag a month earlier , in mid-october .
there is a widespread belief in germany that isaf 's mainly reconstruction role is being confused in afghan minds with oef 's combat operations , which have come under severe criticism for the number of civilian casualties caused .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : has using tornado jets in afghanistan made germany a target ?
and there is deep concern that the deployment of six tornado aircraft in april to help detect taliban positions is turning germany into a target for terrorists .
opponents to increasingly speak out meanwhile , the german federal armed forces association , a group that represents the interests of german servicemen and -women , was skeptical of the idea of enhancing the afghanistan troops .
the association 's acting chairman , wolfgang schmelzer , told the mittelbayrischen zeitung newspaper that he was opposed to general troop increases .
" but i do think it makes a lot of sense for the bundeswehr -lsb- german armed forces -rsb- to send more german trainers for the afghan army to the hindukush , " he said .
he also advised against a troop pullout , despite the number of german soldier casualties and the fact that two german engineers were kidnapped on july 18 .
germany should only pull out after the afghan army is turned into a viable fighting force and if the police and legal systems function , he said .
on monday , nato chief jaap de hoop scheffer acknowledged concern over civilian casualties in afghanistan , in an interview with london 's financial times .
he said nato was considering using smaller bombs .

the government , which has come under fire for the way it handles abductions , is reported to be considering taking a tougher line .

currently , the isaf mission there enjoys broad support , but two other engagements seem likely to face resistance . german politicians said they would first decide whether to send more troops to afghanistan after discussing the matter with the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- there and nato partners , and once the army has determined whether or not it has the capacity to expand .
senior politicians from germany 's two main parties have come out solidly behind the training and reconstruction role played by the 3,000 german isaf troops in northern afghanistan , ahead of a parliamentary decision on renewing their mandate this autumn .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cdu 's kauder says he is prepared to boost troops but support for two other german missions to afghanistan - elite troops are deployed to the us-led operation enduring freedom -lrb- oef -rrb- and reconnaissance aircraft are assisting combat operations in the south - is wavering .
volker kauder , who heads the parliamentary caucus backing christian democratic chancellor angela merkel , says he is prepared to consider sending more troops to buttress the isaf mission led by nato .
pullout is unlikely " if the government considers it necessary to augment the german contingent , then that is right in my view , " said kauder .
" the -lsb- social democrats -rsb- will certainly hold intense discussions .
but i do n't expect much opposition , " kauder said .
and as long as the taliban has n't been conquered , there is no question of a pullout , he said .
" that would lead to a dramatic increase in the danger of terrorism in europe , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spd leader beck has taken a keen interest in afghanistan he was speaking after kurt beck , chairman of the social democrats , who recently paid a visit to afghanistan and has taken a keen interest in afghan affairs , said he backed sending more troops .
the aim was to stabilize the afghan government by creating effective security , beck said .
" and then we have to discuss the question whether we should dispatch more troops and police officers . "
before she left last week on her summer vacation , chancellor merkel made her commitment clear .
" germany 's engagement in afghanistan must continue .
we need all three components to be extended , " the chancellor said .
growing concern over missions backing his chief , kauder advocated rolling the three missions into one and pushing through a decision on all three simultaneously in the bundestag .
but the social democrats are not keen on this idea .
party defense spokesman rainer arnold says there is growing concern about oef which mounts counter-terrorism operations against the taliban in the south and east of afghanistan .
the mandate for the deployment - about which little is made public - should be allowed to lapse when it comes up for renewal in mid-november , he said .
mandates for the tornado reconnaisance deployment and the isaf reconstruction mission come up for renewal in the bundestag a month earlier , in mid-october .
there is a widespread belief in germany that isaf 's mainly reconstruction role is being confused in afghan minds with oef 's combat operations , which have come under severe criticism for the number of civilian casualties caused .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : has using tornado jets in afghanistan made germany a target ?
and there is deep concern that the deployment of six tornado aircraft in april to help detect taliban positions is turning germany into a target for terrorists .
opponents to increasingly speak out meanwhile , the german federal armed forces association , a group that represents the interests of german servicemen and -women , was skeptical of the idea of enhancing the afghanistan troops .
the association 's acting chairman , wolfgang schmelzer , told the mittelbayrischen zeitung newspaper that he was opposed to general troop increases .
" but i do think it makes a lot of sense for the bundeswehr -lsb- german armed forces -rsb- to send more german trainers for the afghan army to the hindukush , " he said .
he also advised against a troop pullout , despite the number of german soldier casualties and the fact that two german engineers were kidnapped on july 18 .
germany should only pull out after the afghan army is turned into a viable fighting force and if the police and legal systems function , he said .
on monday , nato chief jaap de hoop scheffer acknowledged concern over civilian casualties in afghanistan , in an interview with london 's financial times .
he said nato was considering using smaller bombs .
the kidnapping problem the july abduction of two german engineers in afghanistan , along with the murder of one of them , has highlighted concerns about terrorism .
the government , which has come under fire for the way it handles abductions , is reported to be considering taking a tougher line .

currently , the isaf mission there enjoys broad support , but two other engagements seem likely to face resistance . german politicians said they would first decide whether to send more troops to afghanistan after discussing the matter with the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- there and nato partners , and once the army has determined whether or not it has the capacity to expand .
senior politicians from germany 's two main parties have come out solidly behind the training and reconstruction role played by the 3,000 german isaf troops in northern afghanistan , ahead of a parliamentary decision on renewing their mandate this autumn .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cdu 's kauder says he is prepared to boost troops but support for two other german missions to afghanistan - elite troops are deployed to the us-led operation enduring freedom -lrb- oef -rrb- and reconnaissance aircraft are assisting combat operations in the south - is wavering .
volker kauder , who heads the parliamentary caucus backing christian democratic chancellor angela merkel , says he is prepared to consider sending more troops to buttress the isaf mission led by nato .
pullout is unlikely " if the government considers it necessary to augment the german contingent , then that is right in my view , " said kauder .
" the -lsb- social democrats -rsb- will certainly hold intense discussions .
but i do n't expect much opposition , " kauder said .
and as long as the taliban has n't been conquered , there is no question of a pullout , he said .
" that would lead to a dramatic increase in the danger of terrorism in europe , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spd leader beck has taken a keen interest in afghanistan he was speaking after kurt beck , chairman of the social democrats , who recently paid a visit to afghanistan and has taken a keen interest in afghan affairs , said he backed sending more troops .
the aim was to stabilize the afghan government by creating effective security , beck said .
" and then we have to discuss the question whether we should dispatch more troops and police officers . "
before she left last week on her summer vacation , chancellor merkel made her commitment clear .
" germany 's engagement in afghanistan must continue .
we need all three components to be extended , " the chancellor said .
growing concern over missions backing his chief , kauder advocated rolling the three missions into one and pushing through a decision on all three simultaneously in the bundestag .
but the social democrats are not keen on this idea .
party defense spokesman rainer arnold says there is growing concern about oef which mounts counter-terrorism operations against the taliban in the south and east of afghanistan .
the mandate for the deployment - about which little is made public - should be allowed to lapse when it comes up for renewal in mid-november , he said .
mandates for the tornado reconnaisance deployment and the isaf reconstruction mission come up for renewal in the bundestag a month earlier , in mid-october .
there is a widespread belief in germany that isaf 's mainly reconstruction role is being confused in afghan minds with oef 's combat operations , which have come under severe criticism for the number of civilian casualties caused .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : has using tornado jets in afghanistan made germany a target ?
and there is deep concern that the deployment of six tornado aircraft in april to help detect taliban positions is turning germany into a target for terrorists .
opponents to increasingly speak out meanwhile , the german federal armed forces association , a group that represents the interests of german servicemen and -women , was skeptical of the idea of enhancing the afghanistan troops .
the association 's acting chairman , wolfgang schmelzer , told the mittelbayrischen zeitung newspaper that he was opposed to general troop increases .
" but i do think it makes a lot of sense for the bundeswehr -lsb- german armed forces -rsb- to send more german trainers for the afghan army to the hindukush , " he said .
he also advised against a troop pullout , despite the number of german soldier casualties and the fact that two german engineers were kidnapped on july 18 .
germany should only pull out after the afghan army is turned into a viable fighting force and if the police and legal systems function , he said .
on monday , nato chief jaap de hoop scheffer acknowledged concern over civilian casualties in afghanistan , in an interview with london 's financial times .
he said nato was considering using smaller bombs .
the kidnapping problem the july abduction of two german engineers in afghanistan , along with the murder of one of them , has highlighted concerns about terrorism .
the government , which has come under fire for the way it handles abductions , is reported to be considering taking a tougher line .
but it is no secret that germany has paid large sums to criminal groups in previous cases , particularly in iraq , to secure the release of its citizens , as have other european countries . article based on news reports -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in an interview tuesday with news agency reuters , voigt said he was skeptical the deal would serve to rein in iran 's power .
supplying more weapons to the region will not bring peace there , he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karsten voigt minced no words in his criticism of us plans " the region is not suffering from a lack of arms but from a lack of stability , " voigt said .
" i have strong doubts whether stability could be achieved with these weapons . "
bolstering democracy with weapons ?
an official for the us defense department said over the weekend that washington planned to give some $ 20 billion in military assistance to saudi arabia and other states in the persian gulf region to modernize their armed forces and limit iran 's influence .
the aid to saudi arabia is meant to upgrade its missile defenses and boost its navy . israel would receive $ 30.4 billion in military aid over the next decade - a significant increase to what the country received before .
us officials say the aid is meant to send a signal to its gulf allies that washington is committed to the region and will stand by them amid concerns about the war in iraq and iran 's growing clout .
voigt however said the plans ran contrary to the us desire to nurture and bolster democracy in the region .
" the us said a couple of months ago the main problem in the region was the lack of democracy , " he said .
" i do not know how one can support democracy by supplying weapons for saudi arabia , which is anything but a very democratic country . "

she stressed that washington was fighting extremism along with its allies in the gulf region .

germany critical of deal but news of the arms deal has sparked strong criticism in germany with several leading politicians echoing voigt 's doubts .
ruprecht polenz , the head of parliament 's foreign affairs committee and member of chancellor angela merkel 's conservative party , said the move threatened to destabilize what is already a volatile region .
" if you add more explosive things to a powder keg - and that 's what the middle east is - you heighten the risk and do n't make the region safer in the end , " polenz told frankfurter rundschau newspaper on monday .
the proposed military aid still has to be approved by the us congress .

in an interview tuesday with news agency reuters , voigt said he was skeptical the deal would serve to rein in iran 's power .
supplying more weapons to the region will not bring peace there , he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karsten voigt minced no words in his criticism of us plans " the region is not suffering from a lack of arms but from a lack of stability , " voigt said .
" i have strong doubts whether stability could be achieved with these weapons . "
bolstering democracy with weapons ?
an official for the us defense department said over the weekend that washington planned to give some $ 20 billion in military assistance to saudi arabia and other states in the persian gulf region to modernize their armed forces and limit iran 's influence .
the aid to saudi arabia is meant to upgrade its missile defenses and boost its navy . israel would receive $ 30.4 billion in military aid over the next decade - a significant increase to what the country received before .
us officials say the aid is meant to send a signal to its gulf allies that washington is committed to the region and will stand by them amid concerns about the war in iraq and iran 's growing clout .
voigt however said the plans ran contrary to the us desire to nurture and bolster democracy in the region .
" the us said a couple of months ago the main problem in the region was the lack of democracy , " he said .
" i do not know how one can support democracy by supplying weapons for saudi arabia , which is anything but a very democratic country . "
rice defends controversial plan on tuesday , us secretary of state condoleeza rice defended the plan , saying the us wanted to guarantee the security of their long-time allies in the middle east .
rice , who is on a tour of the middle east along with defense secretary robert gates , said in egypt the aid was not aimed at shifting the military balance in the region or kicking off a new arms race .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice defended the plans in egypt as she tours the middle east " we are determined to maintain the balances - the military and strategic balances - within the region that we have been committed to as well , " she said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de afghanistan -pipe- 31.07.2007 germany debates boost in afghanistan troops großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers on isaf missions use helicopters as transport germany is debating whether to send more soldiers to afghanistan .
currently , the isaf mission there enjoys broad support , but two other engagements seem likely to face resistance . german politicians said they would first decide whether to send more troops to afghanistan after discussing the matter with the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- there and nato partners , and once the army has determined whether or not it has the capacity to expand .
senior politicians from germany 's two main parties have come out solidly behind the training and reconstruction role played by the 3,000 german isaf troops in northern afghanistan , ahead of a parliamentary decision on renewing their mandate this autumn .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cdu 's kauder says he is prepared to boost troops but support for two other german missions to afghanistan - elite troops are deployed to the us-led operation enduring freedom -lrb- oef -rrb- and reconnaissance aircraft are assisting combat operations in the south - is wavering .
volker kauder , who heads the parliamentary caucus backing christian democratic chancellor angela merkel , says he is prepared to consider sending more troops to buttress the isaf mission led by nato .
pullout is unlikely " if the government considers it necessary to augment the german contingent , then that is right in my view , " said kauder .
" the -lsb- social democrats -rsb- will certainly hold intense discussions .
but i do n't expect much opposition , " kauder said .
and as long as the taliban has n't been conquered , there is no question of a pullout , he said .
" that would lead to a dramatic increase in the danger of terrorism in europe , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spd leader beck has taken a keen interest in afghanistan he was speaking after kurt beck , chairman of the social democrats , who recently paid a visit to afghanistan and has taken a keen interest in afghan affairs , said he backed sending more troops .
the aim was to stabilize the afghan government by creating effective security , beck said .
" and then we have to discuss the question whether we should dispatch more troops and police officers . "
before she left last week on her summer vacation , chancellor merkel made her commitment clear .
" germany 's engagement in afghanistan must continue .
we need all three components to be extended , " the chancellor said .
growing concern over missions backing his chief , kauder advocated rolling the three missions into one and pushing through a decision on all three simultaneously in the bundestag .
but the social democrats are not keen on this idea .
party defense spokesman rainer arnold says there is growing concern about oef which mounts counter-terrorism operations against the taliban in the south and east of afghanistan .
the mandate for the deployment - about which little is made public - should be allowed to lapse when it comes up for renewal in mid-november , he said .
mandates for the tornado reconnaisance deployment and the isaf reconstruction mission come up for renewal in the bundestag a month earlier , in mid-october .
there is a widespread belief in germany that isaf 's mainly reconstruction role is being confused in afghan minds with oef 's combat operations , which have come under severe criticism for the number of civilian casualties caused .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : has using tornado jets in afghanistan made germany a target ?
and there is deep concern that the deployment of six tornado aircraft in april to help detect taliban positions is turning germany into a target for terrorists .
opponents to increasingly speak out meanwhile , the german federal armed forces association , a group that represents the interests of german servicemen and -women , was skeptical of the idea of enhancing the afghanistan troops .
the association 's acting chairman , wolfgang schmelzer , told the mittelbayrischen zeitung newspaper that he was opposed to general troop increases .
" but i do think it makes a lot of sense for the bundeswehr -lsb- german armed forces -rsb- to send more german trainers for the afghan army to the hindukush , " he said .
he also advised against a troop pullout , despite the number of german soldier casualties and the fact that two german engineers were kidnapped on july 18 .
germany should only pull out after the afghan army is turned into a viable fighting force and if the police and legal systems function , he said .
on monday , nato chief jaap de hoop scheffer acknowledged concern over civilian casualties in afghanistan , in an interview with london 's financial times .
he said nato was considering using smaller bombs .
the kidnapping problem the july abduction of two german engineers in afghanistan , along with the murder of one of them , has highlighted concerns about terrorism .
the government , which has come under fire for the way it handles abductions , is reported to be considering taking a tougher line .
but it is no secret that germany has paid large sums to criminal groups in previous cases , particularly in iraq , to secure the release of its citizens , as have other european countries . article based on news reports -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the berlin government says it is doing its utmost to free the german engineer being held hostage in afghanistan .
but it continues to stress that it will not allow itself to be blackmailed into paying ransom money . a growing debate has arisen in germany on how the country should deal with freeing kidnapped nationals .
the interior affairs expert for the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- dieter wiefelspütz said there should n't be a sole strategy for handling kidnappings . " the government is well-advised to make such decisions based on each individual case , " wiefelspütz told the german daily frankfurter rundschau in its tuesday edition .
he said germany had so far dealt with kidnappings satisfactorily . " i do n't see that there has been any careless action taken here , " wiefelspütz said .

the berlin government says it is doing its utmost to free the german engineer being held hostage in afghanistan .
but it continues to stress that it will not allow itself to be blackmailed into paying ransom money . a growing debate has arisen in germany on how the country should deal with freeing kidnapped nationals .
the interior affairs expert for the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- dieter wiefelspütz said there should n't be a sole strategy for handling kidnappings . " the government is well-advised to make such decisions based on each individual case , " wiefelspütz told the german daily frankfurter rundschau in its tuesday edition .
he said germany had so far dealt with kidnappings satisfactorily . " i do n't see that there has been any careless action taken here , " wiefelspütz said .
monday night afghan police found the body of a second south korean who had been killed by the taliban in ghasni province .
the fundamentalist islamists kidnapped 23 south koreans on july 19 and have said they would only set the group free if eight of their fighters were released from afghan jails .
they had said monday they would kill one of the hostages in response to failed negotiations with the afghan government . a german engineer has been in the hands of kidnappers in afghanistan for over one-and-a-half weeks .
a second hostage died during captivity .
his body is currently being examined ; results of the autopsy are expected at the end of the week .
in addition , a german national has been in the hands of captors in iraq since feb .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de afghanistan -pipe- 31.07.2007 germany debates boost in afghanistan troops großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers on isaf missions use helicopters as transport germany is debating whether to send more soldiers to afghanistan .
currently , the isaf mission there enjoys broad support , but two other engagements seem likely to face resistance . german politicians said they would first decide whether to send more troops to afghanistan after discussing the matter with the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- there and nato partners , and once the army has determined whether or not it has the capacity to expand .
senior politicians from germany 's two main parties have come out solidly behind the training and reconstruction role played by the 3,000 german isaf troops in northern afghanistan , ahead of a parliamentary decision on renewing their mandate this autumn .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cdu 's kauder says he is prepared to boost troops but support for two other german missions to afghanistan - elite troops are deployed to the us-led operation enduring freedom -lrb- oef -rrb- and reconnaissance aircraft are assisting combat operations in the south - is wavering .
volker kauder , who heads the parliamentary caucus backing christian democratic chancellor angela merkel , says he is prepared to consider sending more troops to buttress the isaf mission led by nato .
pullout is unlikely " if the government considers it necessary to augment the german contingent , then that is right in my view , " said kauder .
" the -lsb- social democrats -rsb- will certainly hold intense discussions .
but i do n't expect much opposition , " kauder said .
and as long as the taliban has n't been conquered , there is no question of a pullout , he said .
" that would lead to a dramatic increase in the danger of terrorism in europe , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spd leader beck has taken a keen interest in afghanistan he was speaking after kurt beck , chairman of the social democrats , who recently paid a visit to afghanistan and has taken a keen interest in afghan affairs , said he backed sending more troops .
the aim was to stabilize the afghan government by creating effective security , beck said .
" and then we have to discuss the question whether we should dispatch more troops and police officers . "
before she left last week on her summer vacation , chancellor merkel made her commitment clear .
" germany 's engagement in afghanistan must continue .
we need all three components to be extended , " the chancellor said .
growing concern over missions backing his chief , kauder advocated rolling the three missions into one and pushing through a decision on all three simultaneously in the bundestag .
but the social democrats are not keen on this idea .
party defense spokesman rainer arnold says there is growing concern about oef which mounts counter-terrorism operations against the taliban in the south and east of afghanistan .
the mandate for the deployment - about which little is made public - should be allowed to lapse when it comes up for renewal in mid-november , he said .
mandates for the tornado reconnaisance deployment and the isaf reconstruction mission come up for renewal in the bundestag a month earlier , in mid-october .
there is a widespread belief in germany that isaf 's mainly reconstruction role is being confused in afghan minds with oef 's combat operations , which have come under severe criticism for the number of civilian casualties caused .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : has using tornado jets in afghanistan made germany a target ?
and there is deep concern that the deployment of six tornado aircraft in april to help detect taliban positions is turning germany into a target for terrorists .
opponents to increasingly speak out meanwhile , the german federal armed forces association , a group that represents the interests of german servicemen and -women , was skeptical of the idea of enhancing the afghanistan troops .
the association 's acting chairman , wolfgang schmelzer , told the mittelbayrischen zeitung newspaper that he was opposed to general troop increases .
" but i do think it makes a lot of sense for the bundeswehr -lsb- german armed forces -rsb- to send more german trainers for the afghan army to the hindukush , " he said .
he also advised against a troop pullout , despite the number of german soldier casualties and the fact that two german engineers were kidnapped on july 18 .
germany should only pull out after the afghan army is turned into a viable fighting force and if the police and legal systems function , he said .
on monday , nato chief jaap de hoop scheffer acknowledged concern over civilian casualties in afghanistan , in an interview with london 's financial times .
he said nato was considering using smaller bombs .
the kidnapping problem the july abduction of two german engineers in afghanistan , along with the murder of one of them , has highlighted concerns about terrorism .
the government , which has come under fire for the way it handles abductions , is reported to be considering taking a tougher line .

currently , the isaf mission there enjoys broad support , but two other engagements seem likely to face resistance . german politicians said they would first decide whether to send more troops to afghanistan after discussing the matter with the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- there and nato partners , and once the army has determined whether or not it has the capacity to expand .
senior politicians from germany 's two main parties have come out solidly behind the training and reconstruction role played by the 3,000 german isaf troops in northern afghanistan , ahead of a parliamentary decision on renewing their mandate this autumn .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cdu 's kauder says he is prepared to boost troops but support for two other german missions to afghanistan - elite troops are deployed to the us-led operation enduring freedom -lrb- oef -rrb- and reconnaissance aircraft are assisting combat operations in the south - is wavering .
volker kauder , who heads the parliamentary caucus backing christian democratic chancellor angela merkel , says he is prepared to consider sending more troops to buttress the isaf mission led by nato .
pullout is unlikely " if the government considers it necessary to augment the german contingent , then that is right in my view , " said kauder .
" the -lsb- social democrats -rsb- will certainly hold intense discussions .
but i do n't expect much opposition , " kauder said .
and as long as the taliban has n't been conquered , there is no question of a pullout , he said .

the aim was to stabilize the afghan government by creating effective security , beck said .
" and then we have to discuss the question whether we should dispatch more troops and police officers . "
before she left last week on her summer vacation , chancellor merkel made her commitment clear .
" germany 's engagement in afghanistan must continue .
we need all three components to be extended , " the chancellor said .
growing concern over missions backing his chief , kauder advocated rolling the three missions into one and pushing through a decision on all three simultaneously in the bundestag .

party defense spokesman rainer arnold says there is growing concern about oef which mounts counter-terrorism operations against the taliban in the south and east of afghanistan .
the mandate for the deployment - about which little is made public - should be allowed to lapse when it comes up for renewal in mid-november , he said .
mandates for the tornado reconnaisance deployment and the isaf reconstruction mission come up for renewal in the bundestag a month earlier , in mid-october .
there is a widespread belief in germany that isaf 's mainly reconstruction role is being confused in afghan minds with oef 's combat operations , which have come under severe criticism for the number of civilian casualties caused .

the berlin government says it is doing its utmost to free the german engineer being held hostage in afghanistan .
but it continues to stress that it will not allow itself to be blackmailed into paying ransom money . a growing debate has arisen in germany on how the country should deal with freeing kidnapped nationals .
the interior affairs expert for the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- dieter wiefelspütz said there should n't be a sole strategy for handling kidnappings . " the government is well-advised to make such decisions based on each individual case , " wiefelspütz told the german daily frankfurter rundschau in its tuesday edition .
he said germany had so far dealt with kidnappings satisfactorily . " i do n't see that there has been any careless action taken here , " wiefelspütz said .
monday night afghan police found the body of a second south korean who had been killed by the taliban in ghasni province .
the fundamentalist islamists kidnapped 23 south koreans on july 19 and have said they would only set the group free if eight of their fighters were released from afghan jails .
they had said monday they would kill one of the hostages in response to failed negotiations with the afghan government . a german engineer has been in the hands of kidnappers in afghanistan for over one-and-a-half weeks .
a second hostage died during captivity .
his body is currently being examined ; results of the autopsy are expected at the end of the week .
in addition , a german national has been in the hands of captors in iraq since feb .
6 . germany does n't want to become a pawn the government does n't officially confirm paying ransom for kidnapped nationals .
yet negotiations behind the scenes and ransom payments are alleged to take place . the foreign affairs spokesman for the spd parliamentary group , gert weisskirchen , said that all possibilities had to be exhausted in order to save human lives .
but germany could not be blackmailed and he was not in favor of ransom payments , he said . " if this barrier were broken , we would become a pawn for anyone anywhere in the world who comes up with the idea to kidnap german nationals and already the money flows , " weisskirchen told german radio rbb .
" this ca n't be the response of the federal government . " the daily süddeutsche zeitung quoted a high-ranking government security expert on whether germany should take a tougher line against kidnappers in view of the series of kidnappings of germans in the middle east and afghanistan .
" we have to consider whether we can take the responsibility for paying ransom for a hostage - money which is then used to buy weapons to kill our soldiers in afghanistan , " the expert told the paper . " germany can not be blackmailed . " the german government , meanwhile , has said it will continue its tough stance . " our position is unchanged : germany can not be blackmailed , " deputy spokesman thomas steg said in berlin on monday .
at the same time , the government was doing " everything humanly possible and everything justifiable " to protect the lives of the victims . yet the protection of national interests also had to be taken into consideration , he said . article based on news reports -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

currently , the isaf mission there enjoys broad support , but two other engagements seem likely to face resistance . german politicians said they would first decide whether to send more troops to afghanistan after discussing the matter with the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- there and nato partners , and once the army has determined whether or not it has the capacity to expand .
senior politicians from germany 's two main parties have come out solidly behind the training and reconstruction role played by the 3,000 german isaf troops in northern afghanistan , ahead of a parliamentary decision on renewing their mandate this autumn .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cdu 's kauder says he is prepared to boost troops but support for two other german missions to afghanistan - elite troops are deployed to the us-led operation enduring freedom -lrb- oef -rrb- and reconnaissance aircraft are assisting combat operations in the south - is wavering .
volker kauder , who heads the parliamentary caucus backing christian democratic chancellor angela merkel , says he is prepared to consider sending more troops to buttress the isaf mission led by nato .
pullout is unlikely " if the government considers it necessary to augment the german contingent , then that is right in my view , " said kauder .
" the -lsb- social democrats -rsb- will certainly hold intense discussions .
but i do n't expect much opposition , " kauder said .
and as long as the taliban has n't been conquered , there is no question of a pullout , he said .
" that would lead to a dramatic increase in the danger of terrorism in europe , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spd leader beck has taken a keen interest in afghanistan he was speaking after kurt beck , chairman of the social democrats , who recently paid a visit to afghanistan and has taken a keen interest in afghan affairs , said he backed sending more troops .
the aim was to stabilize the afghan government by creating effective security , beck said .
" and then we have to discuss the question whether we should dispatch more troops and police officers . "
before she left last week on her summer vacation , chancellor merkel made her commitment clear .
" germany 's engagement in afghanistan must continue .
we need all three components to be extended , " the chancellor said .
growing concern over missions backing his chief , kauder advocated rolling the three missions into one and pushing through a decision on all three simultaneously in the bundestag .
but the social democrats are not keen on this idea .
party defense spokesman rainer arnold says there is growing concern about oef which mounts counter-terrorism operations against the taliban in the south and east of afghanistan .
the mandate for the deployment - about which little is made public - should be allowed to lapse when it comes up for renewal in mid-november , he said .
mandates for the tornado reconnaisance deployment and the isaf reconstruction mission come up for renewal in the bundestag a month earlier , in mid-october .
there is a widespread belief in germany that isaf 's mainly reconstruction role is being confused in afghan minds with oef 's combat operations , which have come under severe criticism for the number of civilian casualties caused .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : has using tornado jets in afghanistan made germany a target ?
and there is deep concern that the deployment of six tornado aircraft in april to help detect taliban positions is turning germany into a target for terrorists .
opponents to increasingly speak out meanwhile , the german federal armed forces association , a group that represents the interests of german servicemen and -women , was skeptical of the idea of enhancing the afghanistan troops .
the association 's acting chairman , wolfgang schmelzer , told the mittelbayrischen zeitung newspaper that he was opposed to general troop increases .
" but i do think it makes a lot of sense for the bundeswehr -lsb- german armed forces -rsb- to send more german trainers for the afghan army to the hindukush , " he said .
he also advised against a troop pullout , despite the number of german soldier casualties and the fact that two german engineers were kidnapped on july 18 .
germany should only pull out after the afghan army is turned into a viable fighting force and if the police and legal systems function , he said .
on monday , nato chief jaap de hoop scheffer acknowledged concern over civilian casualties in afghanistan , in an interview with london 's financial times .
he said nato was considering using smaller bombs .
the kidnapping problem the july abduction of two german engineers in afghanistan , along with the murder of one of them , has highlighted concerns about terrorism .
the government , which has come under fire for the way it handles abductions , is reported to be considering taking a tougher line .

currently , the isaf mission there enjoys broad support , but two other engagements seem likely to face resistance . german politicians said they would first decide whether to send more troops to afghanistan after discussing the matter with the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- there and nato partners , and once the army has determined whether or not it has the capacity to expand .
senior politicians from germany 's two main parties have come out solidly behind the training and reconstruction role played by the 3,000 german isaf troops in northern afghanistan , ahead of a parliamentary decision on renewing their mandate this autumn .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cdu 's kauder says he is prepared to boost troops but support for two other german missions to afghanistan - elite troops are deployed to the us-led operation enduring freedom -lrb- oef -rrb- and reconnaissance aircraft are assisting combat operations in the south - is wavering .
volker kauder , who heads the parliamentary caucus backing christian democratic chancellor angela merkel , says he is prepared to consider sending more troops to buttress the isaf mission led by nato .
pullout is unlikely " if the government considers it necessary to augment the german contingent , then that is right in my view , " said kauder .
" the -lsb- social democrats -rsb- will certainly hold intense discussions .
but i do n't expect much opposition , " kauder said .
and as long as the taliban has n't been conquered , there is no question of a pullout , he said .
" that would lead to a dramatic increase in the danger of terrorism in europe , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spd leader beck has taken a keen interest in afghanistan he was speaking after kurt beck , chairman of the social democrats , who recently paid a visit to afghanistan and has taken a keen interest in afghan affairs , said he backed sending more troops .
the aim was to stabilize the afghan government by creating effective security , beck said .
" and then we have to discuss the question whether we should dispatch more troops and police officers . "
before she left last week on her summer vacation , chancellor merkel made her commitment clear .
" germany 's engagement in afghanistan must continue .
we need all three components to be extended , " the chancellor said .
growing concern over missions backing his chief , kauder advocated rolling the three missions into one and pushing through a decision on all three simultaneously in the bundestag .
but the social democrats are not keen on this idea .
party defense spokesman rainer arnold says there is growing concern about oef which mounts counter-terrorism operations against the taliban in the south and east of afghanistan .
the mandate for the deployment - about which little is made public - should be allowed to lapse when it comes up for renewal in mid-november , he said .
mandates for the tornado reconnaisance deployment and the isaf reconstruction mission come up for renewal in the bundestag a month earlier , in mid-october .
there is a widespread belief in germany that isaf 's mainly reconstruction role is being confused in afghan minds with oef 's combat operations , which have come under severe criticism for the number of civilian casualties caused .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : has using tornado jets in afghanistan made germany a target ?
and there is deep concern that the deployment of six tornado aircraft in april to help detect taliban positions is turning germany into a target for terrorists .
opponents to increasingly speak out meanwhile , the german federal armed forces association , a group that represents the interests of german servicemen and -women , was skeptical of the idea of enhancing the afghanistan troops .
the association 's acting chairman , wolfgang schmelzer , told the mittelbayrischen zeitung newspaper that he was opposed to general troop increases .
" but i do think it makes a lot of sense for the bundeswehr -lsb- german armed forces -rsb- to send more german trainers for the afghan army to the hindukush , " he said .
he also advised against a troop pullout , despite the number of german soldier casualties and the fact that two german engineers were kidnapped on july 18 .
germany should only pull out after the afghan army is turned into a viable fighting force and if the police and legal systems function , he said .
on monday , nato chief jaap de hoop scheffer acknowledged concern over civilian casualties in afghanistan , in an interview with london 's financial times .
he said nato was considering using smaller bombs .
the kidnapping problem the july abduction of two german engineers in afghanistan , along with the murder of one of them , has highlighted concerns about terrorism .

in a statement posted on his web site , sinkewitz spoke of " incorrect conduct . " sinkewitz said on his site that he had obtained testogel , which is applied to the skin to balance out a testosterone deficit .
he said the substance was supposed to aid better recuperation during hard training exercises . " without thinking , or simply in great stupidity , i secretly applied testogel to my upper arm at the training camp in france on the evening before the doping test , " sinkewitz said . t-mobile dismisses sinkewitz from the team earlier tuesday , the german cycling federation bdr said sinkewitz had declined to have his b sample analyzed .
that prompted t-mobile to announce his dismissal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doping controls were also made throughout the tour de france " he broke his commitment to us , so his contract has been terminated , " said the team 's head of sports management rolf aldag .
" of course , the doping positive came as a shock to us , but it shows the effectiveness and importance of our internal testing and nada 's testing . "
nada is the german anti-doping agency . t-mobile had initially suspended sinkewitz after he tested positive during training on june 8 , just a month before the tour de france began .
he still participated , though , until he crashed into a spectator during the eighth stage in the alps on july 15 . evidence is clear-cut christian frommert , vice-president of sponsoring communications at deutsche telekom , said he welcomed the dismissal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tour de france ended - with a whimper - in paris sunday " the fact that sinkewitz passed on the opening of the b-sample means that he is accepting the results of the a-sample , " frommert said .
" we thus have a clear-cut doping case . "
it was important for sinkewitz to stand up to his actions . " it is good that the public and fans are not irritated and disappointed with ridiculous defense strategies , " frommert said . according to aldag , the 26-year-old sinkewitz now faced a two-year ban from competition .
he would also be required to repay a year 's salary for a doping violation .
his annual income is estimated at 500,000 euros -lrb- $ 684,000 -rrb- . sinkewitz 's positive doping test had resulted in german state broadcasters ard and zdf stopping their live tour de france broadcasts . article based on news reports -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

analysts are happy now , but worried for the future .
despite a slight rise in the ranks of unemployed in july , by 28,000 to 3.7 million , germany 's job market has shown significant improvements in an inter-eu comparison . the number of unemployed people in germany rose slightly in july from the month earlier , by 28,000 jobless , to 3.7 million , according to the federal employment agency in nuremberg .
the 0.1 percent rise in unemployment - to 8.9 percent of the work force from 8.8 percent - was smaller than in the previous year , showing the strength of the german economy , analysts said .
positive indicators the seasonally adjusted jobless figures , considered a more important indication of the state of the economy , were actually down 45,000 from june .
seasonal adjustment takes into account the number of school-leavers and job-trainees taking an expected break for the summer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : employment agency 's wiese is delighted with ' positive changes ' the head of the employment agency , frank-jürgen weise , was content .
" the three most important indicators - unemployment , jobs subject to social security and vacant jobs - have all shown positive changes , " he said .
unemployment in germany tipped over the five-million mark in 2006 but dropped below four million this year .
but analysts warned however that despite another set of impressive figures , the german labour market appeared to be running out of steam .
losing momentum ?
sylvain broyer of ixis-cib said he believed the unemployment rate would bottom out next year to about 8.4 percent .
" the german labour market is losing momentum : vacancies now stagnate more or less after having rocketed up to 80 percent year on year in the past years , and regular employment , i.e. employment subject to social security , barely rises above two percent year on year . "

analysts are happy now , but worried for the future .
despite a slight rise in the ranks of unemployed in july , by 28,000 to 3.7 million , germany 's job market has shown significant improvements in an inter-eu comparison . the number of unemployed people in germany rose slightly in july from the month earlier , by 28,000 jobless , to 3.7 million , according to the federal employment agency in nuremberg .
the 0.1 percent rise in unemployment - to 8.9 percent of the work force from 8.8 percent - was smaller than in the previous year , showing the strength of the german economy , analysts said .
positive indicators the seasonally adjusted jobless figures , considered a more important indication of the state of the economy , were actually down 45,000 from june .

the berlin government says it is doing its utmost to free the german engineer being held hostage in afghanistan .
but it continues to stress that it will not allow itself to be blackmailed into paying ransom money . a growing debate has arisen in germany on how the country should deal with freeing kidnapped nationals .
the interior affairs expert for the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- dieter wiefelspütz said there should n't be a sole strategy for handling kidnappings . " the government is well-advised to make such decisions based on each individual case , " wiefelspütz told the german daily frankfurter rundschau in its tuesday edition .
he said germany had so far dealt with kidnappings satisfactorily . " i do n't see that there has been any careless action taken here , " wiefelspütz said .
monday night afghan police found the body of a second south korean who had been killed by the taliban in ghasni province .
the fundamentalist islamists kidnapped 23 south koreans on july 19 and have said they would only set the group free if eight of their fighters were released from afghan jails .
they had said monday they would kill one of the hostages in response to failed negotiations with the afghan government . a german engineer has been in the hands of kidnappers in afghanistan for over one-and-a-half weeks .
a second hostage died during captivity .
his body is currently being examined ; results of the autopsy are expected at the end of the week .
in addition , a german national has been in the hands of captors in iraq since feb .
6 . germany does n't want to become a pawn the government does n't officially confirm paying ransom for kidnapped nationals .
yet negotiations behind the scenes and ransom payments are alleged to take place . the foreign affairs spokesman for the spd parliamentary group , gert weisskirchen , said that all possibilities had to be exhausted in order to save human lives .
but germany could not be blackmailed and he was not in favor of ransom payments , he said . " if this barrier were broken , we would become a pawn for anyone anywhere in the world who comes up with the idea to kidnap german nationals and already the money flows , " weisskirchen told german radio rbb .
" this ca n't be the response of the federal government . " the daily süddeutsche zeitung quoted a high-ranking government security expert on whether germany should take a tougher line against kidnappers in view of the series of kidnappings of germans in the middle east and afghanistan .
" we have to consider whether we can take the responsibility for paying ransom for a hostage - money which is then used to buy weapons to kill our soldiers in afghanistan , " the expert told the paper . " germany can not be blackmailed . " the german government , meanwhile , has said it will continue its tough stance . " our position is unchanged : germany can not be blackmailed , " deputy spokesman thomas steg said in berlin on monday .
at the same time , the government was doing " everything humanly possible and everything justifiable " to protect the lives of the victims . yet the protection of national interests also had to be taken into consideration , he said . article based on news reports -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in an interview tuesday with news agency reuters , voigt said he was skeptical the deal would serve to rein in iran 's power .
supplying more weapons to the region will not bring peace there , he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karsten voigt minced no words in his criticism of us plans " the region is not suffering from a lack of arms but from a lack of stability , " voigt said .
" i have strong doubts whether stability could be achieved with these weapons . "
bolstering democracy with weapons ?
an official for the us defense department said over the weekend that washington planned to give some $ 20 billion in military assistance to saudi arabia and other states in the persian gulf region to modernize their armed forces and limit iran 's influence .
the aid to saudi arabia is meant to upgrade its missile defenses and boost its navy . israel would receive $ 30.4 billion in military aid over the next decade - a significant increase to what the country received before .
us officials say the aid is meant to send a signal to its gulf allies that washington is committed to the region and will stand by them amid concerns about the war in iraq and iran 's growing clout .
voigt however said the plans ran contrary to the us desire to nurture and bolster democracy in the region .
" the us said a couple of months ago the main problem in the region was the lack of democracy , " he said .
" i do not know how one can support democracy by supplying weapons for saudi arabia , which is anything but a very democratic country . "
rice defends controversial plan on tuesday , us secretary of state condoleeza rice defended the plan , saying the us wanted to guarantee the security of their long-time allies in the middle east .
rice , who is on a tour of the middle east along with defense secretary robert gates , said in egypt the aid was not aimed at shifting the military balance in the region or kicking off a new arms race .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice defended the plans in egypt as she tours the middle east " we are determined to maintain the balances - the military and strategic balances - within the region that we have been committed to as well , " she said .
rice also rejected allegations , the gulf states would help the us in its war against terror in iraq in return for the arms supplies .
she stressed that washington was fighting extremism along with its allies in the gulf region .
they have a common interest in a stable and united iraq , she added .
germany critical of deal but news of the arms deal has sparked strong criticism in germany with several leading politicians echoing voigt 's doubts .
ruprecht polenz , the head of parliament 's foreign affairs committee and member of chancellor angela merkel 's conservative party , said the move threatened to destabilize what is already a volatile region .
" if you add more explosive things to a powder keg - and that 's what the middle east is - you heighten the risk and do n't make the region safer in the end , " polenz told frankfurter rundschau newspaper on monday .
the proposed military aid still has to be approved by the us congress .
there is expected to be opposition from some lawmakers , particularly to aid for to saudi arabia , which some accuse of not being helpful to the us-backed government in iraq . article based on news reports -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in an interview tuesday with news agency reuters , voigt said he was skeptical the deal would serve to rein in iran 's power .
supplying more weapons to the region will not bring peace there , he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karsten voigt minced no words in his criticism of us plans " the region is not suffering from a lack of arms but from a lack of stability , " voigt said .
" i have strong doubts whether stability could be achieved with these weapons . "
bolstering democracy with weapons ?
an official for the us defense department said over the weekend that washington planned to give some $ 20 billion in military assistance to saudi arabia and other states in the persian gulf region to modernize their armed forces and limit iran 's influence .
the aid to saudi arabia is meant to upgrade its missile defenses and boost its navy . israel would receive $ 30.4 billion in military aid over the next decade - a significant increase to what the country received before .
us officials say the aid is meant to send a signal to its gulf allies that washington is committed to the region and will stand by them amid concerns about the war in iraq and iran 's growing clout .
voigt however said the plans ran contrary to the us desire to nurture and bolster democracy in the region .
" the us said a couple of months ago the main problem in the region was the lack of democracy , " he said .
" i do not know how one can support democracy by supplying weapons for saudi arabia , which is anything but a very democratic country . "
rice defends controversial plan on tuesday , us secretary of state condoleeza rice defended the plan , saying the us wanted to guarantee the security of their long-time allies in the middle east .
rice , who is on a tour of the middle east along with defense secretary robert gates , said in egypt the aid was not aimed at shifting the military balance in the region or kicking off a new arms race .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice defended the plans in egypt as she tours the middle east " we are determined to maintain the balances - the military and strategic balances - within the region that we have been committed to as well , " she said .
rice also rejected allegations , the gulf states would help the us in its war against terror in iraq in return for the arms supplies .
she stressed that washington was fighting extremism along with its allies in the gulf region .
they have a common interest in a stable and united iraq , she added .
germany critical of deal but news of the arms deal has sparked strong criticism in germany with several leading politicians echoing voigt 's doubts .
ruprecht polenz , the head of parliament 's foreign affairs committee and member of chancellor angela merkel 's conservative party , said the move threatened to destabilize what is already a volatile region .
" if you add more explosive things to a powder keg - and that 's what the middle east is - you heighten the risk and do n't make the region safer in the end , " polenz told frankfurter rundschau newspaper on monday .
the proposed military aid still has to be approved by the us congress .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karsten voigt minced no words in his criticism of us plans " the region is not suffering from a lack of arms but from a lack of stability , " voigt said .
" i have strong doubts whether stability could be achieved with these weapons . "
bolstering democracy with weapons ?
an official for the us defense department said over the weekend that washington planned to give some $ 20 billion in military assistance to saudi arabia and other states in the persian gulf region to modernize their armed forces and limit iran 's influence .
the aid to saudi arabia is meant to upgrade its missile defenses and boost its navy . israel would receive $ 30.4 billion in military aid over the next decade - a significant increase to what the country received before .
us officials say the aid is meant to send a signal to its gulf allies that washington is committed to the region and will stand by them amid concerns about the war in iraq and iran 's growing clout .
voigt however said the plans ran contrary to the us desire to nurture and bolster democracy in the region .
" the us said a couple of months ago the main problem in the region was the lack of democracy , " he said .
" i do not know how one can support democracy by supplying weapons for saudi arabia , which is anything but a very democratic country . "
rice defends controversial plan on tuesday , us secretary of state condoleeza rice defended the plan , saying the us wanted to guarantee the security of their long-time allies in the middle east .
rice , who is on a tour of the middle east along with defense secretary robert gates , said in egypt the aid was not aimed at shifting the military balance in the region or kicking off a new arms race .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice defended the plans in egypt as she tours the middle east " we are determined to maintain the balances - the military and strategic balances - within the region that we have been committed to as well , " she said .
rice also rejected allegations , the gulf states would help the us in its war against terror in iraq in return for the arms supplies .
she stressed that washington was fighting extremism along with its allies in the gulf region .
they have a common interest in a stable and united iraq , she added .
germany critical of deal but news of the arms deal has sparked strong criticism in germany with several leading politicians echoing voigt 's doubts .
ruprecht polenz , the head of parliament 's foreign affairs committee and member of chancellor angela merkel 's conservative party , said the move threatened to destabilize what is already a volatile region .
" if you add more explosive things to a powder keg - and that 's what the middle east is - you heighten the risk and do n't make the region safer in the end , " polenz told frankfurter rundschau newspaper on monday .
the proposed military aid still has to be approved by the us congress .

in an interview tuesday with news agency reuters , voigt said he was skeptical the deal would serve to rein in iran 's power .
supplying more weapons to the region will not bring peace there , he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karsten voigt minced no words in his criticism of us plans " the region is not suffering from a lack of arms but from a lack of stability , " voigt said .
" i have strong doubts whether stability could be achieved with these weapons . "
bolstering democracy with weapons ?
an official for the us defense department said over the weekend that washington planned to give some $ 20 billion in military assistance to saudi arabia and other states in the persian gulf region to modernize their armed forces and limit iran 's influence .
the aid to saudi arabia is meant to upgrade its missile defenses and boost its navy . israel would receive $ 30.4 billion in military aid over the next decade - a significant increase to what the country received before .
us officials say the aid is meant to send a signal to its gulf allies that washington is committed to the region and will stand by them amid concerns about the war in iraq and iran 's growing clout .
voigt however said the plans ran contrary to the us desire to nurture and bolster democracy in the region .
" the us said a couple of months ago the main problem in the region was the lack of democracy , " he said .
" i do not know how one can support democracy by supplying weapons for saudi arabia , which is anything but a very democratic country . "
rice defends controversial plan on tuesday , us secretary of state condoleeza rice defended the plan , saying the us wanted to guarantee the security of their long-time allies in the middle east .
rice , who is on a tour of the middle east along with defense secretary robert gates , said in egypt the aid was not aimed at shifting the military balance in the region or kicking off a new arms race .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice defended the plans in egypt as she tours the middle east " we are determined to maintain the balances - the military and strategic balances - within the region that we have been committed to as well , " she said .
rice also rejected allegations , the gulf states would help the us in its war against terror in iraq in return for the arms supplies .
she stressed that washington was fighting extremism along with its allies in the gulf region .
they have a common interest in a stable and united iraq , she added .
germany critical of deal but news of the arms deal has sparked strong criticism in germany with several leading politicians echoing voigt 's doubts .
ruprecht polenz , the head of parliament 's foreign affairs committee and member of chancellor angela merkel 's conservative party , said the move threatened to destabilize what is already a volatile region .
" if you add more explosive things to a powder keg - and that 's what the middle east is - you heighten the risk and do n't make the region safer in the end , " polenz told frankfurter rundschau newspaper on monday .
the proposed military aid still has to be approved by the us congress .
there is expected to be opposition from some lawmakers , particularly to aid for to saudi arabia , which some accuse of not being helpful to the us-backed government in iraq . article based on news reports -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in an interview tuesday with news agency reuters , voigt said he was skeptical the deal would serve to rein in iran 's power .
supplying more weapons to the region will not bring peace there , he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karsten voigt minced no words in his criticism of us plans " the region is not suffering from a lack of arms but from a lack of stability , " voigt said .
" i have strong doubts whether stability could be achieved with these weapons . "
bolstering democracy with weapons ?
an official for the us defense department said over the weekend that washington planned to give some $ 20 billion in military assistance to saudi arabia and other states in the persian gulf region to modernize their armed forces and limit iran 's influence .
the aid to saudi arabia is meant to upgrade its missile defenses and boost its navy . israel would receive $ 30.4 billion in military aid over the next decade - a significant increase to what the country received before .
us officials say the aid is meant to send a signal to its gulf allies that washington is committed to the region and will stand by them amid concerns about the war in iraq and iran 's growing clout .
voigt however said the plans ran contrary to the us desire to nurture and bolster democracy in the region .
" the us said a couple of months ago the main problem in the region was the lack of democracy , " he said .
" i do not know how one can support democracy by supplying weapons for saudi arabia , which is anything but a very democratic country . "
rice defends controversial plan on tuesday , us secretary of state condoleeza rice defended the plan , saying the us wanted to guarantee the security of their long-time allies in the middle east .
rice , who is on a tour of the middle east along with defense secretary robert gates , said in egypt the aid was not aimed at shifting the military balance in the region or kicking off a new arms race .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice defended the plans in egypt as she tours the middle east " we are determined to maintain the balances - the military and strategic balances - within the region that we have been committed to as well , " she said .
rice also rejected allegations , the gulf states would help the us in its war against terror in iraq in return for the arms supplies .
she stressed that washington was fighting extremism along with its allies in the gulf region .
they have a common interest in a stable and united iraq , she added .
germany critical of deal but news of the arms deal has sparked strong criticism in germany with several leading politicians echoing voigt 's doubts .
ruprecht polenz , the head of parliament 's foreign affairs committee and member of chancellor angela merkel 's conservative party , said the move threatened to destabilize what is already a volatile region .
" if you add more explosive things to a powder keg - and that 's what the middle east is - you heighten the risk and do n't make the region safer in the end , " polenz told frankfurter rundschau newspaper on monday .
the proposed military aid still has to be approved by the us congress .

his team has now fired him .
sinkewitz faces a two-year ban from competition . german cyclist patrik sinkewitz admitted on tuesday that he " secretly " used a testosterone gel before failing a doping test in june .
in a statement posted on his web site , sinkewitz spoke of " incorrect conduct . " sinkewitz said on his site that he had obtained testogel , which is applied to the skin to balance out a testosterone deficit .
he said the substance was supposed to aid better recuperation during hard training exercises . " without thinking , or simply in great stupidity , i secretly applied testogel to my upper arm at the training camp in france on the evening before the doping test , " sinkewitz said . t-mobile dismisses sinkewitz from the team earlier tuesday , the german cycling federation bdr said sinkewitz had declined to have his b sample analyzed .
that prompted t-mobile to announce his dismissal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doping controls were also made throughout the tour de france " he broke his commitment to us , so his contract has been terminated , " said the team 's head of sports management rolf aldag .
" of course , the doping positive came as a shock to us , but it shows the effectiveness and importance of our internal testing and nada 's testing . "
nada is the german anti-doping agency . t-mobile had initially suspended sinkewitz after he tested positive during training on june 8 , just a month before the tour de france began .
he still participated , though , until he crashed into a spectator during the eighth stage in the alps on july 15 . evidence is clear-cut christian frommert , vice-president of sponsoring communications at deutsche telekom , said he welcomed the dismissal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tour de france ended - with a whimper - in paris sunday " the fact that sinkewitz passed on the opening of the b-sample means that he is accepting the results of the a-sample , " frommert said .
" we thus have a clear-cut doping case . "
it was important for sinkewitz to stand up to his actions . " it is good that the public and fans are not irritated and disappointed with ridiculous defense strategies , " frommert said . according to aldag , the 26-year-old sinkewitz now faced a two-year ban from competition .
he would also be required to repay a year 's salary for a doping violation .
his annual income is estimated at 500,000 euros -lrb- $ 684,000 -rrb- . sinkewitz 's positive doping test had resulted in german state broadcasters ard and zdf stopping their live tour de france broadcasts . article based on news reports -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

analysts are happy now , but worried for the future .
despite a slight rise in the ranks of unemployed in july , by 28,000 to 3.7 million , germany 's job market has shown significant improvements in an inter-eu comparison . the number of unemployed people in germany rose slightly in july from the month earlier , by 28,000 jobless , to 3.7 million , according to the federal employment agency in nuremberg .
the 0.1 percent rise in unemployment - to 8.9 percent of the work force from 8.8 percent - was smaller than in the previous year , showing the strength of the german economy , analysts said .
positive indicators the seasonally adjusted jobless figures , considered a more important indication of the state of the economy , were actually down 45,000 from june .
seasonal adjustment takes into account the number of school-leavers and job-trainees taking an expected break for the summer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : employment agency 's wiese is delighted with ' positive changes ' the head of the employment agency , frank-jürgen weise , was content .
" the three most important indicators - unemployment , jobs subject to social security and vacant jobs - have all shown positive changes , " he said .
unemployment in germany tipped over the five-million mark in 2006 but dropped below four million this year .
but analysts warned however that despite another set of impressive figures , the german labour market appeared to be running out of steam .
losing momentum ?
sylvain broyer of ixis-cib said he believed the unemployment rate would bottom out next year to about 8.4 percent .
" the german labour market is losing momentum : vacancies now stagnate more or less after having rocketed up to 80 percent year on year in the past years , and regular employment , i.e. employment subject to social security , barely rises above two percent year on year . "
according to european statistics agency eurostat , their calculation of german unemployment figures for june , at 6.4 percent , were 0.5 percent below the eu average of 6.9 percent .
this was a solid improvement from a year earlier , when german unemployment was at 8.3 percent , and well above the then-eu average of 7.9 percent .
eu improves overall germany , known as the economic motor of the eu , was not the only country to see improvement .
eurostat said 22 of the 27 member states managed to reduce unemployment for the year .
the largest drops were in poland -lrb- down to 10.2 percent from 13.9 percent , -rrb- and sweden -lrb- down to 5.3 percent , from 7.2 percent . -rrb-

the prosecutor initially wanted the documents destroyed .
but copies of the tapes were then handed over to the journalists via the public records office in ludwigsburg . the raf film by aust and büchel will air on german public television in september . article based on news reports -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

his team has now fired him .
sinkewitz faces a two-year ban from competition . german cyclist patrik sinkewitz admitted on tuesday that he " secretly " used a testosterone gel before failing a doping test in june .
in a statement posted on his web site , sinkewitz spoke of " incorrect conduct . " sinkewitz said on his site that he had obtained testogel , which is applied to the skin to balance out a testosterone deficit .
he said the substance was supposed to aid better recuperation during hard training exercises . " without thinking , or simply in great stupidity , i secretly applied testogel to my upper arm at the training camp in france on the evening before the doping test , " sinkewitz said . t-mobile dismisses sinkewitz from the team earlier tuesday , the german cycling federation bdr said sinkewitz had declined to have his b sample analyzed .
that prompted t-mobile to announce his dismissal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doping controls were also made throughout the tour de france " he broke his commitment to us , so his contract has been terminated , " said the team 's head of sports management rolf aldag .
" of course , the doping positive came as a shock to us , but it shows the effectiveness and importance of our internal testing and nada 's testing . "
nada is the german anti-doping agency . t-mobile had initially suspended sinkewitz after he tested positive during training on june 8 , just a month before the tour de france began .
he still participated , though , until he crashed into a spectator during the eighth stage in the alps on july 15 . evidence is clear-cut christian frommert , vice-president of sponsoring communications at deutsche telekom , said he welcomed the dismissal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tour de france ended - with a whimper - in paris sunday " the fact that sinkewitz passed on the opening of the b-sample means that he is accepting the results of the a-sample , " frommert said .
" we thus have a clear-cut doping case . "
it was important for sinkewitz to stand up to his actions . " it is good that the public and fans are not irritated and disappointed with ridiculous defense strategies , " frommert said . according to aldag , the 26-year-old sinkewitz now faced a two-year ban from competition .
he would also be required to repay a year 's salary for a doping violation .
his annual income is estimated at 500,000 euros -lrb- $ 684,000 -rrb- . sinkewitz 's positive doping test had resulted in german state broadcasters ard and zdf stopping their live tour de france broadcasts . article based on news reports -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

an official for the us defense department said over the weekend that washington planned to give some $ 20 billion in military assistance to saudi arabia and other states in the persian gulf region to modernize their armed forces and limit iran 's influence .
the aid to saudi arabia is meant to upgrade its missile defenses and boost its navy . israel would receive $ 30.4 billion in military aid over the next decade - a significant increase to what the country received before .
us officials say the aid is meant to send a signal to its gulf allies that washington is committed to the region and will stand by them amid concerns about the war in iraq and iran 's growing clout .
voigt however said the plans ran contrary to the us desire to nurture and bolster democracy in the region .
" the us said a couple of months ago the main problem in the region was the lack of democracy , " he said .
" i do not know how one can support democracy by supplying weapons for saudi arabia , which is anything but a very democratic country . "

in an interview tuesday with news agency reuters , voigt said he was skeptical the deal would serve to rein in iran 's power .
supplying more weapons to the region will not bring peace there , he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karsten voigt minced no words in his criticism of us plans " the region is not suffering from a lack of arms but from a lack of stability , " voigt said .
" i have strong doubts whether stability could be achieved with these weapons . "
bolstering democracy with weapons ?
an official for the us defense department said over the weekend that washington planned to give some $ 20 billion in military assistance to saudi arabia and other states in the persian gulf region to modernize their armed forces and limit iran 's influence .
the aid to saudi arabia is meant to upgrade its missile defenses and boost its navy . israel would receive $ 30.4 billion in military aid over the next decade - a significant increase to what the country received before .
us officials say the aid is meant to send a signal to its gulf allies that washington is committed to the region and will stand by them amid concerns about the war in iraq and iran 's growing clout .
voigt however said the plans ran contrary to the us desire to nurture and bolster democracy in the region .
" the us said a couple of months ago the main problem in the region was the lack of democracy , " he said .
" i do not know how one can support democracy by supplying weapons for saudi arabia , which is anything but a very democratic country . "
rice defends controversial plan on tuesday , us secretary of state condoleeza rice defended the plan , saying the us wanted to guarantee the security of their long-time allies in the middle east .
rice , who is on a tour of the middle east along with defense secretary robert gates , said in egypt the aid was not aimed at shifting the military balance in the region or kicking off a new arms race .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice defended the plans in egypt as she tours the middle east " we are determined to maintain the balances - the military and strategic balances - within the region that we have been committed to as well , " she said .
rice also rejected allegations , the gulf states would help the us in its war against terror in iraq in return for the arms supplies .
she stressed that washington was fighting extremism along with its allies in the gulf region .
they have a common interest in a stable and united iraq , she added .
germany critical of deal but news of the arms deal has sparked strong criticism in germany with several leading politicians echoing voigt 's doubts .
ruprecht polenz , the head of parliament 's foreign affairs committee and member of chancellor angela merkel 's conservative party , said the move threatened to destabilize what is already a volatile region .

analysts are happy now , but worried for the future .
despite a slight rise in the ranks of unemployed in july , by 28,000 to 3.7 million , germany 's job market has shown significant improvements in an inter-eu comparison . the number of unemployed people in germany rose slightly in july from the month earlier , by 28,000 jobless , to 3.7 million , according to the federal employment agency in nuremberg .
the 0.1 percent rise in unemployment - to 8.9 percent of the work force from 8.8 percent - was smaller than in the previous year , showing the strength of the german economy , analysts said .

the berlin government says it is doing its utmost to free the german engineer being held hostage in afghanistan .
but it continues to stress that it will not allow itself to be blackmailed into paying ransom money . a growing debate has arisen in germany on how the country should deal with freeing kidnapped nationals .
the interior affairs expert for the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- dieter wiefelspütz said there should n't be a sole strategy for handling kidnappings . " the government is well-advised to make such decisions based on each individual case , " wiefelspütz told the german daily frankfurter rundschau in its tuesday edition .
he said germany had so far dealt with kidnappings satisfactorily . " i do n't see that there has been any careless action taken here , " wiefelspütz said .
monday night afghan police found the body of a second south korean who had been killed by the taliban in ghasni province .
the fundamentalist islamists kidnapped 23 south koreans on july 19 and have said they would only set the group free if eight of their fighters were released from afghan jails .
they had said monday they would kill one of the hostages in response to failed negotiations with the afghan government . a german engineer has been in the hands of kidnappers in afghanistan for over one-and-a-half weeks .
a second hostage died during captivity .
his body is currently being examined ; results of the autopsy are expected at the end of the week .
in addition , a german national has been in the hands of captors in iraq since feb .
6 . germany does n't want to become a pawn the government does n't officially confirm paying ransom for kidnapped nationals .
yet negotiations behind the scenes and ransom payments are alleged to take place . the foreign affairs spokesman for the spd parliamentary group , gert weisskirchen , said that all possibilities had to be exhausted in order to save human lives .
but germany could not be blackmailed and he was not in favor of ransom payments , he said . " if this barrier were broken , we would become a pawn for anyone anywhere in the world who comes up with the idea to kidnap german nationals and already the money flows , " weisskirchen told german radio rbb .
" this ca n't be the response of the federal government . " the daily süddeutsche zeitung quoted a high-ranking government security expert on whether germany should take a tougher line against kidnappers in view of the series of kidnappings of germans in the middle east and afghanistan .
" we have to consider whether we can take the responsibility for paying ransom for a hostage - money which is then used to buy weapons to kill our soldiers in afghanistan , " the expert told the paper . " germany can not be blackmailed . " the german government , meanwhile , has said it will continue its tough stance . " our position is unchanged : germany can not be blackmailed , " deputy spokesman thomas steg said in berlin on monday .
at the same time , the government was doing " everything humanly possible and everything justifiable " to protect the lives of the victims . yet the protection of national interests also had to be taken into consideration , he said . article based on news reports -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the recordings were made between october 1975 and may 1976 during the trial against notorious members of the first raf generation , andreas baader , ulrike meinhof , gudrun ensslin and jan-carl raspe .
it involves 21 tapes with some 12 hours of recordings from the courtroom in the high security stammheim prison near stuttgart .
the tapes were initially supposed to be erased after they were transcribed , but were forgotten . the raf , also known as the baader-meinhof gang , conducted a reign of teror in germany in the 1970s- and 80s for kidnapping and killing prominent establishment figures in the name of class struggle and left-wing idealism .
the group was most active in 1977 , when it was responsible for a spate of murders including german federal prosecutor siegfried buback and jürgen ponto , chief executive of dresdner bank ag . baader criticizes prison conditions the recordings include ensslin stating that the raf was responsible for attacks on the cia headquarters as well as the fifth us division in frankfurt , and the us headquarters in heidelberg . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the defendants were sentenced to life in prison " what embodies the policies of the raf is the obligation to resistance in the federal republic of germany , " ensslin said in the recording .
a responsibility towards imperialistic policies could only be met with resistance , she said . baader talked about suffering under solitary confinement .
he criticized that the prisoners were not allowed to walk in the prison yard during the three days of trial per week , although this had been promised .
baader said the accused were forced to spend several hours per day in soundproof and windowless solitary cells . the tapes also include meinhof 's last testimony prior to her suicide in may 1976 . " it is , of course , a police tactic in counter-insurgency conflicts , in guerilla warfare , to take out the leaders , " meinhof , a journalist-turned-terrorist says on the tape . film to air in september the group unleashed a wave of terror across the country in the 1970s and 1980s , which climaxed in the so-called " german autumn " of 1977 .
it ended with the suicides of the raf 's core leadership and the brutal kidnapping and murder of the president of the german employers ' association , hanns martin schleyer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baader and his girlfriend ensslin had already been convicted of a bombing in 1968 according to gemran state network ndr , which is co-producing the documentary film , the authors came across parts of the tapes in secondary rooms at the higher regional court in stuttgart during their research . lengthy negotiations between the authors stefan aust und helmar büchel and the court , as well as the federal prosecutor in karlsruhe followed .
the prosecutor initially wanted the documents destroyed .
but copies of the tapes were then handed over to the journalists via the public records office in ludwigsburg . the raf film by aust and büchel will air on german public television in september . article based on news reports -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

analysts are happy now , but worried for the future .
despite a slight rise in the ranks of unemployed in july , by 28,000 to 3.7 million , germany 's job market has shown significant improvements in an inter-eu comparison . the number of unemployed people in germany rose slightly in july from the month earlier , by 28,000 jobless , to 3.7 million , according to the federal employment agency in nuremberg .
the 0.1 percent rise in unemployment - to 8.9 percent of the work force from 8.8 percent - was smaller than in the previous year , showing the strength of the german economy , analysts said .
positive indicators the seasonally adjusted jobless figures , considered a more important indication of the state of the economy , were actually down 45,000 from june .
seasonal adjustment takes into account the number of school-leavers and job-trainees taking an expected break for the summer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : employment agency 's wiese is delighted with ' positive changes ' the head of the employment agency , frank-jürgen weise , was content .
" the three most important indicators - unemployment , jobs subject to social security and vacant jobs - have all shown positive changes , " he said .
unemployment in germany tipped over the five-million mark in 2006 but dropped below four million this year .
but analysts warned however that despite another set of impressive figures , the german labour market appeared to be running out of steam .
losing momentum ?
sylvain broyer of ixis-cib said he believed the unemployment rate would bottom out next year to about 8.4 percent .
" the german labour market is losing momentum : vacancies now stagnate more or less after having rocketed up to 80 percent year on year in the past years , and regular employment , i.e. employment subject to social security , barely rises above two percent year on year . "
according to european statistics agency eurostat , their calculation of german unemployment figures for june , at 6.4 percent , were 0.5 percent below the eu average of 6.9 percent .
this was a solid improvement from a year earlier , when german unemployment was at 8.3 percent , and well above the then-eu average of 7.9 percent .
eu improves overall germany , known as the economic motor of the eu , was not the only country to see improvement .

analysts are happy now , but worried for the future .
despite a slight rise in the ranks of unemployed in july , by 28,000 to 3.7 million , germany 's job market has shown significant improvements in an inter-eu comparison . the number of unemployed people in germany rose slightly in july from the month earlier , by 28,000 jobless , to 3.7 million , according to the federal employment agency in nuremberg .
the 0.1 percent rise in unemployment - to 8.9 percent of the work force from 8.8 percent - was smaller than in the previous year , showing the strength of the german economy , analysts said .
positive indicators the seasonally adjusted jobless figures , considered a more important indication of the state of the economy , were actually down 45,000 from june .
seasonal adjustment takes into account the number of school-leavers and job-trainees taking an expected break for the summer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : employment agency 's wiese is delighted with ' positive changes ' the head of the employment agency , frank-jürgen weise , was content .
" the three most important indicators - unemployment , jobs subject to social security and vacant jobs - have all shown positive changes , " he said .
unemployment in germany tipped over the five-million mark in 2006 but dropped below four million this year .
but analysts warned however that despite another set of impressive figures , the german labour market appeared to be running out of steam .
losing momentum ?
sylvain broyer of ixis-cib said he believed the unemployment rate would bottom out next year to about 8.4 percent .
" the german labour market is losing momentum : vacancies now stagnate more or less after having rocketed up to 80 percent year on year in the past years , and regular employment , i.e. employment subject to social security , barely rises above two percent year on year . "
according to european statistics agency eurostat , their calculation of german unemployment figures for june , at 6.4 percent , were 0.5 percent below the eu average of 6.9 percent .
this was a solid improvement from a year earlier , when german unemployment was at 8.3 percent , and well above the then-eu average of 7.9 percent .
eu improves overall germany , known as the economic motor of the eu , was not the only country to see improvement .

in an interview tuesday with news agency reuters , voigt said he was skeptical the deal would serve to rein in iran 's power .
supplying more weapons to the region will not bring peace there , he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karsten voigt minced no words in his criticism of us plans " the region is not suffering from a lack of arms but from a lack of stability , " voigt said .
" i have strong doubts whether stability could be achieved with these weapons . "
bolstering democracy with weapons ?
an official for the us defense department said over the weekend that washington planned to give some $ 20 billion in military assistance to saudi arabia and other states in the persian gulf region to modernize their armed forces and limit iran 's influence .
the aid to saudi arabia is meant to upgrade its missile defenses and boost its navy . israel would receive $ 30.4 billion in military aid over the next decade - a significant increase to what the country received before .
us officials say the aid is meant to send a signal to its gulf allies that washington is committed to the region and will stand by them amid concerns about the war in iraq and iran 's growing clout .
voigt however said the plans ran contrary to the us desire to nurture and bolster democracy in the region .
" the us said a couple of months ago the main problem in the region was the lack of democracy , " he said .
" i do not know how one can support democracy by supplying weapons for saudi arabia , which is anything but a very democratic country . "
rice defends controversial plan on tuesday , us secretary of state condoleeza rice defended the plan , saying the us wanted to guarantee the security of their long-time allies in the middle east .
rice , who is on a tour of the middle east along with defense secretary robert gates , said in egypt the aid was not aimed at shifting the military balance in the region or kicking off a new arms race .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice defended the plans in egypt as she tours the middle east " we are determined to maintain the balances - the military and strategic balances - within the region that we have been committed to as well , " she said .
rice also rejected allegations , the gulf states would help the us in its war against terror in iraq in return for the arms supplies .
she stressed that washington was fighting extremism along with its allies in the gulf region .
they have a common interest in a stable and united iraq , she added .
germany critical of deal but news of the arms deal has sparked strong criticism in germany with several leading politicians echoing voigt 's doubts .
ruprecht polenz , the head of parliament 's foreign affairs committee and member of chancellor angela merkel 's conservative party , said the move threatened to destabilize what is already a volatile region .
" if you add more explosive things to a powder keg - and that 's what the middle east is - you heighten the risk and do n't make the region safer in the end , " polenz told frankfurter rundschau newspaper on monday .
the proposed military aid still has to be approved by the us congress .
there is expected to be opposition from some lawmakers , particularly to aid for to saudi arabia , which some accuse of not being helpful to the us-backed government in iraq . article based on news reports -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

analysts are happy now , but worried for the future .
despite a slight rise in the ranks of unemployed in july , by 28,000 to 3.7 million , germany 's job market has shown significant improvements in an inter-eu comparison . the number of unemployed people in germany rose slightly in july from the month earlier , by 28,000 jobless , to 3.7 million , according to the federal employment agency in nuremberg .
the 0.1 percent rise in unemployment - to 8.9 percent of the work force from 8.8 percent - was smaller than in the previous year , showing the strength of the german economy , analysts said .
positive indicators the seasonally adjusted jobless figures , considered a more important indication of the state of the economy , were actually down 45,000 from june .
seasonal adjustment takes into account the number of school-leavers and job-trainees taking an expected break for the summer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : employment agency 's wiese is delighted with ' positive changes ' the head of the employment agency , frank-jürgen weise , was content .
" the three most important indicators - unemployment , jobs subject to social security and vacant jobs - have all shown positive changes , " he said .
unemployment in germany tipped over the five-million mark in 2006 but dropped below four million this year .
but analysts warned however that despite another set of impressive figures , the german labour market appeared to be running out of steam .
losing momentum ?
sylvain broyer of ixis-cib said he believed the unemployment rate would bottom out next year to about 8.4 percent .
" the german labour market is losing momentum : vacancies now stagnate more or less after having rocketed up to 80 percent year on year in the past years , and regular employment , i.e. employment subject to social security , barely rises above two percent year on year . "
according to european statistics agency eurostat , their calculation of german unemployment figures for june , at 6.4 percent , were 0.5 percent below the eu average of 6.9 percent .
this was a solid improvement from a year earlier , when german unemployment was at 8.3 percent , and well above the then-eu average of 7.9 percent .
eu improves overall germany , known as the economic motor of the eu , was not the only country to see improvement .
eurostat said 22 of the 27 member states managed to reduce unemployment for the year .
the largest drops were in poland -lrb- down to 10.2 percent from 13.9 percent , -rrb- and sweden -lrb- down to 5.3 percent , from 7.2 percent . -rrb-
lowest unemployment was seen in the netherlands , denmark , cyprus and ireland , with values between 3.3 and 4 percent . article based on news reports -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it involves 21 tapes with some 12 hours of recordings from the courtroom in the high security stammheim prison near stuttgart .
the tapes were initially supposed to be erased after they were transcribed , but were forgotten . the raf , also known as the baader-meinhof gang , conducted a reign of teror in germany in the 1970s- and 80s for kidnapping and killing prominent establishment figures in the name of class struggle and left-wing idealism .
the group was most active in 1977 , when it was responsible for a spate of murders including german federal prosecutor siegfried buback and jürgen ponto , chief executive of dresdner bank ag . baader criticizes prison conditions the recordings include ensslin stating that the raf was responsible for attacks on the cia headquarters as well as the fifth us division in frankfurt , and the us headquarters in heidelberg . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the defendants were sentenced to life in prison " what embodies the policies of the raf is the obligation to resistance in the federal republic of germany , " ensslin said in the recording .

he criticized that the prisoners were not allowed to walk in the prison yard during the three days of trial per week , although this had been promised .
baader said the accused were forced to spend several hours per day in soundproof and windowless solitary cells . the tapes also include meinhof 's last testimony prior to her suicide in may 1976 . " it is , of course , a police tactic in counter-insurgency conflicts , in guerilla warfare , to take out the leaders , " meinhof , a journalist-turned-terrorist says on the tape . film to air in september the group unleashed a wave of terror across the country in the 1970s and 1980s , which climaxed in the so-called " german autumn " of 1977 .
it ended with the suicides of the raf 's core leadership and the brutal kidnapping and murder of the president of the german employers ' association , hanns martin schleyer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baader and his girlfriend ensslin had already been convicted of a bombing in 1968 according to gemran state network ndr , which is co-producing the documentary film , the authors came across parts of the tapes in secondary rooms at the higher regional court in stuttgart during their research . lengthy negotiations between the authors stefan aust und helmar büchel and the court , as well as the federal prosecutor in karlsruhe followed .

the 0.1 percent rise in unemployment - to 8.9 percent of the work force from 8.8 percent - was smaller than in the previous year , showing the strength of the german economy , analysts said .

analysts are happy now , but worried for the future .
despite a slight rise in the ranks of unemployed in july , by 28,000 to 3.7 million , germany 's job market has shown significant improvements in an inter-eu comparison . the number of unemployed people in germany rose slightly in july from the month earlier , by 28,000 jobless , to 3.7 million , according to the federal employment agency in nuremberg .
the 0.1 percent rise in unemployment - to 8.9 percent of the work force from 8.8 percent - was smaller than in the previous year , showing the strength of the german economy , analysts said .
positive indicators the seasonally adjusted jobless figures , considered a more important indication of the state of the economy , were actually down 45,000 from june .
seasonal adjustment takes into account the number of school-leavers and job-trainees taking an expected break for the summer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : employment agency 's wiese is delighted with ' positive changes ' the head of the employment agency , frank-jürgen weise , was content .
" the three most important indicators - unemployment , jobs subject to social security and vacant jobs - have all shown positive changes , " he said .
unemployment in germany tipped over the five-million mark in 2006 but dropped below four million this year .
but analysts warned however that despite another set of impressive figures , the german labour market appeared to be running out of steam .
losing momentum ?
sylvain broyer of ixis-cib said he believed the unemployment rate would bottom out next year to about 8.4 percent .
" the german labour market is losing momentum : vacancies now stagnate more or less after having rocketed up to 80 percent year on year in the past years , and regular employment , i.e. employment subject to social security , barely rises above two percent year on year . "
according to european statistics agency eurostat , their calculation of german unemployment figures for june , at 6.4 percent , were 0.5 percent below the eu average of 6.9 percent .
this was a solid improvement from a year earlier , when german unemployment was at 8.3 percent , and well above the then-eu average of 7.9 percent .
eu improves overall germany , known as the economic motor of the eu , was not the only country to see improvement .
eurostat said 22 of the 27 member states managed to reduce unemployment for the year .
the largest drops were in poland -lrb- down to 10.2 percent from 13.9 percent , -rrb- and sweden -lrb- down to 5.3 percent , from 7.2 percent . -rrb-
lowest unemployment was seen in the netherlands , denmark , cyprus and ireland , with values between 3.3 and 4 percent . article based on news reports -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the berlin government says it is doing its utmost to free the german engineer being held hostage in afghanistan .
but it continues to stress that it will not allow itself to be blackmailed into paying ransom money . a growing debate has arisen in germany on how the country should deal with freeing kidnapped nationals .
the interior affairs expert for the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- dieter wiefelspütz said there should n't be a sole strategy for handling kidnappings . " the government is well-advised to make such decisions based on each individual case , " wiefelspütz told the german daily frankfurter rundschau in its tuesday edition .
he said germany had so far dealt with kidnappings satisfactorily . " i do n't see that there has been any careless action taken here , " wiefelspütz said .
monday night afghan police found the body of a second south korean who had been killed by the taliban in ghasni province .
the fundamentalist islamists kidnapped 23 south koreans on july 19 and have said they would only set the group free if eight of their fighters were released from afghan jails .
they had said monday they would kill one of the hostages in response to failed negotiations with the afghan government . a german engineer has been in the hands of kidnappers in afghanistan for over one-and-a-half weeks .
a second hostage died during captivity .
his body is currently being examined ; results of the autopsy are expected at the end of the week .
in addition , a german national has been in the hands of captors in iraq since feb .
6 . germany does n't want to become a pawn the government does n't officially confirm paying ransom for kidnapped nationals .
yet negotiations behind the scenes and ransom payments are alleged to take place . the foreign affairs spokesman for the spd parliamentary group , gert weisskirchen , said that all possibilities had to be exhausted in order to save human lives .
but germany could not be blackmailed and he was not in favor of ransom payments , he said .

the recordings were made between october 1975 and may 1976 during the trial against notorious members of the first raf generation , andreas baader , ulrike meinhof , gudrun ensslin and jan-carl raspe .
it involves 21 tapes with some 12 hours of recordings from the courtroom in the high security stammheim prison near stuttgart .
the tapes were initially supposed to be erased after they were transcribed , but were forgotten . the raf , also known as the baader-meinhof gang , conducted a reign of teror in germany in the 1970s- and 80s for kidnapping and killing prominent establishment figures in the name of class struggle and left-wing idealism .
the group was most active in 1977 , when it was responsible for a spate of murders including german federal prosecutor siegfried buback and jürgen ponto , chief executive of dresdner bank ag . baader criticizes prison conditions the recordings include ensslin stating that the raf was responsible for attacks on the cia headquarters as well as the fifth us division in frankfurt , and the us headquarters in heidelberg . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the defendants were sentenced to life in prison " what embodies the policies of the raf is the obligation to resistance in the federal republic of germany , " ensslin said in the recording .

he criticized that the prisoners were not allowed to walk in the prison yard during the three days of trial per week , although this had been promised .
baader said the accused were forced to spend several hours per day in soundproof and windowless solitary cells . the tapes also include meinhof 's last testimony prior to her suicide in may 1976 . " it is , of course , a police tactic in counter-insurgency conflicts , in guerilla warfare , to take out the leaders , " meinhof , a journalist-turned-terrorist says on the tape . film to air in september the group unleashed a wave of terror across the country in the 1970s and 1980s , which climaxed in the so-called " german autumn " of 1977 .
it ended with the suicides of the raf 's core leadership and the brutal kidnapping and murder of the president of the german employers ' association , hanns martin schleyer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baader and his girlfriend ensslin had already been convicted of a bombing in 1968 according to gemran state network ndr , which is co-producing the documentary film , the authors came across parts of the tapes in secondary rooms at the higher regional court in stuttgart during their research . lengthy negotiations between the authors stefan aust und helmar büchel and the court , as well as the federal prosecutor in karlsruhe followed .
the prosecutor initially wanted the documents destroyed .
but copies of the tapes were then handed over to the journalists via the public records office in ludwigsburg . the raf film by aust and büchel will air on german public television in september . article based on news reports -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in an interview tuesday with news agency reuters , voigt said he was skeptical the deal would serve to rein in iran 's power .
supplying more weapons to the region will not bring peace there , he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karsten voigt minced no words in his criticism of us plans " the region is not suffering from a lack of arms but from a lack of stability , " voigt said .
" i have strong doubts whether stability could be achieved with these weapons . "
bolstering democracy with weapons ?
an official for the us defense department said over the weekend that washington planned to give some $ 20 billion in military assistance to saudi arabia and other states in the persian gulf region to modernize their armed forces and limit iran 's influence .
the aid to saudi arabia is meant to upgrade its missile defenses and boost its navy . israel would receive $ 30.4 billion in military aid over the next decade - a significant increase to what the country received before .
us officials say the aid is meant to send a signal to its gulf allies that washington is committed to the region and will stand by them amid concerns about the war in iraq and iran 's growing clout .
voigt however said the plans ran contrary to the us desire to nurture and bolster democracy in the region .
" the us said a couple of months ago the main problem in the region was the lack of democracy , " he said .
" i do not know how one can support democracy by supplying weapons for saudi arabia , which is anything but a very democratic country . "
rice defends controversial plan on tuesday , us secretary of state condoleeza rice defended the plan , saying the us wanted to guarantee the security of their long-time allies in the middle east .
rice , who is on a tour of the middle east along with defense secretary robert gates , said in egypt the aid was not aimed at shifting the military balance in the region or kicking off a new arms race .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice defended the plans in egypt as she tours the middle east " we are determined to maintain the balances - the military and strategic balances - within the region that we have been committed to as well , " she said .
rice also rejected allegations , the gulf states would help the us in its war against terror in iraq in return for the arms supplies .
she stressed that washington was fighting extremism along with its allies in the gulf region .
they have a common interest in a stable and united iraq , she added .
germany critical of deal but news of the arms deal has sparked strong criticism in germany with several leading politicians echoing voigt 's doubts .
ruprecht polenz , the head of parliament 's foreign affairs committee and member of chancellor angela merkel 's conservative party , said the move threatened to destabilize what is already a volatile region .
" if you add more explosive things to a powder keg - and that 's what the middle east is - you heighten the risk and do n't make the region safer in the end , " polenz told frankfurter rundschau newspaper on monday .
the proposed military aid still has to be approved by the us congress .
there is expected to be opposition from some lawmakers , particularly to aid for to saudi arabia , which some accuse of not being helpful to the us-backed government in iraq . article based on news reports -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in an interview tuesday with news agency reuters , voigt said he was skeptical the deal would serve to rein in iran 's power .
supplying more weapons to the region will not bring peace there , he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karsten voigt minced no words in his criticism of us plans " the region is not suffering from a lack of arms but from a lack of stability , " voigt said .
" i have strong doubts whether stability could be achieved with these weapons . "
bolstering democracy with weapons ?
an official for the us defense department said over the weekend that washington planned to give some $ 20 billion in military assistance to saudi arabia and other states in the persian gulf region to modernize their armed forces and limit iran 's influence .
the aid to saudi arabia is meant to upgrade its missile defenses and boost its navy . israel would receive $ 30.4 billion in military aid over the next decade - a significant increase to what the country received before .
us officials say the aid is meant to send a signal to its gulf allies that washington is committed to the region and will stand by them amid concerns about the war in iraq and iran 's growing clout .
voigt however said the plans ran contrary to the us desire to nurture and bolster democracy in the region .
" the us said a couple of months ago the main problem in the region was the lack of democracy , " he said .
" i do not know how one can support democracy by supplying weapons for saudi arabia , which is anything but a very democratic country . "

" there was a risk that this confidence crisis would deteriorate further . " the bank 's main shareholder , the state-owned kfw banking group , has come to the rescue .
according to ikb , kfw assumed the bank 's financial obligations to rhineland funding from monday .
kfw , which holds a 38 percent stake in ikb , will protect the bank from further risks to maintain its creditworthiness .
this applied particularly to its main banking business , issuing loans to german medium-sized businesses . ikb earnings expected to fall bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : markets on both sides of the atlantic have felt the repercussions germany 's second-largest bank commerzbank said on monday it expected the problems in the us subprime mortgage market to cost it 80 million euros -lrb- $ 109 million -rrb- in the second and third quarters of the year . allianz , europe 's largest insurer , has made financial provisions of 70 million euros to cushion any losses .
financial analysts are expecting further details from other german banks this week .

the bank said the figures would be " significantly lower . " subprime mortgage loans involve greater risk , as they are granted to borrowers with limited or tarnished credit histories .
falling housing prices in the united states have made it more difficult for borrowers to meet their long-term payments .
this led to a strong rise in mortgage foreclosures and the subsequent bankruptcy of several major subprime mortgage lenders . article based on news reports -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

currently , the isaf mission there enjoys broad support , but two other engagements seem likely to face resistance . german politicians said they would first decide whether to send more troops to afghanistan after discussing the matter with the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- there and nato partners , and once the army has determined whether or not it has the capacity to expand .
senior politicians from germany 's two main parties have come out solidly behind the training and reconstruction role played by the 3,000 german isaf troops in northern afghanistan , ahead of a parliamentary decision on renewing their mandate this autumn .

volker kauder , who heads the parliamentary caucus backing christian democratic chancellor angela merkel , says he is prepared to consider sending more troops to buttress the isaf mission led by nato .
pullout is unlikely " if the government considers it necessary to augment the german contingent , then that is right in my view , " said kauder .
" the -lsb- social democrats -rsb- will certainly hold intense discussions .
but i do n't expect much opposition , " kauder said .
and as long as the taliban has n't been conquered , there is no question of a pullout , he said .
" that would lead to a dramatic increase in the danger of terrorism in europe , " he said .

" germany 's engagement in afghanistan must continue .
we need all three components to be extended , " the chancellor said .
growing concern over missions backing his chief , kauder advocated rolling the three missions into one and pushing through a decision on all three simultaneously in the bundestag .
but the social democrats are not keen on this idea .
party defense spokesman rainer arnold says there is growing concern about oef which mounts counter-terrorism operations against the taliban in the south and east of afghanistan .
the mandate for the deployment - about which little is made public - should be allowed to lapse when it comes up for renewal in mid-november , he said .
mandates for the tornado reconnaisance deployment and the isaf reconstruction mission come up for renewal in the bundestag a month earlier , in mid-october .
there is a widespread belief in germany that isaf 's mainly reconstruction role is being confused in afghan minds with oef 's combat operations , which have come under severe criticism for the number of civilian casualties caused .

the association 's acting chairman , wolfgang schmelzer , told the mittelbayrischen zeitung newspaper that he was opposed to general troop increases .
" but i do think it makes a lot of sense for the bundeswehr -lsb- german armed forces -rsb- to send more german trainers for the afghan army to the hindukush , " he said .
he also advised against a troop pullout , despite the number of german soldier casualties and the fact that two german engineers were kidnapped on july 18 .
germany should only pull out after the afghan army is turned into a viable fighting force and if the police and legal systems function , he said .
on monday , nato chief jaap de hoop scheffer acknowledged concern over civilian casualties in afghanistan , in an interview with london 's financial times .
he said nato was considering using smaller bombs .

currently , the isaf mission there enjoys broad support , but two other engagements seem likely to face resistance . german politicians said they would first decide whether to send more troops to afghanistan after discussing the matter with the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- there and nato partners , and once the army has determined whether or not it has the capacity to expand .
senior politicians from germany 's two main parties have come out solidly behind the training and reconstruction role played by the 3,000 german isaf troops in northern afghanistan , ahead of a parliamentary decision on renewing their mandate this autumn .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cdu 's kauder says he is prepared to boost troops but support for two other german missions to afghanistan - elite troops are deployed to the us-led operation enduring freedom -lrb- oef -rrb- and reconnaissance aircraft are assisting combat operations in the south - is wavering .
volker kauder , who heads the parliamentary caucus backing christian democratic chancellor angela merkel , says he is prepared to consider sending more troops to buttress the isaf mission led by nato .
pullout is unlikely " if the government considers it necessary to augment the german contingent , then that is right in my view , " said kauder .
" the -lsb- social democrats -rsb- will certainly hold intense discussions .
but i do n't expect much opposition , " kauder said .
and as long as the taliban has n't been conquered , there is no question of a pullout , he said .
" that would lead to a dramatic increase in the danger of terrorism in europe , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spd leader beck has taken a keen interest in afghanistan he was speaking after kurt beck , chairman of the social democrats , who recently paid a visit to afghanistan and has taken a keen interest in afghan affairs , said he backed sending more troops .
the aim was to stabilize the afghan government by creating effective security , beck said .
" and then we have to discuss the question whether we should dispatch more troops and police officers . "
before she left last week on her summer vacation , chancellor merkel made her commitment clear .
" germany 's engagement in afghanistan must continue .
we need all three components to be extended , " the chancellor said .
growing concern over missions backing his chief , kauder advocated rolling the three missions into one and pushing through a decision on all three simultaneously in the bundestag .
but the social democrats are not keen on this idea .
party defense spokesman rainer arnold says there is growing concern about oef which mounts counter-terrorism operations against the taliban in the south and east of afghanistan .
the mandate for the deployment - about which little is made public - should be allowed to lapse when it comes up for renewal in mid-november , he said .
mandates for the tornado reconnaisance deployment and the isaf reconstruction mission come up for renewal in the bundestag a month earlier , in mid-october .
there is a widespread belief in germany that isaf 's mainly reconstruction role is being confused in afghan minds with oef 's combat operations , which have come under severe criticism for the number of civilian casualties caused .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : has using tornado jets in afghanistan made germany a target ?
and there is deep concern that the deployment of six tornado aircraft in april to help detect taliban positions is turning germany into a target for terrorists .
opponents to increasingly speak out meanwhile , the german federal armed forces association , a group that represents the interests of german servicemen and -women , was skeptical of the idea of enhancing the afghanistan troops .
the association 's acting chairman , wolfgang schmelzer , told the mittelbayrischen zeitung newspaper that he was opposed to general troop increases .
" but i do think it makes a lot of sense for the bundeswehr -lsb- german armed forces -rsb- to send more german trainers for the afghan army to the hindukush , " he said .
he also advised against a troop pullout , despite the number of german soldier casualties and the fact that two german engineers were kidnapped on july 18 .
germany should only pull out after the afghan army is turned into a viable fighting force and if the police and legal systems function , he said .
on monday , nato chief jaap de hoop scheffer acknowledged concern over civilian casualties in afghanistan , in an interview with london 's financial times .
he said nato was considering using smaller bombs .
the kidnapping problem the july abduction of two german engineers in afghanistan , along with the murder of one of them , has highlighted concerns about terrorism .

the berlin government says it is doing its utmost to free the german engineer being held hostage in afghanistan .
but it continues to stress that it will not allow itself to be blackmailed into paying ransom money . a growing debate has arisen in germany on how the country should deal with freeing kidnapped nationals .
the interior affairs expert for the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- dieter wiefelspütz said there should n't be a sole strategy for handling kidnappings . " the government is well-advised to make such decisions based on each individual case , " wiefelspütz told the german daily frankfurter rundschau in its tuesday edition .
he said germany had so far dealt with kidnappings satisfactorily . " i do n't see that there has been any careless action taken here , " wiefelspütz said .
monday night afghan police found the body of a second south korean who had been killed by the taliban in ghasni province .
the fundamentalist islamists kidnapped 23 south koreans on july 19 and have said they would only set the group free if eight of their fighters were released from afghan jails .
they had said monday they would kill one of the hostages in response to failed negotiations with the afghan government . a german engineer has been in the hands of kidnappers in afghanistan for over one-and-a-half weeks .
a second hostage died during captivity .
his body is currently being examined ; results of the autopsy are expected at the end of the week .
in addition , a german national has been in the hands of captors in iraq since feb .
6 . germany does n't want to become a pawn the government does n't officially confirm paying ransom for kidnapped nationals .
yet negotiations behind the scenes and ransom payments are alleged to take place . the foreign affairs spokesman for the spd parliamentary group , gert weisskirchen , said that all possibilities had to be exhausted in order to save human lives .
but germany could not be blackmailed and he was not in favor of ransom payments , he said . " if this barrier were broken , we would become a pawn for anyone anywhere in the world who comes up with the idea to kidnap german nationals and already the money flows , " weisskirchen told german radio rbb .
" this ca n't be the response of the federal government . " the daily süddeutsche zeitung quoted a high-ranking government security expert on whether germany should take a tougher line against kidnappers in view of the series of kidnappings of germans in the middle east and afghanistan .
" we have to consider whether we can take the responsibility for paying ransom for a hostage - money which is then used to buy weapons to kill our soldiers in afghanistan , " the expert told the paper . " germany can not be blackmailed . " the german government , meanwhile , has said it will continue its tough stance . " our position is unchanged : germany can not be blackmailed , " deputy spokesman thomas steg said in berlin on monday .
at the same time , the government was doing " everything humanly possible and everything justifiable " to protect the lives of the victims . yet the protection of national interests also had to be taken into consideration , he said . article based on news reports -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

analysts are happy now , but worried for the future .
despite a slight rise in the ranks of unemployed in july , by 28,000 to 3.7 million , germany 's job market has shown significant improvements in an inter-eu comparison . the number of unemployed people in germany rose slightly in july from the month earlier , by 28,000 jobless , to 3.7 million , according to the federal employment agency in nuremberg .
the 0.1 percent rise in unemployment - to 8.9 percent of the work force from 8.8 percent - was smaller than in the previous year , showing the strength of the german economy , analysts said .
positive indicators the seasonally adjusted jobless figures , considered a more important indication of the state of the economy , were actually down 45,000 from june .
seasonal adjustment takes into account the number of school-leavers and job-trainees taking an expected break for the summer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : employment agency 's wiese is delighted with ' positive changes ' the head of the employment agency , frank-jürgen weise , was content .
" the three most important indicators - unemployment , jobs subject to social security and vacant jobs - have all shown positive changes , " he said .
unemployment in germany tipped over the five-million mark in 2006 but dropped below four million this year .
but analysts warned however that despite another set of impressive figures , the german labour market appeared to be running out of steam .
losing momentum ?
sylvain broyer of ixis-cib said he believed the unemployment rate would bottom out next year to about 8.4 percent .
" the german labour market is losing momentum : vacancies now stagnate more or less after having rocketed up to 80 percent year on year in the past years , and regular employment , i.e. employment subject to social security , barely rises above two percent year on year . "
according to european statistics agency eurostat , their calculation of german unemployment figures for june , at 6.4 percent , were 0.5 percent below the eu average of 6.9 percent .
this was a solid improvement from a year earlier , when german unemployment was at 8.3 percent , and well above the then-eu average of 7.9 percent .
eu improves overall germany , known as the economic motor of the eu , was not the only country to see improvement .
eurostat said 22 of the 27 member states managed to reduce unemployment for the year .
the largest drops were in poland -lrb- down to 10.2 percent from 13.9 percent , -rrb- and sweden -lrb- down to 5.3 percent , from 7.2 percent . -rrb-
lowest unemployment was seen in the netherlands , denmark , cyprus and ireland , with values between 3.3 and 4 percent . article based on news reports -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

analysts are happy now , but worried for the future .
despite a slight rise in the ranks of unemployed in july , by 28,000 to 3.7 million , germany 's job market has shown significant improvements in an inter-eu comparison . the number of unemployed people in germany rose slightly in july from the month earlier , by 28,000 jobless , to 3.7 million , according to the federal employment agency in nuremberg .
the 0.1 percent rise in unemployment - to 8.9 percent of the work force from 8.8 percent - was smaller than in the previous year , showing the strength of the german economy , analysts said .
positive indicators the seasonally adjusted jobless figures , considered a more important indication of the state of the economy , were actually down 45,000 from june .
seasonal adjustment takes into account the number of school-leavers and job-trainees taking an expected break for the summer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : employment agency 's wiese is delighted with ' positive changes ' the head of the employment agency , frank-jürgen weise , was content .
" the three most important indicators - unemployment , jobs subject to social security and vacant jobs - have all shown positive changes , " he said .
unemployment in germany tipped over the five-million mark in 2006 but dropped below four million this year .
but analysts warned however that despite another set of impressive figures , the german labour market appeared to be running out of steam .
losing momentum ?
sylvain broyer of ixis-cib said he believed the unemployment rate would bottom out next year to about 8.4 percent .
" the german labour market is losing momentum : vacancies now stagnate more or less after having rocketed up to 80 percent year on year in the past years , and regular employment , i.e. employment subject to social security , barely rises above two percent year on year . "
according to european statistics agency eurostat , their calculation of german unemployment figures for june , at 6.4 percent , were 0.5 percent below the eu average of 6.9 percent .
this was a solid improvement from a year earlier , when german unemployment was at 8.3 percent , and well above the then-eu average of 7.9 percent .
eu improves overall germany , known as the economic motor of the eu , was not the only country to see improvement .
eurostat said 22 of the 27 member states managed to reduce unemployment for the year .
the largest drops were in poland -lrb- down to 10.2 percent from 13.9 percent , -rrb- and sweden -lrb- down to 5.3 percent , from 7.2 percent . -rrb-
lowest unemployment was seen in the netherlands , denmark , cyprus and ireland , with values between 3.3 and 4 percent . article based on news reports -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the berlin government says it is doing its utmost to free the german engineer being held hostage in afghanistan .
but it continues to stress that it will not allow itself to be blackmailed into paying ransom money . a growing debate has arisen in germany on how the country should deal with freeing kidnapped nationals .
the interior affairs expert for the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- dieter wiefelspütz said there should n't be a sole strategy for handling kidnappings . " the government is well-advised to make such decisions based on each individual case , " wiefelspütz told the german daily frankfurter rundschau in its tuesday edition .
he said germany had so far dealt with kidnappings satisfactorily . " i do n't see that there has been any careless action taken here , " wiefelspütz said .
monday night afghan police found the body of a second south korean who had been killed by the taliban in ghasni province .

" if this barrier were broken , we would become a pawn for anyone anywhere in the world who comes up with the idea to kidnap german nationals and already the money flows , " weisskirchen told german radio rbb .
" this ca n't be the response of the federal government . " the daily süddeutsche zeitung quoted a high-ranking government security expert on whether germany should take a tougher line against kidnappers in view of the series of kidnappings of germans in the middle east and afghanistan .

in an interview tuesday with news agency reuters , voigt said he was skeptical the deal would serve to rein in iran 's power .
supplying more weapons to the region will not bring peace there , he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karsten voigt minced no words in his criticism of us plans " the region is not suffering from a lack of arms but from a lack of stability , " voigt said .
" i have strong doubts whether stability could be achieved with these weapons . "
bolstering democracy with weapons ?
an official for the us defense department said over the weekend that washington planned to give some $ 20 billion in military assistance to saudi arabia and other states in the persian gulf region to modernize their armed forces and limit iran 's influence .
the aid to saudi arabia is meant to upgrade its missile defenses and boost its navy . israel would receive $ 30.4 billion in military aid over the next decade - a significant increase to what the country received before .
us officials say the aid is meant to send a signal to its gulf allies that washington is committed to the region and will stand by them amid concerns about the war in iraq and iran 's growing clout .
voigt however said the plans ran contrary to the us desire to nurture and bolster democracy in the region .
" the us said a couple of months ago the main problem in the region was the lack of democracy , " he said .
" i do not know how one can support democracy by supplying weapons for saudi arabia , which is anything but a very democratic country . "

analysts are happy now , but worried for the future .
despite a slight rise in the ranks of unemployed in july , by 28,000 to 3.7 million , germany 's job market has shown significant improvements in an inter-eu comparison . the number of unemployed people in germany rose slightly in july from the month earlier , by 28,000 jobless , to 3.7 million , according to the federal employment agency in nuremberg .
the 0.1 percent rise in unemployment - to 8.9 percent of the work force from 8.8 percent - was smaller than in the previous year , showing the strength of the german economy , analysts said .
positive indicators the seasonally adjusted jobless figures , considered a more important indication of the state of the economy , were actually down 45,000 from june .
seasonal adjustment takes into account the number of school-leavers and job-trainees taking an expected break for the summer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : employment agency 's wiese is delighted with ' positive changes ' the head of the employment agency , frank-jürgen weise , was content .
" the three most important indicators - unemployment , jobs subject to social security and vacant jobs - have all shown positive changes , " he said .
unemployment in germany tipped over the five-million mark in 2006 but dropped below four million this year .
but analysts warned however that despite another set of impressive figures , the german labour market appeared to be running out of steam .
losing momentum ?
sylvain broyer of ixis-cib said he believed the unemployment rate would bottom out next year to about 8.4 percent .
" the german labour market is losing momentum : vacancies now stagnate more or less after having rocketed up to 80 percent year on year in the past years , and regular employment , i.e. employment subject to social security , barely rises above two percent year on year . "
according to european statistics agency eurostat , their calculation of german unemployment figures for june , at 6.4 percent , were 0.5 percent below the eu average of 6.9 percent .
this was a solid improvement from a year earlier , when german unemployment was at 8.3 percent , and well above the then-eu average of 7.9 percent .
eu improves overall germany , known as the economic motor of the eu , was not the only country to see improvement .
eurostat said 22 of the 27 member states managed to reduce unemployment for the year .
the largest drops were in poland -lrb- down to 10.2 percent from 13.9 percent , -rrb- and sweden -lrb- down to 5.3 percent , from 7.2 percent . -rrb-
lowest unemployment was seen in the netherlands , denmark , cyprus and ireland , with values between 3.3 and 4 percent . article based on news reports -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

currently , the isaf mission there enjoys broad support , but two other engagements seem likely to face resistance . german politicians said they would first decide whether to send more troops to afghanistan after discussing the matter with the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- there and nato partners , and once the army has determined whether or not it has the capacity to expand .
senior politicians from germany 's two main parties have come out solidly behind the training and reconstruction role played by the 3,000 german isaf troops in northern afghanistan , ahead of a parliamentary decision on renewing their mandate this autumn .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cdu 's kauder says he is prepared to boost troops but support for two other german missions to afghanistan - elite troops are deployed to the us-led operation enduring freedom -lrb- oef -rrb- and reconnaissance aircraft are assisting combat operations in the south - is wavering .
volker kauder , who heads the parliamentary caucus backing christian democratic chancellor angela merkel , says he is prepared to consider sending more troops to buttress the isaf mission led by nato .
pullout is unlikely " if the government considers it necessary to augment the german contingent , then that is right in my view , " said kauder .
" the -lsb- social democrats -rsb- will certainly hold intense discussions .
but i do n't expect much opposition , " kauder said .
and as long as the taliban has n't been conquered , there is no question of a pullout , he said .
" that would lead to a dramatic increase in the danger of terrorism in europe , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spd leader beck has taken a keen interest in afghanistan he was speaking after kurt beck , chairman of the social democrats , who recently paid a visit to afghanistan and has taken a keen interest in afghan affairs , said he backed sending more troops .
the aim was to stabilize the afghan government by creating effective security , beck said .
" and then we have to discuss the question whether we should dispatch more troops and police officers . "
before she left last week on her summer vacation , chancellor merkel made her commitment clear .
" germany 's engagement in afghanistan must continue .
we need all three components to be extended , " the chancellor said .

in an interview tuesday with news agency reuters , voigt said he was skeptical the deal would serve to rein in iran 's power .
supplying more weapons to the region will not bring peace there , he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karsten voigt minced no words in his criticism of us plans " the region is not suffering from a lack of arms but from a lack of stability , " voigt said .
" i have strong doubts whether stability could be achieved with these weapons . "
bolstering democracy with weapons ?
an official for the us defense department said over the weekend that washington planned to give some $ 20 billion in military assistance to saudi arabia and other states in the persian gulf region to modernize their armed forces and limit iran 's influence .
the aid to saudi arabia is meant to upgrade its missile defenses and boost its navy . israel would receive $ 30.4 billion in military aid over the next decade - a significant increase to what the country received before .
us officials say the aid is meant to send a signal to its gulf allies that washington is committed to the region and will stand by them amid concerns about the war in iraq and iran 's growing clout .
voigt however said the plans ran contrary to the us desire to nurture and bolster democracy in the region .
" the us said a couple of months ago the main problem in the region was the lack of democracy , " he said .
" i do not know how one can support democracy by supplying weapons for saudi arabia , which is anything but a very democratic country . "
rice defends controversial plan on tuesday , us secretary of state condoleeza rice defended the plan , saying the us wanted to guarantee the security of their long-time allies in the middle east .
rice , who is on a tour of the middle east along with defense secretary robert gates , said in egypt the aid was not aimed at shifting the military balance in the region or kicking off a new arms race .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice defended the plans in egypt as she tours the middle east " we are determined to maintain the balances - the military and strategic balances - within the region that we have been committed to as well , " she said .
rice also rejected allegations , the gulf states would help the us in its war against terror in iraq in return for the arms supplies .
she stressed that washington was fighting extremism along with its allies in the gulf region .
they have a common interest in a stable and united iraq , she added .
germany critical of deal but news of the arms deal has sparked strong criticism in germany with several leading politicians echoing voigt 's doubts .
ruprecht polenz , the head of parliament 's foreign affairs committee and member of chancellor angela merkel 's conservative party , said the move threatened to destabilize what is already a volatile region .
" if you add more explosive things to a powder keg - and that 's what the middle east is - you heighten the risk and do n't make the region safer in the end , " polenz told frankfurter rundschau newspaper on monday .
the proposed military aid still has to be approved by the us congress .
there is expected to be opposition from some lawmakers , particularly to aid for to saudi arabia , which some accuse of not being helpful to the us-backed government in iraq . article based on news reports -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the recordings were made between october 1975 and may 1976 during the trial against notorious members of the first raf generation , andreas baader , ulrike meinhof , gudrun ensslin and jan-carl raspe .
it involves 21 tapes with some 12 hours of recordings from the courtroom in the high security stammheim prison near stuttgart .
the tapes were initially supposed to be erased after they were transcribed , but were forgotten . the raf , also known as the baader-meinhof gang , conducted a reign of teror in germany in the 1970s- and 80s for kidnapping and killing prominent establishment figures in the name of class struggle and left-wing idealism .
the group was most active in 1977 , when it was responsible for a spate of murders including german federal prosecutor siegfried buback and jürgen ponto , chief executive of dresdner bank ag . baader criticizes prison conditions the recordings include ensslin stating that the raf was responsible for attacks on the cia headquarters as well as the fifth us division in frankfurt , and the us headquarters in heidelberg . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the defendants were sentenced to life in prison " what embodies the policies of the raf is the obligation to resistance in the federal republic of germany , " ensslin said in the recording .
a responsibility towards imperialistic policies could only be met with resistance , she said . baader talked about suffering under solitary confinement .
he criticized that the prisoners were not allowed to walk in the prison yard during the three days of trial per week , although this had been promised .
baader said the accused were forced to spend several hours per day in soundproof and windowless solitary cells . the tapes also include meinhof 's last testimony prior to her suicide in may 1976 . " it is , of course , a police tactic in counter-insurgency conflicts , in guerilla warfare , to take out the leaders , " meinhof , a journalist-turned-terrorist says on the tape . film to air in september the group unleashed a wave of terror across the country in the 1970s and 1980s , which climaxed in the so-called " german autumn " of 1977 .
it ended with the suicides of the raf 's core leadership and the brutal kidnapping and murder of the president of the german employers ' association , hanns martin schleyer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baader and his girlfriend ensslin had already been convicted of a bombing in 1968 according to gemran state network ndr , which is co-producing the documentary film , the authors came across parts of the tapes in secondary rooms at the higher regional court in stuttgart during their research . lengthy negotiations between the authors stefan aust und helmar büchel and the court , as well as the federal prosecutor in karlsruhe followed .
the prosecutor initially wanted the documents destroyed .
but copies of the tapes were then handed over to the journalists via the public records office in ludwigsburg . the raf film by aust and büchel will air on german public television in september . article based on news reports -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

academics from northern ireland 's oldest university , queen 's university in belfast , are also involved .
mr williams added : " the two new characters are being designed for us and we will be creating the puppet characters to help children to find answers to the questions that they have . "

more than 60 members of ivor rees ' family will gather in his home town llanelli to see a plaque unveiled .
sgt rees , 26 , risked his life to lead the capture of a machine gun at ypres in belgium in world war i , an act which it is said saved many allied lives .
his son and daughter are among those paying tribute .
sgt rees later became a council official and died in 1967 .
the vc was awarded for the " most conspicuous bravery in attack " on 31 july , 1917 , while serving with south wales borderers during the third battle of ypres , known as passchendaele .
his platoon dealt with a machine gun at close range , which had been causing " many casualties " .
sgt rees edged forward gradually to try to reach it , leading around 20 of his men .
sgt rees ' victoria cross is held at the regimental museum at brecon the citation reads : " when he was about 20 yards from the machine gun he rushed forward towards the team , shot one and bayoneted another .
" he then bombed the large concrete emplacement killing five and capturing 30 prisoners ... in addition to an undamaged gun . "
lt col david mathias , of the royal naval association in llanelli , which is helping to organise the tribute at the town hall , said it was hard to estimate how many allied lives he saved by his actions .
" i grew up a couple of streets away from him and we had rees the baker , rees the postman and rees the vc , " he said .
" my grandfather took me to meet him once when i was a boy and he was a genial gentleman . "
passchendaele was fought in the wet season in 1917 ivor rees had joined up as a steelworker in 1914 but was quickly promoted to sergeant .
after the war , he was unemployed for a couple of years back home in llanelli before starting work with the council , where he rose through the ranks to a head of department .
during world war ii , he served with the home guard .
" what we 're remembering is n't what he was before the war or after the war but what he did during the war - he was a ferociously good soldier , " said lt col mathias .
major martin everett , curator of the royal welsh 's regimental museum in brecon , where the medal is now held , said he had met sgt rees before his death in 1967 .
he remained a modest man , carrying with him the memories of comrades lost .
" when you read the story of passchendaele , the battle bogged down in all that mud , you ca n't quite believe what those lads went through , " said maj everett .

more than 60 members of ivor rees ' family will gather in his home town llanelli to see a plaque unveiled .
sgt rees , 26 , risked his life to lead the capture of a machine gun at ypres in belgium in world war i , an act which it is said saved many allied lives .
his son and daughter are among those paying tribute .
sgt rees later became a council official and died in 1967 .
the vc was awarded for the " most conspicuous bravery in attack " on 31 july , 1917 , while serving with south wales borderers during the third battle of ypres , known as passchendaele .
his platoon dealt with a machine gun at close range , which had been causing " many casualties " .
sgt rees edged forward gradually to try to reach it , leading around 20 of his men .
sgt rees ' victoria cross is held at the regimental museum at brecon the citation reads : " when he was about 20 yards from the machine gun he rushed forward towards the team , shot one and bayoneted another .
" he then bombed the large concrete emplacement killing five and capturing 30 prisoners ... in addition to an undamaged gun . "
lt col david mathias , of the royal naval association in llanelli , which is helping to organise the tribute at the town hall , said it was hard to estimate how many allied lives he saved by his actions .
" i grew up a couple of streets away from him and we had rees the baker , rees the postman and rees the vc , " he said .
" my grandfather took me to meet him once when i was a boy and he was a genial gentleman . "
passchendaele was fought in the wet season in 1917 ivor rees had joined up as a steelworker in 1914 but was quickly promoted to sergeant .
after the war , he was unemployed for a couple of years back home in llanelli before starting work with the council , where he rose through the ranks to a head of department .
during world war ii , he served with the home guard .
" what we 're remembering is n't what he was before the war or after the war but what he did during the war - he was a ferociously good soldier , " said lt col mathias .
major martin everett , curator of the royal welsh 's regimental museum in brecon , where the medal is now held , said he had met sgt rees before his death in 1967 .
he remained a modest man , carrying with him the memories of comrades lost .
" when you read the story of passchendaele , the battle bogged down in all that mud , you ca n't quite believe what those lads went through , " said maj everett .

the imperial college london-led team looked at death rates between 1982 and 1998 , comparing them to exposure to black smoke and sulphur dioxide .
although air pollution had fallen over the decades , the risk of an early death remained , the study of 5,000 uk people in the thorax journal found .
experts suggested that pollution may be becoming more toxic .
the researchers looked at death rates during four different time periods - 1982-86 , 1986-90 , 1990-94 and 1994-98 .
the findings point to continuing public health risks even at the relatively low levels of black smoke and sulphur dioxide that now occur professor paul elliott , lead researcher they also looked at the exposure to air pollutants by analysing national air quality registers in the 16 years prior to these periods .
they found the levels of black smoke - unburned carbon from traffic and industrial processes - were five times lower for the most recent time period compared to the first one .
sulphur dioxide was four times lower , the study found .
but the researchers said the risk of death remained fairly constant .
during the four time periods , the increased risk of death for those living in areas with higher levels of pollution than average hovered at or below 10 % for both pollutants .
figures and the risk of early death from respiratory disease actually increased from below 10 % in the first time period to 19 % for black smoke , and from just above 10 % to over 20 % for sulphur dioxide .
the figures held true even after adjusting for factors known to increase the chances of an early death , such as social deprivation .
lead researcher professor paul elliott said : " the findings point to continuing public health risks even at the relatively low levels of black smoke and sulphur dioxide that now occur .
" it is not clear why the risk of early death remains , it could be because the cause of the pollution has changed and it is becoming more toxic . "
dr richard russell , of the british thoracic society , added : " this is a very interesting paper .
there are a number of possible explanations for what is reported .
" there is evidence to suggest the nature of the pollution has changed so that despite levels declining it is more harmful .
" it may also be related to our reaction to the pollution , perhaps over the last 40 years we have become more susceptible .
" there may also be another factor that we simply do n't know about .
what we need is more research in this area . "

the imperial college london-led team looked at death rates between 1982 and 1998 , comparing them to exposure to black smoke and sulphur dioxide .
although air pollution had fallen over the decades , the risk of an early death remained , the study of 5,000 uk people in the thorax journal found .
experts suggested that pollution may be becoming more toxic .
the researchers looked at death rates during four different time periods - 1982-86 , 1986-90 , 1990-94 and 1994-98 .
the findings point to continuing public health risks even at the relatively low levels of black smoke and sulphur dioxide that now occur professor paul elliott , lead researcher they also looked at the exposure to air pollutants by analysing national air quality registers in the 16 years prior to these periods .
they found the levels of black smoke - unburned carbon from traffic and industrial processes - were five times lower for the most recent time period compared to the first one .
sulphur dioxide was four times lower , the study found .
but the researchers said the risk of death remained fairly constant .
during the four time periods , the increased risk of death for those living in areas with higher levels of pollution than average hovered at or below 10 % for both pollutants .
figures and the risk of early death from respiratory disease actually increased from below 10 % in the first time period to 19 % for black smoke , and from just above 10 % to over 20 % for sulphur dioxide .
the figures held true even after adjusting for factors known to increase the chances of an early death , such as social deprivation .
lead researcher professor paul elliott said : " the findings point to continuing public health risks even at the relatively low levels of black smoke and sulphur dioxide that now occur .
" it is not clear why the risk of early death remains , it could be because the cause of the pollution has changed and it is becoming more toxic . "
dr richard russell , of the british thoracic society , added : " this is a very interesting paper .
there are a number of possible explanations for what is reported .
" there is evidence to suggest the nature of the pollution has changed so that despite levels declining it is more harmful .
" it may also be related to our reaction to the pollution , perhaps over the last 40 years we have become more susceptible .
" there may also be another factor that we simply do n't know about .
what we need is more research in this area . "

the research , published in the journal thorax , found cannabis damaged the large airways in the lungs causing symptoms such as coughing and wheezing .
it also damaged the ability of the lungs to get oxygen to , and remove waste products from tissues .
experts say the study confirms that the drug represents a serious health risk .
this research confirms that cannabis poses a serious health risk to the lungs , and smoking a joint can be more harmful to the lungs than smoking a cigarette dr keith prowse british lung foundation in the study researchers from the medical research institute of new zealand , wakefield hospital and the wellington school of medicine and health sciences , studied 339 volunteers .
they took ct scans of their lungs and tested their lung function through breathing tests to assess their lung damage .
participants were divided into four groups - cannabis smokers , combined cannabis and tobacco smokers , tobacco smokers , and non-smokers , and gave them a questionnaire on their smoking habits .
cannabis smokers were included if they had smoked at least one joint per day for at least five years , while tobacco smokers had to have smoked 20 cigarettes per day for one year .
one joint could cause as much damage as up to five cigarettes cannabis smokers reported symptoms such as wheezing , coughing , chest tightness and excessive phlegm production .
the drug also reduced the numbers of small , fine airways that transport oxygen and waste products to and from blood vessels in the lungs .
and it damaged the function of the large airways of the lungs , obstructing air flow and forcing the lungs to work harder , so contributing to symptoms such as coughing , and the development of bronchitis .
the extent of this large airway damage was directly related to the number of joints smoked - the more joints smoked , the more damage was seen .
however , in this study , people who smoked only cannabis were not found to suffer from emphysema , a serious and crippling lung disease which was previously thought to be linked to the drug .
impact the authors said : " the most important finding was that one joint of cannabis was similar to 2.5 to five tobacco cigarettes in terms of causing airflow obstruction .
they said the impact of cannabis was likely to be due to the way in which cannabis joints are smoked - joints do not usually have filters , and they reach higher temperatures with users inhaling more deeply and holding their breath for longer than cigarette smokers .
the british lung foundation welcomed the research , and dr keith prowse , chairman of the foundation said : " this research confirms that cannabis poses a serious health risk to the lungs , and smoking a joint can be more harmful to the lungs than smoking a cigarette .
" it 's important to remember , though , that tobacco continues to be more harmful overall because it is typically smoked in much higher quantities than cannabis . "
the warnings come after recent research suggested cannabis smokers were 40 % more likely than non-users to suffer psychotic illnesses such as schizophrenia .
danny kushlick , of the campaign group transform drug policy foundation , said the finding that smoking cannabis did not cause emphysema suggested it was wrong to characterise the drug as more harmful than tobacco .
he said : " the relative dangers of smoking dope are far less of a public health problem than those associated with the use alcohol and tobacco . "
he also stressed that making the drug illegal did nothing to reduce any dangers that might be associated with it .
in fact , he argued that its illegal status led to a lack of quality control .

the research , published in the journal thorax , found cannabis damaged the large airways in the lungs causing symptoms such as coughing and wheezing .
it also damaged the ability of the lungs to get oxygen to , and remove waste products from tissues .
experts say the study confirms that the drug represents a serious health risk .
this research confirms that cannabis poses a serious health risk to the lungs , and smoking a joint can be more harmful to the lungs than smoking a cigarette dr keith prowse british lung foundation in the study researchers from the medical research institute of new zealand , wakefield hospital and the wellington school of medicine and health sciences , studied 339 volunteers .
they took ct scans of their lungs and tested their lung function through breathing tests to assess their lung damage .
participants were divided into four groups - cannabis smokers , combined cannabis and tobacco smokers , tobacco smokers , and non-smokers , and gave them a questionnaire on their smoking habits .
cannabis smokers were included if they had smoked at least one joint per day for at least five years , while tobacco smokers had to have smoked 20 cigarettes per day for one year .
one joint could cause as much damage as up to five cigarettes cannabis smokers reported symptoms such as wheezing , coughing , chest tightness and excessive phlegm production .
the drug also reduced the numbers of small , fine airways that transport oxygen and waste products to and from blood vessels in the lungs .
and it damaged the function of the large airways of the lungs , obstructing air flow and forcing the lungs to work harder , so contributing to symptoms such as coughing , and the development of bronchitis .
the extent of this large airway damage was directly related to the number of joints smoked - the more joints smoked , the more damage was seen .
however , in this study , people who smoked only cannabis were not found to suffer from emphysema , a serious and crippling lung disease which was previously thought to be linked to the drug .
impact the authors said : " the most important finding was that one joint of cannabis was similar to 2.5 to five tobacco cigarettes in terms of causing airflow obstruction .
they said the impact of cannabis was likely to be due to the way in which cannabis joints are smoked - joints do not usually have filters , and they reach higher temperatures with users inhaling more deeply and holding their breath for longer than cigarette smokers .
the british lung foundation welcomed the research , and dr keith prowse , chairman of the foundation said : " this research confirms that cannabis poses a serious health risk to the lungs , and smoking a joint can be more harmful to the lungs than smoking a cigarette .
" it 's important to remember , though , that tobacco continues to be more harmful overall because it is typically smoked in much higher quantities than cannabis . "
the warnings come after recent research suggested cannabis smokers were 40 % more likely than non-users to suffer psychotic illnesses such as schizophrenia .
danny kushlick , of the campaign group transform drug policy foundation , said the finding that smoking cannabis did not cause emphysema suggested it was wrong to characterise the drug as more harmful than tobacco .
he said : " the relative dangers of smoking dope are far less of a public health problem than those associated with the use alcohol and tobacco . "
he also stressed that making the drug illegal did nothing to reduce any dangers that might be associated with it .
in fact , he argued that its illegal status led to a lack of quality control .

the 48-year-old actor , son of the late actor-politician sunil dutt and actress nargis , has been found guilty of involvement in a series of bombings in mumbai -lrb- bombay -rrb- , which killed 257 people and wounded 713 .
dutt was convicted of possessing arms and ammunition in his upmarket mumbai residence that were allegedly part of the main consignment used in the blasts .
but he was cleared of all conspiracy charges related to the blasts .
he was arrested in april 1993 , a month after the blasts , and spent 18 months in prison before he was released on bail .
he has now been sentenced to six years in jail , although he can appeal .
despite an early drug addiction in college -lrb- " that was it for nine years of my life , " he once told an interviewer -rrb- and his time in prison , dutt has gone on to star in more than 100 bollywood films , making a name in action-packed gangland films and lately revealing a yen for comedy .
recently dutt has been basking in the limelight with his latest release lage raho munnabhai , a light comedy where he plays a brawny , bumbling soft-hearted gangster who resorts to gandhian non-violence to fix problems and win over a girl .
gawky dutt made his debut in 1981 as a gawky 22-year-old in a typical bollywood revenge film of its times , rocky , directed by his father , who later became a federal sports minister with india 's ruling congress party .
the film did modestly and marked the arrival of dutt as another star son in an industry where producer-director parents routinely launch their children as lead actors .
his mother nargis , a luminous beauty and a star actress of her generation , died of cancer in the same year he debuted .
dutt has shown a yen for comedy over the years , sanjay dutt has had a chequered career with a mixed bag of films , mostly revelling in the role of a macho , gangland don , sometimes with a soft heart .
one of his most popular films called khalnayak -lrb- the villain -rrb- ironically coincided with his arrest in the mumbai blast case and became a huge hit .
in the past few years , dutt has won himself a fan following with a curious combination of gangster and bumbling comic roles .
he even set up a production company with director sanjay gupta to star and make a number of films - one of them , kaante , a watered-down bollywood version of quentin tarantino 's reservoir dogs , became a minor cult film .
controversy continued to dog dutt 's rising fortunes in bollywood when an audiotape surfaced in the media in 2001 where the star was allegedly in conversation with an underworld figure , chotta shakeel , based in pakistan .
nothing much transpired from this alleged phone conversation where among other things , dutt allegedly complained about a fellow star , govinda , who usually " came late to the sets " .
" i do n't remember of any phase in my life where there have been no problems , " dutt told interviewer simi garewal last year .
garewal asked the twice-married star whether it was " strange fate that makes you go through one ordeal after the other " .
" maybe i am the chosen one , " he replied .
