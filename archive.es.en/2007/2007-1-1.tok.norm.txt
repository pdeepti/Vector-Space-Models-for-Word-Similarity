" only a united europe can tackle the challenges of globalization including international trade but also violence , terror and war , " she said . " a divided europe is doomed to failure . " germany wants to restart mideast peace process bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany will renew efforts to find a solution to mideast troubles merkel and foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier have called for a january meeting to " revitalize " the middle east quartet - grouping the eu , the united states , the united nations and russia - to help kick start peace efforts between israel and the palestinians . the chancellor will meet us president george w. bush in washington next week amid grumbling in europe that the united states has let the peace process languish as iraq has consumed its attention . steinmeier has said the aim is for the quartet to exercise a " stabilizing " influence in the region and encourage preliminary talks between israeli prime minister ehud olmert and palestinian president mahmud abbas to continue . breathing new life into dead eu treaty the most pressing item for europe , meanwhile , is the stalled constitution , especially with the jan .
1 entry of romania and bulgaria boosting the number of member states to 27 . merkel has cautioned against overly high expectations when germany takes over the eu brief from finland , saying that half a year may not be sufficient to resurrect a treaty that has been in the deep freeze for more than 18 months . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " no to the constitution " - french voters dealt a blow to the treaty it was precisely because of the rapid enlargement of the bloc in 2004 that the 200-page constitution was drawn up in a bid to streamline decision-making and give the eu a stronger international voice .
its highly damaging rejection last year by voters in france and the netherlands - two founding members of the eu - has overshadowed the fact that 18 countries have ratified it . germany has promised to present a " roadmap " of how to get the constitution back on track .
" our goal is to present a specific plan by the end of our presidency in which the timetable and the contours of a solution are laid out , " steinmeier told saturday 's bild newspaper . energy security and climate protection under both presidencies , energy security and climate protection will loom large . the eu wants to forge a common position for negotiations on the successor to the kyoto protocol which runs out in 2012 .
germany would like the bloc to commit to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 30 percent by 2020 . merkel believes europe would be strengthened if it negotiated with one voice with major suppliers such as russia and diversified . " europe must reduce its dependence in order to secure its long-term energy supply , " she wrote in friday 's handelsblatt newspaper .
" it must also speak with one voice on foreign energy relations . " beyond energy , checking the destabilizing influence of highly speculative hedge funds and removing obstacles to faster economic growth in africa will top the agenda when germany takes the helm of the g8 from russia . the highlight of the g8 presidency will be the june summit in the baltic resort heiligendamm , attended by the leaders of britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan , russia and the united states . seeking fairer growth distribution " the goal will be to identify imbalances and to determine what can be done to ensure more balanced global growth , " said bernd pfaffenbach , an aide to merkel , adding that promoting " global prosperity " will be theme of the meeting . the imbalances plaguing world economic momentum are already well-known : the us trade and current account deficits , the massive foreign exchange reserves held by the china , constraints on growth in europe and obstacles to faster economic gains in africa . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany at the helm of the g8 will push for more efforts to tackle africa 's problems merkel wants to forge a privileged partnership between the g8 and those african governments that are committed to corruption-free administration and to strengthening democratic reform . on financial markets , germany will press for greater transparency and political monitoring of speculative hedge funds , which are seen by berlin - and increasingly by some of its partners - as a destabilizing element in global finance . germany now has the backing of the united states , which for years had been reluctant to go along with vigorous market supervision .
but pfaffenbach acknowledged that merkel will probably have to be content with simply " a final declaration that calls for greater transparency . " germany is also expected to push for a more rational use of energy resources and hopes to spark discussion on a follow-up to the kyoto protocol on reducing greenhouse gas emissions , which expires in 2012 . berlin in addition wants to include mexico , india , china , brazil and south africa , countries that are not members of the g8 , in the climate talks . the fate of the doha round of multilateral trade liberalization negotiations , currently deadlocked , is likely to hover over the g8 next year .
but germany , apart from general statements citing the need to complete the doha process , has so far steered clear from any deeper involvement . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german global clout grows as berlin heads eu , g8 germany 's growing economic , political and military role will be spotlighted in 2007 when berlin holds the rotating presidencies of both the european union and the g8 club of industrial nations .

" the belarussian side , in a difficult atmosphere on the eve of the new year , signed an agreement on unfortunate terms , " belarus ' prime minister sergei sidorsky told journalists in moscow . as part of the deal belarus has agreed to sell 50 percent of its strategically important gas pipeline operator beltransgaz to russian gas monopoly gazprom - a move earlier resisted by the belarussian government - the russian company said in a statement . under the deal , belarus will pay 100 dollars for 1,000 cubic meters of gas in 2007 , just below the 105 dollars earlier demanded by russia , but far higher than the 45 dollars charged under the previous contract , gazprom said . market price over the five years covered by the contract , the price of gas will climb annually to reach the " market price " charged to western european customers , the statement said . most of gazprom 's eu customers pay over 200 dollars per 1,000 cubic meters of russian gas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belarus ' prime minister sidorsky , left , and gazprom chief miller at a monday news conference in moscow " gazprom is undertaking a move to market principles of cooperation with all of the countries who buy russian gas without exception , " the statement quoted gazprom ceo alexei miller as saying . speaking to journalists alongside the belarussian prime minister , miller said the deal was signed at 11:58 pm -lrb- 20:58 gmt -rrb- on new year 's eve after months of tense negotiations , adding that belarus had been offered " the best conditions . " he said that russia would pay 2.5 billion dollars for a 50 percent stake in beltransgaz over the next four years . the transit price for russian gas supplies across belarus would be increased to $ 1.45 for 1,000 cubic meters traveling 100 kilometers , from 0.75 dollars at present , he said . disruptions avoided the last-minute deal came as russia was on the verge of cutting gas supplies to belarus , which could have disruptions to western europe . without an accord on a new five-year contract gazprom had warned that it would move towards cutting off supplies to belarus from 0700 gmt monday .
a cut in supplies like that suffered briefly by ukraine in a similar price dispute last january would have been a major blow to the country 's economy . there were also concerns in the european union that the row would impact on russian gas exports to western europe , 20 percent of which transit through belarus , meeting about five percent of eu natural gas needs . end of subsidies gazprom , a state-owned giant that produces a third of the world 's gas , has mounted a tough campaign to end soviet-era subsidies to neighboring countries , as well as expand ownership of infrastructure and other energy businesses throughout europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : before the deal was reached belarussians were preparing to heat with wood the company says it wants to put pricing on a market basis .
critics , including many in western europe , fear the kremlin seeks to use gazprom as a tool to reimpose part of its dominance lost at the time of the 1991 collapse of the soviet union . belarus , which lies sandwiched between russia and the european union , is in a loose economic and political partnership with russia and has always argued that gas import prices should be similar to those paid within russia . western governments gave strong diplomatic backing to ukraine 's pro-western president , viktor yushchenko , during the gas row at the start of 2006 , but belarus ' authoritarian leader lukashenko is a political pariah in europe and the united states . the eu has limited itself to calling on the two parties to reach a deal that does not threaten european supplies , while the authorities in france and germany say they are not worried by the prospect of shortages . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de russia belarus gas pricing row sparks jitters in europe russia and belarus are meeting to try and defuse a gas war that could threaten supplies to the eu .

" only a united europe can tackle the challenges of globalization including international trade but also violence , terror and war , " she said . " a divided europe is doomed to failure . " germany wants to restart mideast peace process bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany will renew efforts to find a solution to mideast troubles merkel and foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier have called for a january meeting to " revitalize " the middle east quartet - grouping the eu , the united states , the united nations and russia - to help kick start peace efforts between israel and the palestinians . the chancellor will meet us president george w. bush in washington next week amid grumbling in europe that the united states has let the peace process languish as iraq has consumed its attention . steinmeier has said the aim is for the quartet to exercise a " stabilizing " influence in the region and encourage preliminary talks between israeli prime minister ehud olmert and palestinian president mahmud abbas to continue . breathing new life into dead eu treaty the most pressing item for europe , meanwhile , is the stalled constitution , especially with the jan .
1 entry of romania and bulgaria boosting the number of member states to 27 . merkel has cautioned against overly high expectations when germany takes over the eu brief from finland , saying that half a year may not be sufficient to resurrect a treaty that has been in the deep freeze for more than 18 months . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " no to the constitution " - french voters dealt a blow to the treaty it was precisely because of the rapid enlargement of the bloc in 2004 that the 200-page constitution was drawn up in a bid to streamline decision-making and give the eu a stronger international voice .
its highly damaging rejection last year by voters in france and the netherlands - two founding members of the eu - has overshadowed the fact that 18 countries have ratified it . germany has promised to present a " roadmap " of how to get the constitution back on track .
" our goal is to present a specific plan by the end of our presidency in which the timetable and the contours of a solution are laid out , " steinmeier told saturday 's bild newspaper . energy security and climate protection under both presidencies , energy security and climate protection will loom large . the eu wants to forge a common position for negotiations on the successor to the kyoto protocol which runs out in 2012 .
germany would like the bloc to commit to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 30 percent by 2020 . merkel believes europe would be strengthened if it negotiated with one voice with major suppliers such as russia and diversified . " europe must reduce its dependence in order to secure its long-term energy supply , " she wrote in friday 's handelsblatt newspaper .
" it must also speak with one voice on foreign energy relations . " beyond energy , checking the destabilizing influence of highly speculative hedge funds and removing obstacles to faster economic growth in africa will top the agenda when germany takes the helm of the g8 from russia . the highlight of the g8 presidency will be the june summit in the baltic resort heiligendamm , attended by the leaders of britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan , russia and the united states . seeking fairer growth distribution " the goal will be to identify imbalances and to determine what can be done to ensure more balanced global growth , " said bernd pfaffenbach , an aide to merkel , adding that promoting " global prosperity " will be theme of the meeting . the imbalances plaguing world economic momentum are already well-known : the us trade and current account deficits , the massive foreign exchange reserves held by the china , constraints on growth in europe and obstacles to faster economic gains in africa . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany at the helm of the g8 will push for more efforts to tackle africa 's problems merkel wants to forge a privileged partnership between the g8 and those african governments that are committed to corruption-free administration and to strengthening democratic reform . on financial markets , germany will press for greater transparency and political monitoring of speculative hedge funds , which are seen by berlin - and increasingly by some of its partners - as a destabilizing element in global finance . germany now has the backing of the united states , which for years had been reluctant to go along with vigorous market supervision .
but pfaffenbach acknowledged that merkel will probably have to be content with simply " a final declaration that calls for greater transparency . " germany is also expected to push for a more rational use of energy resources and hopes to spark discussion on a follow-up to the kyoto protocol on reducing greenhouse gas emissions , which expires in 2012 . berlin in addition wants to include mexico , india , china , brazil and south africa , countries that are not members of the g8 , in the climate talks . the fate of the doha round of multilateral trade liberalization negotiations , currently deadlocked , is likely to hover over the g8 next year .

" the belarussian side , in a difficult atmosphere on the eve of the new year , signed an agreement on unfortunate terms , " belarus ' prime minister sergei sidorsky told journalists in moscow . as part of the deal belarus has agreed to sell 50 percent of its strategically important gas pipeline operator beltransgaz to russian gas monopoly gazprom - a move earlier resisted by the belarussian government - the russian company said in a statement . under the deal , belarus will pay 100 dollars for 1,000 cubic meters of gas in 2007 , just below the 105 dollars earlier demanded by russia , but far higher than the 45 dollars charged under the previous contract , gazprom said . market price over the five years covered by the contract , the price of gas will climb annually to reach the " market price " charged to western european customers , the statement said . most of gazprom 's eu customers pay over 200 dollars per 1,000 cubic meters of russian gas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belarus ' prime minister sidorsky , left , and gazprom chief miller at a monday news conference in moscow " gazprom is undertaking a move to market principles of cooperation with all of the countries who buy russian gas without exception , " the statement quoted gazprom ceo alexei miller as saying . speaking to journalists alongside the belarussian prime minister , miller said the deal was signed at 11:58 pm -lrb- 20:58 gmt -rrb- on new year 's eve after months of tense negotiations , adding that belarus had been offered " the best conditions .

" the belarussian side , in a difficult atmosphere on the eve of the new year , signed an agreement on unfortunate terms , " belarus ' prime minister sergei sidorsky told journalists in moscow . as part of the deal belarus has agreed to sell 50 percent of its strategically important gas pipeline operator beltransgaz to russian gas monopoly gazprom - a move earlier resisted by the belarussian government - the russian company said in a statement . under the deal , belarus will pay 100 dollars for 1,000 cubic meters of gas in 2007 , just below the 105 dollars earlier demanded by russia , but far higher than the 45 dollars charged under the previous contract , gazprom said . market price over the five years covered by the contract , the price of gas will climb annually to reach the " market price " charged to western european customers , the statement said . most of gazprom 's eu customers pay over 200 dollars per 1,000 cubic meters of russian gas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belarus ' prime minister sidorsky , left , and gazprom chief miller at a monday news conference in moscow " gazprom is undertaking a move to market principles of cooperation with all of the countries who buy russian gas without exception , " the statement quoted gazprom ceo alexei miller as saying . speaking to journalists alongside the belarussian prime minister , miller said the deal was signed at 11:58 pm -lrb- 20:58 gmt -rrb- on new year 's eve after months of tense negotiations , adding that belarus had been offered " the best conditions . " he said that russia would pay 2.5 billion dollars for a 50 percent stake in beltransgaz over the next four years . the transit price for russian gas supplies across belarus would be increased to $ 1.45 for 1,000 cubic meters traveling 100 kilometers , from 0.75 dollars at present , he said . disruptions avoided the last-minute deal came as russia was on the verge of cutting gas supplies to belarus , which could have disruptions to western europe . without an accord on a new five-year contract gazprom had warned that it would move towards cutting off supplies to belarus from 0700 gmt monday .
a cut in supplies like that suffered briefly by ukraine in a similar price dispute last january would have been a major blow to the country 's economy . there were also concerns in the european union that the row would impact on russian gas exports to western europe , 20 percent of which transit through belarus , meeting about five percent of eu natural gas needs . end of subsidies gazprom , a state-owned giant that produces a third of the world 's gas , has mounted a tough campaign to end soviet-era subsidies to neighboring countries , as well as expand ownership of infrastructure and other energy businesses throughout europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : before the deal was reached belarussians were preparing to heat with wood the company says it wants to put pricing on a market basis .
critics , including many in western europe , fear the kremlin seeks to use gazprom as a tool to reimpose part of its dominance lost at the time of the 1991 collapse of the soviet union . belarus , which lies sandwiched between russia and the european union , is in a loose economic and political partnership with russia and has always argued that gas import prices should be similar to those paid within russia . western governments gave strong diplomatic backing to ukraine 's pro-western president , viktor yushchenko , during the gas row at the start of 2006 , but belarus ' authoritarian leader lukashenko is a political pariah in europe and the united states . the eu has limited itself to calling on the two parties to reach a deal that does not threaten european supplies , while the authorities in france and germany say they are not worried by the prospect of shortages . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de russia belarus gas pricing row sparks jitters in europe russia and belarus are meeting to try and defuse a gas war that could threaten supplies to the eu .

" he said that russia would pay 2.5 billion dollars for a 50 percent stake in beltransgaz over the next four years . the transit price for russian gas supplies across belarus would be increased to $ 1.45 for 1,000 cubic meters traveling 100 kilometers , from 0.75 dollars at present , he said . disruptions avoided the last-minute deal came as russia was on the verge of cutting gas supplies to belarus , which could have disruptions to western europe . without an accord on a new five-year contract gazprom had warned that it would move towards cutting off supplies to belarus from 0700 gmt monday .
a cut in supplies like that suffered briefly by ukraine in a similar price dispute last january would have been a major blow to the country 's economy . there were also concerns in the european union that the row would impact on russian gas exports to western europe , 20 percent of which transit through belarus , meeting about five percent of eu natural gas needs . end of subsidies gazprom , a state-owned giant that produces a third of the world 's gas , has mounted a tough campaign to end soviet-era subsidies to neighboring countries , as well as expand ownership of infrastructure and other energy businesses throughout europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : before the deal was reached belarussians were preparing to heat with wood the company says it wants to put pricing on a market basis .
critics , including many in western europe , fear the kremlin seeks to use gazprom as a tool to reimpose part of its dominance lost at the time of the 1991 collapse of the soviet union . belarus , which lies sandwiched between russia and the european union , is in a loose economic and political partnership with russia and has always argued that gas import prices should be similar to those paid within russia . western governments gave strong diplomatic backing to ukraine 's pro-western president , viktor yushchenko , during the gas row at the start of 2006 , but belarus ' authoritarian leader lukashenko is a political pariah in europe and the united states . the eu has limited itself to calling on the two parties to reach a deal that does not threaten european supplies , while the authorities in france and germany say they are not worried by the prospect of shortages . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de russia belarus gas pricing row sparks jitters in europe russia and belarus are meeting to try and defuse a gas war that could threaten supplies to the eu .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 01.01.2007 excitement and hope as slovenia adopts the euro großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slovenia leads the way in eastern europe in embracing the euro slovenia on new year 's day will become the first former communist state to adopt the european union 's common currency as it exchanges its tolar for the euro . the slovenian national bank has already distributed 450,000 euro starter packets with exactly 12.52 euros in each .
hotlines are busy , with staff answering questions about the new currency .
common ones ask how long the tolar can be used and how long can it be exchanged for the euro . still , most slovenians are pretty relaxed about the change , said nada serajnik-sraka , who heads the euro information campaign for the government . " more than 80 percent are already familiar with the euro , " she said .
" slovenians travel a lot and are good business people so they usually already have euros in their wallets . " a success story five years after euro was introduced into the eu , three years after slovenia acceded to the eu and 15 years after slovenia declared independence from the former yugoslavia , slovenia 's adoption of the euro marks a new stage in the east-west integration of europe . " the euro is n't important only for our economy , we also expect psychological benefits ... we are coming closer to the most developed part of the eu and this will give -lrb- citizens -rrb- confidence , " slovenian prime minister janez jansa told the afp news agency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : inflation is expected to rise because of the change the tolar , which jansa described as a " success story , " was introduced in 1991 to cut off economic ties to the former yugoslavia . the accession to the eurozone is also a coup for slovenia as it is the only one of the 10 countries - eight former communist states plus malta and cyprus - that joined in 2004 to have met the tough maastricht criteria on public finances , inflation , interest and exchange rates that are required for euro-zone newcomers . smooth transition after eu finance ministers gave slovenia the green light last july to join the euro zone , the government and central bank had to carry out extensive preparations for the switch such as minting slovenian euro coins , distributing bills to banks and preparing the infrastructure for the changeover . the changeover to the single european currency foresees that tolars and euros will circulate simultaneously for only the first two weeks of january .
after that , banks and post offices will continue changing tolars into euros until the end of february .
from march on , only the central bank will continue changing tolars for euros .
the exchange rate will be one euro for 239.64 tolars . some say that transition wo n't be difficult because of slovenia 's readiness for the change and because of its history . " we have already had so many currencies here in slovenia , " said anja , a political science student who staffs the hotlines .
" i am only 23 and have already been through four currencies so imagine how my grandmother feels .
and many people calculate still in the dinar , the old yugoslavian currency , or in german marks .
often , people have had their savings in marks therefore the calculate in marks . " one concern is inflation to prevent a rounding upward of prices as happened when other nations changed over to the euro , the government introduced last march the double labelling of prices , in euros and tolars , which will remain in force for six months . despite this measure , slovenia 's main consumer association has warned that some prices have increased excessively already and it has opened a web site to shame stores accused of profiteering .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slovenia is small in size , but big in economic performance jansa said he did not think the hikes will push up inflation , which in november stood at 2.3 percent on a 12-month basis . " we did face some rising prices but it was not significant , " he said .
" last october we had a deflation of almost one percent -lrb- 0.8 percent -rrb- which was the biggest fall in slovenia 's history . " others following now the wealthiest of eight former communist states that joined the european union in 2004 , slovenia will mark another historic step in january 2008 when it becomes the first of the eu newcomers to take over the six-month eu presidency . the country will preside over the drive by other new eu states to join the euro .
cyprus and malta are expected to follow slovenia into the euro zone in 2008 and slovakia is aiming to adopt the single currency in 2009 .
the czech republic is now aiming for 2012 and hungary 2013 . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de euro rises to new high but europeans remain skeptical for the first time , the euro surpassed the us dollar in terms of the number of banknotes in circulation .

common ones ask how long the tolar can be used and how long can it be exchanged for the euro . still , most slovenians are pretty relaxed about the change , said nada serajnik-sraka , who heads the euro information campaign for the government . " more than 80 percent are already familiar with the euro , " she said .
" slovenians travel a lot and are good business people so they usually already have euros in their wallets . " a success story five years after euro was introduced into the eu , three years after slovenia acceded to the eu and 15 years after slovenia declared independence from the former yugoslavia , slovenia 's adoption of the euro marks a new stage in the east-west integration of europe . " the euro is n't important only for our economy , we also expect psychological benefits ... we are coming closer to the most developed part of the eu and this will give -lrb- citizens -rrb- confidence , " slovenian prime minister janez jansa told the afp news agency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : inflation is expected to rise because of the change the tolar , which jansa described as a " success story , " was introduced in 1991 to cut off economic ties to the former yugoslavia . the accession to the eurozone is also a coup for slovenia as it is the only one of the 10 countries - eight former communist states plus malta and cyprus - that joined in 2004 to have met the tough maastricht criteria on public finances , inflation , interest and exchange rates that are required for euro-zone newcomers . smooth transition after eu finance ministers gave slovenia the green light last july to join the euro zone , the government and central bank had to carry out extensive preparations for the switch such as minting slovenian euro coins , distributing bills to banks and preparing the infrastructure for the changeover . the changeover to the single european currency foresees that tolars and euros will circulate simultaneously for only the first two weeks of january .
after that , banks and post offices will continue changing tolars into euros until the end of february .
from march on , only the central bank will continue changing tolars for euros .
the exchange rate will be one euro for 239.64 tolars . some say that transition wo n't be difficult because of slovenia 's readiness for the change and because of its history . " we have already had so many currencies here in slovenia , " said anja , a political science student who staffs the hotlines .
" i am only 23 and have already been through four currencies so imagine how my grandmother feels .
and many people calculate still in the dinar , the old yugoslavian currency , or in german marks .
often , people have had their savings in marks therefore the calculate in marks . " one concern is inflation to prevent a rounding upward of prices as happened when other nations changed over to the euro , the government introduced last march the double labelling of prices , in euros and tolars , which will remain in force for six months . despite this measure , slovenia 's main consumer association has warned that some prices have increased excessively already and it has opened a web site to shame stores accused of profiteering .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slovenia is small in size , but big in economic performance jansa said he did not think the hikes will push up inflation , which in november stood at 2.3 percent on a 12-month basis . " we did face some rising prices but it was not significant , " he said .
" last october we had a deflation of almost one percent -lrb- 0.8 percent -rrb- which was the biggest fall in slovenia 's history . " others following now the wealthiest of eight former communist states that joined the european union in 2004 , slovenia will mark another historic step in january 2008 when it becomes the first of the eu newcomers to take over the six-month eu presidency . the country will preside over the drive by other new eu states to join the euro .
cyprus and malta are expected to follow slovenia into the euro zone in 2008 and slovakia is aiming to adopt the single currency in 2009 .
the czech republic is now aiming for 2012 and hungary 2013 . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de euro rises to new high but europeans remain skeptical for the first time , the euro surpassed the us dollar in terms of the number of banknotes in circulation .

hotlines are busy , with staff answering questions about the new currency .
common ones ask how long the tolar can be used and how long can it be exchanged for the euro . still , most slovenians are pretty relaxed about the change , said nada serajnik-sraka , who heads the euro information campaign for the government . " more than 80 percent are already familiar with the euro , " she said .
" slovenians travel a lot and are good business people so they usually already have euros in their wallets . " a success story five years after euro was introduced into the eu , three years after slovenia acceded to the eu and 15 years after slovenia declared independence from the former yugoslavia , slovenia 's adoption of the euro marks a new stage in the east-west integration of europe . " the euro is n't important only for our economy , we also expect psychological benefits ... we are coming closer to the most developed part of the eu and this will give -lrb- citizens -rrb- confidence , " slovenian prime minister janez jansa told the afp news agency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : inflation is expected to rise because of the change the tolar , which jansa described as a " success story , " was introduced in 1991 to cut off economic ties to the former yugoslavia . the accession to the eurozone is also a coup for slovenia as it is the only one of the 10 countries - eight former communist states plus malta and cyprus - that joined in 2004 to have met the tough maastricht criteria on public finances , inflation , interest and exchange rates that are required for euro-zone newcomers . smooth transition after eu finance ministers gave slovenia the green light last july to join the euro zone , the government and central bank had to carry out extensive preparations for the switch such as minting slovenian euro coins , distributing bills to banks and preparing the infrastructure for the changeover . the changeover to the single european currency foresees that tolars and euros will circulate simultaneously for only the first two weeks of january .
after that , banks and post offices will continue changing tolars into euros until the end of february .
from march on , only the central bank will continue changing tolars for euros .
the exchange rate will be one euro for 239.64 tolars . some say that transition wo n't be difficult because of slovenia 's readiness for the change and because of its history . " we have already had so many currencies here in slovenia , " said anja , a political science student who staffs the hotlines .
" i am only 23 and have already been through four currencies so imagine how my grandmother feels .
and many people calculate still in the dinar , the old yugoslavian currency , or in german marks .
often , people have had their savings in marks therefore the calculate in marks . " one concern is inflation to prevent a rounding upward of prices as happened when other nations changed over to the euro , the government introduced last march the double labelling of prices , in euros and tolars , which will remain in force for six months . despite this measure , slovenia 's main consumer association has warned that some prices have increased excessively already and it has opened a web site to shame stores accused of profiteering .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slovenia is small in size , but big in economic performance jansa said he did not think the hikes will push up inflation , which in november stood at 2.3 percent on a 12-month basis . " we did face some rising prices but it was not significant , " he said .
" last october we had a deflation of almost one percent -lrb- 0.8 percent -rrb- which was the biggest fall in slovenia 's history . " others following now the wealthiest of eight former communist states that joined the european union in 2004 , slovenia will mark another historic step in january 2008 when it becomes the first of the eu newcomers to take over the six-month eu presidency . the country will preside over the drive by other new eu states to join the euro .
cyprus and malta are expected to follow slovenia into the euro zone in 2008 and slovakia is aiming to adopt the single currency in 2009 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 01.01.2007 germany faces daunting agenda for eu , g8 presidencies großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel will need to draw on all her diplomatic skills in the first half of 2007 germany will fight to revive international efforts for middle east peace , relaunch the eu constitution and advocate a gentler form of globalization when it takes over the presidencies of the eu and the g8 monday . as the biggest economy and most populous country in europe , germany faces high hopes to deliver progress during its six-month eu tenure and its year-long stint at the head of the world 's eight most industrialized nations . berlin has set ambitious targets and achieving them will test the diplomatic powers of chancellor angela merkel , who has already won widespread praise for her approach to foreign policy since taking over in november 2005 . she told germans in a new year 's speech sunday that the dual presidencies presented a unique opportunity to help shape europe 's future in a globalized world . " only a united europe can tackle the challenges of globalization including international trade but also violence , terror and war , " she said . " a divided europe is doomed to failure . " germany wants to restart mideast peace process bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany will renew efforts to find a solution to mideast troubles merkel and foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier have called for a january meeting to " revitalize " the middle east quartet - grouping the eu , the united states , the united nations and russia - to help kick start peace efforts between israel and the palestinians . the chancellor will meet us president george w. bush in washington next week amid grumbling in europe that the united states has let the peace process languish as iraq has consumed its attention . steinmeier has said the aim is for the quartet to exercise a " stabilizing " influence in the region and encourage preliminary talks between israeli prime minister ehud olmert and palestinian president mahmud abbas to continue . breathing new life into dead eu treaty the most pressing item for europe , meanwhile , is the stalled constitution , especially with the jan .
1 entry of romania and bulgaria boosting the number of member states to 27 . merkel has cautioned against overly high expectations when germany takes over the eu brief from finland , saying that half a year may not be sufficient to resurrect a treaty that has been in the deep freeze for more than 18 months . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " no to the constitution " - french voters dealt a blow to the treaty it was precisely because of the rapid enlargement of the bloc in 2004 that the 200-page constitution was drawn up in a bid to streamline decision-making and give the eu a stronger international voice .
its highly damaging rejection last year by voters in france and the netherlands - two founding members of the eu - has overshadowed the fact that 18 countries have ratified it . germany has promised to present a " roadmap " of how to get the constitution back on track .
" our goal is to present a specific plan by the end of our presidency in which the timetable and the contours of a solution are laid out , " steinmeier told saturday 's bild newspaper . energy security and climate protection under both presidencies , energy security and climate protection will loom large . the eu wants to forge a common position for negotiations on the successor to the kyoto protocol which runs out in 2012 .
germany would like the bloc to commit to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 30 percent by 2020 . merkel believes europe would be strengthened if it negotiated with one voice with major suppliers such as russia and diversified . " europe must reduce its dependence in order to secure its long-term energy supply , " she wrote in friday 's handelsblatt newspaper .
" it must also speak with one voice on foreign energy relations . " beyond energy , checking the destabilizing influence of highly speculative hedge funds and removing obstacles to faster economic growth in africa will top the agenda when germany takes the helm of the g8 from russia . the highlight of the g8 presidency will be the june summit in the baltic resort heiligendamm , attended by the leaders of britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan , russia and the united states . seeking fairer growth distribution " the goal will be to identify imbalances and to determine what can be done to ensure more balanced global growth , " said bernd pfaffenbach , an aide to merkel , adding that promoting " global prosperity " will be theme of the meeting . the imbalances plaguing world economic momentum are already well-known : the us trade and current account deficits , the massive foreign exchange reserves held by the china , constraints on growth in europe and obstacles to faster economic gains in africa . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany at the helm of the g8 will push for more efforts to tackle africa 's problems merkel wants to forge a privileged partnership between the g8 and those african governments that are committed to corruption-free administration and to strengthening democratic reform . on financial markets , germany will press for greater transparency and political monitoring of speculative hedge funds , which are seen by berlin - and increasingly by some of its partners - as a destabilizing element in global finance . germany now has the backing of the united states , which for years had been reluctant to go along with vigorous market supervision .

" the belarussian side , in a difficult atmosphere on the eve of the new year , signed an agreement on unfortunate terms , " belarus ' prime minister sergei sidorsky told journalists in moscow . as part of the deal belarus has agreed to sell 50 percent of its strategically important gas pipeline operator beltransgaz to russian gas monopoly gazprom - a move earlier resisted by the belarussian government - the russian company said in a statement . under the deal , belarus will pay 100 dollars for 1,000 cubic meters of gas in 2007 , just below the 105 dollars earlier demanded by russia , but far higher than the 45 dollars charged under the previous contract , gazprom said . market price over the five years covered by the contract , the price of gas will climb annually to reach the " market price " charged to western european customers , the statement said . most of gazprom 's eu customers pay over 200 dollars per 1,000 cubic meters of russian gas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belarus ' prime minister sidorsky , left , and gazprom chief miller at a monday news conference in moscow " gazprom is undertaking a move to market principles of cooperation with all of the countries who buy russian gas without exception , " the statement quoted gazprom ceo alexei miller as saying . speaking to journalists alongside the belarussian prime minister , miller said the deal was signed at 11:58 pm -lrb- 20:58 gmt -rrb- on new year 's eve after months of tense negotiations , adding that belarus had been offered " the best conditions . " he said that russia would pay 2.5 billion dollars for a 50 percent stake in beltransgaz over the next four years . the transit price for russian gas supplies across belarus would be increased to $ 1.45 for 1,000 cubic meters traveling 100 kilometers , from 0.75 dollars at present , he said . disruptions avoided the last-minute deal came as russia was on the verge of cutting gas supplies to belarus , which could have disruptions to western europe . without an accord on a new five-year contract gazprom had warned that it would move towards cutting off supplies to belarus from 0700 gmt monday .
a cut in supplies like that suffered briefly by ukraine in a similar price dispute last january would have been a major blow to the country 's economy . there were also concerns in the european union that the row would impact on russian gas exports to western europe , 20 percent of which transit through belarus , meeting about five percent of eu natural gas needs . end of subsidies gazprom , a state-owned giant that produces a third of the world 's gas , has mounted a tough campaign to end soviet-era subsidies to neighboring countries , as well as expand ownership of infrastructure and other energy businesses throughout europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : before the deal was reached belarussians were preparing to heat with wood the company says it wants to put pricing on a market basis .
critics , including many in western europe , fear the kremlin seeks to use gazprom as a tool to reimpose part of its dominance lost at the time of the 1991 collapse of the soviet union . belarus , which lies sandwiched between russia and the european union , is in a loose economic and political partnership with russia and has always argued that gas import prices should be similar to those paid within russia . western governments gave strong diplomatic backing to ukraine 's pro-western president , viktor yushchenko , during the gas row at the start of 2006 , but belarus ' authoritarian leader lukashenko is a political pariah in europe and the united states . the eu has limited itself to calling on the two parties to reach a deal that does not threaten european supplies , while the authorities in france and germany say they are not worried by the prospect of shortages . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de russia belarus gas pricing row sparks jitters in europe russia and belarus are meeting to try and defuse a gas war that could threaten supplies to the eu .
the spat raises new concerns about eu energy dependence on russia .
-lrb- 29.12.2006 -rrb- belarus threatens to stop gas deliveries to europe belarus implied that unless russian gas giant gazprom backs off of demands for a hefty price increase , it might keep gas from being transported through its pipelines to western europe .

hotlines are busy , with staff answering questions about the new currency .
common ones ask how long the tolar can be used and how long can it be exchanged for the euro . still , most slovenians are pretty relaxed about the change , said nada serajnik-sraka , who heads the euro information campaign for the government . " more than 80 percent are already familiar with the euro , " she said .
" slovenians travel a lot and are good business people so they usually already have euros in their wallets . " a success story five years after euro was introduced into the eu , three years after slovenia acceded to the eu and 15 years after slovenia declared independence from the former yugoslavia , slovenia 's adoption of the euro marks a new stage in the east-west integration of europe . " the euro is n't important only for our economy , we also expect psychological benefits ... we are coming closer to the most developed part of the eu and this will give -lrb- citizens -rrb- confidence , " slovenian prime minister janez jansa told the afp news agency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : inflation is expected to rise because of the change the tolar , which jansa described as a " success story , " was introduced in 1991 to cut off economic ties to the former yugoslavia . the accession to the eurozone is also a coup for slovenia as it is the only one of the 10 countries - eight former communist states plus malta and cyprus - that joined in 2004 to have met the tough maastricht criteria on public finances , inflation , interest and exchange rates that are required for euro-zone newcomers . smooth transition after eu finance ministers gave slovenia the green light last july to join the euro zone , the government and central bank had to carry out extensive preparations for the switch such as minting slovenian euro coins , distributing bills to banks and preparing the infrastructure for the changeover . the changeover to the single european currency foresees that tolars and euros will circulate simultaneously for only the first two weeks of january .
after that , banks and post offices will continue changing tolars into euros until the end of february .
from march on , only the central bank will continue changing tolars for euros .
the exchange rate will be one euro for 239.64 tolars . some say that transition wo n't be difficult because of slovenia 's readiness for the change and because of its history . " we have already had so many currencies here in slovenia , " said anja , a political science student who staffs the hotlines .
" i am only 23 and have already been through four currencies so imagine how my grandmother feels .
and many people calculate still in the dinar , the old yugoslavian currency , or in german marks .
often , people have had their savings in marks therefore the calculate in marks . " one concern is inflation to prevent a rounding upward of prices as happened when other nations changed over to the euro , the government introduced last march the double labelling of prices , in euros and tolars , which will remain in force for six months . despite this measure , slovenia 's main consumer association has warned that some prices have increased excessively already and it has opened a web site to shame stores accused of profiteering .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slovenia is small in size , but big in economic performance jansa said he did not think the hikes will push up inflation , which in november stood at 2.3 percent on a 12-month basis . " we did face some rising prices but it was not significant , " he said .
" last october we had a deflation of almost one percent -lrb- 0.8 percent -rrb- which was the biggest fall in slovenia 's history . " others following now the wealthiest of eight former communist states that joined the european union in 2004 , slovenia will mark another historic step in january 2008 when it becomes the first of the eu newcomers to take over the six-month eu presidency . the country will preside over the drive by other new eu states to join the euro .
cyprus and malta are expected to follow slovenia into the euro zone in 2008 and slovakia is aiming to adopt the single currency in 2009 .

" a success story five years after euro was introduced into the eu , three years after slovenia acceded to the eu and 15 years after slovenia declared independence from the former yugoslavia , slovenia 's adoption of the euro marks a new stage in the east-west integration of europe . " the euro is n't important only for our economy , we also expect psychological benefits ... we are coming closer to the most developed part of the eu and this will give -lrb- citizens -rrb- confidence , " slovenian prime minister janez jansa told the afp news agency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : inflation is expected to rise because of the change the tolar , which jansa described as a " success story , " was introduced in 1991 to cut off economic ties to the former yugoslavia . the accession to the eurozone is also a coup for slovenia as it is the only one of the 10 countries - eight former communist states plus malta and cyprus - that joined in 2004 to have met the tough maastricht criteria on public finances , inflation , interest and exchange rates that are required for euro-zone newcomers . smooth transition after eu finance ministers gave slovenia the green light last july to join the euro zone , the government and central bank had to carry out extensive preparations for the switch such as minting slovenian euro coins , distributing bills to banks and preparing the infrastructure for the changeover . the changeover to the single european currency foresees that tolars and euros will circulate simultaneously for only the first two weeks of january .
after that , banks and post offices will continue changing tolars into euros until the end of february .
from march on , only the central bank will continue changing tolars for euros .
the exchange rate will be one euro for 239.64 tolars . some say that transition wo n't be difficult because of slovenia 's readiness for the change and because of its history . " we have already had so many currencies here in slovenia , " said anja , a political science student who staffs the hotlines .
" i am only 23 and have already been through four currencies so imagine how my grandmother feels .
and many people calculate still in the dinar , the old yugoslavian currency , or in german marks .
often , people have had their savings in marks therefore the calculate in marks . " one concern is inflation to prevent a rounding upward of prices as happened when other nations changed over to the euro , the government introduced last march the double labelling of prices , in euros and tolars , which will remain in force for six months . despite this measure , slovenia 's main consumer association has warned that some prices have increased excessively already and it has opened a web site to shame stores accused of profiteering .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slovenia is small in size , but big in economic performance jansa said he did not think the hikes will push up inflation , which in november stood at 2.3 percent on a 12-month basis . " we did face some rising prices but it was not significant , " he said .
" last october we had a deflation of almost one percent -lrb- 0.8 percent -rrb- which was the biggest fall in slovenia 's history . " others following now the wealthiest of eight former communist states that joined the european union in 2004 , slovenia will mark another historic step in january 2008 when it becomes the first of the eu newcomers to take over the six-month eu presidency . the country will preside over the drive by other new eu states to join the euro .
cyprus and malta are expected to follow slovenia into the euro zone in 2008 and slovakia is aiming to adopt the single currency in 2009 .

the eu , already burdened with 20 official languages , officially promotes linguistic diversity but often defaults to english . bulgarian , romanian and gaelic will become official eu languages on jan .
1 , further complicating europe 's ability to communicate . since its inception , the eu has been multilingual and working with multiple languages has always proved challenging .
the interpreting and translating require large amounts of money and linguistic finesse .
but in this babel-like environment , english often ends up being the language used in official business . multilingualism a priority bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the demand for interpreters is high , and growing yet the eu remains committed to multilingualism , even as bulgaria and romania join monday , bringing two additional languages with them . " the diversity of languages is our common richness and the promotion of this diversity is a clear priority , " said europe 's commissioner for multilingualism , jan figel . when the eu is enlarged , a number of official languages climbs .
but even within member states , regional languages and bilingualism are promoted .
irish gaelic is a case in point , which is also being added to the eu language roster , a move seen by its advocates as a way to promote the irish language . currently , the eu 's three main institutions employ approximately 4,000 interpreters and translators .
another 1,500 freelancers are also used .
this costs eu taxpayers close to 1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.3 billion -rrb- each year , " less than one percent of the total budget , " as the european commission likes to stress . even with all this money , the eu is short of people , particularly those who are fluent in less frequently spoken languages .
one way around this is to use a relay system .
an interpreter who translates from english into dutch might use the translation of an english-speaking colleague for a politician who is speaking greek , since greek to dutch translators can be hard to find .
this demands high precision , speed and concentration during live events such as meetings or press conferences . those working in brussels are " under constant pressure to learn more languages , " said patrice liberman , a belgian interpreter working for the eu since 1991 . he already speaks eight : dutch , english , french , german , italian , polish , russian and spanish . english often the default language bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu promotes linguistic diversity with so many languages entering conversations , english often becomes dominant by default .
most of the 2.8 million pages of documents produced by the eu in 2005 were written in english .
translation into the eu 's other two " big " working languages - french and german - happens later . the number of interpreters can not keep pace with the growing number of languages and language combinations .
this means the " smaller " tongues are often translated only at big meetings .
as a result , officials tend to speak english themselves or listen to english translations of remarks and questions .
this makes bad english a linguistic currency in brussels and frustrates translators . " we do n't want to be only decorative , we want to be listened to , " said ieva zauberga , a latvian who moved to brussels when her country joined the eu two years ago . the eu 's multilinguism does n't show any signs of halting .

the eu , already burdened with 20 official languages , officially promotes linguistic diversity but often defaults to english . bulgarian , romanian and gaelic will become official eu languages on jan .
1 , further complicating europe 's ability to communicate . since its inception , the eu has been multilingual and working with multiple languages has always proved challenging .
the interpreting and translating require large amounts of money and linguistic finesse .
but in this babel-like environment , english often ends up being the language used in official business . multilingualism a priority bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the demand for interpreters is high , and growing yet the eu remains committed to multilingualism , even as bulgaria and romania join monday , bringing two additional languages with them . " the diversity of languages is our common richness and the promotion of this diversity is a clear priority , " said europe 's commissioner for multilingualism , jan figel . when the eu is enlarged , a number of official languages climbs .
but even within member states , regional languages and bilingualism are promoted .
irish gaelic is a case in point , which is also being added to the eu language roster , a move seen by its advocates as a way to promote the irish language . currently , the eu 's three main institutions employ approximately 4,000 interpreters and translators .
another 1,500 freelancers are also used .
this costs eu taxpayers close to 1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.3 billion -rrb- each year , " less than one percent of the total budget , " as the european commission likes to stress . even with all this money , the eu is short of people , particularly those who are fluent in less frequently spoken languages .
one way around this is to use a relay system .
an interpreter who translates from english into dutch might use the translation of an english-speaking colleague for a politician who is speaking greek , since greek to dutch translators can be hard to find .
this demands high precision , speed and concentration during live events such as meetings or press conferences . those working in brussels are " under constant pressure to learn more languages , " said patrice liberman , a belgian interpreter working for the eu since 1991 . he already speaks eight : dutch , english , french , german , italian , polish , russian and spanish . english often the default language bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu promotes linguistic diversity with so many languages entering conversations , english often becomes dominant by default .
most of the 2.8 million pages of documents produced by the eu in 2005 were written in english .
translation into the eu 's other two " big " working languages - french and german - happens later . the number of interpreters can not keep pace with the growing number of languages and language combinations .
this means the " smaller " tongues are often translated only at big meetings .
as a result , officials tend to speak english themselves or listen to english translations of remarks and questions .

hotlines are busy , with staff answering questions about the new currency .
common ones ask how long the tolar can be used and how long can it be exchanged for the euro . still , most slovenians are pretty relaxed about the change , said nada serajnik-sraka , who heads the euro information campaign for the government . " more than 80 percent are already familiar with the euro , " she said .
" slovenians travel a lot and are good business people so they usually already have euros in their wallets . " a success story five years after euro was introduced into the eu , three years after slovenia acceded to the eu and 15 years after slovenia declared independence from the former yugoslavia , slovenia 's adoption of the euro marks a new stage in the east-west integration of europe . " the euro is n't important only for our economy , we also expect psychological benefits ... we are coming closer to the most developed part of the eu and this will give -lrb- citizens -rrb- confidence , " slovenian prime minister janez jansa told the afp news agency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : inflation is expected to rise because of the change the tolar , which jansa described as a " success story , " was introduced in 1991 to cut off economic ties to the former yugoslavia . the accession to the eurozone is also a coup for slovenia as it is the only one of the 10 countries - eight former communist states plus malta and cyprus - that joined in 2004 to have met the tough maastricht criteria on public finances , inflation , interest and exchange rates that are required for euro-zone newcomers . smooth transition after eu finance ministers gave slovenia the green light last july to join the euro zone , the government and central bank had to carry out extensive preparations for the switch such as minting slovenian euro coins , distributing bills to banks and preparing the infrastructure for the changeover . the changeover to the single european currency foresees that tolars and euros will circulate simultaneously for only the first two weeks of january .
after that , banks and post offices will continue changing tolars into euros until the end of february .
from march on , only the central bank will continue changing tolars for euros .
the exchange rate will be one euro for 239.64 tolars . some say that transition wo n't be difficult because of slovenia 's readiness for the change and because of its history . " we have already had so many currencies here in slovenia , " said anja , a political science student who staffs the hotlines .
" i am only 23 and have already been through four currencies so imagine how my grandmother feels .
and many people calculate still in the dinar , the old yugoslavian currency , or in german marks .
often , people have had their savings in marks therefore the calculate in marks . " one concern is inflation to prevent a rounding upward of prices as happened when other nations changed over to the euro , the government introduced last march the double labelling of prices , in euros and tolars , which will remain in force for six months . despite this measure , slovenia 's main consumer association has warned that some prices have increased excessively already and it has opened a web site to shame stores accused of profiteering .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slovenia is small in size , but big in economic performance jansa said he did not think the hikes will push up inflation , which in november stood at 2.3 percent on a 12-month basis . " we did face some rising prices but it was not significant , " he said .
" last october we had a deflation of almost one percent -lrb- 0.8 percent -rrb- which was the biggest fall in slovenia 's history . " others following now the wealthiest of eight former communist states that joined the european union in 2004 , slovenia will mark another historic step in january 2008 when it becomes the first of the eu newcomers to take over the six-month eu presidency . the country will preside over the drive by other new eu states to join the euro .
cyprus and malta are expected to follow slovenia into the euro zone in 2008 and slovakia is aiming to adopt the single currency in 2009 .
the czech republic is now aiming for 2012 and hungary 2013 . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de euro rises to new high but europeans remain skeptical for the first time , the euro surpassed the us dollar in terms of the number of banknotes in circulation .

" the belarussian side , in a difficult atmosphere on the eve of the new year , signed an agreement on unfortunate terms , " belarus ' prime minister sergei sidorsky told journalists in moscow . as part of the deal belarus has agreed to sell 50 percent of its strategically important gas pipeline operator beltransgaz to russian gas monopoly gazprom - a move earlier resisted by the belarussian government - the russian company said in a statement . under the deal , belarus will pay 100 dollars for 1,000 cubic meters of gas in 2007 , just below the 105 dollars earlier demanded by russia , but far higher than the 45 dollars charged under the previous contract , gazprom said . market price over the five years covered by the contract , the price of gas will climb annually to reach the " market price " charged to western european customers , the statement said . most of gazprom 's eu customers pay over 200 dollars per 1,000 cubic meters of russian gas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belarus ' prime minister sidorsky , left , and gazprom chief miller at a monday news conference in moscow " gazprom is undertaking a move to market principles of cooperation with all of the countries who buy russian gas without exception , " the statement quoted gazprom ceo alexei miller as saying . speaking to journalists alongside the belarussian prime minister , miller said the deal was signed at 11:58 pm -lrb- 20:58 gmt -rrb- on new year 's eve after months of tense negotiations , adding that belarus had been offered " the best conditions . " he said that russia would pay 2.5 billion dollars for a 50 percent stake in beltransgaz over the next four years . the transit price for russian gas supplies across belarus would be increased to $ 1.45 for 1,000 cubic meters traveling 100 kilometers , from 0.75 dollars at present , he said . disruptions avoided the last-minute deal came as russia was on the verge of cutting gas supplies to belarus , which could have disruptions to western europe . without an accord on a new five-year contract gazprom had warned that it would move towards cutting off supplies to belarus from 0700 gmt monday .
a cut in supplies like that suffered briefly by ukraine in a similar price dispute last january would have been a major blow to the country 's economy . there were also concerns in the european union that the row would impact on russian gas exports to western europe , 20 percent of which transit through belarus , meeting about five percent of eu natural gas needs . end of subsidies gazprom , a state-owned giant that produces a third of the world 's gas , has mounted a tough campaign to end soviet-era subsidies to neighboring countries , as well as expand ownership of infrastructure and other energy businesses throughout europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : before the deal was reached belarussians were preparing to heat with wood the company says it wants to put pricing on a market basis .
critics , including many in western europe , fear the kremlin seeks to use gazprom as a tool to reimpose part of its dominance lost at the time of the 1991 collapse of the soviet union . belarus , which lies sandwiched between russia and the european union , is in a loose economic and political partnership with russia and has always argued that gas import prices should be similar to those paid within russia . western governments gave strong diplomatic backing to ukraine 's pro-western president , viktor yushchenko , during the gas row at the start of 2006 , but belarus ' authoritarian leader lukashenko is a political pariah in europe and the united states . the eu has limited itself to calling on the two parties to reach a deal that does not threaten european supplies , while the authorities in france and germany say they are not worried by the prospect of shortages . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de russia belarus gas pricing row sparks jitters in europe russia and belarus are meeting to try and defuse a gas war that could threaten supplies to the eu .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 01.01.2007 germany faces daunting agenda for eu , g8 presidencies großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel will need to draw on all her diplomatic skills in the first half of 2007 germany will fight to revive international efforts for middle east peace , relaunch the eu constitution and advocate a gentler form of globalization when it takes over the presidencies of the eu and the g8 monday . as the biggest economy and most populous country in europe , germany faces high hopes to deliver progress during its six-month eu tenure and its year-long stint at the head of the world 's eight most industrialized nations . berlin has set ambitious targets and achieving them will test the diplomatic powers of chancellor angela merkel , who has already won widespread praise for her approach to foreign policy since taking over in november 2005 . she told germans in a new year 's speech sunday that the dual presidencies presented a unique opportunity to help shape europe 's future in a globalized world . " only a united europe can tackle the challenges of globalization including international trade but also violence , terror and war , " she said . " a divided europe is doomed to failure . " germany wants to restart mideast peace process bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany will renew efforts to find a solution to mideast troubles merkel and foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier have called for a january meeting to " revitalize " the middle east quartet - grouping the eu , the united states , the united nations and russia - to help kick start peace efforts between israel and the palestinians . the chancellor will meet us president george w. bush in washington next week amid grumbling in europe that the united states has let the peace process languish as iraq has consumed its attention . steinmeier has said the aim is for the quartet to exercise a " stabilizing " influence in the region and encourage preliminary talks between israeli prime minister ehud olmert and palestinian president mahmud abbas to continue . breathing new life into dead eu treaty the most pressing item for europe , meanwhile , is the stalled constitution , especially with the jan .
1 entry of romania and bulgaria boosting the number of member states to 27 . merkel has cautioned against overly high expectations when germany takes over the eu brief from finland , saying that half a year may not be sufficient to resurrect a treaty that has been in the deep freeze for more than 18 months . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " no to the constitution " - french voters dealt a blow to the treaty it was precisely because of the rapid enlargement of the bloc in 2004 that the 200-page constitution was drawn up in a bid to streamline decision-making and give the eu a stronger international voice .
its highly damaging rejection last year by voters in france and the netherlands - two founding members of the eu - has overshadowed the fact that 18 countries have ratified it . germany has promised to present a " roadmap " of how to get the constitution back on track .
" our goal is to present a specific plan by the end of our presidency in which the timetable and the contours of a solution are laid out , " steinmeier told saturday 's bild newspaper . energy security and climate protection under both presidencies , energy security and climate protection will loom large . the eu wants to forge a common position for negotiations on the successor to the kyoto protocol which runs out in 2012 .
germany would like the bloc to commit to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 30 percent by 2020 . merkel believes europe would be strengthened if it negotiated with one voice with major suppliers such as russia and diversified . " europe must reduce its dependence in order to secure its long-term energy supply , " she wrote in friday 's handelsblatt newspaper .
" it must also speak with one voice on foreign energy relations . " beyond energy , checking the destabilizing influence of highly speculative hedge funds and removing obstacles to faster economic growth in africa will top the agenda when germany takes the helm of the g8 from russia . the highlight of the g8 presidency will be the june summit in the baltic resort heiligendamm , attended by the leaders of britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan , russia and the united states . seeking fairer growth distribution " the goal will be to identify imbalances and to determine what can be done to ensure more balanced global growth , " said bernd pfaffenbach , an aide to merkel , adding that promoting " global prosperity " will be theme of the meeting . the imbalances plaguing world economic momentum are already well-known : the us trade and current account deficits , the massive foreign exchange reserves held by the china , constraints on growth in europe and obstacles to faster economic gains in africa . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany at the helm of the g8 will push for more efforts to tackle africa 's problems merkel wants to forge a privileged partnership between the g8 and those african governments that are committed to corruption-free administration and to strengthening democratic reform . on financial markets , germany will press for greater transparency and political monitoring of speculative hedge funds , which are seen by berlin - and increasingly by some of its partners - as a destabilizing element in global finance . germany now has the backing of the united states , which for years had been reluctant to go along with vigorous market supervision .

" only a united europe can tackle the challenges of globalization including international trade but also violence , terror and war , " she said . " a divided europe is doomed to failure . " germany wants to restart mideast peace process bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany will renew efforts to find a solution to mideast troubles merkel and foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier have called for a january meeting to " revitalize " the middle east quartet - grouping the eu , the united states , the united nations and russia - to help kick start peace efforts between israel and the palestinians . the chancellor will meet us president george w. bush in washington next week amid grumbling in europe that the united states has let the peace process languish as iraq has consumed its attention . steinmeier has said the aim is for the quartet to exercise a " stabilizing " influence in the region and encourage preliminary talks between israeli prime minister ehud olmert and palestinian president mahmud abbas to continue . breathing new life into dead eu treaty the most pressing item for europe , meanwhile , is the stalled constitution , especially with the jan .
1 entry of romania and bulgaria boosting the number of member states to 27 . merkel has cautioned against overly high expectations when germany takes over the eu brief from finland , saying that half a year may not be sufficient to resurrect a treaty that has been in the deep freeze for more than 18 months . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " no to the constitution " - french voters dealt a blow to the treaty it was precisely because of the rapid enlargement of the bloc in 2004 that the 200-page constitution was drawn up in a bid to streamline decision-making and give the eu a stronger international voice .
its highly damaging rejection last year by voters in france and the netherlands - two founding members of the eu - has overshadowed the fact that 18 countries have ratified it . germany has promised to present a " roadmap " of how to get the constitution back on track .
" our goal is to present a specific plan by the end of our presidency in which the timetable and the contours of a solution are laid out , " steinmeier told saturday 's bild newspaper . energy security and climate protection under both presidencies , energy security and climate protection will loom large . the eu wants to forge a common position for negotiations on the successor to the kyoto protocol which runs out in 2012 .
germany would like the bloc to commit to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 30 percent by 2020 . merkel believes europe would be strengthened if it negotiated with one voice with major suppliers such as russia and diversified . " europe must reduce its dependence in order to secure its long-term energy supply , " she wrote in friday 's handelsblatt newspaper .
" it must also speak with one voice on foreign energy relations . " beyond energy , checking the destabilizing influence of highly speculative hedge funds and removing obstacles to faster economic growth in africa will top the agenda when germany takes the helm of the g8 from russia . the highlight of the g8 presidency will be the june summit in the baltic resort heiligendamm , attended by the leaders of britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan , russia and the united states . seeking fairer growth distribution " the goal will be to identify imbalances and to determine what can be done to ensure more balanced global growth , " said bernd pfaffenbach , an aide to merkel , adding that promoting " global prosperity " will be theme of the meeting . the imbalances plaguing world economic momentum are already well-known : the us trade and current account deficits , the massive foreign exchange reserves held by the china , constraints on growth in europe and obstacles to faster economic gains in africa . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany at the helm of the g8 will push for more efforts to tackle africa 's problems merkel wants to forge a privileged partnership between the g8 and those african governments that are committed to corruption-free administration and to strengthening democratic reform . on financial markets , germany will press for greater transparency and political monitoring of speculative hedge funds , which are seen by berlin - and increasingly by some of its partners - as a destabilizing element in global finance . germany now has the backing of the united states , which for years had been reluctant to go along with vigorous market supervision .
but pfaffenbach acknowledged that merkel will probably have to be content with simply " a final declaration that calls for greater transparency . " germany is also expected to push for a more rational use of energy resources and hopes to spark discussion on a follow-up to the kyoto protocol on reducing greenhouse gas emissions , which expires in 2012 . berlin in addition wants to include mexico , india , china , brazil and south africa , countries that are not members of the g8 , in the climate talks . the fate of the doha round of multilateral trade liberalization negotiations , currently deadlocked , is likely to hover over the g8 next year .

irish gaelic is a case in point , which is also being added to the eu language roster , a move seen by its advocates as a way to promote the irish language . currently , the eu 's three main institutions employ approximately 4,000 interpreters and translators .

the eu , already burdened with 20 official languages , officially promotes linguistic diversity but often defaults to english . bulgarian , romanian and gaelic will become official eu languages on jan .
1 , further complicating europe 's ability to communicate . since its inception , the eu has been multilingual and working with multiple languages has always proved challenging .
the interpreting and translating require large amounts of money and linguistic finesse .
but in this babel-like environment , english often ends up being the language used in official business . multilingualism a priority bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the demand for interpreters is high , and growing yet the eu remains committed to multilingualism , even as bulgaria and romania join monday , bringing two additional languages with them . " the diversity of languages is our common richness and the promotion of this diversity is a clear priority , " said europe 's commissioner for multilingualism , jan figel . when the eu is enlarged , a number of official languages climbs .
but even within member states , regional languages and bilingualism are promoted .
irish gaelic is a case in point , which is also being added to the eu language roster , a move seen by its advocates as a way to promote the irish language . currently , the eu 's three main institutions employ approximately 4,000 interpreters and translators .
another 1,500 freelancers are also used .
this costs eu taxpayers close to 1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.3 billion -rrb- each year , " less than one percent of the total budget , " as the european commission likes to stress . even with all this money , the eu is short of people , particularly those who are fluent in less frequently spoken languages .
one way around this is to use a relay system .
an interpreter who translates from english into dutch might use the translation of an english-speaking colleague for a politician who is speaking greek , since greek to dutch translators can be hard to find .
this demands high precision , speed and concentration during live events such as meetings or press conferences . those working in brussels are " under constant pressure to learn more languages , " said patrice liberman , a belgian interpreter working for the eu since 1991 . he already speaks eight : dutch , english , french , german , italian , polish , russian and spanish . english often the default language bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu promotes linguistic diversity with so many languages entering conversations , english often becomes dominant by default .
most of the 2.8 million pages of documents produced by the eu in 2005 were written in english .
translation into the eu 's other two " big " working languages - french and german - happens later . the number of interpreters can not keep pace with the growing number of languages and language combinations .
this means the " smaller " tongues are often translated only at big meetings .
as a result , officials tend to speak english themselves or listen to english translations of remarks and questions .
this makes bad english a linguistic currency in brussels and frustrates translators . " we do n't want to be only decorative , we want to be listened to , " said ieva zauberga , a latvian who moved to brussels when her country joined the eu two years ago . the eu 's multilinguism does n't show any signs of halting .
croatia could be next , as its entry is scheduled for 2009-2010 .
starting next summer , a new building will have 30 studios for interpreters , instead of the 21 currently available . but the prediction is that the hiring problems wo n't disappear , making english increasingly europe 's lingua franca . dw staff / afp -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de romanian to become eu 's first commissioner for multilingualism the european parliament approved romania 's candidate for the post of commissioner for multilingualism .

the eu , already burdened with 20 official languages , officially promotes linguistic diversity but often defaults to english . bulgarian , romanian and gaelic will become official eu languages on jan .
1 , further complicating europe 's ability to communicate . since its inception , the eu has been multilingual and working with multiple languages has always proved challenging .
the interpreting and translating require large amounts of money and linguistic finesse .
but in this babel-like environment , english often ends up being the language used in official business . multilingualism a priority bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the demand for interpreters is high , and growing yet the eu remains committed to multilingualism , even as bulgaria and romania join monday , bringing two additional languages with them . " the diversity of languages is our common richness and the promotion of this diversity is a clear priority , " said europe 's commissioner for multilingualism , jan figel . when the eu is enlarged , a number of official languages climbs .
but even within member states , regional languages and bilingualism are promoted .
irish gaelic is a case in point , which is also being added to the eu language roster , a move seen by its advocates as a way to promote the irish language . currently , the eu 's three main institutions employ approximately 4,000 interpreters and translators .
another 1,500 freelancers are also used .
this costs eu taxpayers close to 1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.3 billion -rrb- each year , " less than one percent of the total budget , " as the european commission likes to stress . even with all this money , the eu is short of people , particularly those who are fluent in less frequently spoken languages .
one way around this is to use a relay system .
an interpreter who translates from english into dutch might use the translation of an english-speaking colleague for a politician who is speaking greek , since greek to dutch translators can be hard to find .
this demands high precision , speed and concentration during live events such as meetings or press conferences . those working in brussels are " under constant pressure to learn more languages , " said patrice liberman , a belgian interpreter working for the eu since 1991 . he already speaks eight : dutch , english , french , german , italian , polish , russian and spanish . english often the default language bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu promotes linguistic diversity with so many languages entering conversations , english often becomes dominant by default .
most of the 2.8 million pages of documents produced by the eu in 2005 were written in english .
translation into the eu 's other two " big " working languages - french and german - happens later . the number of interpreters can not keep pace with the growing number of languages and language combinations .
this means the " smaller " tongues are often translated only at big meetings .
as a result , officials tend to speak english themselves or listen to english translations of remarks and questions .
this makes bad english a linguistic currency in brussels and frustrates translators . " we do n't want to be only decorative , we want to be listened to , " said ieva zauberga , a latvian who moved to brussels when her country joined the eu two years ago . the eu 's multilinguism does n't show any signs of halting .
croatia could be next , as its entry is scheduled for 2009-2010 .
starting next summer , a new building will have 30 studios for interpreters , instead of the 21 currently available . but the prediction is that the hiring problems wo n't disappear , making english increasingly europe 's lingua franca . dw staff / afp -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de romanian to become eu 's first commissioner for multilingualism the european parliament approved romania 's candidate for the post of commissioner for multilingualism .
doubts remain as to how influential leonard orban 's role will be .
-lrb- 11.12.2006 -rrb- berlin protests sidelining of german at eu the eu has no less than 20 official languages , yet english remains the undisputed lingua franca of the union .
the german government is now stepping up its efforts to make german more prominent in the eu .

" only a united europe can tackle the challenges of globalization including international trade but also violence , terror and war , " she said . " a divided europe is doomed to failure . " germany wants to restart mideast peace process bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany will renew efforts to find a solution to mideast troubles merkel and foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier have called for a january meeting to " revitalize " the middle east quartet - grouping the eu , the united states , the united nations and russia - to help kick start peace efforts between israel and the palestinians . the chancellor will meet us president george w. bush in washington next week amid grumbling in europe that the united states has let the peace process languish as iraq has consumed its attention . steinmeier has said the aim is for the quartet to exercise a " stabilizing " influence in the region and encourage preliminary talks between israeli prime minister ehud olmert and palestinian president mahmud abbas to continue . breathing new life into dead eu treaty the most pressing item for europe , meanwhile , is the stalled constitution , especially with the jan .
1 entry of romania and bulgaria boosting the number of member states to 27 . merkel has cautioned against overly high expectations when germany takes over the eu brief from finland , saying that half a year may not be sufficient to resurrect a treaty that has been in the deep freeze for more than 18 months . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " no to the constitution " - french voters dealt a blow to the treaty it was precisely because of the rapid enlargement of the bloc in 2004 that the 200-page constitution was drawn up in a bid to streamline decision-making and give the eu a stronger international voice .
its highly damaging rejection last year by voters in france and the netherlands - two founding members of the eu - has overshadowed the fact that 18 countries have ratified it . germany has promised to present a " roadmap " of how to get the constitution back on track .
" our goal is to present a specific plan by the end of our presidency in which the timetable and the contours of a solution are laid out , " steinmeier told saturday 's bild newspaper . energy security and climate protection under both presidencies , energy security and climate protection will loom large . the eu wants to forge a common position for negotiations on the successor to the kyoto protocol which runs out in 2012 .
germany would like the bloc to commit to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 30 percent by 2020 . merkel believes europe would be strengthened if it negotiated with one voice with major suppliers such as russia and diversified . " europe must reduce its dependence in order to secure its long-term energy supply , " she wrote in friday 's handelsblatt newspaper .
" it must also speak with one voice on foreign energy relations . " beyond energy , checking the destabilizing influence of highly speculative hedge funds and removing obstacles to faster economic growth in africa will top the agenda when germany takes the helm of the g8 from russia . the highlight of the g8 presidency will be the june summit in the baltic resort heiligendamm , attended by the leaders of britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan , russia and the united states . seeking fairer growth distribution " the goal will be to identify imbalances and to determine what can be done to ensure more balanced global growth , " said bernd pfaffenbach , an aide to merkel , adding that promoting " global prosperity " will be theme of the meeting . the imbalances plaguing world economic momentum are already well-known : the us trade and current account deficits , the massive foreign exchange reserves held by the china , constraints on growth in europe and obstacles to faster economic gains in africa . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany at the helm of the g8 will push for more efforts to tackle africa 's problems merkel wants to forge a privileged partnership between the g8 and those african governments that are committed to corruption-free administration and to strengthening democratic reform . on financial markets , germany will press for greater transparency and political monitoring of speculative hedge funds , which are seen by berlin - and increasingly by some of its partners - as a destabilizing element in global finance . germany now has the backing of the united states , which for years had been reluctant to go along with vigorous market supervision .
but pfaffenbach acknowledged that merkel will probably have to be content with simply " a final declaration that calls for greater transparency . " germany is also expected to push for a more rational use of energy resources and hopes to spark discussion on a follow-up to the kyoto protocol on reducing greenhouse gas emissions , which expires in 2012 . berlin in addition wants to include mexico , india , china , brazil and south africa , countries that are not members of the g8 , in the climate talks . the fate of the doha round of multilateral trade liberalization negotiations , currently deadlocked , is likely to hover over the g8 next year .

" the belarussian side , in a difficult atmosphere on the eve of the new year , signed an agreement on unfortunate terms , " belarus ' prime minister sergei sidorsky told journalists in moscow . as part of the deal belarus has agreed to sell 50 percent of its strategically important gas pipeline operator beltransgaz to russian gas monopoly gazprom - a move earlier resisted by the belarussian government - the russian company said in a statement . under the deal , belarus will pay 100 dollars for 1,000 cubic meters of gas in 2007 , just below the 105 dollars earlier demanded by russia , but far higher than the 45 dollars charged under the previous contract , gazprom said . market price over the five years covered by the contract , the price of gas will climb annually to reach the " market price " charged to western european customers , the statement said . most of gazprom 's eu customers pay over 200 dollars per 1,000 cubic meters of russian gas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belarus ' prime minister sidorsky , left , and gazprom chief miller at a monday news conference in moscow " gazprom is undertaking a move to market principles of cooperation with all of the countries who buy russian gas without exception , " the statement quoted gazprom ceo alexei miller as saying . speaking to journalists alongside the belarussian prime minister , miller said the deal was signed at 11:58 pm -lrb- 20:58 gmt -rrb- on new year 's eve after months of tense negotiations , adding that belarus had been offered " the best conditions . " he said that russia would pay 2.5 billion dollars for a 50 percent stake in beltransgaz over the next four years . the transit price for russian gas supplies across belarus would be increased to $ 1.45 for 1,000 cubic meters traveling 100 kilometers , from 0.75 dollars at present , he said . disruptions avoided the last-minute deal came as russia was on the verge of cutting gas supplies to belarus , which could have disruptions to western europe . without an accord on a new five-year contract gazprom had warned that it would move towards cutting off supplies to belarus from 0700 gmt monday .
a cut in supplies like that suffered briefly by ukraine in a similar price dispute last january would have been a major blow to the country 's economy . there were also concerns in the european union that the row would impact on russian gas exports to western europe , 20 percent of which transit through belarus , meeting about five percent of eu natural gas needs . end of subsidies gazprom , a state-owned giant that produces a third of the world 's gas , has mounted a tough campaign to end soviet-era subsidies to neighboring countries , as well as expand ownership of infrastructure and other energy businesses throughout europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : before the deal was reached belarussians were preparing to heat with wood the company says it wants to put pricing on a market basis .
critics , including many in western europe , fear the kremlin seeks to use gazprom as a tool to reimpose part of its dominance lost at the time of the 1991 collapse of the soviet union . belarus , which lies sandwiched between russia and the european union , is in a loose economic and political partnership with russia and has always argued that gas import prices should be similar to those paid within russia . western governments gave strong diplomatic backing to ukraine 's pro-western president , viktor yushchenko , during the gas row at the start of 2006 , but belarus ' authoritarian leader lukashenko is a political pariah in europe and the united states . the eu has limited itself to calling on the two parties to reach a deal that does not threaten european supplies , while the authorities in france and germany say they are not worried by the prospect of shortages . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de russia belarus gas pricing row sparks jitters in europe russia and belarus are meeting to try and defuse a gas war that could threaten supplies to the eu .

" the belarussian side , in a difficult atmosphere on the eve of the new year , signed an agreement on unfortunate terms , " belarus ' prime minister sergei sidorsky told journalists in moscow . as part of the deal belarus has agreed to sell 50 percent of its strategically important gas pipeline operator beltransgaz to russian gas monopoly gazprom - a move earlier resisted by the belarussian government - the russian company said in a statement . under the deal , belarus will pay 100 dollars for 1,000 cubic meters of gas in 2007 , just below the 105 dollars earlier demanded by russia , but far higher than the 45 dollars charged under the previous contract , gazprom said . market price over the five years covered by the contract , the price of gas will climb annually to reach the " market price " charged to western european customers , the statement said . most of gazprom 's eu customers pay over 200 dollars per 1,000 cubic meters of russian gas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belarus ' prime minister sidorsky , left , and gazprom chief miller at a monday news conference in moscow " gazprom is undertaking a move to market principles of cooperation with all of the countries who buy russian gas without exception , " the statement quoted gazprom ceo alexei miller as saying . speaking to journalists alongside the belarussian prime minister , miller said the deal was signed at 11:58 pm -lrb- 20:58 gmt -rrb- on new year 's eve after months of tense negotiations , adding that belarus had been offered " the best conditions . " he said that russia would pay 2.5 billion dollars for a 50 percent stake in beltransgaz over the next four years . the transit price for russian gas supplies across belarus would be increased to $ 1.45 for 1,000 cubic meters traveling 100 kilometers , from 0.75 dollars at present , he said . disruptions avoided the last-minute deal came as russia was on the verge of cutting gas supplies to belarus , which could have disruptions to western europe . without an accord on a new five-year contract gazprom had warned that it would move towards cutting off supplies to belarus from 0700 gmt monday .
a cut in supplies like that suffered briefly by ukraine in a similar price dispute last january would have been a major blow to the country 's economy . there were also concerns in the european union that the row would impact on russian gas exports to western europe , 20 percent of which transit through belarus , meeting about five percent of eu natural gas needs . end of subsidies gazprom , a state-owned giant that produces a third of the world 's gas , has mounted a tough campaign to end soviet-era subsidies to neighboring countries , as well as expand ownership of infrastructure and other energy businesses throughout europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : before the deal was reached belarussians were preparing to heat with wood the company says it wants to put pricing on a market basis .
critics , including many in western europe , fear the kremlin seeks to use gazprom as a tool to reimpose part of its dominance lost at the time of the 1991 collapse of the soviet union . belarus , which lies sandwiched between russia and the european union , is in a loose economic and political partnership with russia and has always argued that gas import prices should be similar to those paid within russia . western governments gave strong diplomatic backing to ukraine 's pro-western president , viktor yushchenko , during the gas row at the start of 2006 , but belarus ' authoritarian leader lukashenko is a political pariah in europe and the united states . the eu has limited itself to calling on the two parties to reach a deal that does not threaten european supplies , while the authorities in france and germany say they are not worried by the prospect of shortages . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de russia belarus gas pricing row sparks jitters in europe russia and belarus are meeting to try and defuse a gas war that could threaten supplies to the eu .
the spat raises new concerns about eu energy dependence on russia .
-lrb- 29.12.2006 -rrb- belarus threatens to stop gas deliveries to europe belarus implied that unless russian gas giant gazprom backs off of demands for a hefty price increase , it might keep gas from being transported through its pipelines to western europe .

the eu , already burdened with 20 official languages , officially promotes linguistic diversity but often defaults to english . bulgarian , romanian and gaelic will become official eu languages on jan .
1 , further complicating europe 's ability to communicate . since its inception , the eu has been multilingual and working with multiple languages has always proved challenging .
the interpreting and translating require large amounts of money and linguistic finesse .
but in this babel-like environment , english often ends up being the language used in official business . multilingualism a priority bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the demand for interpreters is high , and growing yet the eu remains committed to multilingualism , even as bulgaria and romania join monday , bringing two additional languages with them . " the diversity of languages is our common richness and the promotion of this diversity is a clear priority , " said europe 's commissioner for multilingualism , jan figel . when the eu is enlarged , a number of official languages climbs .
but even within member states , regional languages and bilingualism are promoted .
irish gaelic is a case in point , which is also being added to the eu language roster , a move seen by its advocates as a way to promote the irish language . currently , the eu 's three main institutions employ approximately 4,000 interpreters and translators .
another 1,500 freelancers are also used .
this costs eu taxpayers close to 1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.3 billion -rrb- each year , " less than one percent of the total budget , " as the european commission likes to stress . even with all this money , the eu is short of people , particularly those who are fluent in less frequently spoken languages .

the eu , already burdened with 20 official languages , officially promotes linguistic diversity but often defaults to english . bulgarian , romanian and gaelic will become official eu languages on jan .
1 , further complicating europe 's ability to communicate . since its inception , the eu has been multilingual and working with multiple languages has always proved challenging .
the interpreting and translating require large amounts of money and linguistic finesse .
but in this babel-like environment , english often ends up being the language used in official business . multilingualism a priority bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the demand for interpreters is high , and growing yet the eu remains committed to multilingualism , even as bulgaria and romania join monday , bringing two additional languages with them . " the diversity of languages is our common richness and the promotion of this diversity is a clear priority , " said europe 's commissioner for multilingualism , jan figel . when the eu is enlarged , a number of official languages climbs .
but even within member states , regional languages and bilingualism are promoted .
irish gaelic is a case in point , which is also being added to the eu language roster , a move seen by its advocates as a way to promote the irish language . currently , the eu 's three main institutions employ approximately 4,000 interpreters and translators .
another 1,500 freelancers are also used .
this costs eu taxpayers close to 1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.3 billion -rrb- each year , " less than one percent of the total budget , " as the european commission likes to stress . even with all this money , the eu is short of people , particularly those who are fluent in less frequently spoken languages .
one way around this is to use a relay system .

" the belarussian side , in a difficult atmosphere on the eve of the new year , signed an agreement on unfortunate terms , " belarus ' prime minister sergei sidorsky told journalists in moscow . as part of the deal belarus has agreed to sell 50 percent of its strategically important gas pipeline operator beltransgaz to russian gas monopoly gazprom - a move earlier resisted by the belarussian government - the russian company said in a statement . under the deal , belarus will pay 100 dollars for 1,000 cubic meters of gas in 2007 , just below the 105 dollars earlier demanded by russia , but far higher than the 45 dollars charged under the previous contract , gazprom said . market price over the five years covered by the contract , the price of gas will climb annually to reach the " market price " charged to western european customers , the statement said . most of gazprom 's eu customers pay over 200 dollars per 1,000 cubic meters of russian gas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belarus ' prime minister sidorsky , left , and gazprom chief miller at a monday news conference in moscow " gazprom is undertaking a move to market principles of cooperation with all of the countries who buy russian gas without exception , " the statement quoted gazprom ceo alexei miller as saying . speaking to journalists alongside the belarussian prime minister , miller said the deal was signed at 11:58 pm -lrb- 20:58 gmt -rrb- on new year 's eve after months of tense negotiations , adding that belarus had been offered " the best conditions . " he said that russia would pay 2.5 billion dollars for a 50 percent stake in beltransgaz over the next four years . the transit price for russian gas supplies across belarus would be increased to $ 1.45 for 1,000 cubic meters traveling 100 kilometers , from 0.75 dollars at present , he said . disruptions avoided the last-minute deal came as russia was on the verge of cutting gas supplies to belarus , which could have disruptions to western europe . without an accord on a new five-year contract gazprom had warned that it would move towards cutting off supplies to belarus from 0700 gmt monday .
a cut in supplies like that suffered briefly by ukraine in a similar price dispute last january would have been a major blow to the country 's economy . there were also concerns in the european union that the row would impact on russian gas exports to western europe , 20 percent of which transit through belarus , meeting about five percent of eu natural gas needs . end of subsidies gazprom , a state-owned giant that produces a third of the world 's gas , has mounted a tough campaign to end soviet-era subsidies to neighboring countries , as well as expand ownership of infrastructure and other energy businesses throughout europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : before the deal was reached belarussians were preparing to heat with wood the company says it wants to put pricing on a market basis .
critics , including many in western europe , fear the kremlin seeks to use gazprom as a tool to reimpose part of its dominance lost at the time of the 1991 collapse of the soviet union . belarus , which lies sandwiched between russia and the european union , is in a loose economic and political partnership with russia and has always argued that gas import prices should be similar to those paid within russia . western governments gave strong diplomatic backing to ukraine 's pro-western president , viktor yushchenko , during the gas row at the start of 2006 , but belarus ' authoritarian leader lukashenko is a political pariah in europe and the united states . the eu has limited itself to calling on the two parties to reach a deal that does not threaten european supplies , while the authorities in france and germany say they are not worried by the prospect of shortages . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de russia belarus gas pricing row sparks jitters in europe russia and belarus are meeting to try and defuse a gas war that could threaten supplies to the eu .

" the belarussian side , in a difficult atmosphere on the eve of the new year , signed an agreement on unfortunate terms , " belarus ' prime minister sergei sidorsky told journalists in moscow . as part of the deal belarus has agreed to sell 50 percent of its strategically important gas pipeline operator beltransgaz to russian gas monopoly gazprom - a move earlier resisted by the belarussian government - the russian company said in a statement . under the deal , belarus will pay 100 dollars for 1,000 cubic meters of gas in 2007 , just below the 105 dollars earlier demanded by russia , but far higher than the 45 dollars charged under the previous contract , gazprom said . market price over the five years covered by the contract , the price of gas will climb annually to reach the " market price " charged to western european customers , the statement said . most of gazprom 's eu customers pay over 200 dollars per 1,000 cubic meters of russian gas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belarus ' prime minister sidorsky , left , and gazprom chief miller at a monday news conference in moscow " gazprom is undertaking a move to market principles of cooperation with all of the countries who buy russian gas without exception , " the statement quoted gazprom ceo alexei miller as saying . speaking to journalists alongside the belarussian prime minister , miller said the deal was signed at 11:58 pm -lrb- 20:58 gmt -rrb- on new year 's eve after months of tense negotiations , adding that belarus had been offered " the best conditions .

" only a united europe can tackle the challenges of globalization including international trade but also violence , terror and war , " she said . " a divided europe is doomed to failure . " germany wants to restart mideast peace process bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany will renew efforts to find a solution to mideast troubles merkel and foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier have called for a january meeting to " revitalize " the middle east quartet - grouping the eu , the united states , the united nations and russia - to help kick start peace efforts between israel and the palestinians . the chancellor will meet us president george w. bush in washington next week amid grumbling in europe that the united states has let the peace process languish as iraq has consumed its attention . steinmeier has said the aim is for the quartet to exercise a " stabilizing " influence in the region and encourage preliminary talks between israeli prime minister ehud olmert and palestinian president mahmud abbas to continue . breathing new life into dead eu treaty the most pressing item for europe , meanwhile , is the stalled constitution , especially with the jan .
1 entry of romania and bulgaria boosting the number of member states to 27 . merkel has cautioned against overly high expectations when germany takes over the eu brief from finland , saying that half a year may not be sufficient to resurrect a treaty that has been in the deep freeze for more than 18 months . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " no to the constitution " - french voters dealt a blow to the treaty it was precisely because of the rapid enlargement of the bloc in 2004 that the 200-page constitution was drawn up in a bid to streamline decision-making and give the eu a stronger international voice .
its highly damaging rejection last year by voters in france and the netherlands - two founding members of the eu - has overshadowed the fact that 18 countries have ratified it . germany has promised to present a " roadmap " of how to get the constitution back on track .
" our goal is to present a specific plan by the end of our presidency in which the timetable and the contours of a solution are laid out , " steinmeier told saturday 's bild newspaper . energy security and climate protection under both presidencies , energy security and climate protection will loom large . the eu wants to forge a common position for negotiations on the successor to the kyoto protocol which runs out in 2012 .
germany would like the bloc to commit to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 30 percent by 2020 . merkel believes europe would be strengthened if it negotiated with one voice with major suppliers such as russia and diversified . " europe must reduce its dependence in order to secure its long-term energy supply , " she wrote in friday 's handelsblatt newspaper .
" it must also speak with one voice on foreign energy relations . " beyond energy , checking the destabilizing influence of highly speculative hedge funds and removing obstacles to faster economic growth in africa will top the agenda when germany takes the helm of the g8 from russia . the highlight of the g8 presidency will be the june summit in the baltic resort heiligendamm , attended by the leaders of britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan , russia and the united states . seeking fairer growth distribution " the goal will be to identify imbalances and to determine what can be done to ensure more balanced global growth , " said bernd pfaffenbach , an aide to merkel , adding that promoting " global prosperity " will be theme of the meeting . the imbalances plaguing world economic momentum are already well-known : the us trade and current account deficits , the massive foreign exchange reserves held by the china , constraints on growth in europe and obstacles to faster economic gains in africa . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany at the helm of the g8 will push for more efforts to tackle africa 's problems merkel wants to forge a privileged partnership between the g8 and those african governments that are committed to corruption-free administration and to strengthening democratic reform . on financial markets , germany will press for greater transparency and political monitoring of speculative hedge funds , which are seen by berlin - and increasingly by some of its partners - as a destabilizing element in global finance . germany now has the backing of the united states , which for years had been reluctant to go along with vigorous market supervision .
but pfaffenbach acknowledged that merkel will probably have to be content with simply " a final declaration that calls for greater transparency . " germany is also expected to push for a more rational use of energy resources and hopes to spark discussion on a follow-up to the kyoto protocol on reducing greenhouse gas emissions , which expires in 2012 . berlin in addition wants to include mexico , india , china , brazil and south africa , countries that are not members of the g8 , in the climate talks . the fate of the doha round of multilateral trade liberalization negotiations , currently deadlocked , is likely to hover over the g8 next year .
but germany , apart from general statements citing the need to complete the doha process , has so far steered clear from any deeper involvement . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german global clout grows as berlin heads eu , g8 germany 's growing economic , political and military role will be spotlighted in 2007 when berlin holds the rotating presidencies of both the european union and the g8 club of industrial nations .

the eu , already burdened with 20 official languages , officially promotes linguistic diversity but often defaults to english . bulgarian , romanian and gaelic will become official eu languages on jan .
1 , further complicating europe 's ability to communicate . since its inception , the eu has been multilingual and working with multiple languages has always proved challenging .
the interpreting and translating require large amounts of money and linguistic finesse .
but in this babel-like environment , english often ends up being the language used in official business . multilingualism a priority bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the demand for interpreters is high , and growing yet the eu remains committed to multilingualism , even as bulgaria and romania join monday , bringing two additional languages with them . " the diversity of languages is our common richness and the promotion of this diversity is a clear priority , " said europe 's commissioner for multilingualism , jan figel . when the eu is enlarged , a number of official languages climbs .
but even within member states , regional languages and bilingualism are promoted .
irish gaelic is a case in point , which is also being added to the eu language roster , a move seen by its advocates as a way to promote the irish language . currently , the eu 's three main institutions employ approximately 4,000 interpreters and translators .
another 1,500 freelancers are also used .
this costs eu taxpayers close to 1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.3 billion -rrb- each year , " less than one percent of the total budget , " as the european commission likes to stress . even with all this money , the eu is short of people , particularly those who are fluent in less frequently spoken languages .
one way around this is to use a relay system .
an interpreter who translates from english into dutch might use the translation of an english-speaking colleague for a politician who is speaking greek , since greek to dutch translators can be hard to find .
this demands high precision , speed and concentration during live events such as meetings or press conferences . those working in brussels are " under constant pressure to learn more languages , " said patrice liberman , a belgian interpreter working for the eu since 1991 . he already speaks eight : dutch , english , french , german , italian , polish , russian and spanish . english often the default language bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu promotes linguistic diversity with so many languages entering conversations , english often becomes dominant by default .
most of the 2.8 million pages of documents produced by the eu in 2005 were written in english .
translation into the eu 's other two " big " working languages - french and german - happens later . the number of interpreters can not keep pace with the growing number of languages and language combinations .
this means the " smaller " tongues are often translated only at big meetings .
as a result , officials tend to speak english themselves or listen to english translations of remarks and questions .
this makes bad english a linguistic currency in brussels and frustrates translators . " we do n't want to be only decorative , we want to be listened to , " said ieva zauberga , a latvian who moved to brussels when her country joined the eu two years ago . the eu 's multilinguism does n't show any signs of halting .
croatia could be next , as its entry is scheduled for 2009-2010 .
starting next summer , a new building will have 30 studios for interpreters , instead of the 21 currently available . but the prediction is that the hiring problems wo n't disappear , making english increasingly europe 's lingua franca . dw staff / afp -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de romanian to become eu 's first commissioner for multilingualism the european parliament approved romania 's candidate for the post of commissioner for multilingualism .

" only a united europe can tackle the challenges of globalization including international trade but also violence , terror and war , " she said . " a divided europe is doomed to failure . " germany wants to restart mideast peace process bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany will renew efforts to find a solution to mideast troubles merkel and foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier have called for a january meeting to " revitalize " the middle east quartet - grouping the eu , the united states , the united nations and russia - to help kick start peace efforts between israel and the palestinians . the chancellor will meet us president george w. bush in washington next week amid grumbling in europe that the united states has let the peace process languish as iraq has consumed its attention . steinmeier has said the aim is for the quartet to exercise a " stabilizing " influence in the region and encourage preliminary talks between israeli prime minister ehud olmert and palestinian president mahmud abbas to continue . breathing new life into dead eu treaty the most pressing item for europe , meanwhile , is the stalled constitution , especially with the jan .

its highly damaging rejection last year by voters in france and the netherlands - two founding members of the eu - has overshadowed the fact that 18 countries have ratified it . germany has promised to present a " roadmap " of how to get the constitution back on track .
" our goal is to present a specific plan by the end of our presidency in which the timetable and the contours of a solution are laid out , " steinmeier told saturday 's bild newspaper . energy security and climate protection under both presidencies , energy security and climate protection will loom large . the eu wants to forge a common position for negotiations on the successor to the kyoto protocol which runs out in 2012 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the german eu presidency a dummy 's guide to the eu german fm : kosovo biggest problem right now commission proposes eu-wide green card for migrants germany determined to strengthen european police agency eu expansion -pipe- 01.01.2007 pumping up the volume of europe 's multilingualism großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : irish gaelic is now official in brussels the european union has a new year 's challenge : to assimilate three new languages in 2007 .
the eu , already burdened with 20 official languages , officially promotes linguistic diversity but often defaults to english . bulgarian , romanian and gaelic will become official eu languages on jan .
1 , further complicating europe 's ability to communicate . since its inception , the eu has been multilingual and working with multiple languages has always proved challenging .
the interpreting and translating require large amounts of money and linguistic finesse .
but in this babel-like environment , english often ends up being the language used in official business . multilingualism a priority bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the demand for interpreters is high , and growing yet the eu remains committed to multilingualism , even as bulgaria and romania join monday , bringing two additional languages with them . " the diversity of languages is our common richness and the promotion of this diversity is a clear priority , " said europe 's commissioner for multilingualism , jan figel . when the eu is enlarged , a number of official languages climbs .
but even within member states , regional languages and bilingualism are promoted .
irish gaelic is a case in point , which is also being added to the eu language roster , a move seen by its advocates as a way to promote the irish language . currently , the eu 's three main institutions employ approximately 4,000 interpreters and translators .
another 1,500 freelancers are also used .
this costs eu taxpayers close to 1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.3 billion -rrb- each year , " less than one percent of the total budget , " as the european commission likes to stress . even with all this money , the eu is short of people , particularly those who are fluent in less frequently spoken languages .
one way around this is to use a relay system .
an interpreter who translates from english into dutch might use the translation of an english-speaking colleague for a politician who is speaking greek , since greek to dutch translators can be hard to find .
this demands high precision , speed and concentration during live events such as meetings or press conferences . those working in brussels are " under constant pressure to learn more languages , " said patrice liberman , a belgian interpreter working for the eu since 1991 . he already speaks eight : dutch , english , french , german , italian , polish , russian and spanish . english often the default language bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu promotes linguistic diversity with so many languages entering conversations , english often becomes dominant by default .
most of the 2.8 million pages of documents produced by the eu in 2005 were written in english .
translation into the eu 's other two " big " working languages - french and german - happens later . the number of interpreters can not keep pace with the growing number of languages and language combinations .
this means the " smaller " tongues are often translated only at big meetings .
as a result , officials tend to speak english themselves or listen to english translations of remarks and questions .
this makes bad english a linguistic currency in brussels and frustrates translators . " we do n't want to be only decorative , we want to be listened to , " said ieva zauberga , a latvian who moved to brussels when her country joined the eu two years ago . the eu 's multilinguism does n't show any signs of halting .
croatia could be next , as its entry is scheduled for 2009-2010 .
starting next summer , a new building will have 30 studios for interpreters , instead of the 21 currently available . but the prediction is that the hiring problems wo n't disappear , making english increasingly europe 's lingua franca . dw staff / afp -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de romanian to become eu 's first commissioner for multilingualism the european parliament approved romania 's candidate for the post of commissioner for multilingualism .
doubts remain as to how influential leonard orban 's role will be .

the eu , already burdened with 20 official languages , officially promotes linguistic diversity but often defaults to english . bulgarian , romanian and gaelic will become official eu languages on jan .
1 , further complicating europe 's ability to communicate . since its inception , the eu has been multilingual and working with multiple languages has always proved challenging .
the interpreting and translating require large amounts of money and linguistic finesse .
but in this babel-like environment , english often ends up being the language used in official business . multilingualism a priority bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the demand for interpreters is high , and growing yet the eu remains committed to multilingualism , even as bulgaria and romania join monday , bringing two additional languages with them . " the diversity of languages is our common richness and the promotion of this diversity is a clear priority , " said europe 's commissioner for multilingualism , jan figel . when the eu is enlarged , a number of official languages climbs .
but even within member states , regional languages and bilingualism are promoted .
irish gaelic is a case in point , which is also being added to the eu language roster , a move seen by its advocates as a way to promote the irish language . currently , the eu 's three main institutions employ approximately 4,000 interpreters and translators .
another 1,500 freelancers are also used .
this costs eu taxpayers close to 1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.3 billion -rrb- each year , " less than one percent of the total budget , " as the european commission likes to stress . even with all this money , the eu is short of people , particularly those who are fluent in less frequently spoken languages .
one way around this is to use a relay system .
an interpreter who translates from english into dutch might use the translation of an english-speaking colleague for a politician who is speaking greek , since greek to dutch translators can be hard to find .
this demands high precision , speed and concentration during live events such as meetings or press conferences . those working in brussels are " under constant pressure to learn more languages , " said patrice liberman , a belgian interpreter working for the eu since 1991 . he already speaks eight : dutch , english , french , german , italian , polish , russian and spanish . english often the default language bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu promotes linguistic diversity with so many languages entering conversations , english often becomes dominant by default .
most of the 2.8 million pages of documents produced by the eu in 2005 were written in english .
translation into the eu 's other two " big " working languages - french and german - happens later . the number of interpreters can not keep pace with the growing number of languages and language combinations .
this means the " smaller " tongues are often translated only at big meetings .
as a result , officials tend to speak english themselves or listen to english translations of remarks and questions .
this makes bad english a linguistic currency in brussels and frustrates translators . " we do n't want to be only decorative , we want to be listened to , " said ieva zauberga , a latvian who moved to brussels when her country joined the eu two years ago . the eu 's multilinguism does n't show any signs of halting .
croatia could be next , as its entry is scheduled for 2009-2010 .
starting next summer , a new building will have 30 studios for interpreters , instead of the 21 currently available . but the prediction is that the hiring problems wo n't disappear , making english increasingly europe 's lingua franca . dw staff / afp -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de romanian to become eu 's first commissioner for multilingualism the european parliament approved romania 's candidate for the post of commissioner for multilingualism .
doubts remain as to how influential leonard orban 's role will be .

they 're finding inspiration in the city 's history and the eclectic fashion they see on the streets . the esmod international fashion school in berlin felt hectic as students put the final touches on their clothes .
the theme of the student show was " rubble women , " and each student had created an outfit in two weeks . the show conjures up the era of trümmerfrauen , the so-called rubble women who cleaned away the debris from the streets of bombed german cities at the end of world war ii . every detail of the long , blue overcoat was important to 21-year-old noa .
it would be modeled by her classmate eva . " eva is perfect for my outfit .
it is exactly her style and goes well with her blue eyes - they 're the same color as my jacket , " noa said . the jacket felt cool , retro and tough , said eva , enthusiastic about her modeling responsibilities . " i love clothes that you can put on and really feel like you have superpowers , " noa said . an international flair bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's never dull at an esmod show noa left tel aviv and her native israel five months ago to study at esmod in berlin .
the fashion school was founded 165 years ago in paris .
now , there are schools in various countries and a worldwide network where students experience the international field of fashion design . fashion has always been one of noa 's most important hobbies .
in israel , most people did n't understand her personal style .
black is her favorite color and she has nose and mouth piercings . " i came to berlin just to study fashion design , because fashion is so free here .
you can wear what you want .
there are so many different styles , it is truly eclectic ; " she said .
" and i believe there is a lot of inspiration in this environment . " noa is one of 30 first-year fashion students at esmod in berlin .
many of her classmates have also come from other countries to complete the three year program . fashion students need to have a very international focus , said carla steinborn , a teacher at the berlin school .
to be innovative , designers must understand what cutting techniques and material treatments are being used so that they can truly innovate , steinborn said . " when one wants to be successful today , one should think globally and also know what 's in demand in japan , " she said . dreaming big bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fashion design students say berlin provides inspiration for their work yong , from china , hopes to use the international contacts he makes at esmod to launch his own design career .
yong skillfully pushed the fabric under the needle of the sewing machine , while discussing his future plans . " my big dream would be to make couture .
i would love to start my own label in china .
there , i have more opportunities , " he said .
" we were poor , but now there are people who are actually very wealthy and could really afford such things . " asade , an iranian , wants to be trained in fashion , but does not want to return to her home country .
in iran , it 's less likely that her fashion work will bring her attention . " we have fewer opportunities because fashion is not an issue on television or on the street .
everything is secret and takes place in private circles , " asade said . she 's enjoying the new fashion freedom , and likes to combine things that at first glance seem odd : frayed jeans with glittery tops and head scarves .

the eu , already burdened with 20 official languages , officially promotes linguistic diversity but often defaults to english . bulgarian , romanian and gaelic will become official eu languages on jan .
1 , further complicating europe 's ability to communicate . since its inception , the eu has been multilingual and working with multiple languages has always proved challenging .
the interpreting and translating require large amounts of money and linguistic finesse .
but in this babel-like environment , english often ends up being the language used in official business . multilingualism a priority bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the demand for interpreters is high , and growing yet the eu remains committed to multilingualism , even as bulgaria and romania join monday , bringing two additional languages with them . " the diversity of languages is our common richness and the promotion of this diversity is a clear priority , " said europe 's commissioner for multilingualism , jan figel . when the eu is enlarged , a number of official languages climbs .
but even within member states , regional languages and bilingualism are promoted .
irish gaelic is a case in point , which is also being added to the eu language roster , a move seen by its advocates as a way to promote the irish language . currently , the eu 's three main institutions employ approximately 4,000 interpreters and translators .
another 1,500 freelancers are also used .
this costs eu taxpayers close to 1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.3 billion -rrb- each year , " less than one percent of the total budget , " as the european commission likes to stress . even with all this money , the eu is short of people , particularly those who are fluent in less frequently spoken languages .
one way around this is to use a relay system .
an interpreter who translates from english into dutch might use the translation of an english-speaking colleague for a politician who is speaking greek , since greek to dutch translators can be hard to find .
this demands high precision , speed and concentration during live events such as meetings or press conferences . those working in brussels are " under constant pressure to learn more languages , " said patrice liberman , a belgian interpreter working for the eu since 1991 . he already speaks eight : dutch , english , french , german , italian , polish , russian and spanish . english often the default language bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu promotes linguistic diversity with so many languages entering conversations , english often becomes dominant by default .
most of the 2.8 million pages of documents produced by the eu in 2005 were written in english .
translation into the eu 's other two " big " working languages - french and german - happens later . the number of interpreters can not keep pace with the growing number of languages and language combinations .
this means the " smaller " tongues are often translated only at big meetings .
as a result , officials tend to speak english themselves or listen to english translations of remarks and questions .
this makes bad english a linguistic currency in brussels and frustrates translators . " we do n't want to be only decorative , we want to be listened to , " said ieva zauberga , a latvian who moved to brussels when her country joined the eu two years ago . the eu 's multilinguism does n't show any signs of halting .
croatia could be next , as its entry is scheduled for 2009-2010 .
starting next summer , a new building will have 30 studios for interpreters , instead of the 21 currently available . but the prediction is that the hiring problems wo n't disappear , making english increasingly europe 's lingua franca . dw staff / afp -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de romanian to become eu 's first commissioner for multilingualism the european parliament approved romania 's candidate for the post of commissioner for multilingualism .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 01.01.2007 germany faces daunting agenda for eu , g8 presidencies großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel will need to draw on all her diplomatic skills in the first half of 2007 germany will fight to revive international efforts for middle east peace , relaunch the eu constitution and advocate a gentler form of globalization when it takes over the presidencies of the eu and the g8 monday . as the biggest economy and most populous country in europe , germany faces high hopes to deliver progress during its six-month eu tenure and its year-long stint at the head of the world 's eight most industrialized nations . berlin has set ambitious targets and achieving them will test the diplomatic powers of chancellor angela merkel , who has already won widespread praise for her approach to foreign policy since taking over in november 2005 . she told germans in a new year 's speech sunday that the dual presidencies presented a unique opportunity to help shape europe 's future in a globalized world . " only a united europe can tackle the challenges of globalization including international trade but also violence , terror and war , " she said . " a divided europe is doomed to failure . " germany wants to restart mideast peace process bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany will renew efforts to find a solution to mideast troubles merkel and foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier have called for a january meeting to " revitalize " the middle east quartet - grouping the eu , the united states , the united nations and russia - to help kick start peace efforts between israel and the palestinians . the chancellor will meet us president george w. bush in washington next week amid grumbling in europe that the united states has let the peace process languish as iraq has consumed its attention . steinmeier has said the aim is for the quartet to exercise a " stabilizing " influence in the region and encourage preliminary talks between israeli prime minister ehud olmert and palestinian president mahmud abbas to continue . breathing new life into dead eu treaty the most pressing item for europe , meanwhile , is the stalled constitution , especially with the jan .
1 entry of romania and bulgaria boosting the number of member states to 27 . merkel has cautioned against overly high expectations when germany takes over the eu brief from finland , saying that half a year may not be sufficient to resurrect a treaty that has been in the deep freeze for more than 18 months . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " no to the constitution " - french voters dealt a blow to the treaty it was precisely because of the rapid enlargement of the bloc in 2004 that the 200-page constitution was drawn up in a bid to streamline decision-making and give the eu a stronger international voice .
its highly damaging rejection last year by voters in france and the netherlands - two founding members of the eu - has overshadowed the fact that 18 countries have ratified it . germany has promised to present a " roadmap " of how to get the constitution back on track .
" our goal is to present a specific plan by the end of our presidency in which the timetable and the contours of a solution are laid out , " steinmeier told saturday 's bild newspaper . energy security and climate protection under both presidencies , energy security and climate protection will loom large . the eu wants to forge a common position for negotiations on the successor to the kyoto protocol which runs out in 2012 .
germany would like the bloc to commit to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 30 percent by 2020 . merkel believes europe would be strengthened if it negotiated with one voice with major suppliers such as russia and diversified . " europe must reduce its dependence in order to secure its long-term energy supply , " she wrote in friday 's handelsblatt newspaper .
" it must also speak with one voice on foreign energy relations .

" only a united europe can tackle the challenges of globalization including international trade but also violence , terror and war , " she said . " a divided europe is doomed to failure . " germany wants to restart mideast peace process bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany will renew efforts to find a solution to mideast troubles merkel and foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier have called for a january meeting to " revitalize " the middle east quartet - grouping the eu , the united states , the united nations and russia - to help kick start peace efforts between israel and the palestinians . the chancellor will meet us president george w. bush in washington next week amid grumbling in europe that the united states has let the peace process languish as iraq has consumed its attention . steinmeier has said the aim is for the quartet to exercise a " stabilizing " influence in the region and encourage preliminary talks between israeli prime minister ehud olmert and palestinian president mahmud abbas to continue . breathing new life into dead eu treaty the most pressing item for europe , meanwhile , is the stalled constitution , especially with the jan .
1 entry of romania and bulgaria boosting the number of member states to 27 . merkel has cautioned against overly high expectations when germany takes over the eu brief from finland , saying that half a year may not be sufficient to resurrect a treaty that has been in the deep freeze for more than 18 months . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " no to the constitution " - french voters dealt a blow to the treaty it was precisely because of the rapid enlargement of the bloc in 2004 that the 200-page constitution was drawn up in a bid to streamline decision-making and give the eu a stronger international voice .
its highly damaging rejection last year by voters in france and the netherlands - two founding members of the eu - has overshadowed the fact that 18 countries have ratified it . germany has promised to present a " roadmap " of how to get the constitution back on track .
" our goal is to present a specific plan by the end of our presidency in which the timetable and the contours of a solution are laid out , " steinmeier told saturday 's bild newspaper . energy security and climate protection under both presidencies , energy security and climate protection will loom large . the eu wants to forge a common position for negotiations on the successor to the kyoto protocol which runs out in 2012 .
germany would like the bloc to commit to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 30 percent by 2020 . merkel believes europe would be strengthened if it negotiated with one voice with major suppliers such as russia and diversified . " europe must reduce its dependence in order to secure its long-term energy supply , " she wrote in friday 's handelsblatt newspaper .
" it must also speak with one voice on foreign energy relations . " beyond energy , checking the destabilizing influence of highly speculative hedge funds and removing obstacles to faster economic growth in africa will top the agenda when germany takes the helm of the g8 from russia . the highlight of the g8 presidency will be the june summit in the baltic resort heiligendamm , attended by the leaders of britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan , russia and the united states . seeking fairer growth distribution " the goal will be to identify imbalances and to determine what can be done to ensure more balanced global growth , " said bernd pfaffenbach , an aide to merkel , adding that promoting " global prosperity " will be theme of the meeting . the imbalances plaguing world economic momentum are already well-known : the us trade and current account deficits , the massive foreign exchange reserves held by the china , constraints on growth in europe and obstacles to faster economic gains in africa . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany at the helm of the g8 will push for more efforts to tackle africa 's problems merkel wants to forge a privileged partnership between the g8 and those african governments that are committed to corruption-free administration and to strengthening democratic reform . on financial markets , germany will press for greater transparency and political monitoring of speculative hedge funds , which are seen by berlin - and increasingly by some of its partners - as a destabilizing element in global finance . germany now has the backing of the united states , which for years had been reluctant to go along with vigorous market supervision .

" the belarussian side , in a difficult atmosphere on the eve of the new year , signed an agreement on unfortunate terms , " belarus ' prime minister sergei sidorsky told journalists in moscow . as part of the deal belarus has agreed to sell 50 percent of its strategically important gas pipeline operator beltransgaz to russian gas monopoly gazprom - a move earlier resisted by the belarussian government - the russian company said in a statement . under the deal , belarus will pay 100 dollars for 1,000 cubic meters of gas in 2007 , just below the 105 dollars earlier demanded by russia , but far higher than the 45 dollars charged under the previous contract , gazprom said . market price over the five years covered by the contract , the price of gas will climb annually to reach the " market price " charged to western european customers , the statement said . most of gazprom 's eu customers pay over 200 dollars per 1,000 cubic meters of russian gas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belarus ' prime minister sidorsky , left , and gazprom chief miller at a monday news conference in moscow " gazprom is undertaking a move to market principles of cooperation with all of the countries who buy russian gas without exception , " the statement quoted gazprom ceo alexei miller as saying . speaking to journalists alongside the belarussian prime minister , miller said the deal was signed at 11:58 pm -lrb- 20:58 gmt -rrb- on new year 's eve after months of tense negotiations , adding that belarus had been offered " the best conditions .

" the belarussian side , in a difficult atmosphere on the eve of the new year , signed an agreement on unfortunate terms , " belarus ' prime minister sergei sidorsky told journalists in moscow . as part of the deal belarus has agreed to sell 50 percent of its strategically important gas pipeline operator beltransgaz to russian gas monopoly gazprom - a move earlier resisted by the belarussian government - the russian company said in a statement . under the deal , belarus will pay 100 dollars for 1,000 cubic meters of gas in 2007 , just below the 105 dollars earlier demanded by russia , but far higher than the 45 dollars charged under the previous contract , gazprom said . market price over the five years covered by the contract , the price of gas will climb annually to reach the " market price " charged to western european customers , the statement said . most of gazprom 's eu customers pay over 200 dollars per 1,000 cubic meters of russian gas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belarus ' prime minister sidorsky , left , and gazprom chief miller at a monday news conference in moscow " gazprom is undertaking a move to market principles of cooperation with all of the countries who buy russian gas without exception , " the statement quoted gazprom ceo alexei miller as saying . speaking to journalists alongside the belarussian prime minister , miller said the deal was signed at 11:58 pm -lrb- 20:58 gmt -rrb- on new year 's eve after months of tense negotiations , adding that belarus had been offered " the best conditions . " he said that russia would pay 2.5 billion dollars for a 50 percent stake in beltransgaz over the next four years . the transit price for russian gas supplies across belarus would be increased to $ 1.45 for 1,000 cubic meters traveling 100 kilometers , from 0.75 dollars at present , he said . disruptions avoided the last-minute deal came as russia was on the verge of cutting gas supplies to belarus , which could have disruptions to western europe . without an accord on a new five-year contract gazprom had warned that it would move towards cutting off supplies to belarus from 0700 gmt monday .
a cut in supplies like that suffered briefly by ukraine in a similar price dispute last january would have been a major blow to the country 's economy . there were also concerns in the european union that the row would impact on russian gas exports to western europe , 20 percent of which transit through belarus , meeting about five percent of eu natural gas needs . end of subsidies gazprom , a state-owned giant that produces a third of the world 's gas , has mounted a tough campaign to end soviet-era subsidies to neighboring countries , as well as expand ownership of infrastructure and other energy businesses throughout europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : before the deal was reached belarussians were preparing to heat with wood the company says it wants to put pricing on a market basis .
critics , including many in western europe , fear the kremlin seeks to use gazprom as a tool to reimpose part of its dominance lost at the time of the 1991 collapse of the soviet union . belarus , which lies sandwiched between russia and the european union , is in a loose economic and political partnership with russia and has always argued that gas import prices should be similar to those paid within russia . western governments gave strong diplomatic backing to ukraine 's pro-western president , viktor yushchenko , during the gas row at the start of 2006 , but belarus ' authoritarian leader lukashenko is a political pariah in europe and the united states . the eu has limited itself to calling on the two parties to reach a deal that does not threaten european supplies , while the authorities in france and germany say they are not worried by the prospect of shortages . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de russia belarus gas pricing row sparks jitters in europe russia and belarus are meeting to try and defuse a gas war that could threaten supplies to the eu .

" only a united europe can tackle the challenges of globalization including international trade but also violence , terror and war , " she said . " a divided europe is doomed to failure . " germany wants to restart mideast peace process bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany will renew efforts to find a solution to mideast troubles merkel and foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier have called for a january meeting to " revitalize " the middle east quartet - grouping the eu , the united states , the united nations and russia - to help kick start peace efforts between israel and the palestinians . the chancellor will meet us president george w. bush in washington next week amid grumbling in europe that the united states has let the peace process languish as iraq has consumed its attention . steinmeier has said the aim is for the quartet to exercise a " stabilizing " influence in the region and encourage preliminary talks between israeli prime minister ehud olmert and palestinian president mahmud abbas to continue . breathing new life into dead eu treaty the most pressing item for europe , meanwhile , is the stalled constitution , especially with the jan .
1 entry of romania and bulgaria boosting the number of member states to 27 . merkel has cautioned against overly high expectations when germany takes over the eu brief from finland , saying that half a year may not be sufficient to resurrect a treaty that has been in the deep freeze for more than 18 months . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " no to the constitution " - french voters dealt a blow to the treaty it was precisely because of the rapid enlargement of the bloc in 2004 that the 200-page constitution was drawn up in a bid to streamline decision-making and give the eu a stronger international voice .
its highly damaging rejection last year by voters in france and the netherlands - two founding members of the eu - has overshadowed the fact that 18 countries have ratified it . germany has promised to present a " roadmap " of how to get the constitution back on track .
" our goal is to present a specific plan by the end of our presidency in which the timetable and the contours of a solution are laid out , " steinmeier told saturday 's bild newspaper . energy security and climate protection under both presidencies , energy security and climate protection will loom large . the eu wants to forge a common position for negotiations on the successor to the kyoto protocol which runs out in 2012 .
germany would like the bloc to commit to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 30 percent by 2020 . merkel believes europe would be strengthened if it negotiated with one voice with major suppliers such as russia and diversified . " europe must reduce its dependence in order to secure its long-term energy supply , " she wrote in friday 's handelsblatt newspaper .
" it must also speak with one voice on foreign energy relations . " beyond energy , checking the destabilizing influence of highly speculative hedge funds and removing obstacles to faster economic growth in africa will top the agenda when germany takes the helm of the g8 from russia . the highlight of the g8 presidency will be the june summit in the baltic resort heiligendamm , attended by the leaders of britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan , russia and the united states . seeking fairer growth distribution " the goal will be to identify imbalances and to determine what can be done to ensure more balanced global growth , " said bernd pfaffenbach , an aide to merkel , adding that promoting " global prosperity " will be theme of the meeting . the imbalances plaguing world economic momentum are already well-known : the us trade and current account deficits , the massive foreign exchange reserves held by the china , constraints on growth in europe and obstacles to faster economic gains in africa . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany at the helm of the g8 will push for more efforts to tackle africa 's problems merkel wants to forge a privileged partnership between the g8 and those african governments that are committed to corruption-free administration and to strengthening democratic reform . on financial markets , germany will press for greater transparency and political monitoring of speculative hedge funds , which are seen by berlin - and increasingly by some of its partners - as a destabilizing element in global finance . germany now has the backing of the united states , which for years had been reluctant to go along with vigorous market supervision .
but pfaffenbach acknowledged that merkel will probably have to be content with simply " a final declaration that calls for greater transparency . " germany is also expected to push for a more rational use of energy resources and hopes to spark discussion on a follow-up to the kyoto protocol on reducing greenhouse gas emissions , which expires in 2012 . berlin in addition wants to include mexico , india , china , brazil and south africa , countries that are not members of the g8 , in the climate talks . the fate of the doha round of multilateral trade liberalization negotiations , currently deadlocked , is likely to hover over the g8 next year .
but germany , apart from general statements citing the need to complete the doha process , has so far steered clear from any deeper involvement . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german global clout grows as berlin heads eu , g8 germany 's growing economic , political and military role will be spotlighted in 2007 when berlin holds the rotating presidencies of both the european union and the g8 club of industrial nations .

hotlines are busy , with staff answering questions about the new currency .
common ones ask how long the tolar can be used and how long can it be exchanged for the euro . still , most slovenians are pretty relaxed about the change , said nada serajnik-sraka , who heads the euro information campaign for the government . " more than 80 percent are already familiar with the euro , " she said .
" slovenians travel a lot and are good business people so they usually already have euros in their wallets . " a success story five years after euro was introduced into the eu , three years after slovenia acceded to the eu and 15 years after slovenia declared independence from the former yugoslavia , slovenia 's adoption of the euro marks a new stage in the east-west integration of europe . " the euro is n't important only for our economy , we also expect psychological benefits ... we are coming closer to the most developed part of the eu and this will give -lrb- citizens -rrb- confidence , " slovenian prime minister janez jansa told the afp news agency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : inflation is expected to rise because of the change the tolar , which jansa described as a " success story , " was introduced in 1991 to cut off economic ties to the former yugoslavia . the accession to the eurozone is also a coup for slovenia as it is the only one of the 10 countries - eight former communist states plus malta and cyprus - that joined in 2004 to have met the tough maastricht criteria on public finances , inflation , interest and exchange rates that are required for euro-zone newcomers . smooth transition after eu finance ministers gave slovenia the green light last july to join the euro zone , the government and central bank had to carry out extensive preparations for the switch such as minting slovenian euro coins , distributing bills to banks and preparing the infrastructure for the changeover . the changeover to the single european currency foresees that tolars and euros will circulate simultaneously for only the first two weeks of january .
after that , banks and post offices will continue changing tolars into euros until the end of february .
from march on , only the central bank will continue changing tolars for euros .
the exchange rate will be one euro for 239.64 tolars . some say that transition wo n't be difficult because of slovenia 's readiness for the change and because of its history . " we have already had so many currencies here in slovenia , " said anja , a political science student who staffs the hotlines .
" i am only 23 and have already been through four currencies so imagine how my grandmother feels .
and many people calculate still in the dinar , the old yugoslavian currency , or in german marks .
often , people have had their savings in marks therefore the calculate in marks . " one concern is inflation to prevent a rounding upward of prices as happened when other nations changed over to the euro , the government introduced last march the double labelling of prices , in euros and tolars , which will remain in force for six months . despite this measure , slovenia 's main consumer association has warned that some prices have increased excessively already and it has opened a web site to shame stores accused of profiteering .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slovenia is small in size , but big in economic performance jansa said he did not think the hikes will push up inflation , which in november stood at 2.3 percent on a 12-month basis . " we did face some rising prices but it was not significant , " he said .
" last october we had a deflation of almost one percent -lrb- 0.8 percent -rrb- which was the biggest fall in slovenia 's history . " others following now the wealthiest of eight former communist states that joined the european union in 2004 , slovenia will mark another historic step in january 2008 when it becomes the first of the eu newcomers to take over the six-month eu presidency . the country will preside over the drive by other new eu states to join the euro .
cyprus and malta are expected to follow slovenia into the euro zone in 2008 and slovakia is aiming to adopt the single currency in 2009 .

1 entry of romania and bulgaria boosting the number of member states to 27 . merkel has cautioned against overly high expectations when germany takes over the eu brief from finland , saying that half a year may not be sufficient to resurrect a treaty that has been in the deep freeze for more than 18 months . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " no to the constitution " - french voters dealt a blow to the treaty it was precisely because of the rapid enlargement of the bloc in 2004 that the 200-page constitution was drawn up in a bid to streamline decision-making and give the eu a stronger international voice .
its highly damaging rejection last year by voters in france and the netherlands - two founding members of the eu - has overshadowed the fact that 18 countries have ratified it . germany has promised to present a " roadmap " of how to get the constitution back on track .
" our goal is to present a specific plan by the end of our presidency in which the timetable and the contours of a solution are laid out , " steinmeier told saturday 's bild newspaper . energy security and climate protection under both presidencies , energy security and climate protection will loom large . the eu wants to forge a common position for negotiations on the successor to the kyoto protocol which runs out in 2012 .
germany would like the bloc to commit to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 30 percent by 2020 . merkel believes europe would be strengthened if it negotiated with one voice with major suppliers such as russia and diversified . " europe must reduce its dependence in order to secure its long-term energy supply , " she wrote in friday 's handelsblatt newspaper .
" it must also speak with one voice on foreign energy relations . " beyond energy , checking the destabilizing influence of highly speculative hedge funds and removing obstacles to faster economic growth in africa will top the agenda when germany takes the helm of the g8 from russia . the highlight of the g8 presidency will be the june summit in the baltic resort heiligendamm , attended by the leaders of britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan , russia and the united states . seeking fairer growth distribution " the goal will be to identify imbalances and to determine what can be done to ensure more balanced global growth , " said bernd pfaffenbach , an aide to merkel , adding that promoting " global prosperity " will be theme of the meeting . the imbalances plaguing world economic momentum are already well-known : the us trade and current account deficits , the massive foreign exchange reserves held by the china , constraints on growth in europe and obstacles to faster economic gains in africa . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany at the helm of the g8 will push for more efforts to tackle africa 's problems merkel wants to forge a privileged partnership between the g8 and those african governments that are committed to corruption-free administration and to strengthening democratic reform . on financial markets , germany will press for greater transparency and political monitoring of speculative hedge funds , which are seen by berlin - and increasingly by some of its partners - as a destabilizing element in global finance . germany now has the backing of the united states , which for years had been reluctant to go along with vigorous market supervision .
but pfaffenbach acknowledged that merkel will probably have to be content with simply " a final declaration that calls for greater transparency . " germany is also expected to push for a more rational use of energy resources and hopes to spark discussion on a follow-up to the kyoto protocol on reducing greenhouse gas emissions , which expires in 2012 . berlin in addition wants to include mexico , india , china , brazil and south africa , countries that are not members of the g8 , in the climate talks . the fate of the doha round of multilateral trade liberalization negotiations , currently deadlocked , is likely to hover over the g8 next year .
but germany , apart from general statements citing the need to complete the doha process , has so far steered clear from any deeper involvement . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : german global clout grows as berlin heads eu , g8 germany 's growing economic , political and military role will be spotlighted in 2007 when berlin holds the rotating presidencies of both the european union and the g8 club of industrial nations .

tens of thousands attended concerts in the two capitals , bucharest and sofia .
the romanian president said eu entry was an " enormous chance for future generations " , while bulgaria 's leader said it was a " heavenly moment " .
their accession means the eu now has 27 members and half a billion people , and stretches as far east as the black sea .

it is the road of our future .

" we arrived in europe .
welcome to europe , " mr basescu said on stage in university square , where he was joined by eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn and government ministers .
foreign ministers of germany , denmark , austria and hungary , who were also attending , wished romanian citizens a happy new year .
earlier , the eu flag was raised outside the government headquarters in bucharest to the european anthem , beethoven 's ode to joy .

thousands of people in battenberg square cheered as midnight struck .

in an emotional address to the nation , bulgarian president georgi parvanov called the country 's eu entry a " heavenly moment " .
" the day we are welcoming - 1 january 2007 - will undoubtedly find its place among the most important dates in our national history , " he said .
" but let 's make it clear , our future success as a nation depends not on european funds and resources , but on our own work . "
' falling enthusiasm ' the accession of the two new countries comes amid falling enthusiasm in europe for the bloc 's continuing expansion .
a recent eurobarometer poll suggested only 41 % of people in the 15 states that were part of the eu before 2004 supported further enlargement .
the two new countries will now be subject to strict monitoring , to ensure they make more progress in the fight against corruption and organised crime .
they face export bans on certain foods , and bulgaria has been warned that 55 of its aircraft could be grounded unless they reach eu safety standards .
analysts say there is a risk that eu aid will be mis-spent , or just not taken up because the countries ' institutions are too disorganised .
there are also fears that the countries ' economies will fail to compete with the rest of the eu 's once trade barriers come down .
immigration fears both bulgaria and romania are much poorer than the rest of the eu , with gdp per capita of about 33 % of the eu average , compared with 50 % in poland .
bulgaria : key facts romania : key facts some western european member states fear a flood of new immigrants , but officials in both countries say most of those who wanted to work abroad have already left .
most of the 15 older eu member states have put in place restrictions on the free movement of workers from the two new members - though finland and sweden are two exceptions .
also on 1 january , slovenia became the first of the 10 states which joined the eu in 2004 to adopt the european currency , the euro .
the existing slovenian currency , the tolar will remain in dual use with the euro for 14 days .
germany also takes over from finland for six months as the country holding the presidency of the european union .

the metropolitan police - which had 3,200 officers on duty - said all viewing areas on the thames were full .

bulgarians and romanians coming to work in the uk will face extra restrictions compared with other eu citizens .
predictions on how many will come to britain vary from 56,000 to 180,000 in the first year .
mrs beckett acknowledged the uk would have to work with the new member states on the question of organised crime .
the eu now has 27 members - up from 15 three years ago - and a population of 500 million .
the conservatives said allowing any eu citizen to work in the uk if they were self-employed was a " big loophole " .
shadow home secretary david davis said the measures were " open to abuse " and dismissed the government 's talk of a managed flow of workers as " a piece of spin " .
the new system will be reviewed within 12 months , said the home office .
mrs beckett said : " in the last few years economic growth in both countries has been rapid and uk trade has boomed alongside it .
' they will contribute to eu ' " these two countries will bring their own particular contributions to the eu . "
britain looked forward to working closely with bulgaria and romania on such challenges as climate change , organised crime and terrorism , she said .
" these are bigger than any individual state .
but working together through an enlarged eu we can solve them , " said mrs beckett .
anti-mass migration group migrationwatch has admitted its 180,000 prediction - which it says is based on government suggestions of a link between the poverty of the sending country and the numbers who arrive - is " very unlikely " .
" but it serves to illustrate the degree of uncertainty , " said chairman sir andrew green .
left-wing think-tank the institute for public policy research put the figure at 56,000 . "
the traditional migration pattern for these two countries is to the mediterranean countries , not to the north " keith best , chief executive , immigration advisory service keith best , chief executive of charity the immigration advisory service , said the impact of bulgaria and romania joining would be nothing compared to the eight countries that joined in 2004 .
" the combined population of both countries is less than poland , just one of the previous tranche .
" i am also satisfied that the traditional migration pattern for these two countries is to the mediterranean countries , not to the north . "
he said most who wanted to come here would already have done so .
romania 's acting ambassador in the uk , raduta matache , has said she expected most of her countrymen looking for work abroad to head for italy or spain .
plans criticised the home office had earlier revealed its plans to limit the right to work for bulgarians and romanians .
unskilled workers will initially be limited to quota-based schemes that fill vacancies in the agricultural and food processing sectors .
the skilled can work if they get a permit , are a student , or are self-employed .
they could also come to the uk if they qualify under the highly skilled migrant programme - which currently allows under 100 per year .
on-the-spot fines of £ 1,000 and penalties for employers of up to £ 5,000 are in place to penalise law-breaking , said the government .
the new curbs contrast with the " open-door " policy adopted in 2004 , when 15,000 migrant workers were expected to arrive each year .
instead 600,000 arrived in two years .

anti-mass migration group migrationwatch has admitted its 180,000 prediction - which it says is based on government suggestions of a link between the poverty of the sending country and the numbers who arrive - is " very unlikely " .

they take the membership of the bloc from 25 to 27 member states - a long way from its beginnings as a six-nation economic community in 1958 .
why is the eu enlarging , is it a good thing or a bad thing , and what do bulgaria and romania bring to the eu ?
why are these two countries joining the eu , and why now ?
bulgaria and romania applied to join the eu in the early 1990s along with eight other former communist states of central and eastern europe , once they were no longer under the power of the soviet union .
the other eight moved quickly to carry out political and economic reforms , and joined the eu in 2004 .
bulgaria and romania were slower , and are only now judged to have met the eu 's membership conditions .
are bulgaria and romania really ready for membership ?
joined in 2004 cyprus czech republic estonia hungary latvia lithuania malta poland slovakia slovenia officials at the european commission have been quoted as saying that they are not really ready , but that delaying accession may not be the best way to encourage further reforms .
the commission was hoping , for example , that bulgaria would take big steps over the summer to tackle high-level corruption and organised crime , but officials in brussels say they have been disappointed .
nonetheless , a decision has been taken that it is better to have bulgaria and romania inside the club - under threat of strong sanctions if eu funds are not properly administered or crime gangs continue to flourish - rather than leaving them out in the cold .
how will they fit in with the rest of the eu ?
bulgaria and romania make up 6 % of the eu 's population and less than 1 % of its gdp .
two extra seats are being added to the european commission , and 54 to the european parliament .
bulgaria and romania are the poorest members of the eu , with gdp per head about a third of the eu average .
however their economies are growing quickly , at 5-7 % per year ..
what do they bring to the club ?
the european commission says the two countries ' rapid growth and highly motivated workforce will be an asset for the eu economy .
it also says both countries can help shape the eu 's foreign and security policy - romania as a bridge to eastern europe , including moldova , and bulgaria as an interface with the balkan and black sea region .
will the expansion of the eu now come to a halt ?
future members bulgaria and romania joined on 1 january 2007 turkey and croatia started membership talks in october 2005 macedonia officially gained " candidate " status in december 2005 albania , bosnia , kosovo , montenegro and serbia are expected to join in future probably not .
the eu has promised the balkan countries they can all join when they meet the conditions .
croatia and the former yugoslav republic of macedonia are already officially labelled as " candidates " for membership .
however , most experts expect the eu to go slow on further enlargement from now on .
for one thing , opposition to the whole process is growing in some member states .
for another , eu treaties will have to be revised before any more countries can join .
experts say the eu may be prepared to " tinker " with treaties to allow croatia in , but major reform will be necessary after that .
was n't the eu already big enough before 2004 , when it had 15 members ?
some member states have always had misgivings about enlarging the eu to the east - and these only intensified after france and the netherlands voted against the proposed eu constitution in 2005 .
however , eu treaties say any european country can apply to join if it meets the conditions , such as democracy , respect for human rights , the rule of law and a market economy .
is public opinion in the eu in favour of more enlargement ?
polls suggest attitudes towards enlargement are cooling .
forty-six per cent of people questioned in an autumn 2006 eurobarometer poll were in favour of further enlargement -lrb- down from 49 % a year months earlier -rrb- , and 42 % were against -lrb- up from 39 % six months earlier -rrb- .
the rest did not know .
however , the picture varies from country to country .
people in countries which joined the eu in 2004 seem to be broadly in favour of further enlargement , as are the people of greece , sweden and spain .
but in five other member states - austria , france , germany , luxembourg and the uk - only 30-36 % support the idea .
how much does enlargement cost ?
in 2005 , the 10 countries which joined the eu in 2004 received about 4bn euros -lrb- £ 2.7bn -rrb- more from the eu than they paid into the budget .
this comes to about 4 % of the eu budget , which is itself about 1 % of the eu 's gross national income .
in 2006 , bulgaria and romania are getting about 1.5bn euros in pre-accession aid .
of the older eu members , spain , greece , portugal and ireland also traditionally end up getting more back than they paid in .
spain 's " positive balance " in 2005 was in fact bigger than that of the 10 new member states put together .
in future spain will do less well from the eu budget , and the newer member states - the poorer ones , at least - will do better .
these calculations do not take into account the fact that eu money spent in one country - for example to build a road - will often be paid to contractors from a different eu country .
nor do they take into account that expansion of the single market is financially beneficial for all concerned .
what are the arguments against enlargement ?
here are some of them : it could lead to mass immigration , and increased organised crime workers from poorer countries take jobs from richer ones , and companies relocate to countries with lower labour costs and worse social protection the richer member states can not afford to pay huge subsidies to the poorer states the broader the eu gets , the more difficult it is to achieve deep integration the eu will grind to a halt , because with so many members it will never be able to agree on anything what are the arguments in favour of enlargement ?
supporters say it is reuniting a continent divided by the cold war , spreading stability and prosperity , expanding the single market , and giving europe more weight on the world stage .
they also have a specific response to each of the above arguments against enlargement : immigration helps drive economic growth , and the eu will be able to work with new member states to tackle organised crime and trafficking cheaper labour is good for the economies of richer european nations - and it is better for them if companies relocate to central europe than to india or china the richer member states gain more from being members of a large single market than they pay out in transfers to the poorer countries a broader union can also be a deeper one - the eu has been expanding at regular intervals since 1973 and all the while integration has been steadily increasing decision-making in the eu has not ground to a halt yet , despite the failure to pass a new constitution which would have simplified procedures .
can eu member states refuse to accept migrant workers from another member state ?
the eu regards free movement of workers as a fundamental right - but has nonetheless allowed member states to place restrictions on workers from eight of the 10 countries which joined the eu in 2004 .
restrictions will also be allowed in the case of workers from bulgaria and romania .
however , they can not be continued for more than seven years .
countries which impose restrictions must tell the european commission why they think the foreign workers would distort their labour market .
they have to justify the decision again after two years , and again after five years .
have eu voters ever been asked if they support enlargement ?
each enlargement has to be approved unanimously by the elected governments of each member state , and ratified in each national parliament .
no enlargement has yet been put to a referendum , though ireland held two referendums on the nice treaty , which , among other things , paved the way for the 2004 enlargement .
-lrb- the treaty was rejected at the first time of asking and approved at the second . -rrb-
also , france has changed its constitution to ensure that french voters will have a say on future enlargements , after the accession of croatia .
austria has also given notice that it will hold a referendum on turkish membership , when the time comes .

people in countries which joined the eu in 2004 seem to be broadly in favour of further enlargement , as are the people of greece , sweden and spain .
but in five other member states - austria , france , germany , luxembourg and the uk - only 30-36 % support the idea .
how much does enlargement cost ?
in 2005 , the 10 countries which joined the eu in 2004 received about 4bn euros -lrb- £ 2.7bn -rrb- more from the eu than they paid into the budget .
this comes to about 4 % of the eu budget , which is itself about 1 % of the eu 's gross national income .
in 2006 , bulgaria and romania are getting about 1.5bn euros in pre-accession aid .
of the older eu members , spain , greece , portugal and ireland also traditionally end up getting more back than they paid in .
spain 's " positive balance " in 2005 was in fact bigger than that of the 10 new member states put together .
in future spain will do less well from the eu budget , and the newer member states - the poorer ones , at least - will do better .
these calculations do not take into account the fact that eu money spent in one country - for example to build a road - will often be paid to contractors from a different eu country .
nor do they take into account that expansion of the single market is financially beneficial for all concerned .
what are the arguments against enlargement ?
here are some of them : it could lead to mass immigration , and increased organised crime workers from poorer countries take jobs from richer ones , and companies relocate to countries with lower labour costs and worse social protection the richer member states can not afford to pay huge subsidies to the poorer states the broader the eu gets , the more difficult it is to achieve deep integration the eu will grind to a halt , because with so many members it will never be able to agree on anything what are the arguments in favour of enlargement ?
supporters say it is reuniting a continent divided by the cold war , spreading stability and prosperity , expanding the single market , and giving europe more weight on the world stage .
they also have a specific response to each of the above arguments against enlargement : immigration helps drive economic growth , and the eu will be able to work with new member states to tackle organised crime and trafficking cheaper labour is good for the economies of richer european nations - and it is better for them if companies relocate to central europe than to india or china the richer member states gain more from being members of a large single market than they pay out in transfers to the poorer countries a broader union can also be a deeper one - the eu has been expanding at regular intervals since 1973 and all the while integration has been steadily increasing decision-making in the eu has not ground to a halt yet , despite the failure to pass a new constitution which would have simplified procedures .
can eu member states refuse to accept migrant workers from another member state ?
the eu regards free movement of workers as a fundamental right - but has nonetheless allowed member states to place restrictions on workers from eight of the 10 countries which joined the eu in 2004 .
restrictions will also be allowed in the case of workers from bulgaria and romania .
however , they can not be continued for more than seven years .
countries which impose restrictions must tell the european commission why they think the foreign workers would distort their labour market .
they have to justify the decision again after two years , and again after five years .
have eu voters ever been asked if they support enlargement ?
each enlargement has to be approved unanimously by the elected governments of each member state , and ratified in each national parliament .
no enlargement has yet been put to a referendum , though ireland held two referendums on the nice treaty , which , among other things , paved the way for the 2004 enlargement .
-lrb- the treaty was rejected at the first time of asking and approved at the second . -rrb-
also , france has changed its constitution to ensure that french voters will have a say on future enlargements , after the accession of croatia .
austria has also given notice that it will hold a referendum on turkish membership , when the time comes .

they take the membership of the bloc from 25 to 27 member states - a long way from its beginnings as a six-nation economic community in 1958 .
why is the eu enlarging , is it a good thing or a bad thing , and what do bulgaria and romania bring to the eu ?
why are these two countries joining the eu , and why now ?
bulgaria and romania applied to join the eu in the early 1990s along with eight other former communist states of central and eastern europe , once they were no longer under the power of the soviet union .
the other eight moved quickly to carry out political and economic reforms , and joined the eu in 2004 .
bulgaria and romania were slower , and are only now judged to have met the eu 's membership conditions .
are bulgaria and romania really ready for membership ?
joined in 2004 cyprus czech republic estonia hungary latvia lithuania malta poland slovakia slovenia watch the eu grow officials at the european commission have been quoted as saying that they are not really ready , but that delaying accession may not be the best way to encourage further reforms .
the commission was hoping , for example , that bulgaria would take big steps over the summer to tackle high-level corruption and organised crime , but officials in brussels say they have been disappointed .
nonetheless , a decision has been taken that it is better to have bulgaria and romania inside the club - under threat of strong sanctions if eu funds are not properly administered or crime gangs continue to flourish - rather than leaving them out in the cold .
how will they fit in with the rest of the eu ?
bulgaria and romania make up 6 % of the eu 's population and less than 1 % of its gdp .
two extra seats are being added to the european commission , and 54 to the european parliament .
bulgaria and romania are the poorest members of the eu , with gdp per head about a third of the eu average .
however their economies are growing quickly , at 5-7 % per year ..
what do they bring to the club ?
the european commission says the two countries ' rapid growth and highly motivated workforce will be an asset for the eu economy .
it also says both countries can help shape the eu 's foreign and security policy - romania as a bridge to eastern europe , including moldova , and bulgaria as an interface with the balkan and black sea region .
will the expansion of the eu now come to a halt ?
future members bulgaria and romania joined on 1 january 2007 turkey and croatia started membership talks in october 2005 macedonia officially gained " candidate " status in december 2005 albania , bosnia , kosovo , montenegro and serbia are expected to join in future guide to membership queue probably not .
the eu has promised the balkan countries they can all join when they meet the conditions .
croatia and the former yugoslav republic of macedonia are already officially labelled as " candidates " for membership .
however , most experts expect the eu to go slow on further enlargement from now on .
for one thing , opposition to the whole process is growing in some member states .
for another , eu treaties will have to be revised before any more countries can join .
experts say the eu may be prepared to " tinker " with treaties to allow croatia in , but major reform will be necessary after that .
was n't the eu already big enough before 2004 , when it had 15 members ?
some member states have always had misgivings about enlarging the eu to the east - and these only intensified after france and the netherlands voted against the proposed eu constitution in 2005 .
however , eu treaties say any european country can apply to join if it meets the conditions , such as democracy , respect for human rights , the rule of law and a market economy .
is public opinion in the eu in favour of more enlargement ?
polls suggest attitudes towards enlargement are cooling .
forty-six per cent of people questioned in an autumn 2006 eurobarometer poll were in favour of further enlargement -lrb- down from 49 % a year months earlier -rrb- , and 42 % were against -lrb- up from 39 % six months earlier -rrb- .

supporters say it is reuniting a continent divided by the cold war , spreading stability and prosperity , expanding the single market , and giving europe more weight on the world stage .
they also have a specific response to each of the above arguments against enlargement : immigration helps drive economic growth , and the eu will be able to work with new member states to tackle organised crime and trafficking cheaper labour is good for the economies of richer european nations - and it is better for them if companies relocate to central europe than to india or china the richer member states gain more from being members of a large single market than they pay out in transfers to the poorer countries a broader union can also be a deeper one - the eu has been expanding at regular intervals since 1973 and all the while integration has been steadily increasing decision-making in the eu has not ground to a halt yet , despite the failure to pass a new constitution which would have simplified procedures .
can eu member states refuse to accept migrant workers from another member state ?
the eu regards free movement of workers as a fundamental right - but has nonetheless allowed member states to place restrictions on workers from eight of the 10 countries which joined the eu in 2004 .
restrictions will also be allowed in the case of workers from bulgaria and romania .
however , they can not be continued for more than seven years .
countries which impose restrictions must tell the european commission why they think the foreign workers would distort their labour market .
they have to justify the decision again after two years , and again after five years .
have eu voters ever been asked if they support enlargement ?
each enlargement has to be approved unanimously by the elected governments of each member state , and ratified in each national parliament .
no enlargement has yet been put to a referendum , though ireland held two referendums on the nice treaty , which , among other things , paved the way for the 2004 enlargement .
-lrb- the treaty was rejected at the first time of asking and approved at the second . -rrb-
also , france has changed its constitution to ensure that french voters will have a say on future enlargements , after the accession of croatia .
austria has also given notice that it will hold a referendum on turkish membership , when the time comes .

they take the membership of the bloc from 25 to 27 member states - a long way from its beginnings as a six-nation economic community in 1958 .
why is the eu enlarging , is it a good thing or a bad thing , and what do bulgaria and romania bring to the eu ?
why are these two countries joining the eu , and why now ?
bulgaria and romania applied to join the eu in the early 1990s along with eight other former communist states of central and eastern europe , once they were no longer under the power of the soviet union .
the other eight moved quickly to carry out political and economic reforms , and joined the eu in 2004 .
bulgaria and romania were slower , and are only now judged to have met the eu 's membership conditions .
are bulgaria and romania really ready for membership ?
joined in 2004 cyprus czech republic estonia hungary latvia lithuania malta poland slovakia slovenia watch the eu grow officials at the european commission have been quoted as saying that they are not really ready , but that delaying accession may not be the best way to encourage further reforms .
the commission was hoping , for example , that bulgaria would take big steps over the summer to tackle high-level corruption and organised crime , but officials in brussels say they have been disappointed .
nonetheless , a decision has been taken that it is better to have bulgaria and romania inside the club - under threat of strong sanctions if eu funds are not properly administered or crime gangs continue to flourish - rather than leaving them out in the cold .
how will they fit in with the rest of the eu ?
bulgaria and romania make up 6 % of the eu 's population and less than 1 % of its gdp .
two extra seats are being added to the european commission , and 54 to the european parliament .
bulgaria and romania are the poorest members of the eu , with gdp per head about a third of the eu average .
however their economies are growing quickly , at 5-7 % per year ..
what do they bring to the club ?
the european commission says the two countries ' rapid growth and highly motivated workforce will be an asset for the eu economy .
it also says both countries can help shape the eu 's foreign and security policy - romania as a bridge to eastern europe , including moldova , and bulgaria as an interface with the balkan and black sea region .
will the expansion of the eu now come to a halt ?
future members bulgaria and romania joined on 1 january 2007 turkey and croatia started membership talks in october 2005 macedonia officially gained " candidate " status in december 2005 albania , bosnia , kosovo , montenegro and serbia are expected to join in future guide to membership queue probably not .
the eu has promised the balkan countries they can all join when they meet the conditions .
croatia and the former yugoslav republic of macedonia are already officially labelled as " candidates " for membership .
however , most experts expect the eu to go slow on further enlargement from now on .
for one thing , opposition to the whole process is growing in some member states .
for another , eu treaties will have to be revised before any more countries can join .
experts say the eu may be prepared to " tinker " with treaties to allow croatia in , but major reform will be necessary after that .
was n't the eu already big enough before 2004 , when it had 15 members ?
some member states have always had misgivings about enlarging the eu to the east - and these only intensified after france and the netherlands voted against the proposed eu constitution in 2005 .
however , eu treaties say any european country can apply to join if it meets the conditions , such as democracy , respect for human rights , the rule of law and a market economy .
is public opinion in the eu in favour of more enlargement ?
polls suggest attitudes towards enlargement are cooling .
forty-six per cent of people questioned in an autumn 2006 eurobarometer poll were in favour of further enlargement -lrb- down from 49 % a year months earlier -rrb- , and 42 % were against -lrb- up from 39 % six months earlier -rrb- .
the rest did not know .
however , the picture varies from country to country .
people in countries which joined the eu in 2004 seem to be broadly in favour of further enlargement , as are the people of greece , sweden and spain .
but in five other member states - austria , france , germany , luxembourg and the uk - only 30-36 % support the idea .
how much does enlargement cost ?
in 2005 , the 10 countries which joined the eu in 2004 received about 4bn euros -lrb- £ 2.7bn -rrb- more from the eu than they paid into the budget .
this comes to about 4 % of the eu budget , which is itself about 1 % of the eu 's gross national income .
in 2006 , bulgaria and romania are getting about 1.5bn euros in pre-accession aid .
of the older eu members , spain , greece , portugal and ireland also traditionally end up getting more back than they paid in .
spain 's " positive balance " in 2005 was in fact bigger than that of the 10 new member states put together .
in future spain will do less well from the eu budget , and the newer member states - the poorer ones , at least - will do better .
these calculations do not take into account the fact that eu money spent in one country - for example to build a road - will often be paid to contractors from a different eu country .
nor do they take into account that expansion of the single market is financially beneficial for all concerned .
what are the arguments against enlargement ?
here are some of them : it could lead to mass immigration , and increased organised crime workers from poorer countries take jobs from richer ones , and companies relocate to countries with lower labour costs and worse social protection the richer member states can not afford to pay huge subsidies to the poorer states the broader the eu gets , the more difficult it is to achieve deep integration the eu will grind to a halt , because with so many members it will never be able to agree on anything what are the arguments in favour of enlargement ?

no enlargement has yet been put to a referendum , though ireland held two referendums on the nice treaty , which , among other things , paved the way for the 2004 enlargement .
-lrb- the treaty was rejected at the first time of asking and approved at the second . -rrb-
also , france has changed its constitution to ensure that french voters will have a say on future enlargements , after the accession of croatia .
austria has also given notice that it will hold a referendum on turkish membership , when the time comes .

they take the membership of the bloc from 25 to 27 member states - a long way from its beginnings as a six-nation economic community in 1958 .
why is the eu enlarging , is it a good thing or a bad thing , and what do bulgaria and romania bring to the eu ?
why are these two countries joining the eu , and why now ?
bulgaria and romania applied to join the eu in the early 1990s along with eight other former communist states of central and eastern europe , once they were no longer under the power of the soviet union .
the other eight moved quickly to carry out political and economic reforms , and joined the eu in 2004 .
bulgaria and romania were slower , and are only now judged to have met the eu 's membership conditions .
are bulgaria and romania really ready for membership ?
joined in 2004 cyprus czech republic estonia hungary latvia lithuania malta poland slovakia slovenia watch the eu grow officials at the european commission have been quoted as saying that they are not really ready , but that delaying accession may not be the best way to encourage further reforms .
the commission was hoping , for example , that bulgaria would take big steps over the summer to tackle high-level corruption and organised crime , but officials in brussels say they have been disappointed .
nonetheless , a decision has been taken that it is better to have bulgaria and romania inside the club - under threat of strong sanctions if eu funds are not properly administered or crime gangs continue to flourish - rather than leaving them out in the cold .
how will they fit in with the rest of the eu ?
bulgaria and romania make up 6 % of the eu 's population and less than 1 % of its gdp .
two extra seats are being added to the european commission , and 54 to the european parliament .
bulgaria and romania are the poorest members of the eu , with gdp per head about a third of the eu average .
however their economies are growing quickly , at 5-7 % per year ..
what do they bring to the club ?
the european commission says the two countries ' rapid growth and highly motivated workforce will be an asset for the eu economy .
it also says both countries can help shape the eu 's foreign and security policy - romania as a bridge to eastern europe , including moldova , and bulgaria as an interface with the balkan and black sea region .
will the expansion of the eu now come to a halt ?
future members bulgaria and romania joined on 1 january 2007 turkey and croatia started membership talks in october 2005 macedonia officially gained " candidate " status in december 2005 albania , bosnia , kosovo , montenegro and serbia are expected to join in future guide to membership queue probably not .
the eu has promised the balkan countries they can all join when they meet the conditions .
croatia and the former yugoslav republic of macedonia are already officially labelled as " candidates " for membership .
however , most experts expect the eu to go slow on further enlargement from now on .
for one thing , opposition to the whole process is growing in some member states .
for another , eu treaties will have to be revised before any more countries can join .
experts say the eu may be prepared to " tinker " with treaties to allow croatia in , but major reform will be necessary after that .
was n't the eu already big enough before 2004 , when it had 15 members ?
some member states have always had misgivings about enlarging the eu to the east - and these only intensified after france and the netherlands voted against the proposed eu constitution in 2005 .
however , eu treaties say any european country can apply to join if it meets the conditions , such as democracy , respect for human rights , the rule of law and a market economy .
is public opinion in the eu in favour of more enlargement ?
polls suggest attitudes towards enlargement are cooling .
forty-six per cent of people questioned in an autumn 2006 eurobarometer poll were in favour of further enlargement -lrb- down from 49 % a year months earlier -rrb- , and 42 % were against -lrb- up from 39 % six months earlier -rrb- .
the rest did not know .
however , the picture varies from country to country .
people in countries which joined the eu in 2004 seem to be broadly in favour of further enlargement , as are the people of greece , sweden and spain .
but in five other member states - austria , france , germany , luxembourg and the uk - only 30-36 % support the idea .
how much does enlargement cost ?
in 2005 , the 10 countries which joined the eu in 2004 received about 4bn euros -lrb- £ 2.7bn -rrb- more from the eu than they paid into the budget .
this comes to about 4 % of the eu budget , which is itself about 1 % of the eu 's gross national income .
in 2006 , bulgaria and romania are getting about 1.5bn euros in pre-accession aid .
of the older eu members , spain , greece , portugal and ireland also traditionally end up getting more back than they paid in .
spain 's " positive balance " in 2005 was in fact bigger than that of the 10 new member states put together .
in future spain will do less well from the eu budget , and the newer member states - the poorer ones , at least - will do better .
these calculations do not take into account the fact that eu money spent in one country - for example to build a road - will often be paid to contractors from a different eu country .
nor do they take into account that expansion of the single market is financially beneficial for all concerned .
what are the arguments against enlargement ?
here are some of them : it could lead to mass immigration , and increased organised crime workers from poorer countries take jobs from richer ones , and companies relocate to countries with lower labour costs and worse social protection the richer member states can not afford to pay huge subsidies to the poorer states the broader the eu gets , the more difficult it is to achieve deep integration the eu will grind to a halt , because with so many members it will never be able to agree on anything what are the arguments in favour of enlargement ?
supporters say it is reuniting a continent divided by the cold war , spreading stability and prosperity , expanding the single market , and giving europe more weight on the world stage .
they also have a specific response to each of the above arguments against enlargement : immigration helps drive economic growth , and the eu will be able to work with new member states to tackle organised crime and trafficking cheaper labour is good for the economies of richer european nations - and it is better for them if companies relocate to central europe than to india or china the richer member states gain more from being members of a large single market than they pay out in transfers to the poorer countries a broader union can also be a deeper one - the eu has been expanding at regular intervals since 1973 and all the while integration has been steadily increasing decision-making in the eu has not ground to a halt yet , despite the failure to pass a new constitution which would have simplified procedures .
can eu member states refuse to accept migrant workers from another member state ?
the eu regards free movement of workers as a fundamental right - but has nonetheless allowed member states to place restrictions on workers from eight of the 10 countries which joined the eu in 2004 .
restrictions will also be allowed in the case of workers from bulgaria and romania .
however , they can not be continued for more than seven years .
countries which impose restrictions must tell the european commission why they think the foreign workers would distort their labour market .
they have to justify the decision again after two years , and again after five years .
have eu voters ever been asked if they support enlargement ?
each enlargement has to be approved unanimously by the elected governments of each member state , and ratified in each national parliament .
no enlargement has yet been put to a referendum , though ireland held two referendums on the nice treaty , which , among other things , paved the way for the 2004 enlargement .
