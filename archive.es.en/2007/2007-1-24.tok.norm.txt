these people should have been executed for their crimes .
how can any human being with a brain possibly think that this somehow serves justice ?
does justice count for anything in europe anymore ?
the people who have engineered this travesty should have to explain their logic to the families of those that were murdered by these animals , face to face .
but then what do i know , i 'm just an unenlightened american . - steven torelli aside from sending an obvious message of weakness and lack of resolve to today 's new cadre of terrorists , releasing communist terrorists who are guilty of actual acts of murder , while locking up members of the far right for simply saying disagreeable words or displaying controversial symbols , is the apex of hypocrisy and will not go unnoticed by those with any sense of justice . - kevin c. cook i strongly believe that brigitte mohnhaupt and christian klar should remain in prison and not be granted clemency .
they had no scruples in their past dealings and , according to your article about them , neither do they have any regrets about their convictions . - astrid howes if the people in jail can not bring the victims back to life when they walk , then they should not be released .
go and save money somewhere else .
who will bear the responsibility for the future victims ?

" more than 1,245 cia-operated flights flew over european airspace or stopped over at airports in europe , members of the european parliament -lrb- meps -rrb- concluded .
they urged member states to investigate these so-called extraordinary rendition flights . us president george w. bush in september acknowledged for the first time that the cia was running secret prisons for holding and interrogating high-level al-qaeda figures who had been captured since the september 11 , 2001 attacks . allegations that cia agents shipped prisoners through european airports to secret detention centers , including compounds in eastern europe , were first reported in november 2005 . eu involvement in torture eu deputies " condemned the fact that european countries have been relinquishing their control over their airspace and airports by turning a blind eye or admitting flights operated by the cia which , on some occasions , were being used for extraordinary renditions , " the report said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian claudio fava is a member of the eu investigation committee italian socialist mep claudio fava , who drafted the final conclusions of the probe , told reporters that " involvement in detainment amounts to a certain extent to involvement in torture .

however , the parliamentarians stressed that poland was the eu country least cooperative with the parliament probe . the report also mentioned the eu 's foreign policy and security chief javier solana , saying that he did not reveal his knowledge about the detention program . in addition , the meps called on the bloc to more strictly monitor data transfer to non-eu countries and the use of european airspace .
they also demanded more eu competencies in combating international terrorism . human rights organization human rights watch , in new york , responded to the report by saying european countries need to go further to stop their own policies that allow torture to continue worldwide . in a briefing paper , the non-profit group said eu states used " ' diplomatic assurances " to justify returning terrorism suspects to places where they were likely to be tortured .
the group said such policies are unreliable , unenforceable and ineffective and do little to protect against torture . " european governments have used these empty promises as a fig leaf to justify sending people to places where they risk being tortured , " holly cartner , the group 's europe and central asia director , said in a statement . german failures the eu committee 's final conclusions also accused the former german governmental coalition of the social democrats and greens of failing to work for the release of german resident murat kurnaz , who was imprisoned in the us camp at guantanamo bay . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier - who was former chancellor gerhard schröder 's chief of staff at the time and thus in charge of intelligence - on tuesday rejected charges that he had known about a us offer in 2002 to release a german-born turk from the us military prison at guantanamo . kurnaz was not freed until august 2006 , after intervention from the present government led by chancellor angela merkel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor merkel , right , has backed steinmeier in the ex-guantanamo inmate affair ahead of a meeting with the european parliament 's foreign affairs committee in brussels , steinmeier said that the former german government had repeatedly tried to free kurnaz . " on various occasions , we made efforts for a release , " steinmeier said .
charges that the former government had obstructed a release of kurnaz were " firstly wrong and simply mean , " he added . kurnaz spent four-and-a-half years at guantanamo on cuba after his arrest as a suspected al-qaeda supporter in pakistan , shortly after the september 11 , 2001 attacks . but eu lawmakers stressed that " according to confidential institutional information , the german government did not accept the us offer , made in 2002 , to release murat kurnaz from guantanamo .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 24.01.2007 eu report slams members for involvement in secret cia affair großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the report says at least 10 eu members knew about the cia 's rendition flights european union lawmakers have approved a report which lashes out at eu countries for tolerating or assisting the united states ' practice of secret detentions of terrorist suspects . at least 10 european states , including britain , poland , italy and germany aided or knew about the cia 's clandestine program of taking terrorism suspects to other countries for interrogation , the report said . it ended a year-long investigation by a special european parliament committee .
the text , adopted by 28 votes in favor , 17 against and three abstentions , criticized eu states for a failure to fulfill " european obligations , such as the respect of human rights . " more than 1,245 cia-operated flights flew over european airspace or stopped over at airports in europe , members of the european parliament -lrb- meps -rrb- concluded .
they urged member states to investigate these so-called extraordinary rendition flights . us president george w. bush in september acknowledged for the first time that the cia was running secret prisons for holding and interrogating high-level al-qaeda figures who had been captured since the september 11 , 2001 attacks . allegations that cia agents shipped prisoners through european airports to secret detention centers , including compounds in eastern europe , were first reported in november 2005 . eu involvement in torture eu deputies " condemned the fact that european countries have been relinquishing their control over their airspace and airports by turning a blind eye or admitting flights operated by the cia which , on some occasions , were being used for extraordinary renditions , " the report said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian claudio fava is a member of the eu investigation committee italian socialist mep claudio fava , who drafted the final conclusions of the probe , told reporters that " involvement in detainment amounts to a certain extent to involvement in torture . " the report , which goes to a vote of the full parliament next month , said that claims that the cia had a secret prison in poland were unproven .
however , the parliamentarians stressed that poland was the eu country least cooperative with the parliament probe . the report also mentioned the eu 's foreign policy and security chief javier solana , saying that he did not reveal his knowledge about the detention program . in addition , the meps called on the bloc to more strictly monitor data transfer to non-eu countries and the use of european airspace .
they also demanded more eu competencies in combating international terrorism . human rights organization human rights watch , in new york , responded to the report by saying european countries need to go further to stop their own policies that allow torture to continue worldwide . in a briefing paper , the non-profit group said eu states used " ' diplomatic assurances " to justify returning terrorism suspects to places where they were likely to be tortured .
the group said such policies are unreliable , unenforceable and ineffective and do little to protect against torture . " european governments have used these empty promises as a fig leaf to justify sending people to places where they risk being tortured , " holly cartner , the group 's europe and central asia director , said in a statement . german failures the eu committee 's final conclusions also accused the former german governmental coalition of the social democrats and greens of failing to work for the release of german resident murat kurnaz , who was imprisoned in the us camp at guantanamo bay . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier - who was former chancellor gerhard schröder 's chief of staff at the time and thus in charge of intelligence - on tuesday rejected charges that he had known about a us offer in 2002 to release a german-born turk from the us military prison at guantanamo . kurnaz was not freed until august 2006 , after intervention from the present government led by chancellor angela merkel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor merkel , right , has backed steinmeier in the ex-guantanamo inmate affair ahead of a meeting with the european parliament 's foreign affairs committee in brussels , steinmeier said that the former german government had repeatedly tried to free kurnaz . " on various occasions , we made efforts for a release , " steinmeier said .
charges that the former government had obstructed a release of kurnaz were " firstly wrong and simply mean , " he added . kurnaz spent four-and-a-half years at guantanamo on cuba after his arrest as a suspected al-qaeda supporter in pakistan , shortly after the september 11 , 2001 attacks . but eu lawmakers stressed that " according to confidential institutional information , the german government did not accept the us offer , made in 2002 , to release murat kurnaz from guantanamo . " the documents were given to the committee by the german government on the condition of strict confidentiality , carlos coelho , head of the special committee , told reporters . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german social democrats question eu report on cia scandal members of germany social democratic party on tuesday criticized a report by an eu parliament commission that could damage their party colleague , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier .

the text , adopted by 28 votes in favor , 17 against and three abstentions , criticized eu states for a failure to fulfill " european obligations , such as the respect of human rights . " more than 1,245 cia-operated flights flew over european airspace or stopped over at airports in europe , members of the european parliament -lrb- meps -rrb- concluded .
they urged member states to investigate these so-called extraordinary rendition flights . us president george w. bush in september acknowledged for the first time that the cia was running secret prisons for holding and interrogating high-level al-qaeda figures who had been captured since the september 11 , 2001 attacks . allegations that cia agents shipped prisoners through european airports to secret detention centers , including compounds in eastern europe , were first reported in november 2005 . eu involvement in torture eu deputies " condemned the fact that european countries have been relinquishing their control over their airspace and airports by turning a blind eye or admitting flights operated by the cia which , on some occasions , were being used for extraordinary renditions , " the report said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian claudio fava is a member of the eu investigation committee italian socialist mep claudio fava , who drafted the final conclusions of the probe , told reporters that " involvement in detainment amounts to a certain extent to involvement in torture . " the report , which goes to a vote of the full parliament next month , said that claims that the cia had a secret prison in poland were unproven .
however , the parliamentarians stressed that poland was the eu country least cooperative with the parliament probe . the report also mentioned the eu 's foreign policy and security chief javier solana , saying that he did not reveal his knowledge about the detention program . in addition , the meps called on the bloc to more strictly monitor data transfer to non-eu countries and the use of european airspace .
they also demanded more eu competencies in combating international terrorism . human rights organization human rights watch , in new york , responded to the report by saying european countries need to go further to stop their own policies that allow torture to continue worldwide . in a briefing paper , the non-profit group said eu states used " ' diplomatic assurances " to justify returning terrorism suspects to places where they were likely to be tortured .
the group said such policies are unreliable , unenforceable and ineffective and do little to protect against torture . " european governments have used these empty promises as a fig leaf to justify sending people to places where they risk being tortured , " holly cartner , the group 's europe and central asia director , said in a statement . german failures the eu committee 's final conclusions also accused the former german governmental coalition of the social democrats and greens of failing to work for the release of german resident murat kurnaz , who was imprisoned in the us camp at guantanamo bay . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier - who was former chancellor gerhard schröder 's chief of staff at the time and thus in charge of intelligence - on tuesday rejected charges that he had known about a us offer in 2002 to release a german-born turk from the us military prison at guantanamo . kurnaz was not freed until august 2006 , after intervention from the present government led by chancellor angela merkel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor merkel , right , has backed steinmeier in the ex-guantanamo inmate affair ahead of a meeting with the european parliament 's foreign affairs committee in brussels , steinmeier said that the former german government had repeatedly tried to free kurnaz .

it used to be when you wanted a cd you had to go out and buy it .
now you pay 99 cents that the artist has to share with the internet site - there 's actually not much left . it 's getting harder and harder to put new products on the market , because the marketing costs are crazily high .
this download nonsense is n't enough , it 's just drop in the bucket .
when the normal means of distribution for a cd , which you can hold in your hands , is lost , the business - sooner or later - will be reduced to a couple of big acts or purely internet-based platforms where some people put something on the internet and then hope to make a couple of euros off it .
that wo n't be enough to keep the music market above water . but the trend seems unstoppable . that 's completely true , but it 's a negative trend that i think is terrible .
of course it 's wonderful that these days everyone can say , " i composed a song and put it on the internet " and then see what happens .

this is what the music industry has done , but it can only do it when it has the opportunity to make money .
but this small-time business going on now is downright absurd . young artists like will.i.am from the " black eyed peas " as well as the band " shiny toy guns " say they can make a living from it . when a couple of people can do it , that 's wonderful .
of course there are always a few good examples , a few people that it 's good for .

"

it used to be when you wanted a cd you had to go out and buy it .
now you pay 99 cents that the artist has to share with the internet site - there 's actually not much left . it 's getting harder and harder to put new products on the market , because the marketing costs are crazily high .
this download nonsense is n't enough , it 's just drop in the bucket .
when the normal means of distribution for a cd , which you can hold in your hands , is lost , the business - sooner or later - will be reduced to a couple of big acts or purely internet-based platforms where some people put something on the internet and then hope to make a couple of euros off it .
that wo n't be enough to keep the music market above water . but the trend seems unstoppable . that 's completely true , but it 's a negative trend that i think is terrible .
of course it 's wonderful that these days everyone can say , " i composed a song and put it on the internet " and then see what happens .
but turns it into a hobby occupation , and professionalism gets watered down . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siegel said platforms like apple 's itunes do n't help artists you can put 100,000 songs on the internet , even from new composers , but no one knows what to find where .

there has to be a job description for artists getting into this profession again . when there are only small revenues and small amounts of money generated , no one is going to be interested in getting involved in training artists or getting them started on paths that take 10 or 20 years .
this is what the music industry has done , but it can only do it when it has the opportunity to make money .
but this small-time business going on now is downright absurd . young artists like will.i.am from the " black eyed peas " as well as the band " shiny toy guns " say they can make a living from it . when a couple of people can do it , that 's wonderful .
of course there are always a few good examples , a few people that it 's good for .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de music -pipe- 24.01.2007 " downloading music is a negative trend " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siegel said he does not want cd stores to become a thing of the past the writer of several compositions for the eurovision song contest , german folk-rock musician and producer ralph siegel talked to dw-world.de about the damage being done to the music industry by the internet . siegel wrote 18 songs for the eurovision song contest , including the 1982 german hit " ein bisschen frieden . "
he owns jupiter records and has registered over 2,000 titles with germany 's music rights authority , gema . dw-world.de : mr. siegel , what do you think of the shift of music distribution from records to cds and now to internet downloads ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siegel owns a record label and a music publishing company ralph siegel : it 's a huge catastrophe .
it used to be when you wanted a cd you had to go out and buy it .
now you pay 99 cents that the artist has to share with the internet site - there 's actually not much left . it 's getting harder and harder to put new products on the market , because the marketing costs are crazily high .
this download nonsense is n't enough , it 's just drop in the bucket .
when the normal means of distribution for a cd , which you can hold in your hands , is lost , the business - sooner or later - will be reduced to a couple of big acts or purely internet-based platforms where some people put something on the internet and then hope to make a couple of euros off it .
that wo n't be enough to keep the music market above water . but the trend seems unstoppable . that 's completely true , but it 's a negative trend that i think is terrible .
of course it 's wonderful that these days everyone can say , " i composed a song and put it on the internet " and then see what happens .
but turns it into a hobby occupation , and professionalism gets watered down . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siegel said platforms like apple 's itunes do n't help artists you can put 100,000 songs on the internet , even from new composers , but no one knows what to find where .
and no one receives any more support .
in and of itself , the internet is not a support , because after an artist is listed on the internet someone needs to work with him , which i think is the most important thing .
he has to learn new things .
there has to be a job description for artists getting into this profession again . when there are only small revenues and small amounts of money generated , no one is going to be interested in getting involved in training artists or getting them started on paths that take 10 or 20 years .
this is what the music industry has done , but it can only do it when it has the opportunity to make money .
but this small-time business going on now is downright absurd . young artists like will.i.am from the " black eyed peas " as well as the band " shiny toy guns " say they can make a living from it . when a couple of people can do it , that 's wonderful .
of course there are always a few good examples , a few people that it 's good for .
but in the long run this wo n't be the case .
i do n't think so anyway . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : online sales wo n't be enough to support artists , according to siegel it 's just like all the newspapers that open up and then close down .
i think it 's dangerous .
there always has to be some professionalism in the world .
by the time a little internet site makes it worldwide - that 's going to take a long time and an internet shop is n't going to be enough . something has to be done for the artists .
management has to nurture them , there has to be a real structure and the internet ca n't do that by itself .
it 's one thing to present or market something - which is a good - but it 's not everything . what are the advantages of the old-fashioned means of distribution you promote ? the biggest problem is that the internet is n't alive .
the exchanges you have in conversations and in cooperating with others , or in a lot of other private ways , are what keeps music alive and are what music needs . creativity ca n't just be hunted down in the ether or created alone in a room .
i know what i 'm talking about , i 've been in front of a computer many a time in the past 20 years and always look forward to when i can be with my artists in the studio or out on the road .
the human touch is very important .
i do n't get that from the internet . julia elvers-guyot interviewed ralph siegel -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " mozart new edition " now online for free as the end of a full year of mozart celebrations nears , the musical scores of his complete works have been made available for free on the web .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 24.01.2007 opinion : time for explanations großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unless he manages to produce new evidence , germany 's foreign minister will have to resign over the failure to get a german-born guantanamo prisoner released despite a us offer to do so , says dw 's heinz dylong . it seems right to keep asking why the former social democratic-green party government had so little interest in getting bremen-born turk murat kurnaz released from the us detention camp at guantanamo - especially since a us offer apparently existed to set kurnaz free after he had been wrongly accused of terrorist activities .
berlin allegedly rejected that , and a special committee of the european parliament says there 's enough proof to back the allegation . this alone would be a scandal that can not be covered up by claiming that kurnaz has turkish and not german citizenship and placing the blame on ankara instead of berlin .
a visit by german secret agents to kurnaz in guantanamo completes the picture . let 's be clear about this : barely 20 years of age , kurnaz was captured by the americans in pakistan .
he was possibly naive , but certainly not a terror suspect .
in january 2002 , he ended up at guantanamo , he was abused , but even the americans were eventually convinced of his innocence and wanted to send him back to germany .
berlin rejected the offer .
what 's more : the german authorities did n't merely not work towards his release , rather they boycotted it .
the man was n't able to leave the camp until 2006 . political responsibility for the germans ' behavior lies with a group of state secretaries and intelligence agency heads , who regularly discussed the security situation under the leadership of the chancellery 's chief-of-staff .
at the time in question , the latter position was occupied by frank-walter steinmeier , the current foreign minister .
he 'll have quite a bit of explaining to do to a parliamentary committee which is investigating the case .
it 's certain that steinmeier will have to resign if he can not offer any new information to make berlin 's behavior plausible . his resignation would obviously not explain why berlin behaved the way it did .
foreign policy considerations may have played a role .
the german-american relationship was already tense because of germany 's " no " to the war in iraq .
it might have made sense not to put additional strain on ties with the us - whether by insisting in the case of guantanamo or by the released prisoner one day possibly making public accusations .
be that as it may ; it 's certainly not in line with a foreign policy oriented toward human rights which the social democratic-green party government had claimed to pursue . heinz dylong is an editor at dw-radio -lrb- win -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu report slams members for involvement in secret cia affair european union lawmakers have approved a report which lashes out at eu countries for tolerating or assisting the united states ' practice of secret detentions of terrorist suspects .

she became a model and in 1968 moved into berlin 's infamous commune 1 , where a group of young germans , including obermaier 's then boyfriend , rainer langhans , rejected the traditional family system and propagated free love while partaking in a fair amount of drugs . " she was the most beautiful face of germany 's brainy rebellion , " wrote german magazine stern , which shocked readers with raunchy pictures of obermaier and langhans in the 1960s .

she left germany in 1973 with a former hamburg pimp named dieter bockhorn to travel around asia and america in a bus and eventually settled in california after bockhorn , whom she had married in india , died in a motorcycle crash on new years ' eve 1983 . calming down blessed with " good genes " and a formidable plastic surgeon -lrb- " i 've received some help , but the details are private , " she told stern -rrb- , obermaier still talks to keith richards once in a while - usually to get free tickets to a stones concert , she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : getting excited ahead of a stones concert in munich in 2003 she has stopped using her fridge to store manolo blahniks and replaced breakfasts consisting of apple juice , a line of heroin and a joint with home-cooked meals such as deer ragout and blue cabbage prepared according to her cousin 's recipe .
she finds that she 's started to care about the shape of faucets . " i 'm sick of listening to my biography , " obermaier , now 60 and a jewelry designer living in topanga canyon just north of los angeles , recently told munich 's süddeutsche zeitung . lovers ' quarrel she 's hoping others might feel differently .
her autobiography , entitled " high times : my wild life , " was published in january and a movie based on her life called " das wilde leben " -lrb- english title : 8 miles high -rrb- will open next week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : langhans thinks his ex-girlfriend was n't fair to him in her book and movie in a talk show on german public broadcaster ard on monday , obermaier was reunited with her former commune 1 boyfriend , who promptly accused her of misrepresenting the facts in the film by claiming that he was uptight when it came to sex . " it was great in the beginning and then not any more , " said langhans , who now lives in a self-styled " harem " with five women .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 24.01.2007 berlin wants new laws to protect prostitutes großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many prostitutes are in germany illegally and have few , if any , protections germany 's federal government wants to toughen laws around prostitution , which is legal in germany .
the nation 's family minister said she would like customers of women forced into the profession to be prosecuted . family minister ursula von der leyen said that there are still too many illegal prostitutes in germany and that it is still too hard for many of the woman in the field to leave , even if they want to . referring to a report on prostitution commissioned by the federal cabinet , von der leyen told reporters at a press conference on wednesday that the attempt to improve that lives of prostitutes by giving them access to healthcare , social security and pensions in a groundbreaking 2002 law still did not do enough for large numbers of sex workers in germany . " the possibilities in practice are almost never used , " she said , and announced new measures aimed at protecting women forced into sex work and underage prostitutes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : family minister ursula von der leyen " the prostitution law has only reached part of its goal , " she said , adding that health and hygiene conditions of most prostitutes have not improved since the law 's passage .
there are an estimated 400,000 registered prostitutes in germany . but von der leyen , a member of angela merkel 's conservative christian democratic party , said she was not aiming at turning back and clock and making prostitution illegal again , but wanted to offer sex workers viable ways out of the profession . " we want to rigorously go after the criminal element surrounding prostitution , " she said .
" that includes punishing customers of forced prostitutes , raising the minimal age and much stricter controls over brothels , with the message that prostitution is not just a job like any other .

the nation 's family minister said she would like customers of women forced into the profession to be prosecuted . family minister ursula von der leyen said that there are still too many illegal prostitutes in germany and that it is still too hard for many of the woman in the field to leave , even if they want to . referring to a report on prostitution commissioned by the federal cabinet , von der leyen told reporters at a press conference on wednesday that the attempt to improve that lives of prostitutes by giving them access to healthcare , social security and pensions in a groundbreaking 2002 law still did not do enough for large numbers of sex workers in germany . " the possibilities in practice are almost never used , " she said , and announced new measures aimed at protecting women forced into sex work and underage prostitutes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : family minister ursula von der leyen " the prostitution law has only reached part of its goal , " she said , adding that health and hygiene conditions of most prostitutes have not improved since the law 's passage .
there are an estimated 400,000 registered prostitutes in germany . but von der leyen , a member of angela merkel 's conservative christian democratic party , said she was not aiming at turning back and clock and making prostitution illegal again , but wanted to offer sex workers viable ways out of the profession . " we want to rigorously go after the criminal element surrounding prostitution , " she said .
" that includes punishing customers of forced prostitutes , raising the minimal age and much stricter controls over brothels , with the message that prostitution is not just a job like any other . " the final goal must be to encourage prostitutes to get out of the field , she said . ignorance no excuse chancellor merkel 's grand coalition government is now drafting new legislation that would raise the legal age for prostitution from 16 to 18 and would plug a legal loophole that allows clients of women forced into prostitution to escape prosecution by pleading ignorance of their situation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are some 400,000 registered prostitites in germany " if the prostitute speaks no german and has bruises on her body then the client has to assume this is forced prostitution , " von der leyen said .
" he can no longer say : ' i did n't notice ' . " more than half of the prostitutes in germany are thought to be here illegally , many from eastern europe , and because most have no legal papers , leaving the profession or the men who control their lives , is next to impossible . however , the family minister offered no details on how such measures would be enforced . her proposals will have to be approved by the german cabinet and then approved by the parliament before becoming law . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a job like none other : being a prostitute in germany morning , noon and night - the demand for prostitutes is huge .

berlin allegedly rejected that , and a special committee of the european parliament says there 's enough proof to back the allegation . this alone would be a scandal that can not be covered up by claiming that kurnaz has turkish and not german citizenship and placing the blame on ankara instead of berlin .
a visit by german secret agents to kurnaz in guantanamo completes the picture . let 's be clear about this : barely 20 years of age , kurnaz was captured by the americans in pakistan .
he was possibly naive , but certainly not a terror suspect .
in january 2002 , he ended up at guantanamo , he was abused , but even the americans were eventually convinced of his innocence and wanted to send him back to germany .
berlin rejected the offer .
what 's more : the german authorities did n't merely not work towards his release , rather they boycotted it .
the man was n't able to leave the camp until 2006 . political responsibility for the germans ' behavior lies with a group of state secretaries and intelligence agency heads , who regularly discussed the security situation under the leadership of the chancellery 's chief-of-staff .
at the time in question , the latter position was occupied by frank-walter steinmeier , the current foreign minister .
he 'll have quite a bit of explaining to do to a parliamentary committee which is investigating the case .
it 's certain that steinmeier will have to resign if he can not offer any new information to make berlin 's behavior plausible . his resignation would obviously not explain why berlin behaved the way it did .
foreign policy considerations may have played a role .
the german-american relationship was already tense because of germany 's " no " to the war in iraq .
it might have made sense not to put additional strain on ties with the us - whether by insisting in the case of guantanamo or by the released prisoner one day possibly making public accusations .

from now on , teambank , the buddy-buddy bank , is going with first names and the informal form of address . the world of finance around the globe is not known for its breezy atmosphere .
besides the occasional dress-down friday , the order of the day is generally pressed pants and tie clips and a rather reserved formality -lrb- save on the trading-room floor -rrb- . in germany , the serious tone in the workplace is often ratcheted up a notch .
germans offices in many sectors are often more formal than , say their american counterparts , with employees who 've worked together for years often still calling each other mr. schmidt or ms. bauer instead of dieter or gisela . so when a bank in germany puts a new policy in place that asks employees to get all touchy-feely , it 's touted as a revolution .
theophil graband , the chairman of teambank , has n't mandated the singing of kumbayah and holding hands , but he has asked him employees to address each other using the familiar form of the word " you . " dual ' you ' german , like many languages but unlike english , has two forms of " you . "
there 's the informal one , " du " in german , used with close friends , family members and little children .
then there 's " sie , " used with everyone else .
most workplaces are " sie " kinds of places , while in schoolyards , for example , the " du " predominates . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goofy ties could be next but now teambank is all warm and fuzzy , and the informal " you " form can be used with everyone from the copyboy to director graband himself .
he says taking the formality down a notch can help strengthen team spirit at the bank , which is all the rage in 21st century management manuals . graband is not forcing his " du " on anyone , and says the new form address should be adopted " voluntarily " by the bank 's 1,250 employees .
but those who refuse to bend will face a bit of peer pressure .
" we want to be as unifed as possible , " graband said . over the next several weeks , teambank is holding " teamcamps " to get any starched-shirts used to the bank 's new jaunty ways . whether there 'll be a teamgroan going up among employees remains to be seen . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de top cop busted for bank heist a high-ranking german police officer has been arrested for robbing a bank near his police station and getting away with tens of thousands in cash .

the firms then received official notification of the charges in may last year . an 11th firm , abb ltd . , the globe 's largest builder of electricity networks , tipped off the eu and escaped any fine . " abb has been the whistleblower and has been cooperating with the commission , " wolfram eberhardt , a spokesman for the zurich-based company , told bloomberg news . appeal siemens , europe 's biggest engineering company , responded to the announcement of fines saying it plans to appeal . " siemens intends to go to the european court of justice to take legal action against antitrust fines … charged by the eu commission , " the company said in a statement .
it added that it " denies the blanket accusation " that it was part of a cartel between 1988 and 2004 .

"
but environmentalists in europe say his measures do n't go far enough . german leaders on wednesday reacted positively to us president george w. bush 's annual state of the union speech in which he called climate change a " serious issue " and urged americans to cut their gasoline consumption by 20 percent over a decade , mostly through a nearly five-fold increase in use of home-grown fuels such as ethanol . bush also pushed for tighter vehicle fuel efficiency standards . " a positive sign " " the fact that the american president acknowledges climate change as a problem is definitely a positive sign , " karsten voigt , the government 's coordinator of transatlantic relations told spiegel online . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush said climate change was a " serious challenge " voigt said bush had realized that saving energy was not just important on the political level , but also for security reasons . former german environment minister , jürgen trittin told german radio that bush had realized that oil-dependency massively undermined his leveraging power .

"
but environmentalists in europe say his measures do n't go far enough . german leaders on wednesday reacted positively to us president george w. bush 's annual state of the union speech in which he called climate change a " serious issue " and urged americans to cut their gasoline consumption by 20 percent over a decade , mostly through a nearly five-fold increase in use of home-grown fuels such as ethanol . bush also pushed for tighter vehicle fuel efficiency standards . " a positive sign " " the fact that the american president acknowledges climate change as a problem is definitely a positive sign , " karsten voigt , the government 's coordinator of transatlantic relations told spiegel online . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush said climate change was a " serious challenge " voigt said bush had realized that saving energy was not just important on the political level , but also for security reasons . former german environment minister , jürgen trittin told german radio that bush had realized that oil-dependency massively undermined his leveraging power .
bush 's speech , said trittin , could " improve transatlantic cooperation in the fight against climate change . " bärbel höhn , deputy leader of the green group in parliament urged the german government to set similar ambitious goals on renewable energy like the american president did in his address . " we have to be careful that we do n't squander our leadership and technological edge in renewable energy , " höhn said . " moving in the right direction " sir nicholas stern , chief economic adviser to the british government and author of a report in 2006 that warned of the mounting costs of climate change , said bush 's speech was " a movement in the right direction . " " there is a recognition of the link between climate change and human activity , " he told reporters at the world economic forum in davos , switzerland . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush 's comments made for much debate in davos " you have to recognise what everyone is doing .
the united states is doing a lot on technology , a lot on standards .
but then of course we have to scale up our action . " the executive secretary of the un framework convention on climate change -lrb- unfccc -rrb- , yvo de boer , said bush 's speech marked a shift towards a more sustainable form of energy and noted his choice of words about climate change . " he did not talk in his state of the union address about international cooperation on climate change .
but at the same time , he did put his remarks in the context of the need for global response , " de boer told reporters in tokyo .
" that i think is very encouraging . " green groups say too little too late but environmentalists and green groups in europe were less impressed with the president 's address and said his measures did n't go far enough . jan kowalzig at friends of the earth europe told news agency afp that biofuel and fuel-efficiency initiatives were " worthwhile measures " but did not tackle the critical problem posed by us emissions of greenhouse gases . bush declined in his annual address to support mandatory caps on heat-trapping carbon gases that big us companies such as general electric co. have pushed for . only a mandatory cap on these emissions could drive down this pollution , said kowalzig .
he added that biofuels could in fact worsen the greenhouse-gas problem . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush does n't support mandatory carbon caps " in theory , they only produce as many greenhouse gas emissions as they suck up when growing , so they would be carbon neutral , " kowalzig said .
" in practice , in most places , they are not , because transportation of the fuels , processing of the fuels , all that requires energy which is currently driven by a fossil-fuel economy , " he said .
" so all these biofuels projects currently add to the greenhouse-gas effect . " bush u-turns on climate change bush 's address had been trailed by several media reports that forecast a u-turn on climate change . in 2001 , bush abandoned the kyoto protocol for curbing greenhouse-gas emissions , saying the pact 's binding caps were unfair and too costly for the us economy . bereft of the united states , which by itself accounts for nearly a quarter of global carbon pollution , kyoto has limped along and negotiations on cuts beyond 2012 are set to be long and bitter . but bush made no reference at all to the kyoto process or the voluntary initiatives on emissions and alternative energy that he has launched bilaterally and regionally . he did refer to global climate change , though , as a " serious challenge " that these technologies would help to confront . " bush out of step " some of corporate america 's industrial giants , including alcoa , general electric and dupont , this week called for mandatory caps on businesses ' greenhouse gas emissions , and trading of emissions permits . some observers said bush was out of kilter with domestic demands for action on climate change . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush 's plans for iraq found few takers in germany " he 's clearly out of step with where the american public and us congress are right now on climate change , which is ready to go much further than continuing technology initiatives , " jennifer morgan , a europe-based consultant on climate change and former spokesman with the green group wwf , told afp . european leaders however were less enthusiastic about bush 's plans for iraq in his address which involve sending 20,000 more american troops to the violence-racked country . both voigt and trittin criticized the plans , saying they could not detect any coherent political strategy . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de global warming bubbles to the surface in davos an exceptionally mild first half of winter in the swiss alps is helping to fuel growing concern about climate change at the annual meeting of the world economic forum , beginning on wednesday in davos .

"
but environmentalists in europe say his measures do n't go far enough . german leaders on wednesday reacted positively to us president george w. bush 's annual state of the union speech in which he called climate change a " serious issue " and urged americans to cut their gasoline consumption by 20 percent over a decade , mostly through a nearly five-fold increase in use of home-grown fuels such as ethanol . bush also pushed for tighter vehicle fuel efficiency standards . " a positive sign " " the fact that the american president acknowledges climate change as a problem is definitely a positive sign , " karsten voigt , the government 's coordinator of transatlantic relations told spiegel online . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush said climate change was a " serious challenge " voigt said bush had realized that saving energy was not just important on the political level , but also for security reasons . former german environment minister , jürgen trittin told german radio that bush had realized that oil-dependency massively undermined his leveraging power .
bush 's speech , said trittin , could " improve transatlantic cooperation in the fight against climate change . " bärbel höhn , deputy leader of the green group in parliament urged the german government to set similar ambitious goals on renewable energy like the american president did in his address . " we have to be careful that we do n't squander our leadership and technological edge in renewable energy , " höhn said . " moving in the right direction " sir nicholas stern , chief economic adviser to the british government and author of a report in 2006 that warned of the mounting costs of climate change , said bush 's speech was " a movement in the right direction . " " there is a recognition of the link between climate change and human activity , " he told reporters at the world economic forum in davos , switzerland . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush 's comments made for much debate in davos " you have to recognise what everyone is doing .
the united states is doing a lot on technology , a lot on standards .
but then of course we have to scale up our action . " the executive secretary of the un framework convention on climate change -lrb- unfccc -rrb- , yvo de boer , said bush 's speech marked a shift towards a more sustainable form of energy and noted his choice of words about climate change . " he did not talk in his state of the union address about international cooperation on climate change .
but at the same time , he did put his remarks in the context of the need for global response , " de boer told reporters in tokyo .
" that i think is very encouraging . " green groups say too little too late but environmentalists and green groups in europe were less impressed with the president 's address and said his measures did n't go far enough . jan kowalzig at friends of the earth europe told news agency afp that biofuel and fuel-efficiency initiatives were " worthwhile measures " but did not tackle the critical problem posed by us emissions of greenhouse gases . bush declined in his annual address to support mandatory caps on heat-trapping carbon gases that big us companies such as general electric co. have pushed for . only a mandatory cap on these emissions could drive down this pollution , said kowalzig .
he added that biofuels could in fact worsen the greenhouse-gas problem . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush does n't support mandatory carbon caps " in theory , they only produce as many greenhouse gas emissions as they suck up when growing , so they would be carbon neutral , " kowalzig said .
" in practice , in most places , they are not , because transportation of the fuels , processing of the fuels , all that requires energy which is currently driven by a fossil-fuel economy , " he said .
" so all these biofuels projects currently add to the greenhouse-gas effect . " bush u-turns on climate change bush 's address had been trailed by several media reports that forecast a u-turn on climate change . in 2001 , bush abandoned the kyoto protocol for curbing greenhouse-gas emissions , saying the pact 's binding caps were unfair and too costly for the us economy . bereft of the united states , which by itself accounts for nearly a quarter of global carbon pollution , kyoto has limped along and negotiations on cuts beyond 2012 are set to be long and bitter . but bush made no reference at all to the kyoto process or the voluntary initiatives on emissions and alternative energy that he has launched bilaterally and regionally . he did refer to global climate change , though , as a " serious challenge " that these technologies would help to confront . " bush out of step " some of corporate america 's industrial giants , including alcoa , general electric and dupont , this week called for mandatory caps on businesses ' greenhouse gas emissions , and trading of emissions permits . some observers said bush was out of kilter with domestic demands for action on climate change . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush 's plans for iraq found few takers in germany " he 's clearly out of step with where the american public and us congress are right now on climate change , which is ready to go much further than continuing technology initiatives , " jennifer morgan , a europe-based consultant on climate change and former spokesman with the green group wwf , told afp . european leaders however were less enthusiastic about bush 's plans for iraq in his address which involve sending 20,000 more american troops to the violence-racked country . both voigt and trittin criticized the plans , saying they could not detect any coherent political strategy . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de global warming bubbles to the surface in davos an exceptionally mild first half of winter in the swiss alps is helping to fuel growing concern about climate change at the annual meeting of the world economic forum , beginning on wednesday in davos .

" " my clear and succinct answer is : no ! "
merkel told the gathering of business and political leaders in the swiss resort of davos . speaking as the current president of the european union , merkel said she wanted the bloc to use the motto " more freedom for a new security " as its guiding principle for the future . she also said germany , during its presidency of the group of eight industrialized nations , would aim at removing exchange rate imbalances , boosting hedge fund transparency and starting a new dialogue with emerging powers . more opportunity merkel said recent deep rooted shifts in the structure of the world economy had spread opportunity for economic growth more widely , especially in emerging nations .
but she cautioned that the trend had also created greater uncertainty . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : movers and shakers in abundance , few celebrities this year " those who regard themselves as the winners of tomorrow can not feel sure that they will that they will also be the winners the day after tomorrow , " she warned the gathering of business and political leaders gathered here . the theme of this year 's world economic forum -lrb- wef -rrb- meeting - " the shifting power equation " - sought to take in everything from the growing geopolitical clout of asia to the increasing influence of the internet in business and information gathering . " we have a shift of power in many ways ... with the rise of china and india , and the next layer of countries like vietnam , brazil and korea , " said wef founder klaus schwab .
" at the same time we see the shift of power from business leaders to customers and shareholders , " schwab said . upbeat mood about 2007 the 2,400 registered participants at davos included 800 corporate chief executives or chairmen , 24 heads of state or government and 85 cabinet ministers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barbed wire in downtown davos business leaders were in upbeat mood about prospects for 2007 and beyond , amid strong corporate profits and forecasts for another year of global expansion , despite a predicted slowdown in the united states . a poll of davos participants by the organizers showed that 65 percent of corporate chiefs and politicians thought their children would live in a more prosperous world . economist laura tyson of the university of california , berkeley , sounded a cautious note when she said 2007 could be another fairytale year but warned that unresolved global imbalances meant " the big bad wolf is hiding in the forest . " an unusual lack of snow at davos in the run-up to this year 's forum helped to highlight the issue of climate change , which schwab expected to top the gathering 's agenda . cautious welcome for us proposals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us plans to cut emissions across the board there was a cautious welcome for us president george bush 's proposals for a long-term cut in us gasoline consumption , as business leaders urged greater government action on global warming . " i think it is a movement in the right direction , there is a recognition of the link between climate change and human activity , " said nicholas stern , the british government 's chief economic advisor . stern recently penned a major report that warned of the dire economic consequences of climate change unless swift action was taken . bush 's state of the union address on tuesday promised to cut us gasoline consumption by 20 percent by 2017 and favor alternative fuels like corn-based ethanol .
but it failed to meet growing expectations of federal limits on carbon emissions to match international ones . " you have to recognize what everyone is doing .
the united states is doing a lot on technology , a lot on standards .
but then of course we have to scale up our action , " stern said . shifting spheres of influence the theme of shifting spheres of influence was party reflected in the absence of big name us officials , while india sent a high-profile 100-member delegation and the prime minister of vietnam - the newest member of the world trade organization - also showed up . another notable " shift " was the lack of celebrities . with the exception of davos regular bono , famous names from the world of entertainment were scarce on the ground compared to previous years when the likes of angelina jolie , brad pitt and sharon stone stole the media spotlight from the corporate bigwigs and political leaders . " it is not our policy to invite stars , " schwab explained .

the text , adopted by 28 votes in favor , 17 against and three abstentions , criticized eu states for a failure to fulfill " european obligations , such as the respect of human rights . " more than 1,245 cia-operated flights flew over european airspace or stopped over at airports in europe , members of the european parliament -lrb- meps -rrb- concluded .
they urged member states to investigate these so-called extraordinary rendition flights . us president george w. bush in september acknowledged for the first time that the cia was running secret prisons for holding and interrogating high-level al-qaeda figures who had been captured since the september 11 , 2001 attacks . allegations that cia agents shipped prisoners through european airports to secret detention centers , including compounds in eastern europe , were first reported in november 2005 . eu involvement in torture eu deputies " condemned the fact that european countries have been relinquishing their control over their airspace and airports by turning a blind eye or admitting flights operated by the cia which , on some occasions , were being used for extraordinary renditions , " the report said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian claudio fava is a member of the eu investigation committee italian socialist mep claudio fava , who drafted the final conclusions of the probe , told reporters that " involvement in detainment amounts to a certain extent to involvement in torture . " the report , which goes to a vote of the full parliament next month , said that claims that the cia had a secret prison in poland were unproven .
however , the parliamentarians stressed that poland was the eu country least cooperative with the parliament probe . the report also mentioned the eu 's foreign policy and security chief javier solana , saying that he did not reveal his knowledge about the detention program . in addition , the meps called on the bloc to more strictly monitor data transfer to non-eu countries and the use of european airspace .
they also demanded more eu competencies in combating international terrorism . human rights organization human rights watch , in new york , responded to the report by saying european countries need to go further to stop their own policies that allow torture to continue worldwide . in a briefing paper , the non-profit group said eu states used " ' diplomatic assurances " to justify returning terrorism suspects to places where they were likely to be tortured .
the group said such policies are unreliable , unenforceable and ineffective and do little to protect against torture . " european governments have used these empty promises as a fig leaf to justify sending people to places where they risk being tortured , " holly cartner , the group 's europe and central asia director , said in a statement . german failures the eu committee 's final conclusions also accused the former german governmental coalition of the social democrats and greens of failing to work for the release of german resident murat kurnaz , who was imprisoned in the us camp at guantanamo bay . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier - who was former chancellor gerhard schröder 's chief of staff at the time and thus in charge of intelligence - on tuesday rejected charges that he had known about a us offer in 2002 to release a german-born turk from the us military prison at guantanamo . kurnaz was not freed until august 2006 , after intervention from the present government led by chancellor angela merkel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor merkel , right , has backed steinmeier in the ex-guantanamo inmate affair ahead of a meeting with the european parliament 's foreign affairs committee in brussels , steinmeier said that the former german government had repeatedly tried to free kurnaz . " on various occasions , we made efforts for a release , " steinmeier said .
charges that the former government had obstructed a release of kurnaz were " firstly wrong and simply mean , " he added . kurnaz spent four-and-a-half years at guantanamo on cuba after his arrest as a suspected al-qaeda supporter in pakistan , shortly after the september 11 , 2001 attacks . but eu lawmakers stressed that " according to confidential institutional information , the german government did not accept the us offer , made in 2002 , to release murat kurnaz from guantanamo . " the documents were given to the committee by the german government on the condition of strict confidentiality , carlos coelho , head of the special committee , told reporters . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german social democrats question eu report on cia scandal members of germany social democratic party on tuesday criticized a report by an eu parliament commission that could damage their party colleague , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier .

berlin allegedly rejected that , and a special committee of the european parliament says there 's enough proof to back the allegation . this alone would be a scandal that can not be covered up by claiming that kurnaz has turkish and not german citizenship and placing the blame on ankara instead of berlin .
a visit by german secret agents to kurnaz in guantanamo completes the picture . let 's be clear about this : barely 20 years of age , kurnaz was captured by the americans in pakistan .
he was possibly naive , but certainly not a terror suspect .
in january 2002 , he ended up at guantanamo , he was abused , but even the americans were eventually convinced of his innocence and wanted to send him back to germany .
berlin rejected the offer .
what 's more : the german authorities did n't merely not work towards his release , rather they boycotted it .
the man was n't able to leave the camp until 2006 . political responsibility for the germans ' behavior lies with a group of state secretaries and intelligence agency heads , who regularly discussed the security situation under the leadership of the chancellery 's chief-of-staff .
at the time in question , the latter position was occupied by frank-walter steinmeier , the current foreign minister .
he 'll have quite a bit of explaining to do to a parliamentary committee which is investigating the case .
it 's certain that steinmeier will have to resign if he can not offer any new information to make berlin 's behavior plausible . his resignation would obviously not explain why berlin behaved the way it did .
foreign policy considerations may have played a role .
the german-american relationship was already tense because of germany 's " no " to the war in iraq .
it might have made sense not to put additional strain on ties with the us - whether by insisting in the case of guantanamo or by the released prisoner one day possibly making public accusations .
be that as it may ; it 's certainly not in line with a foreign policy oriented toward human rights which the social democratic-green party government had claimed to pursue . heinz dylong is an editor at dw-radio -lrb- win -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu report slams members for involvement in secret cia affair european union lawmakers have approved a report which lashes out at eu countries for tolerating or assisting the united states ' practice of secret detentions of terrorist suspects .

the nation 's family minister said she would like customers of women forced into the profession to be prosecuted . family minister ursula von der leyen said that there are still too many illegal prostitutes in germany and that it is still too hard for many of the woman in the field to leave , even if they want to . referring to a report on prostitution commissioned by the federal cabinet , von der leyen told reporters at a press conference on wednesday that the attempt to improve that lives of prostitutes by giving them access to healthcare , social security and pensions in a groundbreaking 2002 law still did not do enough for large numbers of sex workers in germany . " the possibilities in practice are almost never used , " she said , and announced new measures aimed at protecting women forced into sex work and underage prostitutes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : family minister ursula von der leyen " the prostitution law has only reached part of its goal , " she said , adding that health and hygiene conditions of most prostitutes have not improved since the law 's passage .
there are an estimated 400,000 registered prostitutes in germany . but von der leyen , a member of angela merkel 's conservative christian democratic party , said she was not aiming at turning back and clock and making prostitution illegal again , but wanted to offer sex workers viable ways out of the profession . " we want to rigorously go after the criminal element surrounding prostitution , " she said .
" that includes punishing customers of forced prostitutes , raising the minimal age and much stricter controls over brothels , with the message that prostitution is not just a job like any other . " the final goal must be to encourage prostitutes to get out of the field , she said . ignorance no excuse chancellor merkel 's grand coalition government is now drafting new legislation that would raise the legal age for prostitution from 16 to 18 and would plug a legal loophole that allows clients of women forced into prostitution to escape prosecution by pleading ignorance of their situation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are some 400,000 registered prostitites in germany " if the prostitute speaks no german and has bruises on her body then the client has to assume this is forced prostitution , " von der leyen said .
" he can no longer say : ' i did n't notice ' . " more than half of the prostitutes in germany are thought to be here illegally , many from eastern europe , and because most have no legal papers , leaving the profession or the men who control their lives , is next to impossible . however , the family minister offered no details on how such measures would be enforced . her proposals will have to be approved by the german cabinet and then approved by the parliament before becoming law . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a job like none other : being a prostitute in germany morning , noon and night - the demand for prostitutes is huge .

berlin allegedly rejected that , and a special committee of the european parliament says there 's enough proof to back the allegation . this alone would be a scandal that can not be covered up by claiming that kurnaz has turkish and not german citizenship and placing the blame on ankara instead of berlin .
a visit by german secret agents to kurnaz in guantanamo completes the picture . let 's be clear about this : barely 20 years of age , kurnaz was captured by the americans in pakistan .
he was possibly naive , but certainly not a terror suspect .
in january 2002 , he ended up at guantanamo , he was abused , but even the americans were eventually convinced of his innocence and wanted to send him back to germany .
berlin rejected the offer .
what 's more : the german authorities did n't merely not work towards his release , rather they boycotted it .
the man was n't able to leave the camp until 2006 . political responsibility for the germans ' behavior lies with a group of state secretaries and intelligence agency heads , who regularly discussed the security situation under the leadership of the chancellery 's chief-of-staff .
at the time in question , the latter position was occupied by frank-walter steinmeier , the current foreign minister .
he 'll have quite a bit of explaining to do to a parliamentary committee which is investigating the case .
it 's certain that steinmeier will have to resign if he can not offer any new information to make berlin 's behavior plausible . his resignation would obviously not explain why berlin behaved the way it did .
foreign policy considerations may have played a role .
the german-american relationship was already tense because of germany 's " no " to the war in iraq .
it might have made sense not to put additional strain on ties with the us - whether by insisting in the case of guantanamo or by the released prisoner one day possibly making public accusations .
be that as it may ; it 's certainly not in line with a foreign policy oriented toward human rights which the social democratic-green party government had claimed to pursue . heinz dylong is an editor at dw-radio -lrb- win -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu report slams members for involvement in secret cia affair european union lawmakers have approved a report which lashes out at eu countries for tolerating or assisting the united states ' practice of secret detentions of terrorist suspects .

the house in wittenberg that held his massive workshop has recently been restored and was reopened wednesday . lucas cranach was a true renaissance man .
he possessed the rare combination of talent and wealth and , not only did he become one of the most significant painters of the german renaissance , he also enjoyed success as a merchant , politician and even a pharmacist . when the ruler of saxony , frederick iii , invited cranach to wittenberg in 1505 to become his court painter , the 33-year-old artist could n't have suspected that he would spend the next 45 years of his life there .

"
but environmentalists in europe say his measures do n't go far enough . german leaders on wednesday reacted positively to us president george w. bush 's annual state of the union speech in which he called climate change a " serious issue " and urged americans to cut their gasoline consumption by 20 percent over a decade , mostly through a nearly five-fold increase in use of home-grown fuels such as ethanol . bush also pushed for tighter vehicle fuel efficiency standards . " a positive sign " " the fact that the american president acknowledges climate change as a problem is definitely a positive sign , " karsten voigt , the government 's coordinator of transatlantic relations told spiegel online . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush said climate change was a " serious challenge " voigt said bush had realized that saving energy was not just important on the political level , but also for security reasons . former german environment minister , jürgen trittin told german radio that bush had realized that oil-dependency massively undermined his leveraging power .
bush 's speech , said trittin , could " improve transatlantic cooperation in the fight against climate change . " bärbel höhn , deputy leader of the green group in parliament urged the german government to set similar ambitious goals on renewable energy like the american president did in his address . " we have to be careful that we do n't squander our leadership and technological edge in renewable energy , " höhn said . " moving in the right direction " sir nicholas stern , chief economic adviser to the british government and author of a report in 2006 that warned of the mounting costs of climate change , said bush 's speech was " a movement in the right direction . " " there is a recognition of the link between climate change and human activity , " he told reporters at the world economic forum in davos , switzerland . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush 's comments made for much debate in davos " you have to recognise what everyone is doing .
the united states is doing a lot on technology , a lot on standards .
but then of course we have to scale up our action . " the executive secretary of the un framework convention on climate change -lrb- unfccc -rrb- , yvo de boer , said bush 's speech marked a shift towards a more sustainable form of energy and noted his choice of words about climate change . " he did not talk in his state of the union address about international cooperation on climate change .
but at the same time , he did put his remarks in the context of the need for global response , " de boer told reporters in tokyo .
" that i think is very encouraging . " green groups say too little too late but environmentalists and green groups in europe were less impressed with the president 's address and said his measures did n't go far enough . jan kowalzig at friends of the earth europe told news agency afp that biofuel and fuel-efficiency initiatives were " worthwhile measures " but did not tackle the critical problem posed by us emissions of greenhouse gases . bush declined in his annual address to support mandatory caps on heat-trapping carbon gases that big us companies such as general electric co. have pushed for . only a mandatory cap on these emissions could drive down this pollution , said kowalzig .
he added that biofuels could in fact worsen the greenhouse-gas problem . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush does n't support mandatory carbon caps " in theory , they only produce as many greenhouse gas emissions as they suck up when growing , so they would be carbon neutral , " kowalzig said .
" in practice , in most places , they are not , because transportation of the fuels , processing of the fuels , all that requires energy which is currently driven by a fossil-fuel economy , " he said .
" so all these biofuels projects currently add to the greenhouse-gas effect . " bush u-turns on climate change bush 's address had been trailed by several media reports that forecast a u-turn on climate change . in 2001 , bush abandoned the kyoto protocol for curbing greenhouse-gas emissions , saying the pact 's binding caps were unfair and too costly for the us economy . bereft of the united states , which by itself accounts for nearly a quarter of global carbon pollution , kyoto has limped along and negotiations on cuts beyond 2012 are set to be long and bitter . but bush made no reference at all to the kyoto process or the voluntary initiatives on emissions and alternative energy that he has launched bilaterally and regionally . he did refer to global climate change , though , as a " serious challenge " that these technologies would help to confront . " bush out of step " some of corporate america 's industrial giants , including alcoa , general electric and dupont , this week called for mandatory caps on businesses ' greenhouse gas emissions , and trading of emissions permits . some observers said bush was out of kilter with domestic demands for action on climate change . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush 's plans for iraq found few takers in germany " he 's clearly out of step with where the american public and us congress are right now on climate change , which is ready to go much further than continuing technology initiatives , " jennifer morgan , a europe-based consultant on climate change and former spokesman with the green group wwf , told afp . european leaders however were less enthusiastic about bush 's plans for iraq in his address which involve sending 20,000 more american troops to the violence-racked country . both voigt and trittin criticized the plans , saying they could not detect any coherent political strategy . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de global warming bubbles to the surface in davos an exceptionally mild first half of winter in the swiss alps is helping to fuel growing concern about climate change at the annual meeting of the world economic forum , beginning on wednesday in davos .

the text , adopted by 28 votes in favor , 17 against and three abstentions , criticized eu states for a failure to fulfill " european obligations , such as the respect of human rights . " more than 1,245 cia-operated flights flew over european airspace or stopped over at airports in europe , members of the european parliament -lrb- meps -rrb- concluded .
they urged member states to investigate these so-called extraordinary rendition flights . us president george w. bush in september acknowledged for the first time that the cia was running secret prisons for holding and interrogating high-level al-qaeda figures who had been captured since the september 11 , 2001 attacks . allegations that cia agents shipped prisoners through european airports to secret detention centers , including compounds in eastern europe , were first reported in november 2005 . eu involvement in torture eu deputies " condemned the fact that european countries have been relinquishing their control over their airspace and airports by turning a blind eye or admitting flights operated by the cia which , on some occasions , were being used for extraordinary renditions , " the report said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian claudio fava is a member of the eu investigation committee italian socialist mep claudio fava , who drafted the final conclusions of the probe , told reporters that " involvement in detainment amounts to a certain extent to involvement in torture . " the report , which goes to a vote of the full parliament next month , said that claims that the cia had a secret prison in poland were unproven .
however , the parliamentarians stressed that poland was the eu country least cooperative with the parliament probe . the report also mentioned the eu 's foreign policy and security chief javier solana , saying that he did not reveal his knowledge about the detention program . in addition , the meps called on the bloc to more strictly monitor data transfer to non-eu countries and the use of european airspace .
they also demanded more eu competencies in combating international terrorism . human rights organization human rights watch , in new york , responded to the report by saying european countries need to go further to stop their own policies that allow torture to continue worldwide . in a briefing paper , the non-profit group said eu states used " ' diplomatic assurances " to justify returning terrorism suspects to places where they were likely to be tortured .
the group said such policies are unreliable , unenforceable and ineffective and do little to protect against torture . " european governments have used these empty promises as a fig leaf to justify sending people to places where they risk being tortured , " holly cartner , the group 's europe and central asia director , said in a statement . german failures the eu committee 's final conclusions also accused the former german governmental coalition of the social democrats and greens of failing to work for the release of german resident murat kurnaz , who was imprisoned in the us camp at guantanamo bay . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier - who was former chancellor gerhard schröder 's chief of staff at the time and thus in charge of intelligence - on tuesday rejected charges that he had known about a us offer in 2002 to release a german-born turk from the us military prison at guantanamo . kurnaz was not freed until august 2006 , after intervention from the present government led by chancellor angela merkel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor merkel , right , has backed steinmeier in the ex-guantanamo inmate affair ahead of a meeting with the european parliament 's foreign affairs committee in brussels , steinmeier said that the former german government had repeatedly tried to free kurnaz . " on various occasions , we made efforts for a release , " steinmeier said .
charges that the former government had obstructed a release of kurnaz were " firstly wrong and simply mean , " he added . kurnaz spent four-and-a-half years at guantanamo on cuba after his arrest as a suspected al-qaeda supporter in pakistan , shortly after the september 11 , 2001 attacks . but eu lawmakers stressed that " according to confidential institutional information , the german government did not accept the us offer , made in 2002 , to release murat kurnaz from guantanamo . " the documents were given to the committee by the german government on the condition of strict confidentiality , carlos coelho , head of the special committee , told reporters . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german social democrats question eu report on cia scandal members of germany social democratic party on tuesday criticized a report by an eu parliament commission that could damage their party colleague , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier .

berlin allegedly rejected that , and a special committee of the european parliament says there 's enough proof to back the allegation . this alone would be a scandal that can not be covered up by claiming that kurnaz has turkish and not german citizenship and placing the blame on ankara instead of berlin .
a visit by german secret agents to kurnaz in guantanamo completes the picture . let 's be clear about this : barely 20 years of age , kurnaz was captured by the americans in pakistan .
he was possibly naive , but certainly not a terror suspect .
in january 2002 , he ended up at guantanamo , he was abused , but even the americans were eventually convinced of his innocence and wanted to send him back to germany .
berlin rejected the offer .
what 's more : the german authorities did n't merely not work towards his release , rather they boycotted it .
the man was n't able to leave the camp until 2006 . political responsibility for the germans ' behavior lies with a group of state secretaries and intelligence agency heads , who regularly discussed the security situation under the leadership of the chancellery 's chief-of-staff .
at the time in question , the latter position was occupied by frank-walter steinmeier , the current foreign minister .
he 'll have quite a bit of explaining to do to a parliamentary committee which is investigating the case .
it 's certain that steinmeier will have to resign if he can not offer any new information to make berlin 's behavior plausible . his resignation would obviously not explain why berlin behaved the way it did .
foreign policy considerations may have played a role .
the german-american relationship was already tense because of germany 's " no " to the war in iraq .
it might have made sense not to put additional strain on ties with the us - whether by insisting in the case of guantanamo or by the released prisoner one day possibly making public accusations .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 24.01.2007 at davos kick-off , merkel says no to protectionism großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel focused on the challenges of globalization during her speech in a wide-ranging speech at the world economic forum , german chancellor angela merkel on wednesday staunchly rejected protectionism as a solution to the economic and social challenges of globalization . chancellor merkel said some countries might be tempted to exploit their economic might to its fullest , by selfishly consuming global resources and setting up customs barriers to protect " their own weaknesses . " " my clear and succinct answer is : no ! "
merkel told the gathering of business and political leaders in the swiss resort of davos . speaking as the current president of the european union , merkel said she wanted the bloc to use the motto " more freedom for a new security " as its guiding principle for the future . she also said germany , during its presidency of the group of eight industrialized nations , would aim at removing exchange rate imbalances , boosting hedge fund transparency and starting a new dialogue with emerging powers . more opportunity merkel said recent deep rooted shifts in the structure of the world economy had spread opportunity for economic growth more widely , especially in emerging nations .
but she cautioned that the trend had also created greater uncertainty . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : movers and shakers in abundance , few celebrities this year " those who regard themselves as the winners of tomorrow can not feel sure that they will that they will also be the winners the day after tomorrow , " she warned the gathering of business and political leaders gathered here . the theme of this year 's world economic forum -lrb- wef -rrb- meeting - " the shifting power equation " - sought to take in everything from the growing geopolitical clout of asia to the increasing influence of the internet in business and information gathering . " we have a shift of power in many ways ... with the rise of china and india , and the next layer of countries like vietnam , brazil and korea , " said wef founder klaus schwab .
" at the same time we see the shift of power from business leaders to customers and shareholders , " schwab said . upbeat mood about 2007 the 2,400 registered participants at davos included 800 corporate chief executives or chairmen , 24 heads of state or government and 85 cabinet ministers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barbed wire in downtown davos business leaders were in upbeat mood about prospects for 2007 and beyond , amid strong corporate profits and forecasts for another year of global expansion , despite a predicted slowdown in the united states . a poll of davos participants by the organizers showed that 65 percent of corporate chiefs and politicians thought their children would live in a more prosperous world . economist laura tyson of the university of california , berkeley , sounded a cautious note when she said 2007 could be another fairytale year but warned that unresolved global imbalances meant " the big bad wolf is hiding in the forest . " an unusual lack of snow at davos in the run-up to this year 's forum helped to highlight the issue of climate change , which schwab expected to top the gathering 's agenda . cautious welcome for us proposals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us plans to cut emissions across the board there was a cautious welcome for us president george bush 's proposals for a long-term cut in us gasoline consumption , as business leaders urged greater government action on global warming . " i think it is a movement in the right direction , there is a recognition of the link between climate change and human activity , " said nicholas stern , the british government 's chief economic advisor . stern recently penned a major report that warned of the dire economic consequences of climate change unless swift action was taken . bush 's state of the union address on tuesday promised to cut us gasoline consumption by 20 percent by 2017 and favor alternative fuels like corn-based ethanol .
but it failed to meet growing expectations of federal limits on carbon emissions to match international ones . " you have to recognize what everyone is doing .
the united states is doing a lot on technology , a lot on standards .
but then of course we have to scale up our action , " stern said . shifting spheres of influence the theme of shifting spheres of influence was party reflected in the absence of big name us officials , while india sent a high-profile 100-member delegation and the prime minister of vietnam - the newest member of the world trade organization - also showed up . another notable " shift " was the lack of celebrities . with the exception of davos regular bono , famous names from the world of entertainment were scarce on the ground compared to previous years when the likes of angelina jolie , brad pitt and sharon stone stole the media spotlight from the corporate bigwigs and political leaders . " it is not our policy to invite stars , " schwab explained .
" it is our policy to invite people who can make contributions to specific sessions .

it used to be when you wanted a cd you had to go out and buy it .

berlin allegedly rejected that , and a special committee of the european parliament says there 's enough proof to back the allegation . this alone would be a scandal that can not be covered up by claiming that kurnaz has turkish and not german citizenship and placing the blame on ankara instead of berlin .
a visit by german secret agents to kurnaz in guantanamo completes the picture . let 's be clear about this : barely 20 years of age , kurnaz was captured by the americans in pakistan .
he was possibly naive , but certainly not a terror suspect .
in january 2002 , he ended up at guantanamo , he was abused , but even the americans were eventually convinced of his innocence and wanted to send him back to germany .
berlin rejected the offer .
what 's more : the german authorities did n't merely not work towards his release , rather they boycotted it .
the man was n't able to leave the camp until 2006 . political responsibility for the germans ' behavior lies with a group of state secretaries and intelligence agency heads , who regularly discussed the security situation under the leadership of the chancellery 's chief-of-staff .
at the time in question , the latter position was occupied by frank-walter steinmeier , the current foreign minister .
he 'll have quite a bit of explaining to do to a parliamentary committee which is investigating the case .
it 's certain that steinmeier will have to resign if he can not offer any new information to make berlin 's behavior plausible . his resignation would obviously not explain why berlin behaved the way it did .
foreign policy considerations may have played a role .
the german-american relationship was already tense because of germany 's " no " to the war in iraq .
it might have made sense not to put additional strain on ties with the us - whether by insisting in the case of guantanamo or by the released prisoner one day possibly making public accusations .
be that as it may ; it 's certainly not in line with a foreign policy oriented toward human rights which the social democratic-green party government had claimed to pursue . heinz dylong is an editor at dw-radio -lrb- win -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu report slams members for involvement in secret cia affair european union lawmakers have approved a report which lashes out at eu countries for tolerating or assisting the united states ' practice of secret detentions of terrorist suspects .

the text , adopted by 28 votes in favor , 17 against and three abstentions , criticized eu states for a failure to fulfill " european obligations , such as the respect of human rights . " more than 1,245 cia-operated flights flew over european airspace or stopped over at airports in europe , members of the european parliament -lrb- meps -rrb- concluded .
they urged member states to investigate these so-called extraordinary rendition flights . us president george w. bush in september acknowledged for the first time that the cia was running secret prisons for holding and interrogating high-level al-qaeda figures who had been captured since the september 11 , 2001 attacks . allegations that cia agents shipped prisoners through european airports to secret detention centers , including compounds in eastern europe , were first reported in november 2005 . eu involvement in torture eu deputies " condemned the fact that european countries have been relinquishing their control over their airspace and airports by turning a blind eye or admitting flights operated by the cia which , on some occasions , were being used for extraordinary renditions , " the report said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian claudio fava is a member of the eu investigation committee italian socialist mep claudio fava , who drafted the final conclusions of the probe , told reporters that " involvement in detainment amounts to a certain extent to involvement in torture . " the report , which goes to a vote of the full parliament next month , said that claims that the cia had a secret prison in poland were unproven .
however , the parliamentarians stressed that poland was the eu country least cooperative with the parliament probe . the report also mentioned the eu 's foreign policy and security chief javier solana , saying that he did not reveal his knowledge about the detention program . in addition , the meps called on the bloc to more strictly monitor data transfer to non-eu countries and the use of european airspace .
they also demanded more eu competencies in combating international terrorism . human rights organization human rights watch , in new york , responded to the report by saying european countries need to go further to stop their own policies that allow torture to continue worldwide . in a briefing paper , the non-profit group said eu states used " ' diplomatic assurances " to justify returning terrorism suspects to places where they were likely to be tortured .
the group said such policies are unreliable , unenforceable and ineffective and do little to protect against torture . " european governments have used these empty promises as a fig leaf to justify sending people to places where they risk being tortured , " holly cartner , the group 's europe and central asia director , said in a statement . german failures the eu committee 's final conclusions also accused the former german governmental coalition of the social democrats and greens of failing to work for the release of german resident murat kurnaz , who was imprisoned in the us camp at guantanamo bay . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier - who was former chancellor gerhard schröder 's chief of staff at the time and thus in charge of intelligence - on tuesday rejected charges that he had known about a us offer in 2002 to release a german-born turk from the us military prison at guantanamo . kurnaz was not freed until august 2006 , after intervention from the present government led by chancellor angela merkel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor merkel , right , has backed steinmeier in the ex-guantanamo inmate affair ahead of a meeting with the european parliament 's foreign affairs committee in brussels , steinmeier said that the former german government had repeatedly tried to free kurnaz . " on various occasions , we made efforts for a release , " steinmeier said .
charges that the former government had obstructed a release of kurnaz were " firstly wrong and simply mean , " he added . kurnaz spent four-and-a-half years at guantanamo on cuba after his arrest as a suspected al-qaeda supporter in pakistan , shortly after the september 11 , 2001 attacks . but eu lawmakers stressed that " according to confidential institutional information , the german government did not accept the us offer , made in 2002 , to release murat kurnaz from guantanamo .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 24.01.2007 at davos kick-off , merkel says no to protectionism großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel focused on the challenges of globalization during her speech in a wide-ranging speech at the world economic forum , german chancellor angela merkel on wednesday staunchly rejected protectionism as a solution to the economic and social challenges of globalization . chancellor merkel said some countries might be tempted to exploit their economic might to its fullest , by selfishly consuming global resources and setting up customs barriers to protect " their own weaknesses . " " my clear and succinct answer is : no ! "
merkel told the gathering of business and political leaders in the swiss resort of davos . speaking as the current president of the european union , merkel said she wanted the bloc to use the motto " more freedom for a new security " as its guiding principle for the future . she also said germany , during its presidency of the group of eight industrialized nations , would aim at removing exchange rate imbalances , boosting hedge fund transparency and starting a new dialogue with emerging powers . more opportunity merkel said recent deep rooted shifts in the structure of the world economy had spread opportunity for economic growth more widely , especially in emerging nations .
but she cautioned that the trend had also created greater uncertainty . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : movers and shakers in abundance , few celebrities this year " those who regard themselves as the winners of tomorrow can not feel sure that they will that they will also be the winners the day after tomorrow , " she warned the gathering of business and political leaders gathered here . the theme of this year 's world economic forum -lrb- wef -rrb- meeting - " the shifting power equation " - sought to take in everything from the growing geopolitical clout of asia to the increasing influence of the internet in business and information gathering . " we have a shift of power in many ways ... with the rise of china and india , and the next layer of countries like vietnam , brazil and korea , " said wef founder klaus schwab .
" at the same time we see the shift of power from business leaders to customers and shareholders , " schwab said . upbeat mood about 2007 the 2,400 registered participants at davos included 800 corporate chief executives or chairmen , 24 heads of state or government and 85 cabinet ministers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barbed wire in downtown davos business leaders were in upbeat mood about prospects for 2007 and beyond , amid strong corporate profits and forecasts for another year of global expansion , despite a predicted slowdown in the united states . a poll of davos participants by the organizers showed that 65 percent of corporate chiefs and politicians thought their children would live in a more prosperous world . economist laura tyson of the university of california , berkeley , sounded a cautious note when she said 2007 could be another fairytale year but warned that unresolved global imbalances meant " the big bad wolf is hiding in the forest . " an unusual lack of snow at davos in the run-up to this year 's forum helped to highlight the issue of climate change , which schwab expected to top the gathering 's agenda . cautious welcome for us proposals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us plans to cut emissions across the board there was a cautious welcome for us president george bush 's proposals for a long-term cut in us gasoline consumption , as business leaders urged greater government action on global warming . " i think it is a movement in the right direction , there is a recognition of the link between climate change and human activity , " said nicholas stern , the british government 's chief economic advisor . stern recently penned a major report that warned of the dire economic consequences of climate change unless swift action was taken . bush 's state of the union address on tuesday promised to cut us gasoline consumption by 20 percent by 2017 and favor alternative fuels like corn-based ethanol .
but it failed to meet growing expectations of federal limits on carbon emissions to match international ones . " you have to recognize what everyone is doing .
the united states is doing a lot on technology , a lot on standards .
but then of course we have to scale up our action , " stern said . shifting spheres of influence the theme of shifting spheres of influence was party reflected in the absence of big name us officials , while india sent a high-profile 100-member delegation and the prime minister of vietnam - the newest member of the world trade organization - also showed up . another notable " shift " was the lack of celebrities . with the exception of davos regular bono , famous names from the world of entertainment were scarce on the ground compared to previous years when the likes of angelina jolie , brad pitt and sharon stone stole the media spotlight from the corporate bigwigs and political leaders . " it is not our policy to invite stars , " schwab explained .

but environmentalists in europe say his measures do n't go far enough . german leaders on wednesday reacted positively to us president george w. bush 's annual state of the union speech in which he called climate change a " serious issue " and urged americans to cut their gasoline consumption by 20 percent over a decade , mostly through a nearly five-fold increase in use of home-grown fuels such as ethanol . bush also pushed for tighter vehicle fuel efficiency standards . " a positive sign " " the fact that the american president acknowledges climate change as a problem is definitely a positive sign , " karsten voigt , the government 's coordinator of transatlantic relations told spiegel online . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush said climate change was a " serious challenge " voigt said bush had realized that saving energy was not just important on the political level , but also for security reasons . former german environment minister , jürgen trittin told german radio that bush had realized that oil-dependency massively undermined his leveraging power .
bush 's speech , said trittin , could " improve transatlantic cooperation in the fight against climate change . " bärbel höhn , deputy leader of the green group in parliament urged the german government to set similar ambitious goals on renewable energy like the american president did in his address . " we have to be careful that we do n't squander our leadership and technological edge in renewable energy , " höhn said . " moving in the right direction " sir nicholas stern , chief economic adviser to the british government and author of a report in 2006 that warned of the mounting costs of climate change , said bush 's speech was " a movement in the right direction . " " there is a recognition of the link between climate change and human activity , " he told reporters at the world economic forum in davos , switzerland . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush 's comments made for much debate in davos " you have to recognise what everyone is doing .
the united states is doing a lot on technology , a lot on standards .
but then of course we have to scale up our action . " the executive secretary of the un framework convention on climate change -lrb- unfccc -rrb- , yvo de boer , said bush 's speech marked a shift towards a more sustainable form of energy and noted his choice of words about climate change . " he did not talk in his state of the union address about international cooperation on climate change .
but at the same time , he did put his remarks in the context of the need for global response , " de boer told reporters in tokyo .
" that i think is very encouraging . " green groups say too little too late but environmentalists and green groups in europe were less impressed with the president 's address and said his measures did n't go far enough . jan kowalzig at friends of the earth europe told news agency afp that biofuel and fuel-efficiency initiatives were " worthwhile measures " but did not tackle the critical problem posed by us emissions of greenhouse gases . bush declined in his annual address to support mandatory caps on heat-trapping carbon gases that big us companies such as general electric co. have pushed for . only a mandatory cap on these emissions could drive down this pollution , said kowalzig .
he added that biofuels could in fact worsen the greenhouse-gas problem . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush does n't support mandatory carbon caps " in theory , they only produce as many greenhouse gas emissions as they suck up when growing , so they would be carbon neutral , " kowalzig said .
" in practice , in most places , they are not , because transportation of the fuels , processing of the fuels , all that requires energy which is currently driven by a fossil-fuel economy , " he said .
" so all these biofuels projects currently add to the greenhouse-gas effect . " bush u-turns on climate change bush 's address had been trailed by several media reports that forecast a u-turn on climate change . in 2001 , bush abandoned the kyoto protocol for curbing greenhouse-gas emissions , saying the pact 's binding caps were unfair and too costly for the us economy . bereft of the united states , which by itself accounts for nearly a quarter of global carbon pollution , kyoto has limped along and negotiations on cuts beyond 2012 are set to be long and bitter . but bush made no reference at all to the kyoto process or the voluntary initiatives on emissions and alternative energy that he has launched bilaterally and regionally . he did refer to global climate change , though , as a " serious challenge " that these technologies would help to confront . " bush out of step " some of corporate america 's industrial giants , including alcoa , general electric and dupont , this week called for mandatory caps on businesses ' greenhouse gas emissions , and trading of emissions permits . some observers said bush was out of kilter with domestic demands for action on climate change . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush 's plans for iraq found few takers in germany " he 's clearly out of step with where the american public and us congress are right now on climate change , which is ready to go much further than continuing technology initiatives , " jennifer morgan , a europe-based consultant on climate change and former spokesman with the green group wwf , told afp . european leaders however were less enthusiastic about bush 's plans for iraq in his address which involve sending 20,000 more american troops to the violence-racked country . both voigt and trittin criticized the plans , saying they could not detect any coherent political strategy . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de global warming bubbles to the surface in davos an exceptionally mild first half of winter in the swiss alps is helping to fuel growing concern about climate change at the annual meeting of the world economic forum , beginning on wednesday in davos .

the nation 's family minister said she would like customers of women forced into the profession to be prosecuted . family minister ursula von der leyen said that there are still too many illegal prostitutes in germany and that it is still too hard for many of the woman in the field to leave , even if they want to . referring to a report on prostitution commissioned by the federal cabinet , von der leyen told reporters at a press conference on wednesday that the attempt to improve that lives of prostitutes by giving them access to healthcare , social security and pensions in a groundbreaking 2002 law still did not do enough for large numbers of sex workers in germany . " the possibilities in practice are almost never used , " she said , and announced new measures aimed at protecting women forced into sex work and underage prostitutes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : family minister ursula von der leyen " the prostitution law has only reached part of its goal , " she said , adding that health and hygiene conditions of most prostitutes have not improved since the law 's passage .
there are an estimated 400,000 registered prostitutes in germany . but von der leyen , a member of angela merkel 's conservative christian democratic party , said she was not aiming at turning back and clock and making prostitution illegal again , but wanted to offer sex workers viable ways out of the profession . " we want to rigorously go after the criminal element surrounding prostitution , " she said .
" that includes punishing customers of forced prostitutes , raising the minimal age and much stricter controls over brothels , with the message that prostitution is not just a job like any other . " the final goal must be to encourage prostitutes to get out of the field , she said . ignorance no excuse chancellor merkel 's grand coalition government is now drafting new legislation that would raise the legal age for prostitution from 16 to 18 and would plug a legal loophole that allows clients of women forced into prostitution to escape prosecution by pleading ignorance of their situation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are some 400,000 registered prostitites in germany " if the prostitute speaks no german and has bruises on her body then the client has to assume this is forced prostitution , " von der leyen said .
" he can no longer say : ' i did n't notice ' . " more than half of the prostitutes in germany are thought to be here illegally , many from eastern europe , and because most have no legal papers , leaving the profession or the men who control their lives , is next to impossible . however , the family minister offered no details on how such measures would be enforced . her proposals will have to be approved by the german cabinet and then approved by the parliament before becoming law . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a job like none other : being a prostitute in germany morning , noon and night - the demand for prostitutes is huge .

"
but environmentalists in europe say his measures do n't go far enough . german leaders on wednesday reacted positively to us president george w. bush 's annual state of the union speech in which he called climate change a " serious issue " and urged americans to cut their gasoline consumption by 20 percent over a decade , mostly through a nearly five-fold increase in use of home-grown fuels such as ethanol . bush also pushed for tighter vehicle fuel efficiency standards . " a positive sign " " the fact that the american president acknowledges climate change as a problem is definitely a positive sign , " karsten voigt , the government 's coordinator of transatlantic relations told spiegel online . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush said climate change was a " serious challenge " voigt said bush had realized that saving energy was not just important on the political level , but also for security reasons . former german environment minister , jürgen trittin told german radio that bush had realized that oil-dependency massively undermined his leveraging power .
bush 's speech , said trittin , could " improve transatlantic cooperation in the fight against climate change . " bärbel höhn , deputy leader of the green group in parliament urged the german government to set similar ambitious goals on renewable energy like the american president did in his address . " we have to be careful that we do n't squander our leadership and technological edge in renewable energy , " höhn said . " moving in the right direction " sir nicholas stern , chief economic adviser to the british government and author of a report in 2006 that warned of the mounting costs of climate change , said bush 's speech was " a movement in the right direction . " " there is a recognition of the link between climate change and human activity , " he told reporters at the world economic forum in davos , switzerland . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush 's comments made for much debate in davos " you have to recognise what everyone is doing .
the united states is doing a lot on technology , a lot on standards .
but then of course we have to scale up our action . " the executive secretary of the un framework convention on climate change -lrb- unfccc -rrb- , yvo de boer , said bush 's speech marked a shift towards a more sustainable form of energy and noted his choice of words about climate change . " he did not talk in his state of the union address about international cooperation on climate change .
but at the same time , he did put his remarks in the context of the need for global response , " de boer told reporters in tokyo .
" that i think is very encouraging . " green groups say too little too late but environmentalists and green groups in europe were less impressed with the president 's address and said his measures did n't go far enough . jan kowalzig at friends of the earth europe told news agency afp that biofuel and fuel-efficiency initiatives were " worthwhile measures " but did not tackle the critical problem posed by us emissions of greenhouse gases . bush declined in his annual address to support mandatory caps on heat-trapping carbon gases that big us companies such as general electric co. have pushed for . only a mandatory cap on these emissions could drive down this pollution , said kowalzig .
he added that biofuels could in fact worsen the greenhouse-gas problem . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush does n't support mandatory carbon caps " in theory , they only produce as many greenhouse gas emissions as they suck up when growing , so they would be carbon neutral , " kowalzig said .
" in practice , in most places , they are not , because transportation of the fuels , processing of the fuels , all that requires energy which is currently driven by a fossil-fuel economy , " he said .
" so all these biofuels projects currently add to the greenhouse-gas effect . " bush u-turns on climate change bush 's address had been trailed by several media reports that forecast a u-turn on climate change . in 2001 , bush abandoned the kyoto protocol for curbing greenhouse-gas emissions , saying the pact 's binding caps were unfair and too costly for the us economy . bereft of the united states , which by itself accounts for nearly a quarter of global carbon pollution , kyoto has limped along and negotiations on cuts beyond 2012 are set to be long and bitter . but bush made no reference at all to the kyoto process or the voluntary initiatives on emissions and alternative energy that he has launched bilaterally and regionally . he did refer to global climate change , though , as a " serious challenge " that these technologies would help to confront . " bush out of step " some of corporate america 's industrial giants , including alcoa , general electric and dupont , this week called for mandatory caps on businesses ' greenhouse gas emissions , and trading of emissions permits . some observers said bush was out of kilter with domestic demands for action on climate change . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush 's plans for iraq found few takers in germany " he 's clearly out of step with where the american public and us congress are right now on climate change , which is ready to go much further than continuing technology initiatives , " jennifer morgan , a europe-based consultant on climate change and former spokesman with the green group wwf , told afp . european leaders however were less enthusiastic about bush 's plans for iraq in his address which involve sending 20,000 more american troops to the violence-racked country . both voigt and trittin criticized the plans , saying they could not detect any coherent political strategy . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de global warming bubbles to the surface in davos an exceptionally mild first half of winter in the swiss alps is helping to fuel growing concern about climate change at the annual meeting of the world economic forum , beginning on wednesday in davos .

"
but environmentalists in europe say his measures do n't go far enough . german leaders on wednesday reacted positively to us president george w. bush 's annual state of the union speech in which he called climate change a " serious issue " and urged americans to cut their gasoline consumption by 20 percent over a decade , mostly through a nearly five-fold increase in use of home-grown fuels such as ethanol . bush also pushed for tighter vehicle fuel efficiency standards . " a positive sign " " the fact that the american president acknowledges climate change as a problem is definitely a positive sign , " karsten voigt , the government 's coordinator of transatlantic relations told spiegel online . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush said climate change was a " serious challenge " voigt said bush had realized that saving energy was not just important on the political level , but also for security reasons . former german environment minister , jürgen trittin told german radio that bush had realized that oil-dependency massively undermined his leveraging power .
bush 's speech , said trittin , could " improve transatlantic cooperation in the fight against climate change . " bärbel höhn , deputy leader of the green group in parliament urged the german government to set similar ambitious goals on renewable energy like the american president did in his address . " we have to be careful that we do n't squander our leadership and technological edge in renewable energy , " höhn said . " moving in the right direction " sir nicholas stern , chief economic adviser to the british government and author of a report in 2006 that warned of the mounting costs of climate change , said bush 's speech was " a movement in the right direction . " " there is a recognition of the link between climate change and human activity , " he told reporters at the world economic forum in davos , switzerland . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush 's comments made for much debate in davos " you have to recognise what everyone is doing .
the united states is doing a lot on technology , a lot on standards .
but then of course we have to scale up our action . " the executive secretary of the un framework convention on climate change -lrb- unfccc -rrb- , yvo de boer , said bush 's speech marked a shift towards a more sustainable form of energy and noted his choice of words about climate change . " he did not talk in his state of the union address about international cooperation on climate change .
but at the same time , he did put his remarks in the context of the need for global response , " de boer told reporters in tokyo .
" that i think is very encouraging . " green groups say too little too late but environmentalists and green groups in europe were less impressed with the president 's address and said his measures did n't go far enough . jan kowalzig at friends of the earth europe told news agency afp that biofuel and fuel-efficiency initiatives were " worthwhile measures " but did not tackle the critical problem posed by us emissions of greenhouse gases . bush declined in his annual address to support mandatory caps on heat-trapping carbon gases that big us companies such as general electric co. have pushed for . only a mandatory cap on these emissions could drive down this pollution , said kowalzig .
he added that biofuels could in fact worsen the greenhouse-gas problem . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush does n't support mandatory carbon caps " in theory , they only produce as many greenhouse gas emissions as they suck up when growing , so they would be carbon neutral , " kowalzig said .
" in practice , in most places , they are not , because transportation of the fuels , processing of the fuels , all that requires energy which is currently driven by a fossil-fuel economy , " he said .
" so all these biofuels projects currently add to the greenhouse-gas effect . " bush u-turns on climate change bush 's address had been trailed by several media reports that forecast a u-turn on climate change . in 2001 , bush abandoned the kyoto protocol for curbing greenhouse-gas emissions , saying the pact 's binding caps were unfair and too costly for the us economy . bereft of the united states , which by itself accounts for nearly a quarter of global carbon pollution , kyoto has limped along and negotiations on cuts beyond 2012 are set to be long and bitter . but bush made no reference at all to the kyoto process or the voluntary initiatives on emissions and alternative energy that he has launched bilaterally and regionally . he did refer to global climate change , though , as a " serious challenge " that these technologies would help to confront . " bush out of step " some of corporate america 's industrial giants , including alcoa , general electric and dupont , this week called for mandatory caps on businesses ' greenhouse gas emissions , and trading of emissions permits . some observers said bush was out of kilter with domestic demands for action on climate change . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush 's plans for iraq found few takers in germany " he 's clearly out of step with where the american public and us congress are right now on climate change , which is ready to go much further than continuing technology initiatives , " jennifer morgan , a europe-based consultant on climate change and former spokesman with the green group wwf , told afp . european leaders however were less enthusiastic about bush 's plans for iraq in his address which involve sending 20,000 more american troops to the violence-racked country . both voigt and trittin criticized the plans , saying they could not detect any coherent political strategy . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de global warming bubbles to the surface in davos an exceptionally mild first half of winter in the swiss alps is helping to fuel growing concern about climate change at the annual meeting of the world economic forum , beginning on wednesday in davos .

the text , adopted by 28 votes in favor , 17 against and three abstentions , criticized eu states for a failure to fulfill " european obligations , such as the respect of human rights . " more than 1,245 cia-operated flights flew over european airspace or stopped over at airports in europe , members of the european parliament -lrb- meps -rrb- concluded .
they urged member states to investigate these so-called extraordinary rendition flights . us president george w. bush in september acknowledged for the first time that the cia was running secret prisons for holding and interrogating high-level al-qaeda figures who had been captured since the september 11 , 2001 attacks . allegations that cia agents shipped prisoners through european airports to secret detention centers , including compounds in eastern europe , were first reported in november 2005 . eu involvement in torture eu deputies " condemned the fact that european countries have been relinquishing their control over their airspace and airports by turning a blind eye or admitting flights operated by the cia which , on some occasions , were being used for extraordinary renditions , " the report said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian claudio fava is a member of the eu investigation committee italian socialist mep claudio fava , who drafted the final conclusions of the probe , told reporters that " involvement in detainment amounts to a certain extent to involvement in torture . " the report , which goes to a vote of the full parliament next month , said that claims that the cia had a secret prison in poland were unproven .
however , the parliamentarians stressed that poland was the eu country least cooperative with the parliament probe . the report also mentioned the eu 's foreign policy and security chief javier solana , saying that he did not reveal his knowledge about the detention program . in addition , the meps called on the bloc to more strictly monitor data transfer to non-eu countries and the use of european airspace .
they also demanded more eu competencies in combating international terrorism . human rights organization human rights watch , in new york , responded to the report by saying european countries need to go further to stop their own policies that allow torture to continue worldwide . in a briefing paper , the non-profit group said eu states used " ' diplomatic assurances " to justify returning terrorism suspects to places where they were likely to be tortured .
the group said such policies are unreliable , unenforceable and ineffective and do little to protect against torture . " european governments have used these empty promises as a fig leaf to justify sending people to places where they risk being tortured , " holly cartner , the group 's europe and central asia director , said in a statement . german failures the eu committee 's final conclusions also accused the former german governmental coalition of the social democrats and greens of failing to work for the release of german resident murat kurnaz , who was imprisoned in the us camp at guantanamo bay . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier - who was former chancellor gerhard schröder 's chief of staff at the time and thus in charge of intelligence - on tuesday rejected charges that he had known about a us offer in 2002 to release a german-born turk from the us military prison at guantanamo . kurnaz was not freed until august 2006 , after intervention from the present government led by chancellor angela merkel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor merkel , right , has backed steinmeier in the ex-guantanamo inmate affair ahead of a meeting with the european parliament 's foreign affairs committee in brussels , steinmeier said that the former german government had repeatedly tried to free kurnaz . " on various occasions , we made efforts for a release , " steinmeier said .
charges that the former government had obstructed a release of kurnaz were " firstly wrong and simply mean , " he added . kurnaz spent four-and-a-half years at guantanamo on cuba after his arrest as a suspected al-qaeda supporter in pakistan , shortly after the september 11 , 2001 attacks . but eu lawmakers stressed that " according to confidential institutional information , the german government did not accept the us offer , made in 2002 , to release murat kurnaz from guantanamo . " the documents were given to the committee by the german government on the condition of strict confidentiality , carlos coelho , head of the special committee , told reporters . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german social democrats question eu report on cia scandal members of germany social democratic party on tuesday criticized a report by an eu parliament commission that could damage their party colleague , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier .

"
but environmentalists in europe say his measures do n't go far enough . german leaders on wednesday reacted positively to us president george w. bush 's annual state of the union speech in which he called climate change a " serious issue " and urged americans to cut their gasoline consumption by 20 percent over a decade , mostly through a nearly five-fold increase in use of home-grown fuels such as ethanol . bush also pushed for tighter vehicle fuel efficiency standards . " a positive sign " " the fact that the american president acknowledges climate change as a problem is definitely a positive sign , " karsten voigt , the government 's coordinator of transatlantic relations told spiegel online . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush said climate change was a " serious challenge " voigt said bush had realized that saving energy was not just important on the political level , but also for security reasons . former german environment minister , jürgen trittin told german radio that bush had realized that oil-dependency massively undermined his leveraging power .
bush 's speech , said trittin , could " improve transatlantic cooperation in the fight against climate change . " bärbel höhn , deputy leader of the green group in parliament urged the german government to set similar ambitious goals on renewable energy like the american president did in his address . " we have to be careful that we do n't squander our leadership and technological edge in renewable energy , " höhn said . " moving in the right direction " sir nicholas stern , chief economic adviser to the british government and author of a report in 2006 that warned of the mounting costs of climate change , said bush 's speech was " a movement in the right direction . " " there is a recognition of the link between climate change and human activity , " he told reporters at the world economic forum in davos , switzerland . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush 's comments made for much debate in davos " you have to recognise what everyone is doing .
the united states is doing a lot on technology , a lot on standards .
but then of course we have to scale up our action . " the executive secretary of the un framework convention on climate change -lrb- unfccc -rrb- , yvo de boer , said bush 's speech marked a shift towards a more sustainable form of energy and noted his choice of words about climate change . " he did not talk in his state of the union address about international cooperation on climate change .
but at the same time , he did put his remarks in the context of the need for global response , " de boer told reporters in tokyo .
" that i think is very encouraging . " green groups say too little too late but environmentalists and green groups in europe were less impressed with the president 's address and said his measures did n't go far enough . jan kowalzig at friends of the earth europe told news agency afp that biofuel and fuel-efficiency initiatives were " worthwhile measures " but did not tackle the critical problem posed by us emissions of greenhouse gases . bush declined in his annual address to support mandatory caps on heat-trapping carbon gases that big us companies such as general electric co. have pushed for . only a mandatory cap on these emissions could drive down this pollution , said kowalzig .
he added that biofuels could in fact worsen the greenhouse-gas problem . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush does n't support mandatory carbon caps " in theory , they only produce as many greenhouse gas emissions as they suck up when growing , so they would be carbon neutral , " kowalzig said .
" in practice , in most places , they are not , because transportation of the fuels , processing of the fuels , all that requires energy which is currently driven by a fossil-fuel economy , " he said .
" so all these biofuels projects currently add to the greenhouse-gas effect . " bush u-turns on climate change bush 's address had been trailed by several media reports that forecast a u-turn on climate change . in 2001 , bush abandoned the kyoto protocol for curbing greenhouse-gas emissions , saying the pact 's binding caps were unfair and too costly for the us economy . bereft of the united states , which by itself accounts for nearly a quarter of global carbon pollution , kyoto has limped along and negotiations on cuts beyond 2012 are set to be long and bitter . but bush made no reference at all to the kyoto process or the voluntary initiatives on emissions and alternative energy that he has launched bilaterally and regionally . he did refer to global climate change , though , as a " serious challenge " that these technologies would help to confront . " bush out of step " some of corporate america 's industrial giants , including alcoa , general electric and dupont , this week called for mandatory caps on businesses ' greenhouse gas emissions , and trading of emissions permits . some observers said bush was out of kilter with domestic demands for action on climate change . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush 's plans for iraq found few takers in germany " he 's clearly out of step with where the american public and us congress are right now on climate change , which is ready to go much further than continuing technology initiatives , " jennifer morgan , a europe-based consultant on climate change and former spokesman with the green group wwf , told afp . european leaders however were less enthusiastic about bush 's plans for iraq in his address which involve sending 20,000 more american troops to the violence-racked country . both voigt and trittin criticized the plans , saying they could not detect any coherent political strategy . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de global warming bubbles to the surface in davos an exceptionally mild first half of winter in the swiss alps is helping to fuel growing concern about climate change at the annual meeting of the world economic forum , beginning on wednesday in davos .

the text , adopted by 28 votes in favor , 17 against and three abstentions , criticized eu states for a failure to fulfill " european obligations , such as the respect of human rights . " more than 1,245 cia-operated flights flew over european airspace or stopped over at airports in europe , members of the european parliament -lrb- meps -rrb- concluded .
they urged member states to investigate these so-called extraordinary rendition flights . us president george w. bush in september acknowledged for the first time that the cia was running secret prisons for holding and interrogating high-level al-qaeda figures who had been captured since the september 11 , 2001 attacks . allegations that cia agents shipped prisoners through european airports to secret detention centers , including compounds in eastern europe , were first reported in november 2005 . eu involvement in torture eu deputies " condemned the fact that european countries have been relinquishing their control over their airspace and airports by turning a blind eye or admitting flights operated by the cia which , on some occasions , were being used for extraordinary renditions , " the report said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian claudio fava is a member of the eu investigation committee italian socialist mep claudio fava , who drafted the final conclusions of the probe , told reporters that " involvement in detainment amounts to a certain extent to involvement in torture . " the report , which goes to a vote of the full parliament next month , said that claims that the cia had a secret prison in poland were unproven .
however , the parliamentarians stressed that poland was the eu country least cooperative with the parliament probe . the report also mentioned the eu 's foreign policy and security chief javier solana , saying that he did not reveal his knowledge about the detention program . in addition , the meps called on the bloc to more strictly monitor data transfer to non-eu countries and the use of european airspace .
they also demanded more eu competencies in combating international terrorism . human rights organization human rights watch , in new york , responded to the report by saying european countries need to go further to stop their own policies that allow torture to continue worldwide . in a briefing paper , the non-profit group said eu states used " ' diplomatic assurances " to justify returning terrorism suspects to places where they were likely to be tortured .
the group said such policies are unreliable , unenforceable and ineffective and do little to protect against torture . " european governments have used these empty promises as a fig leaf to justify sending people to places where they risk being tortured , " holly cartner , the group 's europe and central asia director , said in a statement . german failures the eu committee 's final conclusions also accused the former german governmental coalition of the social democrats and greens of failing to work for the release of german resident murat kurnaz , who was imprisoned in the us camp at guantanamo bay . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier - who was former chancellor gerhard schröder 's chief of staff at the time and thus in charge of intelligence - on tuesday rejected charges that he had known about a us offer in 2002 to release a german-born turk from the us military prison at guantanamo . kurnaz was not freed until august 2006 , after intervention from the present government led by chancellor angela merkel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor merkel , right , has backed steinmeier in the ex-guantanamo inmate affair ahead of a meeting with the european parliament 's foreign affairs committee in brussels , steinmeier said that the former german government had repeatedly tried to free kurnaz . " on various occasions , we made efforts for a release , " steinmeier said .
charges that the former government had obstructed a release of kurnaz were " firstly wrong and simply mean , " he added . kurnaz spent four-and-a-half years at guantanamo on cuba after his arrest as a suspected al-qaeda supporter in pakistan , shortly after the september 11 , 2001 attacks . but eu lawmakers stressed that " according to confidential institutional information , the german government did not accept the us offer , made in 2002 , to release murat kurnaz from guantanamo . " the documents were given to the committee by the german government on the condition of strict confidentiality , carlos coelho , head of the special committee , told reporters . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german social democrats question eu report on cia scandal members of germany social democratic party on tuesday criticized a report by an eu parliament commission that could damage their party colleague , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de music -pipe- 24.01.2007 " downloading music is a negative trend " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siegel said he does not want cd stores to become a thing of the past the writer of several compositions for the eurovision song contest , german folk-rock musician and producer ralph siegel talked to dw-world.de about the damage being done to the music industry by the internet . siegel wrote 18 songs for the eurovision song contest , including the 1982 german hit " ein bisschen frieden . "
he owns jupiter records and has registered over 2,000 titles with germany 's music rights authority , gema . dw-world.de : mr. siegel , what do you think of the shift of music distribution from records to cds and now to internet downloads ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siegel owns a record label and a music publishing company ralph siegel : it 's a huge catastrophe .
it used to be when you wanted a cd you had to go out and buy it .
now you pay 99 cents that the artist has to share with the internet site - there 's actually not much left . it 's getting harder and harder to put new products on the market , because the marketing costs are crazily high .
this download nonsense is n't enough , it 's just drop in the bucket .
when the normal means of distribution for a cd , which you can hold in your hands , is lost , the business - sooner or later - will be reduced to a couple of big acts or purely internet-based platforms where some people put something on the internet and then hope to make a couple of euros off it .
that wo n't be enough to keep the music market above water . but the trend seems unstoppable . that 's completely true , but it 's a negative trend that i think is terrible .
of course it 's wonderful that these days everyone can say , " i composed a song and put it on the internet " and then see what happens .
but turns it into a hobby occupation , and professionalism gets watered down . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siegel said platforms like apple 's itunes do n't help artists you can put 100,000 songs on the internet , even from new composers , but no one knows what to find where .
and no one receives any more support .
in and of itself , the internet is not a support , because after an artist is listed on the internet someone needs to work with him , which i think is the most important thing .
he has to learn new things .
there has to be a job description for artists getting into this profession again . when there are only small revenues and small amounts of money generated , no one is going to be interested in getting involved in training artists or getting them started on paths that take 10 or 20 years .
this is what the music industry has done , but it can only do it when it has the opportunity to make money .
but this small-time business going on now is downright absurd . young artists like will.i.am from the " black eyed peas " as well as the band " shiny toy guns " say they can make a living from it . when a couple of people can do it , that 's wonderful .
of course there are always a few good examples , a few people that it 's good for .
but in the long run this wo n't be the case .
i do n't think so anyway . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : online sales wo n't be enough to support artists , according to siegel it 's just like all the newspapers that open up and then close down .
i think it 's dangerous .
there always has to be some professionalism in the world .
by the time a little internet site makes it worldwide - that 's going to take a long time and an internet shop is n't going to be enough . something has to be done for the artists .
management has to nurture them , there has to be a real structure and the internet ca n't do that by itself .
it 's one thing to present or market something - which is a good - but it 's not everything . what are the advantages of the old-fashioned means of distribution you promote ? the biggest problem is that the internet is n't alive .
the exchanges you have in conversations and in cooperating with others , or in a lot of other private ways , are what keeps music alive and are what music needs . creativity ca n't just be hunted down in the ether or created alone in a room .
i know what i 'm talking about , i 've been in front of a computer many a time in the past 20 years and always look forward to when i can be with my artists in the studio or out on the road .
the human touch is very important .
i do n't get that from the internet . julia elvers-guyot interviewed ralph siegel -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " mozart new edition " now online for free as the end of a full year of mozart celebrations nears , the musical scores of his complete works have been made available for free on the web .

" " my clear and succinct answer is : no ! "
merkel told the gathering of business and political leaders in the swiss resort of davos . speaking as the current president of the european union , merkel said she wanted the bloc to use the motto " more freedom for a new security " as its guiding principle for the future . she also said germany , during its presidency of the group of eight industrialized nations , would aim at removing exchange rate imbalances , boosting hedge fund transparency and starting a new dialogue with emerging powers . more opportunity merkel said recent deep rooted shifts in the structure of the world economy had spread opportunity for economic growth more widely , especially in emerging nations .
but she cautioned that the trend had also created greater uncertainty . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : movers and shakers in abundance , few celebrities this year " those who regard themselves as the winners of tomorrow can not feel sure that they will that they will also be the winners the day after tomorrow , " she warned the gathering of business and political leaders gathered here . the theme of this year 's world economic forum -lrb- wef -rrb- meeting - " the shifting power equation " - sought to take in everything from the growing geopolitical clout of asia to the increasing influence of the internet in business and information gathering . " we have a shift of power in many ways ... with the rise of china and india , and the next layer of countries like vietnam , brazil and korea , " said wef founder klaus schwab .
" at the same time we see the shift of power from business leaders to customers and shareholders , " schwab said . upbeat mood about 2007 the 2,400 registered participants at davos included 800 corporate chief executives or chairmen , 24 heads of state or government and 85 cabinet ministers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barbed wire in downtown davos business leaders were in upbeat mood about prospects for 2007 and beyond , amid strong corporate profits and forecasts for another year of global expansion , despite a predicted slowdown in the united states . a poll of davos participants by the organizers showed that 65 percent of corporate chiefs and politicians thought their children would live in a more prosperous world . economist laura tyson of the university of california , berkeley , sounded a cautious note when she said 2007 could be another fairytale year but warned that unresolved global imbalances meant " the big bad wolf is hiding in the forest . " an unusual lack of snow at davos in the run-up to this year 's forum helped to highlight the issue of climate change , which schwab expected to top the gathering 's agenda . cautious welcome for us proposals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us plans to cut emissions across the board there was a cautious welcome for us president george bush 's proposals for a long-term cut in us gasoline consumption , as business leaders urged greater government action on global warming . " i think it is a movement in the right direction , there is a recognition of the link between climate change and human activity , " said nicholas stern , the british government 's chief economic advisor . stern recently penned a major report that warned of the dire economic consequences of climate change unless swift action was taken . bush 's state of the union address on tuesday promised to cut us gasoline consumption by 20 percent by 2017 and favor alternative fuels like corn-based ethanol .
but it failed to meet growing expectations of federal limits on carbon emissions to match international ones . " you have to recognize what everyone is doing .
the united states is doing a lot on technology , a lot on standards .
but then of course we have to scale up our action , " stern said . shifting spheres of influence the theme of shifting spheres of influence was party reflected in the absence of big name us officials , while india sent a high-profile 100-member delegation and the prime minister of vietnam - the newest member of the world trade organization - also showed up . another notable " shift " was the lack of celebrities . with the exception of davos regular bono , famous names from the world of entertainment were scarce on the ground compared to previous years when the likes of angelina jolie , brad pitt and sharon stone stole the media spotlight from the corporate bigwigs and political leaders . " it is not our policy to invite stars , " schwab explained .

the text , adopted by 28 votes in favor , 17 against and three abstentions , criticized eu states for a failure to fulfill " european obligations , such as the respect of human rights . " more than 1,245 cia-operated flights flew over european airspace or stopped over at airports in europe , members of the european parliament -lrb- meps -rrb- concluded .
they urged member states to investigate these so-called extraordinary rendition flights . us president george w. bush in september acknowledged for the first time that the cia was running secret prisons for holding and interrogating high-level al-qaeda figures who had been captured since the september 11 , 2001 attacks . allegations that cia agents shipped prisoners through european airports to secret detention centers , including compounds in eastern europe , were first reported in november 2005 . eu involvement in torture eu deputies " condemned the fact that european countries have been relinquishing their control over their airspace and airports by turning a blind eye or admitting flights operated by the cia which , on some occasions , were being used for extraordinary renditions , " the report said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian claudio fava is a member of the eu investigation committee italian socialist mep claudio fava , who drafted the final conclusions of the probe , told reporters that " involvement in detainment amounts to a certain extent to involvement in torture . " the report , which goes to a vote of the full parliament next month , said that claims that the cia had a secret prison in poland were unproven .
however , the parliamentarians stressed that poland was the eu country least cooperative with the parliament probe . the report also mentioned the eu 's foreign policy and security chief javier solana , saying that he did not reveal his knowledge about the detention program . in addition , the meps called on the bloc to more strictly monitor data transfer to non-eu countries and the use of european airspace .
they also demanded more eu competencies in combating international terrorism . human rights organization human rights watch , in new york , responded to the report by saying european countries need to go further to stop their own policies that allow torture to continue worldwide . in a briefing paper , the non-profit group said eu states used " ' diplomatic assurances " to justify returning terrorism suspects to places where they were likely to be tortured .
the group said such policies are unreliable , unenforceable and ineffective and do little to protect against torture . " european governments have used these empty promises as a fig leaf to justify sending people to places where they risk being tortured , " holly cartner , the group 's europe and central asia director , said in a statement . german failures the eu committee 's final conclusions also accused the former german governmental coalition of the social democrats and greens of failing to work for the release of german resident murat kurnaz , who was imprisoned in the us camp at guantanamo bay . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier - who was former chancellor gerhard schröder 's chief of staff at the time and thus in charge of intelligence - on tuesday rejected charges that he had known about a us offer in 2002 to release a german-born turk from the us military prison at guantanamo . kurnaz was not freed until august 2006 , after intervention from the present government led by chancellor angela merkel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor merkel , right , has backed steinmeier in the ex-guantanamo inmate affair ahead of a meeting with the european parliament 's foreign affairs committee in brussels , steinmeier said that the former german government had repeatedly tried to free kurnaz . " on various occasions , we made efforts for a release , " steinmeier said .
charges that the former government had obstructed a release of kurnaz were " firstly wrong and simply mean , " he added . kurnaz spent four-and-a-half years at guantanamo on cuba after his arrest as a suspected al-qaeda supporter in pakistan , shortly after the september 11 , 2001 attacks . but eu lawmakers stressed that " according to confidential institutional information , the german government did not accept the us offer , made in 2002 , to release murat kurnaz from guantanamo . " the documents were given to the committee by the german government on the condition of strict confidentiality , carlos coelho , head of the special committee , told reporters . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german social democrats question eu report on cia scandal members of germany social democratic party on tuesday criticized a report by an eu parliament commission that could damage their party colleague , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier .

"
he owns jupiter records and has registered over 2,000 titles with germany 's music rights authority , gema . dw-world.de : mr. siegel , what do you think of the shift of music distribution from records to cds and now to internet downloads ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siegel owns a record label and a music publishing company ralph siegel : it 's a huge catastrophe .
it used to be when you wanted a cd you had to go out and buy it .
now you pay 99 cents that the artist has to share with the internet site - there 's actually not much left . it 's getting harder and harder to put new products on the market , because the marketing costs are crazily high .
this download nonsense is n't enough , it 's just drop in the bucket .
when the normal means of distribution for a cd , which you can hold in your hands , is lost , the business - sooner or later - will be reduced to a couple of big acts or purely internet-based platforms where some people put something on the internet and then hope to make a couple of euros off it .
that wo n't be enough to keep the music market above water . but the trend seems unstoppable . that 's completely true , but it 's a negative trend that i think is terrible .
of course it 's wonderful that these days everyone can say , " i composed a song and put it on the internet " and then see what happens .
but turns it into a hobby occupation , and professionalism gets watered down . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siegel said platforms like apple 's itunes do n't help artists you can put 100,000 songs on the internet , even from new composers , but no one knows what to find where .
and no one receives any more support .
in and of itself , the internet is not a support , because after an artist is listed on the internet someone needs to work with him , which i think is the most important thing .
he has to learn new things .
there has to be a job description for artists getting into this profession again . when there are only small revenues and small amounts of money generated , no one is going to be interested in getting involved in training artists or getting them started on paths that take 10 or 20 years .
this is what the music industry has done , but it can only do it when it has the opportunity to make money .
but this small-time business going on now is downright absurd . young artists like will.i.am from the " black eyed peas " as well as the band " shiny toy guns " say they can make a living from it . when a couple of people can do it , that 's wonderful .
of course there are always a few good examples , a few people that it 's good for .
but in the long run this wo n't be the case .
i do n't think so anyway . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : online sales wo n't be enough to support artists , according to siegel it 's just like all the newspapers that open up and then close down .
i think it 's dangerous .
there always has to be some professionalism in the world .
by the time a little internet site makes it worldwide - that 's going to take a long time and an internet shop is n't going to be enough . something has to be done for the artists .
management has to nurture them , there has to be a real structure and the internet ca n't do that by itself .
it 's one thing to present or market something - which is a good - but it 's not everything . what are the advantages of the old-fashioned means of distribution you promote ? the biggest problem is that the internet is n't alive .
the exchanges you have in conversations and in cooperating with others , or in a lot of other private ways , are what keeps music alive and are what music needs . creativity ca n't just be hunted down in the ether or created alone in a room .
i know what i 'm talking about , i 've been in front of a computer many a time in the past 20 years and always look forward to when i can be with my artists in the studio or out on the road .
the human touch is very important .
i do n't get that from the internet . julia elvers-guyot interviewed ralph siegel -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " mozart new edition " now online for free as the end of a full year of mozart celebrations nears , the musical scores of his complete works have been made available for free on the web .

"
but environmentalists in europe say his measures do n't go far enough . german leaders on wednesday reacted positively to us president george w. bush 's annual state of the union speech in which he called climate change a " serious issue " and urged americans to cut their gasoline consumption by 20 percent over a decade , mostly through a nearly five-fold increase in use of home-grown fuels such as ethanol . bush also pushed for tighter vehicle fuel efficiency standards . " a positive sign " " the fact that the american president acknowledges climate change as a problem is definitely a positive sign , " karsten voigt , the government 's coordinator of transatlantic relations told spiegel online . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush said climate change was a " serious challenge " voigt said bush had realized that saving energy was not just important on the political level , but also for security reasons . former german environment minister , jürgen trittin told german radio that bush had realized that oil-dependency massively undermined his leveraging power .
bush 's speech , said trittin , could " improve transatlantic cooperation in the fight against climate change . " bärbel höhn , deputy leader of the green group in parliament urged the german government to set similar ambitious goals on renewable energy like the american president did in his address . " we have to be careful that we do n't squander our leadership and technological edge in renewable energy , " höhn said . " moving in the right direction " sir nicholas stern , chief economic adviser to the british government and author of a report in 2006 that warned of the mounting costs of climate change , said bush 's speech was " a movement in the right direction . " " there is a recognition of the link between climate change and human activity , " he told reporters at the world economic forum in davos , switzerland . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush 's comments made for much debate in davos " you have to recognise what everyone is doing .
the united states is doing a lot on technology , a lot on standards .
but then of course we have to scale up our action . " the executive secretary of the un framework convention on climate change -lrb- unfccc -rrb- , yvo de boer , said bush 's speech marked a shift towards a more sustainable form of energy and noted his choice of words about climate change . " he did not talk in his state of the union address about international cooperation on climate change .
but at the same time , he did put his remarks in the context of the need for global response , " de boer told reporters in tokyo .
" that i think is very encouraging . " green groups say too little too late but environmentalists and green groups in europe were less impressed with the president 's address and said his measures did n't go far enough . jan kowalzig at friends of the earth europe told news agency afp that biofuel and fuel-efficiency initiatives were " worthwhile measures " but did not tackle the critical problem posed by us emissions of greenhouse gases . bush declined in his annual address to support mandatory caps on heat-trapping carbon gases that big us companies such as general electric co. have pushed for . only a mandatory cap on these emissions could drive down this pollution , said kowalzig .
he added that biofuels could in fact worsen the greenhouse-gas problem . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush does n't support mandatory carbon caps " in theory , they only produce as many greenhouse gas emissions as they suck up when growing , so they would be carbon neutral , " kowalzig said .
" in practice , in most places , they are not , because transportation of the fuels , processing of the fuels , all that requires energy which is currently driven by a fossil-fuel economy , " he said .
" so all these biofuels projects currently add to the greenhouse-gas effect . " bush u-turns on climate change bush 's address had been trailed by several media reports that forecast a u-turn on climate change . in 2001 , bush abandoned the kyoto protocol for curbing greenhouse-gas emissions , saying the pact 's binding caps were unfair and too costly for the us economy . bereft of the united states , which by itself accounts for nearly a quarter of global carbon pollution , kyoto has limped along and negotiations on cuts beyond 2012 are set to be long and bitter . but bush made no reference at all to the kyoto process or the voluntary initiatives on emissions and alternative energy that he has launched bilaterally and regionally . he did refer to global climate change , though , as a " serious challenge " that these technologies would help to confront . " bush out of step " some of corporate america 's industrial giants , including alcoa , general electric and dupont , this week called for mandatory caps on businesses ' greenhouse gas emissions , and trading of emissions permits . some observers said bush was out of kilter with domestic demands for action on climate change . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush 's plans for iraq found few takers in germany " he 's clearly out of step with where the american public and us congress are right now on climate change , which is ready to go much further than continuing technology initiatives , " jennifer morgan , a europe-based consultant on climate change and former spokesman with the green group wwf , told afp . european leaders however were less enthusiastic about bush 's plans for iraq in his address which involve sending 20,000 more american troops to the violence-racked country . both voigt and trittin criticized the plans , saying they could not detect any coherent political strategy . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de global warming bubbles to the surface in davos an exceptionally mild first half of winter in the swiss alps is helping to fuel growing concern about climate change at the annual meeting of the world economic forum , beginning on wednesday in davos .

"
but environmentalists in europe say his measures do n't go far enough . german leaders on wednesday reacted positively to us president george w. bush 's annual state of the union speech in which he called climate change a " serious issue " and urged americans to cut their gasoline consumption by 20 percent over a decade , mostly through a nearly five-fold increase in use of home-grown fuels such as ethanol . bush also pushed for tighter vehicle fuel efficiency standards . " a positive sign " " the fact that the american president acknowledges climate change as a problem is definitely a positive sign , " karsten voigt , the government 's coordinator of transatlantic relations told spiegel online . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush said climate change was a " serious challenge " voigt said bush had realized that saving energy was not just important on the political level , but also for security reasons . former german environment minister , jürgen trittin told german radio that bush had realized that oil-dependency massively undermined his leveraging power .
bush 's speech , said trittin , could " improve transatlantic cooperation in the fight against climate change . " bärbel höhn , deputy leader of the green group in parliament urged the german government to set similar ambitious goals on renewable energy like the american president did in his address . " we have to be careful that we do n't squander our leadership and technological edge in renewable energy , " höhn said . " moving in the right direction " sir nicholas stern , chief economic adviser to the british government and author of a report in 2006 that warned of the mounting costs of climate change , said bush 's speech was " a movement in the right direction . " " there is a recognition of the link between climate change and human activity , " he told reporters at the world economic forum in davos , switzerland . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush 's comments made for much debate in davos " you have to recognise what everyone is doing .
the united states is doing a lot on technology , a lot on standards .
but then of course we have to scale up our action . " the executive secretary of the un framework convention on climate change -lrb- unfccc -rrb- , yvo de boer , said bush 's speech marked a shift towards a more sustainable form of energy and noted his choice of words about climate change . " he did not talk in his state of the union address about international cooperation on climate change .
but at the same time , he did put his remarks in the context of the need for global response , " de boer told reporters in tokyo .
" that i think is very encouraging . " green groups say too little too late but environmentalists and green groups in europe were less impressed with the president 's address and said his measures did n't go far enough . jan kowalzig at friends of the earth europe told news agency afp that biofuel and fuel-efficiency initiatives were " worthwhile measures " but did not tackle the critical problem posed by us emissions of greenhouse gases . bush declined in his annual address to support mandatory caps on heat-trapping carbon gases that big us companies such as general electric co. have pushed for . only a mandatory cap on these emissions could drive down this pollution , said kowalzig .
he added that biofuels could in fact worsen the greenhouse-gas problem . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush does n't support mandatory carbon caps " in theory , they only produce as many greenhouse gas emissions as they suck up when growing , so they would be carbon neutral , " kowalzig said .
" in practice , in most places , they are not , because transportation of the fuels , processing of the fuels , all that requires energy which is currently driven by a fossil-fuel economy , " he said .
" so all these biofuels projects currently add to the greenhouse-gas effect . " bush u-turns on climate change bush 's address had been trailed by several media reports that forecast a u-turn on climate change . in 2001 , bush abandoned the kyoto protocol for curbing greenhouse-gas emissions , saying the pact 's binding caps were unfair and too costly for the us economy . bereft of the united states , which by itself accounts for nearly a quarter of global carbon pollution , kyoto has limped along and negotiations on cuts beyond 2012 are set to be long and bitter . but bush made no reference at all to the kyoto process or the voluntary initiatives on emissions and alternative energy that he has launched bilaterally and regionally . he did refer to global climate change , though , as a " serious challenge " that these technologies would help to confront . " bush out of step " some of corporate america 's industrial giants , including alcoa , general electric and dupont , this week called for mandatory caps on businesses ' greenhouse gas emissions , and trading of emissions permits . some observers said bush was out of kilter with domestic demands for action on climate change . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush 's plans for iraq found few takers in germany " he 's clearly out of step with where the american public and us congress are right now on climate change , which is ready to go much further than continuing technology initiatives , " jennifer morgan , a europe-based consultant on climate change and former spokesman with the green group wwf , told afp . european leaders however were less enthusiastic about bush 's plans for iraq in his address which involve sending 20,000 more american troops to the violence-racked country . both voigt and trittin criticized the plans , saying they could not detect any coherent political strategy . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de global warming bubbles to the surface in davos an exceptionally mild first half of winter in the swiss alps is helping to fuel growing concern about climate change at the annual meeting of the world economic forum , beginning on wednesday in davos .

"
but environmentalists in europe say his measures do n't go far enough . german leaders on wednesday reacted positively to us president george w. bush 's annual state of the union speech in which he called climate change a " serious issue " and urged americans to cut their gasoline consumption by 20 percent over a decade , mostly through a nearly five-fold increase in use of home-grown fuels such as ethanol . bush also pushed for tighter vehicle fuel efficiency standards . " a positive sign " " the fact that the american president acknowledges climate change as a problem is definitely a positive sign , " karsten voigt , the government 's coordinator of transatlantic relations told spiegel online . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush said climate change was a " serious challenge " voigt said bush had realized that saving energy was not just important on the political level , but also for security reasons . former german environment minister , jürgen trittin told german radio that bush had realized that oil-dependency massively undermined his leveraging power .
bush 's speech , said trittin , could " improve transatlantic cooperation in the fight against climate change . " bärbel höhn , deputy leader of the green group in parliament urged the german government to set similar ambitious goals on renewable energy like the american president did in his address . " we have to be careful that we do n't squander our leadership and technological edge in renewable energy , " höhn said . " moving in the right direction " sir nicholas stern , chief economic adviser to the british government and author of a report in 2006 that warned of the mounting costs of climate change , said bush 's speech was " a movement in the right direction . " " there is a recognition of the link between climate change and human activity , " he told reporters at the world economic forum in davos , switzerland . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush 's comments made for much debate in davos " you have to recognise what everyone is doing .
the united states is doing a lot on technology , a lot on standards .
but then of course we have to scale up our action . " the executive secretary of the un framework convention on climate change -lrb- unfccc -rrb- , yvo de boer , said bush 's speech marked a shift towards a more sustainable form of energy and noted his choice of words about climate change . " he did not talk in his state of the union address about international cooperation on climate change .
but at the same time , he did put his remarks in the context of the need for global response , " de boer told reporters in tokyo .
" that i think is very encouraging . " green groups say too little too late but environmentalists and green groups in europe were less impressed with the president 's address and said his measures did n't go far enough . jan kowalzig at friends of the earth europe told news agency afp that biofuel and fuel-efficiency initiatives were " worthwhile measures " but did not tackle the critical problem posed by us emissions of greenhouse gases . bush declined in his annual address to support mandatory caps on heat-trapping carbon gases that big us companies such as general electric co. have pushed for . only a mandatory cap on these emissions could drive down this pollution , said kowalzig .
he added that biofuels could in fact worsen the greenhouse-gas problem . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush does n't support mandatory carbon caps " in theory , they only produce as many greenhouse gas emissions as they suck up when growing , so they would be carbon neutral , " kowalzig said .
" in practice , in most places , they are not , because transportation of the fuels , processing of the fuels , all that requires energy which is currently driven by a fossil-fuel economy , " he said .
" so all these biofuels projects currently add to the greenhouse-gas effect . " bush u-turns on climate change bush 's address had been trailed by several media reports that forecast a u-turn on climate change . in 2001 , bush abandoned the kyoto protocol for curbing greenhouse-gas emissions , saying the pact 's binding caps were unfair and too costly for the us economy . bereft of the united states , which by itself accounts for nearly a quarter of global carbon pollution , kyoto has limped along and negotiations on cuts beyond 2012 are set to be long and bitter . but bush made no reference at all to the kyoto process or the voluntary initiatives on emissions and alternative energy that he has launched bilaterally and regionally . he did refer to global climate change , though , as a " serious challenge " that these technologies would help to confront . " bush out of step " some of corporate america 's industrial giants , including alcoa , general electric and dupont , this week called for mandatory caps on businesses ' greenhouse gas emissions , and trading of emissions permits . some observers said bush was out of kilter with domestic demands for action on climate change . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush 's plans for iraq found few takers in germany " he 's clearly out of step with where the american public and us congress are right now on climate change , which is ready to go much further than continuing technology initiatives , " jennifer morgan , a europe-based consultant on climate change and former spokesman with the green group wwf , told afp . european leaders however were less enthusiastic about bush 's plans for iraq in his address which involve sending 20,000 more american troops to the violence-racked country . both voigt and trittin criticized the plans , saying they could not detect any coherent political strategy . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de global warming bubbles to the surface in davos an exceptionally mild first half of winter in the swiss alps is helping to fuel growing concern about climate change at the annual meeting of the world economic forum , beginning on wednesday in davos .

the text , adopted by 28 votes in favor , 17 against and three abstentions , criticized eu states for a failure to fulfill " european obligations , such as the respect of human rights . " more than 1,245 cia-operated flights flew over european airspace or stopped over at airports in europe , members of the european parliament -lrb- meps -rrb- concluded .
they urged member states to investigate these so-called extraordinary rendition flights . us president george w. bush in september acknowledged for the first time that the cia was running secret prisons for holding and interrogating high-level al-qaeda figures who had been captured since the september 11 , 2001 attacks . allegations that cia agents shipped prisoners through european airports to secret detention centers , including compounds in eastern europe , were first reported in november 2005 . eu involvement in torture eu deputies " condemned the fact that european countries have been relinquishing their control over their airspace and airports by turning a blind eye or admitting flights operated by the cia which , on some occasions , were being used for extraordinary renditions , " the report said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian claudio fava is a member of the eu investigation committee italian socialist mep claudio fava , who drafted the final conclusions of the probe , told reporters that " involvement in detainment amounts to a certain extent to involvement in torture . " the report , which goes to a vote of the full parliament next month , said that claims that the cia had a secret prison in poland were unproven .
however , the parliamentarians stressed that poland was the eu country least cooperative with the parliament probe . the report also mentioned the eu 's foreign policy and security chief javier solana , saying that he did not reveal his knowledge about the detention program . in addition , the meps called on the bloc to more strictly monitor data transfer to non-eu countries and the use of european airspace .
they also demanded more eu competencies in combating international terrorism . human rights organization human rights watch , in new york , responded to the report by saying european countries need to go further to stop their own policies that allow torture to continue worldwide . in a briefing paper , the non-profit group said eu states used " ' diplomatic assurances " to justify returning terrorism suspects to places where they were likely to be tortured .
the group said such policies are unreliable , unenforceable and ineffective and do little to protect against torture . " european governments have used these empty promises as a fig leaf to justify sending people to places where they risk being tortured , " holly cartner , the group 's europe and central asia director , said in a statement . german failures the eu committee 's final conclusions also accused the former german governmental coalition of the social democrats and greens of failing to work for the release of german resident murat kurnaz , who was imprisoned in the us camp at guantanamo bay . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier - who was former chancellor gerhard schröder 's chief of staff at the time and thus in charge of intelligence - on tuesday rejected charges that he had known about a us offer in 2002 to release a german-born turk from the us military prison at guantanamo . kurnaz was not freed until august 2006 , after intervention from the present government led by chancellor angela merkel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor merkel , right , has backed steinmeier in the ex-guantanamo inmate affair ahead of a meeting with the european parliament 's foreign affairs committee in brussels , steinmeier said that the former german government had repeatedly tried to free kurnaz . " on various occasions , we made efforts for a release , " steinmeier said .
charges that the former government had obstructed a release of kurnaz were " firstly wrong and simply mean , " he added . kurnaz spent four-and-a-half years at guantanamo on cuba after his arrest as a suspected al-qaeda supporter in pakistan , shortly after the september 11 , 2001 attacks . but eu lawmakers stressed that " according to confidential institutional information , the german government did not accept the us offer , made in 2002 , to release murat kurnaz from guantanamo .

the text , adopted by 28 votes in favor , 17 against and three abstentions , criticized eu states for a failure to fulfill " european obligations , such as the respect of human rights . " more than 1,245 cia-operated flights flew over european airspace or stopped over at airports in europe , members of the european parliament -lrb- meps -rrb- concluded .
they urged member states to investigate these so-called extraordinary rendition flights . us president george w. bush in september acknowledged for the first time that the cia was running secret prisons for holding and interrogating high-level al-qaeda figures who had been captured since the september 11 , 2001 attacks . allegations that cia agents shipped prisoners through european airports to secret detention centers , including compounds in eastern europe , were first reported in november 2005 . eu involvement in torture eu deputies " condemned the fact that european countries have been relinquishing their control over their airspace and airports by turning a blind eye or admitting flights operated by the cia which , on some occasions , were being used for extraordinary renditions , " the report said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian claudio fava is a member of the eu investigation committee italian socialist mep claudio fava , who drafted the final conclusions of the probe , told reporters that " involvement in detainment amounts to a certain extent to involvement in torture . " the report , which goes to a vote of the full parliament next month , said that claims that the cia had a secret prison in poland were unproven .
however , the parliamentarians stressed that poland was the eu country least cooperative with the parliament probe . the report also mentioned the eu 's foreign policy and security chief javier solana , saying that he did not reveal his knowledge about the detention program . in addition , the meps called on the bloc to more strictly monitor data transfer to non-eu countries and the use of european airspace .
they also demanded more eu competencies in combating international terrorism . human rights organization human rights watch , in new york , responded to the report by saying european countries need to go further to stop their own policies that allow torture to continue worldwide . in a briefing paper , the non-profit group said eu states used " ' diplomatic assurances " to justify returning terrorism suspects to places where they were likely to be tortured .
the group said such policies are unreliable , unenforceable and ineffective and do little to protect against torture . " european governments have used these empty promises as a fig leaf to justify sending people to places where they risk being tortured , " holly cartner , the group 's europe and central asia director , said in a statement . german failures the eu committee 's final conclusions also accused the former german governmental coalition of the social democrats and greens of failing to work for the release of german resident murat kurnaz , who was imprisoned in the us camp at guantanamo bay . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier - who was former chancellor gerhard schröder 's chief of staff at the time and thus in charge of intelligence - on tuesday rejected charges that he had known about a us offer in 2002 to release a german-born turk from the us military prison at guantanamo . kurnaz was not freed until august 2006 , after intervention from the present government led by chancellor angela merkel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor merkel , right , has backed steinmeier in the ex-guantanamo inmate affair ahead of a meeting with the european parliament 's foreign affairs committee in brussels , steinmeier said that the former german government had repeatedly tried to free kurnaz . " on various occasions , we made efforts for a release , " steinmeier said .
charges that the former government had obstructed a release of kurnaz were " firstly wrong and simply mean , " he added . kurnaz spent four-and-a-half years at guantanamo on cuba after his arrest as a suspected al-qaeda supporter in pakistan , shortly after the september 11 , 2001 attacks . but eu lawmakers stressed that " according to confidential institutional information , the german government did not accept the us offer , made in 2002 , to release murat kurnaz from guantanamo . " the documents were given to the committee by the german government on the condition of strict confidentiality , carlos coelho , head of the special committee , told reporters . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german social democrats question eu report on cia scandal members of germany social democratic party on tuesday criticized a report by an eu parliament commission that could damage their party colleague , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier .

berlin allegedly rejected that , and a special committee of the european parliament says there 's enough proof to back the allegation . this alone would be a scandal that can not be covered up by claiming that kurnaz has turkish and not german citizenship and placing the blame on ankara instead of berlin .
a visit by german secret agents to kurnaz in guantanamo completes the picture . let 's be clear about this : barely 20 years of age , kurnaz was captured by the americans in pakistan .
he was possibly naive , but certainly not a terror suspect .
in january 2002 , he ended up at guantanamo , he was abused , but even the americans were eventually convinced of his innocence and wanted to send him back to germany .
berlin rejected the offer .
what 's more : the german authorities did n't merely not work towards his release , rather they boycotted it .
the man was n't able to leave the camp until 2006 . political responsibility for the germans ' behavior lies with a group of state secretaries and intelligence agency heads , who regularly discussed the security situation under the leadership of the chancellery 's chief-of-staff .

foreign policy considerations may have played a role .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 24.01.2007 at davos kick-off , merkel says no to protectionism großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel focused on the challenges of globalization during her speech in a wide-ranging speech at the world economic forum , german chancellor angela merkel on wednesday staunchly rejected protectionism as a solution to the economic and social challenges of globalization . chancellor merkel said some countries might be tempted to exploit their economic might to its fullest , by selfishly consuming global resources and setting up customs barriers to protect " their own weaknesses . " " my clear and succinct answer is : no ! "
merkel told the gathering of business and political leaders in the swiss resort of davos . speaking as the current president of the european union , merkel said she wanted the bloc to use the motto " more freedom for a new security " as its guiding principle for the future . she also said germany , during its presidency of the group of eight industrialized nations , would aim at removing exchange rate imbalances , boosting hedge fund transparency and starting a new dialogue with emerging powers . more opportunity merkel said recent deep rooted shifts in the structure of the world economy had spread opportunity for economic growth more widely , especially in emerging nations .
but she cautioned that the trend had also created greater uncertainty . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : movers and shakers in abundance , few celebrities this year " those who regard themselves as the winners of tomorrow can not feel sure that they will that they will also be the winners the day after tomorrow , " she warned the gathering of business and political leaders gathered here . the theme of this year 's world economic forum -lrb- wef -rrb- meeting - " the shifting power equation " - sought to take in everything from the growing geopolitical clout of asia to the increasing influence of the internet in business and information gathering . " we have a shift of power in many ways ... with the rise of china and india , and the next layer of countries like vietnam , brazil and korea , " said wef founder klaus schwab .
" at the same time we see the shift of power from business leaders to customers and shareholders , " schwab said . upbeat mood about 2007 the 2,400 registered participants at davos included 800 corporate chief executives or chairmen , 24 heads of state or government and 85 cabinet ministers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barbed wire in downtown davos business leaders were in upbeat mood about prospects for 2007 and beyond , amid strong corporate profits and forecasts for another year of global expansion , despite a predicted slowdown in the united states . a poll of davos participants by the organizers showed that 65 percent of corporate chiefs and politicians thought their children would live in a more prosperous world . economist laura tyson of the university of california , berkeley , sounded a cautious note when she said 2007 could be another fairytale year but warned that unresolved global imbalances meant " the big bad wolf is hiding in the forest . " an unusual lack of snow at davos in the run-up to this year 's forum helped to highlight the issue of climate change , which schwab expected to top the gathering 's agenda . cautious welcome for us proposals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us plans to cut emissions across the board there was a cautious welcome for us president george bush 's proposals for a long-term cut in us gasoline consumption , as business leaders urged greater government action on global warming . " i think it is a movement in the right direction , there is a recognition of the link between climate change and human activity , " said nicholas stern , the british government 's chief economic advisor . stern recently penned a major report that warned of the dire economic consequences of climate change unless swift action was taken . bush 's state of the union address on tuesday promised to cut us gasoline consumption by 20 percent by 2017 and favor alternative fuels like corn-based ethanol .

the house in wittenberg that held his massive workshop has recently been restored and was reopened wednesday . lucas cranach was a true renaissance man .
he possessed the rare combination of talent and wealth and , not only did he become one of the most significant painters of the german renaissance , he also enjoyed success as a merchant , politician and even a pharmacist . when the ruler of saxony , frederick iii , invited cranach to wittenberg in 1505 to become his court painter , the 33-year-old artist could n't have suspected that he would spend the next 45 years of his life there .
working as court painter , crafting mainly portraits and scenes from the bible and mythology , was only part of cranach 's broad career . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portions of cranach 's residence were renovated in 1998 , the rest is now complete in 1512 he bought a house in the center of town for both his family and his flourishing art workshop .
parts of this house , located at market square 4 in wittenberg , have been under reconstruction since 2003 , a 3.2 million euro -lrb- $ 4.1 million -rrb- project that officially drew to an end on wednesday . the building , restored in authentic renaissance style , will house permanent and rotating exhibitions , a youth art academy , offices for the cranach foundation , guest rooms and - fittingly - workshop space for artists . unusually large workshop cranach 's a workshop on market square quickly outgrew its quarters .
in 1518 , he bought another larger accommodation down the road , which at that time was the single largest house under private ownership in wittenberg .
up to 30 young apprentices were eventually employed there under cranach 's guidance . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a self-portrait from 1550 such a large-scale workshop , where journeymen painted but used cranach 's signature , was unusual at that time , said eva löber from the cranach foundation in wittenberg .
that 's part of what makes him notable . cranach , together with his apprentices , produced some 5,000 works , said löber , a thousand of which still exist today .
his paintings and woodcarvings are scattered among various museums throughout the world . a man of many trades already an influential man in town , cranach entered local politics in 1519 as the town treasurer .
two decades later , he served as mayor of wittenberg . in 1520 , cranach was granted a license to practice as an apothecary . his new workplace was located at on schloss street , and there he also sold wine and other sundries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " annunciation to joachim among the shepherds " the schloss street location held cranach 's precious printing presses .
invented just over half a century before , the devices were still extremely rare .
cranach put his presses to work publishing some of the significant documents of the protestant reformation , including martin luther 's september testament . cranach and the reformation luther and cranach were close friends - cranach and his wife barbara even served as witnesses at the theologian 's wedding in 1525 .
not only did the artist fashion portraits of luther and other reformation leaders , it was also his personal support for the movement that earned him a nickname as " painter of the reformation . " " cranach 's ' wittenberg altar ' is the best testimony to the reformation , " said eva löber .

not only did the artist fashion portraits of luther and other reformation leaders , it was also his personal support for the movement that earned him a nickname as " painter of the reformation . " " cranach 's ' wittenberg altar ' is the best testimony to the reformation , " said eva löber .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de music -pipe- 24.01.2007 " downloading music is a negative trend " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siegel said he does not want cd stores to become a thing of the past the writer of several compositions for the eurovision song contest , german folk-rock musician and producer ralph siegel talked to dw-world.de about the damage being done to the music industry by the internet . siegel wrote 18 songs for the eurovision song contest , including the 1982 german hit " ein bisschen frieden . "
he owns jupiter records and has registered over 2,000 titles with germany 's music rights authority , gema . dw-world.de : mr. siegel , what do you think of the shift of music distribution from records to cds and now to internet downloads ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siegel owns a record label and a music publishing company ralph siegel : it 's a huge catastrophe .
it used to be when you wanted a cd you had to go out and buy it .
now you pay 99 cents that the artist has to share with the internet site - there 's actually not much left . it 's getting harder and harder to put new products on the market , because the marketing costs are crazily high .
this download nonsense is n't enough , it 's just drop in the bucket .
when the normal means of distribution for a cd , which you can hold in your hands , is lost , the business - sooner or later - will be reduced to a couple of big acts or purely internet-based platforms where some people put something on the internet and then hope to make a couple of euros off it .
that wo n't be enough to keep the music market above water . but the trend seems unstoppable . that 's completely true , but it 's a negative trend that i think is terrible .
of course it 's wonderful that these days everyone can say , " i composed a song and put it on the internet " and then see what happens .
but turns it into a hobby occupation , and professionalism gets watered down . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siegel said platforms like apple 's itunes do n't help artists you can put 100,000 songs on the internet , even from new composers , but no one knows what to find where .
and no one receives any more support .
in and of itself , the internet is not a support , because after an artist is listed on the internet someone needs to work with him , which i think is the most important thing .
he has to learn new things .
there has to be a job description for artists getting into this profession again . when there are only small revenues and small amounts of money generated , no one is going to be interested in getting involved in training artists or getting them started on paths that take 10 or 20 years .
this is what the music industry has done , but it can only do it when it has the opportunity to make money .
but this small-time business going on now is downright absurd . young artists like will.i.am from the " black eyed peas " as well as the band " shiny toy guns " say they can make a living from it . when a couple of people can do it , that 's wonderful .

it used to be when you wanted a cd you had to go out and buy it .
now you pay 99 cents that the artist has to share with the internet site - there 's actually not much left . it 's getting harder and harder to put new products on the market , because the marketing costs are crazily high .
this download nonsense is n't enough , it 's just drop in the bucket .
when the normal means of distribution for a cd , which you can hold in your hands , is lost , the business - sooner or later - will be reduced to a couple of big acts or purely internet-based platforms where some people put something on the internet and then hope to make a couple of euros off it .
that wo n't be enough to keep the music market above water . but the trend seems unstoppable . that 's completely true , but it 's a negative trend that i think is terrible .

there has to be a job description for artists getting into this profession again . when there are only small revenues and small amounts of money generated , no one is going to be interested in getting involved in training artists or getting them started on paths that take 10 or 20 years .
this is what the music industry has done , but it can only do it when it has the opportunity to make money .

the nation 's family minister said she would like customers of women forced into the profession to be prosecuted . family minister ursula von der leyen said that there are still too many illegal prostitutes in germany and that it is still too hard for many of the woman in the field to leave , even if they want to . referring to a report on prostitution commissioned by the federal cabinet , von der leyen told reporters at a press conference on wednesday that the attempt to improve that lives of prostitutes by giving them access to healthcare , social security and pensions in a groundbreaking 2002 law still did not do enough for large numbers of sex workers in germany . " the possibilities in practice are almost never used , " she said , and announced new measures aimed at protecting women forced into sex work and underage prostitutes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : family minister ursula von der leyen " the prostitution law has only reached part of its goal , " she said , adding that health and hygiene conditions of most prostitutes have not improved since the law 's passage .
there are an estimated 400,000 registered prostitutes in germany . but von der leyen , a member of angela merkel 's conservative christian democratic party , said she was not aiming at turning back and clock and making prostitution illegal again , but wanted to offer sex workers viable ways out of the profession . " we want to rigorously go after the criminal element surrounding prostitution , " she said .
" that includes punishing customers of forced prostitutes , raising the minimal age and much stricter controls over brothels , with the message that prostitution is not just a job like any other . " the final goal must be to encourage prostitutes to get out of the field , she said . ignorance no excuse chancellor merkel 's grand coalition government is now drafting new legislation that would raise the legal age for prostitution from 16 to 18 and would plug a legal loophole that allows clients of women forced into prostitution to escape prosecution by pleading ignorance of their situation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are some 400,000 registered prostitites in germany " if the prostitute speaks no german and has bruises on her body then the client has to assume this is forced prostitution , " von der leyen said .
" he can no longer say : ' i did n't notice ' . " more than half of the prostitutes in germany are thought to be here illegally , many from eastern europe , and because most have no legal papers , leaving the profession or the men who control their lives , is next to impossible . however , the family minister offered no details on how such measures would be enforced . her proposals will have to be approved by the german cabinet and then approved by the parliament before becoming law . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a job like none other : being a prostitute in germany morning , noon and night - the demand for prostitutes is huge .

the text , adopted by 28 votes in favor , 17 against and three abstentions , criticized eu states for a failure to fulfill " european obligations , such as the respect of human rights . " more than 1,245 cia-operated flights flew over european airspace or stopped over at airports in europe , members of the european parliament -lrb- meps -rrb- concluded .
they urged member states to investigate these so-called extraordinary rendition flights . us president george w. bush in september acknowledged for the first time that the cia was running secret prisons for holding and interrogating high-level al-qaeda figures who had been captured since the september 11 , 2001 attacks . allegations that cia agents shipped prisoners through european airports to secret detention centers , including compounds in eastern europe , were first reported in november 2005 . eu involvement in torture eu deputies " condemned the fact that european countries have been relinquishing their control over their airspace and airports by turning a blind eye or admitting flights operated by the cia which , on some occasions , were being used for extraordinary renditions , " the report said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian claudio fava is a member of the eu investigation committee italian socialist mep claudio fava , who drafted the final conclusions of the probe , told reporters that " involvement in detainment amounts to a certain extent to involvement in torture . " the report , which goes to a vote of the full parliament next month , said that claims that the cia had a secret prison in poland were unproven .
however , the parliamentarians stressed that poland was the eu country least cooperative with the parliament probe . the report also mentioned the eu 's foreign policy and security chief javier solana , saying that he did not reveal his knowledge about the detention program . in addition , the meps called on the bloc to more strictly monitor data transfer to non-eu countries and the use of european airspace .
they also demanded more eu competencies in combating international terrorism . human rights organization human rights watch , in new york , responded to the report by saying european countries need to go further to stop their own policies that allow torture to continue worldwide . in a briefing paper , the non-profit group said eu states used " ' diplomatic assurances " to justify returning terrorism suspects to places where they were likely to be tortured .
the group said such policies are unreliable , unenforceable and ineffective and do little to protect against torture . " european governments have used these empty promises as a fig leaf to justify sending people to places where they risk being tortured , " holly cartner , the group 's europe and central asia director , said in a statement . german failures the eu committee 's final conclusions also accused the former german governmental coalition of the social democrats and greens of failing to work for the release of german resident murat kurnaz , who was imprisoned in the us camp at guantanamo bay . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier - who was former chancellor gerhard schröder 's chief of staff at the time and thus in charge of intelligence - on tuesday rejected charges that he had known about a us offer in 2002 to release a german-born turk from the us military prison at guantanamo . kurnaz was not freed until august 2006 , after intervention from the present government led by chancellor angela merkel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor merkel , right , has backed steinmeier in the ex-guantanamo inmate affair ahead of a meeting with the european parliament 's foreign affairs committee in brussels , steinmeier said that the former german government had repeatedly tried to free kurnaz . " on various occasions , we made efforts for a release , " steinmeier said .
charges that the former government had obstructed a release of kurnaz were " firstly wrong and simply mean , " he added . kurnaz spent four-and-a-half years at guantanamo on cuba after his arrest as a suspected al-qaeda supporter in pakistan , shortly after the september 11 , 2001 attacks . but eu lawmakers stressed that " according to confidential institutional information , the german government did not accept the us offer , made in 2002 , to release murat kurnaz from guantanamo .

the text , adopted by 28 votes in favor , 17 against and three abstentions , criticized eu states for a failure to fulfill " european obligations , such as the respect of human rights . " more than 1,245 cia-operated flights flew over european airspace or stopped over at airports in europe , members of the european parliament -lrb- meps -rrb- concluded .
they urged member states to investigate these so-called extraordinary rendition flights . us president george w. bush in september acknowledged for the first time that the cia was running secret prisons for holding and interrogating high-level al-qaeda figures who had been captured since the september 11 , 2001 attacks . allegations that cia agents shipped prisoners through european airports to secret detention centers , including compounds in eastern europe , were first reported in november 2005 . eu involvement in torture eu deputies " condemned the fact that european countries have been relinquishing their control over their airspace and airports by turning a blind eye or admitting flights operated by the cia which , on some occasions , were being used for extraordinary renditions , " the report said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian claudio fava is a member of the eu investigation committee italian socialist mep claudio fava , who drafted the final conclusions of the probe , told reporters that " involvement in detainment amounts to a certain extent to involvement in torture . " the report , which goes to a vote of the full parliament next month , said that claims that the cia had a secret prison in poland were unproven .
however , the parliamentarians stressed that poland was the eu country least cooperative with the parliament probe . the report also mentioned the eu 's foreign policy and security chief javier solana , saying that he did not reveal his knowledge about the detention program . in addition , the meps called on the bloc to more strictly monitor data transfer to non-eu countries and the use of european airspace .
they also demanded more eu competencies in combating international terrorism . human rights organization human rights watch , in new york , responded to the report by saying european countries need to go further to stop their own policies that allow torture to continue worldwide . in a briefing paper , the non-profit group said eu states used " ' diplomatic assurances " to justify returning terrorism suspects to places where they were likely to be tortured .
the group said such policies are unreliable , unenforceable and ineffective and do little to protect against torture . " european governments have used these empty promises as a fig leaf to justify sending people to places where they risk being tortured , " holly cartner , the group 's europe and central asia director , said in a statement . german failures the eu committee 's final conclusions also accused the former german governmental coalition of the social democrats and greens of failing to work for the release of german resident murat kurnaz , who was imprisoned in the us camp at guantanamo bay . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier - who was former chancellor gerhard schröder 's chief of staff at the time and thus in charge of intelligence - on tuesday rejected charges that he had known about a us offer in 2002 to release a german-born turk from the us military prison at guantanamo . kurnaz was not freed until august 2006 , after intervention from the present government led by chancellor angela merkel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor merkel , right , has backed steinmeier in the ex-guantanamo inmate affair ahead of a meeting with the european parliament 's foreign affairs committee in brussels , steinmeier said that the former german government had repeatedly tried to free kurnaz . " on various occasions , we made efforts for a release , " steinmeier said .
charges that the former government had obstructed a release of kurnaz were " firstly wrong and simply mean , " he added . kurnaz spent four-and-a-half years at guantanamo on cuba after his arrest as a suspected al-qaeda supporter in pakistan , shortly after the september 11 , 2001 attacks . but eu lawmakers stressed that " according to confidential institutional information , the german government did not accept the us offer , made in 2002 , to release murat kurnaz from guantanamo . " the documents were given to the committee by the german government on the condition of strict confidentiality , carlos coelho , head of the special committee , told reporters . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german social democrats question eu report on cia scandal members of germany social democratic party on tuesday criticized a report by an eu parliament commission that could damage their party colleague , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 24.01.2007 eu report slams members for involvement in secret cia affair großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the report says at least 10 eu members knew about the cia 's rendition flights european union lawmakers have approved a report which lashes out at eu countries for tolerating or assisting the united states ' practice of secret detentions of terrorist suspects . at least 10 european states , including britain , poland , italy and germany aided or knew about the cia 's clandestine program of taking terrorism suspects to other countries for interrogation , the report said . it ended a year-long investigation by a special european parliament committee .
the text , adopted by 28 votes in favor , 17 against and three abstentions , criticized eu states for a failure to fulfill " european obligations , such as the respect of human rights . " more than 1,245 cia-operated flights flew over european airspace or stopped over at airports in europe , members of the european parliament -lrb- meps -rrb- concluded .
they urged member states to investigate these so-called extraordinary rendition flights . us president george w. bush in september acknowledged for the first time that the cia was running secret prisons for holding and interrogating high-level al-qaeda figures who had been captured since the september 11 , 2001 attacks . allegations that cia agents shipped prisoners through european airports to secret detention centers , including compounds in eastern europe , were first reported in november 2005 . eu involvement in torture eu deputies " condemned the fact that european countries have been relinquishing their control over their airspace and airports by turning a blind eye or admitting flights operated by the cia which , on some occasions , were being used for extraordinary renditions , " the report said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian claudio fava is a member of the eu investigation committee italian socialist mep claudio fava , who drafted the final conclusions of the probe , told reporters that " involvement in detainment amounts to a certain extent to involvement in torture . " the report , which goes to a vote of the full parliament next month , said that claims that the cia had a secret prison in poland were unproven .
however , the parliamentarians stressed that poland was the eu country least cooperative with the parliament probe . the report also mentioned the eu 's foreign policy and security chief javier solana , saying that he did not reveal his knowledge about the detention program . in addition , the meps called on the bloc to more strictly monitor data transfer to non-eu countries and the use of european airspace .
they also demanded more eu competencies in combating international terrorism . human rights organization human rights watch , in new york , responded to the report by saying european countries need to go further to stop their own policies that allow torture to continue worldwide . in a briefing paper , the non-profit group said eu states used " ' diplomatic assurances " to justify returning terrorism suspects to places where they were likely to be tortured .
the group said such policies are unreliable , unenforceable and ineffective and do little to protect against torture . " european governments have used these empty promises as a fig leaf to justify sending people to places where they risk being tortured , " holly cartner , the group 's europe and central asia director , said in a statement . german failures the eu committee 's final conclusions also accused the former german governmental coalition of the social democrats and greens of failing to work for the release of german resident murat kurnaz , who was imprisoned in the us camp at guantanamo bay . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier - who was former chancellor gerhard schröder 's chief of staff at the time and thus in charge of intelligence - on tuesday rejected charges that he had known about a us offer in 2002 to release a german-born turk from the us military prison at guantanamo . kurnaz was not freed until august 2006 , after intervention from the present government led by chancellor angela merkel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor merkel , right , has backed steinmeier in the ex-guantanamo inmate affair ahead of a meeting with the european parliament 's foreign affairs committee in brussels , steinmeier said that the former german government had repeatedly tried to free kurnaz . " on various occasions , we made efforts for a release , " steinmeier said .
charges that the former government had obstructed a release of kurnaz were " firstly wrong and simply mean , " he added . kurnaz spent four-and-a-half years at guantanamo on cuba after his arrest as a suspected al-qaeda supporter in pakistan , shortly after the september 11 , 2001 attacks . but eu lawmakers stressed that " according to confidential institutional information , the german government did not accept the us offer , made in 2002 , to release murat kurnaz from guantanamo . " the documents were given to the committee by the german government on the condition of strict confidentiality , carlos coelho , head of the special committee , told reporters . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german social democrats question eu report on cia scandal members of germany social democratic party on tuesday criticized a report by an eu parliament commission that could damage their party colleague , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier .

the house in wittenberg that held his massive workshop has recently been restored and was reopened wednesday . lucas cranach was a true renaissance man .
he possessed the rare combination of talent and wealth and , not only did he become one of the most significant painters of the german renaissance , he also enjoyed success as a merchant , politician and even a pharmacist . when the ruler of saxony , frederick iii , invited cranach to wittenberg in 1505 to become his court painter , the 33-year-old artist could n't have suspected that he would spend the next 45 years of his life there .
working as court painter , crafting mainly portraits and scenes from the bible and mythology , was only part of cranach 's broad career . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portions of cranach 's residence were renovated in 1998 , the rest is now complete in 1512 he bought a house in the center of town for both his family and his flourishing art workshop .
parts of this house , located at market square 4 in wittenberg , have been under reconstruction since 2003 , a 3.2 million euro -lrb- $ 4.1 million -rrb- project that officially drew to an end on wednesday . the building , restored in authentic renaissance style , will house permanent and rotating exhibitions , a youth art academy , offices for the cranach foundation , guest rooms and - fittingly - workshop space for artists . unusually large workshop cranach 's a workshop on market square quickly outgrew its quarters .
in 1518 , he bought another larger accommodation down the road , which at that time was the single largest house under private ownership in wittenberg .
up to 30 young apprentices were eventually employed there under cranach 's guidance . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a self-portrait from 1550 such a large-scale workshop , where journeymen painted but used cranach 's signature , was unusual at that time , said eva löber from the cranach foundation in wittenberg .
that 's part of what makes him notable . cranach , together with his apprentices , produced some 5,000 works , said löber , a thousand of which still exist today .
his paintings and woodcarvings are scattered among various museums throughout the world . a man of many trades already an influential man in town , cranach entered local politics in 1519 as the town treasurer .
two decades later , he served as mayor of wittenberg . in 1520 , cranach was granted a license to practice as an apothecary . his new workplace was located at on schloss street , and there he also sold wine and other sundries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " annunciation to joachim among the shepherds " the schloss street location held cranach 's precious printing presses .
invented just over half a century before , the devices were still extremely rare .
cranach put his presses to work publishing some of the significant documents of the protestant reformation , including martin luther 's september testament . cranach and the reformation luther and cranach were close friends - cranach and his wife barbara even served as witnesses at the theologian 's wedding in 1525 .
not only did the artist fashion portraits of luther and other reformation leaders , it was also his personal support for the movement that earned him a nickname as " painter of the reformation . " " cranach 's ' wittenberg altar ' is the best testimony to the reformation , " said eva löber .
" it points toward christ and the bible .
the orientation to the word was very important to luther . " it was in wittenberg that luther posted a copy of his famed 95 theses in the fall of 1517 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cranach 's " the resurrection of lazarus " is in the gemäldegalerie in dresden the europe-wide conflict over reforms to the powerful catholic church eventually drew cranach away from wittenberg and he did not spend out his final years in the town in which he 'd invested so much . after losing the battle of mühlberg in 1547 , saxony 's elector at the time johann frederick i , called john the magnanimous , was sent into exile because of his support for the reformation .
cranach followed and served as johann frederick 's court painter in augsburg and then in weimar , where the painter died in 1553 . cranach 's house in the 20th century located in eastern germany , cranach 's wittenberg houses lapsed into disrepair under the communists in the 20th century .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 24.01.2007 opinion : time for explanations großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unless he manages to produce new evidence , germany 's foreign minister will have to resign over the failure to get a german-born guantanamo prisoner released despite a us offer to do so , says dw 's heinz dylong . it seems right to keep asking why the former social democratic-green party government had so little interest in getting bremen-born turk murat kurnaz released from the us detention camp at guantanamo - especially since a us offer apparently existed to set kurnaz free after he had been wrongly accused of terrorist activities .
berlin allegedly rejected that , and a special committee of the european parliament says there 's enough proof to back the allegation . this alone would be a scandal that can not be covered up by claiming that kurnaz has turkish and not german citizenship and placing the blame on ankara instead of berlin .
a visit by german secret agents to kurnaz in guantanamo completes the picture . let 's be clear about this : barely 20 years of age , kurnaz was captured by the americans in pakistan .
he was possibly naive , but certainly not a terror suspect .
in january 2002 , he ended up at guantanamo , he was abused , but even the americans were eventually convinced of his innocence and wanted to send him back to germany .
berlin rejected the offer .
what 's more : the german authorities did n't merely not work towards his release , rather they boycotted it .
the man was n't able to leave the camp until 2006 . political responsibility for the germans ' behavior lies with a group of state secretaries and intelligence agency heads , who regularly discussed the security situation under the leadership of the chancellery 's chief-of-staff .
at the time in question , the latter position was occupied by frank-walter steinmeier , the current foreign minister .
he 'll have quite a bit of explaining to do to a parliamentary committee which is investigating the case .
it 's certain that steinmeier will have to resign if he can not offer any new information to make berlin 's behavior plausible . his resignation would obviously not explain why berlin behaved the way it did .
foreign policy considerations may have played a role .
the german-american relationship was already tense because of germany 's " no " to the war in iraq .
it might have made sense not to put additional strain on ties with the us - whether by insisting in the case of guantanamo or by the released prisoner one day possibly making public accusations .
be that as it may ; it 's certainly not in line with a foreign policy oriented toward human rights which the social democratic-green party government had claimed to pursue . heinz dylong is an editor at dw-radio -lrb- win -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu report slams members for involvement in secret cia affair european union lawmakers have approved a report which lashes out at eu countries for tolerating or assisting the united states ' practice of secret detentions of terrorist suspects .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 24.01.2007 opinion : time for explanations großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unless he manages to produce new evidence , germany 's foreign minister will have to resign over the failure to get a german-born guantanamo prisoner released despite a us offer to do so , says dw 's heinz dylong . it seems right to keep asking why the former social democratic-green party government had so little interest in getting bremen-born turk murat kurnaz released from the us detention camp at guantanamo - especially since a us offer apparently existed to set kurnaz free after he had been wrongly accused of terrorist activities .
berlin allegedly rejected that , and a special committee of the european parliament says there 's enough proof to back the allegation . this alone would be a scandal that can not be covered up by claiming that kurnaz has turkish and not german citizenship and placing the blame on ankara instead of berlin .
a visit by german secret agents to kurnaz in guantanamo completes the picture . let 's be clear about this : barely 20 years of age , kurnaz was captured by the americans in pakistan .
he was possibly naive , but certainly not a terror suspect .
in january 2002 , he ended up at guantanamo , he was abused , but even the americans were eventually convinced of his innocence and wanted to send him back to germany .
berlin rejected the offer .
what 's more : the german authorities did n't merely not work towards his release , rather they boycotted it .
the man was n't able to leave the camp until 2006 . political responsibility for the germans ' behavior lies with a group of state secretaries and intelligence agency heads , who regularly discussed the security situation under the leadership of the chancellery 's chief-of-staff .
at the time in question , the latter position was occupied by frank-walter steinmeier , the current foreign minister .
he 'll have quite a bit of explaining to do to a parliamentary committee which is investigating the case .
it 's certain that steinmeier will have to resign if he can not offer any new information to make berlin 's behavior plausible . his resignation would obviously not explain why berlin behaved the way it did .
foreign policy considerations may have played a role .
the german-american relationship was already tense because of germany 's " no " to the war in iraq .
it might have made sense not to put additional strain on ties with the us - whether by insisting in the case of guantanamo or by the released prisoner one day possibly making public accusations .
be that as it may ; it 's certainly not in line with a foreign policy oriented toward human rights which the social democratic-green party government had claimed to pursue . heinz dylong is an editor at dw-radio -lrb- win -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu report slams members for involvement in secret cia affair european union lawmakers have approved a report which lashes out at eu countries for tolerating or assisting the united states ' practice of secret detentions of terrorist suspects .

"
he owns jupiter records and has registered over 2,000 titles with germany 's music rights authority , gema . dw-world.de : mr. siegel , what do you think of the shift of music distribution from records to cds and now to internet downloads ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siegel owns a record label and a music publishing company ralph siegel : it 's a huge catastrophe .
it used to be when you wanted a cd you had to go out and buy it .
now you pay 99 cents that the artist has to share with the internet site - there 's actually not much left . it 's getting harder and harder to put new products on the market , because the marketing costs are crazily high .
this download nonsense is n't enough , it 's just drop in the bucket .
when the normal means of distribution for a cd , which you can hold in your hands , is lost , the business - sooner or later - will be reduced to a couple of big acts or purely internet-based platforms where some people put something on the internet and then hope to make a couple of euros off it .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de music -pipe- 24.01.2007 " downloading music is a negative trend " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siegel said he does not want cd stores to become a thing of the past the writer of several compositions for the eurovision song contest , german folk-rock musician and producer ralph siegel talked to dw-world.de about the damage being done to the music industry by the internet . siegel wrote 18 songs for the eurovision song contest , including the 1982 german hit " ein bisschen frieden . "
he owns jupiter records and has registered over 2,000 titles with germany 's music rights authority , gema . dw-world.de : mr. siegel , what do you think of the shift of music distribution from records to cds and now to internet downloads ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siegel owns a record label and a music publishing company ralph siegel : it 's a huge catastrophe .
it used to be when you wanted a cd you had to go out and buy it .
now you pay 99 cents that the artist has to share with the internet site - there 's actually not much left . it 's getting harder and harder to put new products on the market , because the marketing costs are crazily high .
this download nonsense is n't enough , it 's just drop in the bucket .
when the normal means of distribution for a cd , which you can hold in your hands , is lost , the business - sooner or later - will be reduced to a couple of big acts or purely internet-based platforms where some people put something on the internet and then hope to make a couple of euros off it .
that wo n't be enough to keep the music market above water . but the trend seems unstoppable . that 's completely true , but it 's a negative trend that i think is terrible .
of course it 's wonderful that these days everyone can say , " i composed a song and put it on the internet " and then see what happens .
but turns it into a hobby occupation , and professionalism gets watered down . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siegel said platforms like apple 's itunes do n't help artists you can put 100,000 songs on the internet , even from new composers , but no one knows what to find where .
and no one receives any more support .
in and of itself , the internet is not a support , because after an artist is listed on the internet someone needs to work with him , which i think is the most important thing .
he has to learn new things .
there has to be a job description for artists getting into this profession again . when there are only small revenues and small amounts of money generated , no one is going to be interested in getting involved in training artists or getting them started on paths that take 10 or 20 years .
this is what the music industry has done , but it can only do it when it has the opportunity to make money .
but this small-time business going on now is downright absurd . young artists like will.i.am from the " black eyed peas " as well as the band " shiny toy guns " say they can make a living from it . when a couple of people can do it , that 's wonderful .
of course there are always a few good examples , a few people that it 's good for .
but in the long run this wo n't be the case .
i do n't think so anyway . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : online sales wo n't be enough to support artists , according to siegel it 's just like all the newspapers that open up and then close down .
i think it 's dangerous .
there always has to be some professionalism in the world .
by the time a little internet site makes it worldwide - that 's going to take a long time and an internet shop is n't going to be enough . something has to be done for the artists .
management has to nurture them , there has to be a real structure and the internet ca n't do that by itself .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 24.01.2007 opinion : time for explanations großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unless he manages to produce new evidence , germany 's foreign minister will have to resign over the failure to get a german-born guantanamo prisoner released despite a us offer to do so , says dw 's heinz dylong . it seems right to keep asking why the former social democratic-green party government had so little interest in getting bremen-born turk murat kurnaz released from the us detention camp at guantanamo - especially since a us offer apparently existed to set kurnaz free after he had been wrongly accused of terrorist activities .
berlin allegedly rejected that , and a special committee of the european parliament says there 's enough proof to back the allegation . this alone would be a scandal that can not be covered up by claiming that kurnaz has turkish and not german citizenship and placing the blame on ankara instead of berlin .
a visit by german secret agents to kurnaz in guantanamo completes the picture . let 's be clear about this : barely 20 years of age , kurnaz was captured by the americans in pakistan .
he was possibly naive , but certainly not a terror suspect .
in january 2002 , he ended up at guantanamo , he was abused , but even the americans were eventually convinced of his innocence and wanted to send him back to germany .
berlin rejected the offer .
what 's more : the german authorities did n't merely not work towards his release , rather they boycotted it .
the man was n't able to leave the camp until 2006 . political responsibility for the germans ' behavior lies with a group of state secretaries and intelligence agency heads , who regularly discussed the security situation under the leadership of the chancellery 's chief-of-staff .
at the time in question , the latter position was occupied by frank-walter steinmeier , the current foreign minister .
he 'll have quite a bit of explaining to do to a parliamentary committee which is investigating the case .
it 's certain that steinmeier will have to resign if he can not offer any new information to make berlin 's behavior plausible . his resignation would obviously not explain why berlin behaved the way it did .
foreign policy considerations may have played a role .
the german-american relationship was already tense because of germany 's " no " to the war in iraq .
it might have made sense not to put additional strain on ties with the us - whether by insisting in the case of guantanamo or by the released prisoner one day possibly making public accusations .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 24.01.2007 opinion : time for explanations großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unless he manages to produce new evidence , germany 's foreign minister will have to resign over the failure to get a german-born guantanamo prisoner released despite a us offer to do so , says dw 's heinz dylong . it seems right to keep asking why the former social democratic-green party government had so little interest in getting bremen-born turk murat kurnaz released from the us detention camp at guantanamo - especially since a us offer apparently existed to set kurnaz free after he had been wrongly accused of terrorist activities .
berlin allegedly rejected that , and a special committee of the european parliament says there 's enough proof to back the allegation . this alone would be a scandal that can not be covered up by claiming that kurnaz has turkish and not german citizenship and placing the blame on ankara instead of berlin .
a visit by german secret agents to kurnaz in guantanamo completes the picture . let 's be clear about this : barely 20 years of age , kurnaz was captured by the americans in pakistan .
he was possibly naive , but certainly not a terror suspect .
in january 2002 , he ended up at guantanamo , he was abused , but even the americans were eventually convinced of his innocence and wanted to send him back to germany .
berlin rejected the offer .
what 's more : the german authorities did n't merely not work towards his release , rather they boycotted it .
the man was n't able to leave the camp until 2006 . political responsibility for the germans ' behavior lies with a group of state secretaries and intelligence agency heads , who regularly discussed the security situation under the leadership of the chancellery 's chief-of-staff .
at the time in question , the latter position was occupied by frank-walter steinmeier , the current foreign minister .
he 'll have quite a bit of explaining to do to a parliamentary committee which is investigating the case .
it 's certain that steinmeier will have to resign if he can not offer any new information to make berlin 's behavior plausible . his resignation would obviously not explain why berlin behaved the way it did .
foreign policy considerations may have played a role .
the german-american relationship was already tense because of germany 's " no " to the war in iraq .
it might have made sense not to put additional strain on ties with the us - whether by insisting in the case of guantanamo or by the released prisoner one day possibly making public accusations .

the firms then received official notification of the charges in may last year . an 11th firm , abb ltd . , the globe 's largest builder of electricity networks , tipped off the eu and escaped any fine . " abb has been the whistleblower and has been cooperating with the commission , " wolfram eberhardt , a spokesman for the zurich-based company , told bloomberg news . appeal siemens , europe 's biggest engineering company , responded to the announcement of fines saying it plans to appeal . " siemens intends to go to the european court of justice to take legal action against antitrust fines … charged by the eu commission , " the company said in a statement .
it added that it " denies the blanket accusation " that it was part of a cartel between 1988 and 2004 .

"
but environmentalists in europe say his measures do n't go far enough . german leaders on wednesday reacted positively to us president george w. bush 's annual state of the union speech in which he called climate change a " serious issue " and urged americans to cut their gasoline consumption by 20 percent over a decade , mostly through a nearly five-fold increase in use of home-grown fuels such as ethanol . bush also pushed for tighter vehicle fuel efficiency standards . " a positive sign " " the fact that the american president acknowledges climate change as a problem is definitely a positive sign , " karsten voigt , the government 's coordinator of transatlantic relations told spiegel online . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush said climate change was a " serious challenge " voigt said bush had realized that saving energy was not just important on the political level , but also for security reasons . former german environment minister , jürgen trittin told german radio that bush had realized that oil-dependency massively undermined his leveraging power .
bush 's speech , said trittin , could " improve transatlantic cooperation in the fight against climate change . " bärbel höhn , deputy leader of the green group in parliament urged the german government to set similar ambitious goals on renewable energy like the american president did in his address . " we have to be careful that we do n't squander our leadership and technological edge in renewable energy , " höhn said . " moving in the right direction " sir nicholas stern , chief economic adviser to the british government and author of a report in 2006 that warned of the mounting costs of climate change , said bush 's speech was " a movement in the right direction . " " there is a recognition of the link between climate change and human activity , " he told reporters at the world economic forum in davos , switzerland . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush 's comments made for much debate in davos " you have to recognise what everyone is doing .
the united states is doing a lot on technology , a lot on standards .

"
but environmentalists in europe say his measures do n't go far enough . german leaders on wednesday reacted positively to us president george w. bush 's annual state of the union speech in which he called climate change a " serious issue " and urged americans to cut their gasoline consumption by 20 percent over a decade , mostly through a nearly five-fold increase in use of home-grown fuels such as ethanol . bush also pushed for tighter vehicle fuel efficiency standards . " a positive sign " " the fact that the american president acknowledges climate change as a problem is definitely a positive sign , " karsten voigt , the government 's coordinator of transatlantic relations told spiegel online . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush said climate change was a " serious challenge " voigt said bush had realized that saving energy was not just important on the political level , but also for security reasons . former german environment minister , jürgen trittin told german radio that bush had realized that oil-dependency massively undermined his leveraging power .
bush 's speech , said trittin , could " improve transatlantic cooperation in the fight against climate change . " bärbel höhn , deputy leader of the green group in parliament urged the german government to set similar ambitious goals on renewable energy like the american president did in his address . " we have to be careful that we do n't squander our leadership and technological edge in renewable energy , " höhn said . " moving in the right direction " sir nicholas stern , chief economic adviser to the british government and author of a report in 2006 that warned of the mounting costs of climate change , said bush 's speech was " a movement in the right direction . " " there is a recognition of the link between climate change and human activity , " he told reporters at the world economic forum in davos , switzerland . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush 's comments made for much debate in davos " you have to recognise what everyone is doing .
the united states is doing a lot on technology , a lot on standards .
but then of course we have to scale up our action . " the executive secretary of the un framework convention on climate change -lrb- unfccc -rrb- , yvo de boer , said bush 's speech marked a shift towards a more sustainable form of energy and noted his choice of words about climate change . " he did not talk in his state of the union address about international cooperation on climate change .
but at the same time , he did put his remarks in the context of the need for global response , " de boer told reporters in tokyo .
" that i think is very encouraging . " green groups say too little too late but environmentalists and green groups in europe were less impressed with the president 's address and said his measures did n't go far enough . jan kowalzig at friends of the earth europe told news agency afp that biofuel and fuel-efficiency initiatives were " worthwhile measures " but did not tackle the critical problem posed by us emissions of greenhouse gases . bush declined in his annual address to support mandatory caps on heat-trapping carbon gases that big us companies such as general electric co. have pushed for . only a mandatory cap on these emissions could drive down this pollution , said kowalzig .
he added that biofuels could in fact worsen the greenhouse-gas problem . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush does n't support mandatory carbon caps " in theory , they only produce as many greenhouse gas emissions as they suck up when growing , so they would be carbon neutral , " kowalzig said .
" in practice , in most places , they are not , because transportation of the fuels , processing of the fuels , all that requires energy which is currently driven by a fossil-fuel economy , " he said .
" so all these biofuels projects currently add to the greenhouse-gas effect . " bush u-turns on climate change bush 's address had been trailed by several media reports that forecast a u-turn on climate change . in 2001 , bush abandoned the kyoto protocol for curbing greenhouse-gas emissions , saying the pact 's binding caps were unfair and too costly for the us economy . bereft of the united states , which by itself accounts for nearly a quarter of global carbon pollution , kyoto has limped along and negotiations on cuts beyond 2012 are set to be long and bitter . but bush made no reference at all to the kyoto process or the voluntary initiatives on emissions and alternative energy that he has launched bilaterally and regionally . he did refer to global climate change , though , as a " serious challenge " that these technologies would help to confront . " bush out of step " some of corporate america 's industrial giants , including alcoa , general electric and dupont , this week called for mandatory caps on businesses ' greenhouse gas emissions , and trading of emissions permits . some observers said bush was out of kilter with domestic demands for action on climate change . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush 's plans for iraq found few takers in germany " he 's clearly out of step with where the american public and us congress are right now on climate change , which is ready to go much further than continuing technology initiatives , " jennifer morgan , a europe-based consultant on climate change and former spokesman with the green group wwf , told afp . european leaders however were less enthusiastic about bush 's plans for iraq in his address which involve sending 20,000 more american troops to the violence-racked country . both voigt and trittin criticized the plans , saying they could not detect any coherent political strategy . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de global warming bubbles to the surface in davos an exceptionally mild first half of winter in the swiss alps is helping to fuel growing concern about climate change at the annual meeting of the world economic forum , beginning on wednesday in davos .

berlin allegedly rejected that , and a special committee of the european parliament says there 's enough proof to back the allegation . this alone would be a scandal that can not be covered up by claiming that kurnaz has turkish and not german citizenship and placing the blame on ankara instead of berlin .
a visit by german secret agents to kurnaz in guantanamo completes the picture . let 's be clear about this : barely 20 years of age , kurnaz was captured by the americans in pakistan .
he was possibly naive , but certainly not a terror suspect .
in january 2002 , he ended up at guantanamo , he was abused , but even the americans were eventually convinced of his innocence and wanted to send him back to germany .
berlin rejected the offer .
what 's more : the german authorities did n't merely not work towards his release , rather they boycotted it .
the man was n't able to leave the camp until 2006 . political responsibility for the germans ' behavior lies with a group of state secretaries and intelligence agency heads , who regularly discussed the security situation under the leadership of the chancellery 's chief-of-staff .
at the time in question , the latter position was occupied by frank-walter steinmeier , the current foreign minister .
he 'll have quite a bit of explaining to do to a parliamentary committee which is investigating the case .
it 's certain that steinmeier will have to resign if he can not offer any new information to make berlin 's behavior plausible . his resignation would obviously not explain why berlin behaved the way it did .
foreign policy considerations may have played a role .
the german-american relationship was already tense because of germany 's " no " to the war in iraq .
it might have made sense not to put additional strain on ties with the us - whether by insisting in the case of guantanamo or by the released prisoner one day possibly making public accusations .
be that as it may ; it 's certainly not in line with a foreign policy oriented toward human rights which the social democratic-green party government had claimed to pursue . heinz dylong is an editor at dw-radio -lrb- win -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu report slams members for involvement in secret cia affair european union lawmakers have approved a report which lashes out at eu countries for tolerating or assisting the united states ' practice of secret detentions of terrorist suspects .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 24.01.2007 eu report slams members for involvement in secret cia affair großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the report says at least 10 eu members knew about the cia 's rendition flights european union lawmakers have approved a report which lashes out at eu countries for tolerating or assisting the united states ' practice of secret detentions of terrorist suspects . at least 10 european states , including britain , poland , italy and germany aided or knew about the cia 's clandestine program of taking terrorism suspects to other countries for interrogation , the report said . it ended a year-long investigation by a special european parliament committee .
the text , adopted by 28 votes in favor , 17 against and three abstentions , criticized eu states for a failure to fulfill " european obligations , such as the respect of human rights . " more than 1,245 cia-operated flights flew over european airspace or stopped over at airports in europe , members of the european parliament -lrb- meps -rrb- concluded .
they urged member states to investigate these so-called extraordinary rendition flights . us president george w. bush in september acknowledged for the first time that the cia was running secret prisons for holding and interrogating high-level al-qaeda figures who had been captured since the september 11 , 2001 attacks . allegations that cia agents shipped prisoners through european airports to secret detention centers , including compounds in eastern europe , were first reported in november 2005 . eu involvement in torture eu deputies " condemned the fact that european countries have been relinquishing their control over their airspace and airports by turning a blind eye or admitting flights operated by the cia which , on some occasions , were being used for extraordinary renditions , " the report said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian claudio fava is a member of the eu investigation committee italian socialist mep claudio fava , who drafted the final conclusions of the probe , told reporters that " involvement in detainment amounts to a certain extent to involvement in torture . " the report , which goes to a vote of the full parliament next month , said that claims that the cia had a secret prison in poland were unproven .
however , the parliamentarians stressed that poland was the eu country least cooperative with the parliament probe . the report also mentioned the eu 's foreign policy and security chief javier solana , saying that he did not reveal his knowledge about the detention program . in addition , the meps called on the bloc to more strictly monitor data transfer to non-eu countries and the use of european airspace .
they also demanded more eu competencies in combating international terrorism . human rights organization human rights watch , in new york , responded to the report by saying european countries need to go further to stop their own policies that allow torture to continue worldwide . in a briefing paper , the non-profit group said eu states used " ' diplomatic assurances " to justify returning terrorism suspects to places where they were likely to be tortured .
the group said such policies are unreliable , unenforceable and ineffective and do little to protect against torture . " european governments have used these empty promises as a fig leaf to justify sending people to places where they risk being tortured , " holly cartner , the group 's europe and central asia director , said in a statement . german failures the eu committee 's final conclusions also accused the former german governmental coalition of the social democrats and greens of failing to work for the release of german resident murat kurnaz , who was imprisoned in the us camp at guantanamo bay . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier - who was former chancellor gerhard schröder 's chief of staff at the time and thus in charge of intelligence - on tuesday rejected charges that he had known about a us offer in 2002 to release a german-born turk from the us military prison at guantanamo . kurnaz was not freed until august 2006 , after intervention from the present government led by chancellor angela merkel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor merkel , right , has backed steinmeier in the ex-guantanamo inmate affair ahead of a meeting with the european parliament 's foreign affairs committee in brussels , steinmeier said that the former german government had repeatedly tried to free kurnaz . " on various occasions , we made efforts for a release , " steinmeier said .
charges that the former government had obstructed a release of kurnaz were " firstly wrong and simply mean , " he added . kurnaz spent four-and-a-half years at guantanamo on cuba after his arrest as a suspected al-qaeda supporter in pakistan , shortly after the september 11 , 2001 attacks . but eu lawmakers stressed that " according to confidential institutional information , the german government did not accept the us offer , made in 2002 , to release murat kurnaz from guantanamo . " the documents were given to the committee by the german government on the condition of strict confidentiality , carlos coelho , head of the special committee , told reporters . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german social democrats question eu report on cia scandal members of germany social democratic party on tuesday criticized a report by an eu parliament commission that could damage their party colleague , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 24.01.2007 opinion : time for explanations großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unless he manages to produce new evidence , germany 's foreign minister will have to resign over the failure to get a german-born guantanamo prisoner released despite a us offer to do so , says dw 's heinz dylong . it seems right to keep asking why the former social democratic-green party government had so little interest in getting bremen-born turk murat kurnaz released from the us detention camp at guantanamo - especially since a us offer apparently existed to set kurnaz free after he had been wrongly accused of terrorist activities .
berlin allegedly rejected that , and a special committee of the european parliament says there 's enough proof to back the allegation . this alone would be a scandal that can not be covered up by claiming that kurnaz has turkish and not german citizenship and placing the blame on ankara instead of berlin .
a visit by german secret agents to kurnaz in guantanamo completes the picture . let 's be clear about this : barely 20 years of age , kurnaz was captured by the americans in pakistan .
he was possibly naive , but certainly not a terror suspect .
in january 2002 , he ended up at guantanamo , he was abused , but even the americans were eventually convinced of his innocence and wanted to send him back to germany .
berlin rejected the offer .
what 's more : the german authorities did n't merely not work towards his release , rather they boycotted it .
the man was n't able to leave the camp until 2006 . political responsibility for the germans ' behavior lies with a group of state secretaries and intelligence agency heads , who regularly discussed the security situation under the leadership of the chancellery 's chief-of-staff .

they had no scruples in their past dealings and , according to your article about them , neither do they have any regrets about their convictions . - astrid howes if the people in jail can not bring the victims back to life when they walk , then they should not be released .

it used to be when you wanted a cd you had to go out and buy it .
now you pay 99 cents that the artist has to share with the internet site - there 's actually not much left . it 's getting harder and harder to put new products on the market , because the marketing costs are crazily high .
this download nonsense is n't enough , it 's just drop in the bucket .
when the normal means of distribution for a cd , which you can hold in your hands , is lost , the business - sooner or later - will be reduced to a couple of big acts or purely internet-based platforms where some people put something on the internet and then hope to make a couple of euros off it .
that wo n't be enough to keep the music market above water . but the trend seems unstoppable . that 's completely true , but it 's a negative trend that i think is terrible .

there has to be a job description for artists getting into this profession again . when there are only small revenues and small amounts of money generated , no one is going to be interested in getting involved in training artists or getting them started on paths that take 10 or 20 years .
this is what the music industry has done , but it can only do it when it has the opportunity to make money .
but this small-time business going on now is downright absurd . young artists like will.i.am from the " black eyed peas " as well as the band " shiny toy guns " say they can make a living from it . when a couple of people can do it , that 's wonderful .
of course there are always a few good examples , a few people that it 's good for .

i think it 's dangerous .

by the time a little internet site makes it worldwide - that 's going to take a long time and an internet shop is n't going to be enough . something has to be done for the artists .
management has to nurture them , there has to be a real structure and the internet ca n't do that by itself .

germans offices in many sectors are often more formal than , say their american counterparts , with employees who 've worked together for years often still calling each other mr. schmidt or ms. bauer instead of dieter or gisela . so when a bank in germany puts a new policy in place that asks employees to get all touchy-feely , it 's touted as a revolution .
theophil graband , the chairman of teambank , has n't mandated the singing of kumbayah and holding hands , but he has asked him employees to address each other using the familiar form of the word " you . " dual ' you ' german , like many languages but unlike english , has two forms of " you . "
there 's the informal one , " du " in german , used with close friends , family members and little children .
then there 's " sie , " used with everyone else .
most workplaces are " sie " kinds of places , while in schoolyards , for example , the " du " predominates . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goofy ties could be next but now teambank is all warm and fuzzy , and the informal " you " form can be used with everyone from the copyboy to director graband himself .
he says taking the formality down a notch can help strengthen team spirit at the bank , which is all the rage in 21st century management manuals . graband is not forcing his " du " on anyone , and says the new form address should be adopted " voluntarily " by the bank 's 1,250 employees .
but those who refuse to bend will face a bit of peer pressure .
" we want to be as unifed as possible , " graband said . over the next several weeks , teambank is holding " teamcamps " to get any starched-shirts used to the bank 's new jaunty ways . whether there 'll be a teamgroan going up among employees remains to be seen . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de top cop busted for bank heist a high-ranking german police officer has been arrested for robbing a bank near his police station and getting away with tens of thousands in cash .

the house in wittenberg that held his massive workshop has recently been restored and was reopened wednesday . lucas cranach was a true renaissance man .
he possessed the rare combination of talent and wealth and , not only did he become one of the most significant painters of the german renaissance , he also enjoyed success as a merchant , politician and even a pharmacist . when the ruler of saxony , frederick iii , invited cranach to wittenberg in 1505 to become his court painter , the 33-year-old artist could n't have suspected that he would spend the next 45 years of his life there .
working as court painter , crafting mainly portraits and scenes from the bible and mythology , was only part of cranach 's broad career . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portions of cranach 's residence were renovated in 1998 , the rest is now complete in 1512 he bought a house in the center of town for both his family and his flourishing art workshop .
parts of this house , located at market square 4 in wittenberg , have been under reconstruction since 2003 , a 3.2 million euro -lrb- $ 4.1 million -rrb- project that officially drew to an end on wednesday . the building , restored in authentic renaissance style , will house permanent and rotating exhibitions , a youth art academy , offices for the cranach foundation , guest rooms and - fittingly - workshop space for artists . unusually large workshop cranach 's a workshop on market square quickly outgrew its quarters .
in 1518 , he bought another larger accommodation down the road , which at that time was the single largest house under private ownership in wittenberg .
up to 30 young apprentices were eventually employed there under cranach 's guidance . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a self-portrait from 1550 such a large-scale workshop , where journeymen painted but used cranach 's signature , was unusual at that time , said eva löber from the cranach foundation in wittenberg .
that 's part of what makes him notable . cranach , together with his apprentices , produced some 5,000 works , said löber , a thousand of which still exist today .
his paintings and woodcarvings are scattered among various museums throughout the world . a man of many trades already an influential man in town , cranach entered local politics in 1519 as the town treasurer .
two decades later , he served as mayor of wittenberg . in 1520 , cranach was granted a license to practice as an apothecary . his new workplace was located at on schloss street , and there he also sold wine and other sundries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " annunciation to joachim among the shepherds " the schloss street location held cranach 's precious printing presses .
invented just over half a century before , the devices were still extremely rare .
cranach put his presses to work publishing some of the significant documents of the protestant reformation , including martin luther 's september testament . cranach and the reformation luther and cranach were close friends - cranach and his wife barbara even served as witnesses at the theologian 's wedding in 1525 .
not only did the artist fashion portraits of luther and other reformation leaders , it was also his personal support for the movement that earned him a nickname as " painter of the reformation . " " cranach 's ' wittenberg altar ' is the best testimony to the reformation , " said eva löber .
" it points toward christ and the bible .
the orientation to the word was very important to luther . " it was in wittenberg that luther posted a copy of his famed 95 theses in the fall of 1517 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cranach 's " the resurrection of lazarus " is in the gemäldegalerie in dresden the europe-wide conflict over reforms to the powerful catholic church eventually drew cranach away from wittenberg and he did not spend out his final years in the town in which he 'd invested so much . after losing the battle of mühlberg in 1547 , saxony 's elector at the time johann frederick i , called john the magnanimous , was sent into exile because of his support for the reformation .
cranach followed and served as johann frederick 's court painter in augsburg and then in weimar , where the painter died in 1553 . cranach 's house in the 20th century located in eastern germany , cranach 's wittenberg houses lapsed into disrepair under the communists in the 20th century .
the city bought the buildings in 1991 as a result of a citizen initiative started the first of two restoration projects . following the completion of the second restoration project , the keys to the historic complex were handed over to wittenberg 's mayor on wednesday in an official ceremony . kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany aims for better restitution process for nazi-looted art the german government has invited museum directors and legal experts to berlin on monday to discuss claims for art bought or seized by the nazis .

"
but environmentalists in europe say his measures do n't go far enough . german leaders on wednesday reacted positively to us president george w. bush 's annual state of the union speech in which he called climate change a " serious issue " and urged americans to cut their gasoline consumption by 20 percent over a decade , mostly through a nearly five-fold increase in use of home-grown fuels such as ethanol . bush also pushed for tighter vehicle fuel efficiency standards . " a positive sign " " the fact that the american president acknowledges climate change as a problem is definitely a positive sign , " karsten voigt , the government 's coordinator of transatlantic relations told spiegel online . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush said climate change was a " serious challenge " voigt said bush had realized that saving energy was not just important on the political level , but also for security reasons . former german environment minister , jürgen trittin told german radio that bush had realized that oil-dependency massively undermined his leveraging power .
bush 's speech , said trittin , could " improve transatlantic cooperation in the fight against climate change . " bärbel höhn , deputy leader of the green group in parliament urged the german government to set similar ambitious goals on renewable energy like the american president did in his address . " we have to be careful that we do n't squander our leadership and technological edge in renewable energy , " höhn said . " moving in the right direction " sir nicholas stern , chief economic adviser to the british government and author of a report in 2006 that warned of the mounting costs of climate change , said bush 's speech was " a movement in the right direction . " " there is a recognition of the link between climate change and human activity , " he told reporters at the world economic forum in davos , switzerland . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush 's comments made for much debate in davos " you have to recognise what everyone is doing .
the united states is doing a lot on technology , a lot on standards .
but then of course we have to scale up our action . " the executive secretary of the un framework convention on climate change -lrb- unfccc -rrb- , yvo de boer , said bush 's speech marked a shift towards a more sustainable form of energy and noted his choice of words about climate change . " he did not talk in his state of the union address about international cooperation on climate change .
but at the same time , he did put his remarks in the context of the need for global response , " de boer told reporters in tokyo .
" that i think is very encouraging . " green groups say too little too late but environmentalists and green groups in europe were less impressed with the president 's address and said his measures did n't go far enough . jan kowalzig at friends of the earth europe told news agency afp that biofuel and fuel-efficiency initiatives were " worthwhile measures " but did not tackle the critical problem posed by us emissions of greenhouse gases . bush declined in his annual address to support mandatory caps on heat-trapping carbon gases that big us companies such as general electric co. have pushed for . only a mandatory cap on these emissions could drive down this pollution , said kowalzig .
he added that biofuels could in fact worsen the greenhouse-gas problem . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush does n't support mandatory carbon caps " in theory , they only produce as many greenhouse gas emissions as they suck up when growing , so they would be carbon neutral , " kowalzig said .
" in practice , in most places , they are not , because transportation of the fuels , processing of the fuels , all that requires energy which is currently driven by a fossil-fuel economy , " he said .
" so all these biofuels projects currently add to the greenhouse-gas effect . " bush u-turns on climate change bush 's address had been trailed by several media reports that forecast a u-turn on climate change . in 2001 , bush abandoned the kyoto protocol for curbing greenhouse-gas emissions , saying the pact 's binding caps were unfair and too costly for the us economy . bereft of the united states , which by itself accounts for nearly a quarter of global carbon pollution , kyoto has limped along and negotiations on cuts beyond 2012 are set to be long and bitter . but bush made no reference at all to the kyoto process or the voluntary initiatives on emissions and alternative energy that he has launched bilaterally and regionally . he did refer to global climate change , though , as a " serious challenge " that these technologies would help to confront . " bush out of step " some of corporate america 's industrial giants , including alcoa , general electric and dupont , this week called for mandatory caps on businesses ' greenhouse gas emissions , and trading of emissions permits . some observers said bush was out of kilter with domestic demands for action on climate change . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush 's plans for iraq found few takers in germany " he 's clearly out of step with where the american public and us congress are right now on climate change , which is ready to go much further than continuing technology initiatives , " jennifer morgan , a europe-based consultant on climate change and former spokesman with the green group wwf , told afp . european leaders however were less enthusiastic about bush 's plans for iraq in his address which involve sending 20,000 more american troops to the violence-racked country . both voigt and trittin criticized the plans , saying they could not detect any coherent political strategy . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de global warming bubbles to the surface in davos an exceptionally mild first half of winter in the swiss alps is helping to fuel growing concern about climate change at the annual meeting of the world economic forum , beginning on wednesday in davos .

"
but environmentalists in europe say his measures do n't go far enough . german leaders on wednesday reacted positively to us president george w. bush 's annual state of the union speech in which he called climate change a " serious issue " and urged americans to cut their gasoline consumption by 20 percent over a decade , mostly through a nearly five-fold increase in use of home-grown fuels such as ethanol . bush also pushed for tighter vehicle fuel efficiency standards . " a positive sign " " the fact that the american president acknowledges climate change as a problem is definitely a positive sign , " karsten voigt , the government 's coordinator of transatlantic relations told spiegel online . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush said climate change was a " serious challenge " voigt said bush had realized that saving energy was not just important on the political level , but also for security reasons . former german environment minister , jürgen trittin told german radio that bush had realized that oil-dependency massively undermined his leveraging power .
bush 's speech , said trittin , could " improve transatlantic cooperation in the fight against climate change . " bärbel höhn , deputy leader of the green group in parliament urged the german government to set similar ambitious goals on renewable energy like the american president did in his address . " we have to be careful that we do n't squander our leadership and technological edge in renewable energy , " höhn said .

the united states is doing a lot on technology , a lot on standards .
but then of course we have to scale up our action .

" that i think is very encouraging .

he added that biofuels could in fact worsen the greenhouse-gas problem . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush does n't support mandatory carbon caps " in theory , they only produce as many greenhouse gas emissions as they suck up when growing , so they would be carbon neutral , " kowalzig said .
" in practice , in most places , they are not , because transportation of the fuels , processing of the fuels , all that requires energy which is currently driven by a fossil-fuel economy , " he said .
" so all these biofuels projects currently add to the greenhouse-gas effect . " bush u-turns on climate change bush 's address had been trailed by several media reports that forecast a u-turn on climate change . in 2001 , bush abandoned the kyoto protocol for curbing greenhouse-gas emissions , saying the pact 's binding caps were unfair and too costly for the us economy . bereft of the united states , which by itself accounts for nearly a quarter of global carbon pollution , kyoto has limped along and negotiations on cuts beyond 2012 are set to be long and bitter . but bush made no reference at all to the kyoto process or the voluntary initiatives on emissions and alternative energy that he has launched bilaterally and regionally . he did refer to global climate change , though , as a " serious challenge " that these technologies would help to confront . " bush out of step " some of corporate america 's industrial giants , including alcoa , general electric and dupont , this week called for mandatory caps on businesses ' greenhouse gas emissions , and trading of emissions permits . some observers said bush was out of kilter with domestic demands for action on climate change . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush 's plans for iraq found few takers in germany " he 's clearly out of step with where the american public and us congress are right now on climate change , which is ready to go much further than continuing technology initiatives , " jennifer morgan , a europe-based consultant on climate change and former spokesman with the green group wwf , told afp . european leaders however were less enthusiastic about bush 's plans for iraq in his address which involve sending 20,000 more american troops to the violence-racked country . both voigt and trittin criticized the plans , saying they could not detect any coherent political strategy . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de global warming bubbles to the surface in davos an exceptionally mild first half of winter in the swiss alps is helping to fuel growing concern about climate change at the annual meeting of the world economic forum , beginning on wednesday in davos .

the text , adopted by 28 votes in favor , 17 against and three abstentions , criticized eu states for a failure to fulfill " european obligations , such as the respect of human rights . " more than 1,245 cia-operated flights flew over european airspace or stopped over at airports in europe , members of the european parliament -lrb- meps -rrb- concluded .
they urged member states to investigate these so-called extraordinary rendition flights . us president george w. bush in september acknowledged for the first time that the cia was running secret prisons for holding and interrogating high-level al-qaeda figures who had been captured since the september 11 , 2001 attacks . allegations that cia agents shipped prisoners through european airports to secret detention centers , including compounds in eastern europe , were first reported in november 2005 . eu involvement in torture eu deputies " condemned the fact that european countries have been relinquishing their control over their airspace and airports by turning a blind eye or admitting flights operated by the cia which , on some occasions , were being used for extraordinary renditions , " the report said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian claudio fava is a member of the eu investigation committee italian socialist mep claudio fava , who drafted the final conclusions of the probe , told reporters that " involvement in detainment amounts to a certain extent to involvement in torture . " the report , which goes to a vote of the full parliament next month , said that claims that the cia had a secret prison in poland were unproven .
however , the parliamentarians stressed that poland was the eu country least cooperative with the parliament probe . the report also mentioned the eu 's foreign policy and security chief javier solana , saying that he did not reveal his knowledge about the detention program . in addition , the meps called on the bloc to more strictly monitor data transfer to non-eu countries and the use of european airspace .
they also demanded more eu competencies in combating international terrorism . human rights organization human rights watch , in new york , responded to the report by saying european countries need to go further to stop their own policies that allow torture to continue worldwide . in a briefing paper , the non-profit group said eu states used " ' diplomatic assurances " to justify returning terrorism suspects to places where they were likely to be tortured .
the group said such policies are unreliable , unenforceable and ineffective and do little to protect against torture . " european governments have used these empty promises as a fig leaf to justify sending people to places where they risk being tortured , " holly cartner , the group 's europe and central asia director , said in a statement . german failures the eu committee 's final conclusions also accused the former german governmental coalition of the social democrats and greens of failing to work for the release of german resident murat kurnaz , who was imprisoned in the us camp at guantanamo bay . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier - who was former chancellor gerhard schröder 's chief of staff at the time and thus in charge of intelligence - on tuesday rejected charges that he had known about a us offer in 2002 to release a german-born turk from the us military prison at guantanamo . kurnaz was not freed until august 2006 , after intervention from the present government led by chancellor angela merkel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor merkel , right , has backed steinmeier in the ex-guantanamo inmate affair ahead of a meeting with the european parliament 's foreign affairs committee in brussels , steinmeier said that the former german government had repeatedly tried to free kurnaz . " on various occasions , we made efforts for a release , " steinmeier said .
charges that the former government had obstructed a release of kurnaz were " firstly wrong and simply mean , " he added . kurnaz spent four-and-a-half years at guantanamo on cuba after his arrest as a suspected al-qaeda supporter in pakistan , shortly after the september 11 , 2001 attacks . but eu lawmakers stressed that " according to confidential institutional information , the german government did not accept the us offer , made in 2002 , to release murat kurnaz from guantanamo .

the house in wittenberg that held his massive workshop has recently been restored and was reopened wednesday . lucas cranach was a true renaissance man .
he possessed the rare combination of talent and wealth and , not only did he become one of the most significant painters of the german renaissance , he also enjoyed success as a merchant , politician and even a pharmacist . when the ruler of saxony , frederick iii , invited cranach to wittenberg in 1505 to become his court painter , the 33-year-old artist could n't have suspected that he would spend the next 45 years of his life there .
working as court painter , crafting mainly portraits and scenes from the bible and mythology , was only part of cranach 's broad career . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portions of cranach 's residence were renovated in 1998 , the rest is now complete in 1512 he bought a house in the center of town for both his family and his flourishing art workshop .
parts of this house , located at market square 4 in wittenberg , have been under reconstruction since 2003 , a 3.2 million euro -lrb- $ 4.1 million -rrb- project that officially drew to an end on wednesday . the building , restored in authentic renaissance style , will house permanent and rotating exhibitions , a youth art academy , offices for the cranach foundation , guest rooms and - fittingly - workshop space for artists . unusually large workshop cranach 's a workshop on market square quickly outgrew its quarters .
in 1518 , he bought another larger accommodation down the road , which at that time was the single largest house under private ownership in wittenberg .
up to 30 young apprentices were eventually employed there under cranach 's guidance . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a self-portrait from 1550 such a large-scale workshop , where journeymen painted but used cranach 's signature , was unusual at that time , said eva löber from the cranach foundation in wittenberg .
that 's part of what makes him notable . cranach , together with his apprentices , produced some 5,000 works , said löber , a thousand of which still exist today .
his paintings and woodcarvings are scattered among various museums throughout the world . a man of many trades already an influential man in town , cranach entered local politics in 1519 as the town treasurer .
two decades later , he served as mayor of wittenberg . in 1520 , cranach was granted a license to practice as an apothecary . his new workplace was located at on schloss street , and there he also sold wine and other sundries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " annunciation to joachim among the shepherds " the schloss street location held cranach 's precious printing presses .
invented just over half a century before , the devices were still extremely rare .
cranach put his presses to work publishing some of the significant documents of the protestant reformation , including martin luther 's september testament . cranach and the reformation luther and cranach were close friends - cranach and his wife barbara even served as witnesses at the theologian 's wedding in 1525 .
not only did the artist fashion portraits of luther and other reformation leaders , it was also his personal support for the movement that earned him a nickname as " painter of the reformation . " " cranach 's ' wittenberg altar ' is the best testimony to the reformation , " said eva löber .
" it points toward christ and the bible .
the orientation to the word was very important to luther . " it was in wittenberg that luther posted a copy of his famed 95 theses in the fall of 1517 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cranach 's " the resurrection of lazarus " is in the gemäldegalerie in dresden the europe-wide conflict over reforms to the powerful catholic church eventually drew cranach away from wittenberg and he did not spend out his final years in the town in which he 'd invested so much . after losing the battle of mühlberg in 1547 , saxony 's elector at the time johann frederick i , called john the magnanimous , was sent into exile because of his support for the reformation .
cranach followed and served as johann frederick 's court painter in augsburg and then in weimar , where the painter died in 1553 . cranach 's house in the 20th century located in eastern germany , cranach 's wittenberg houses lapsed into disrepair under the communists in the 20th century .

from now on , teambank , the buddy-buddy bank , is going with first names and the informal form of address . the world of finance around the globe is not known for its breezy atmosphere .
besides the occasional dress-down friday , the order of the day is generally pressed pants and tie clips and a rather reserved formality -lrb- save on the trading-room floor -rrb- . in germany , the serious tone in the workplace is often ratcheted up a notch .
germans offices in many sectors are often more formal than , say their american counterparts , with employees who 've worked together for years often still calling each other mr. schmidt or ms. bauer instead of dieter or gisela . so when a bank in germany puts a new policy in place that asks employees to get all touchy-feely , it 's touted as a revolution .
theophil graband , the chairman of teambank , has n't mandated the singing of kumbayah and holding hands , but he has asked him employees to address each other using the familiar form of the word " you . " dual ' you ' german , like many languages but unlike english , has two forms of " you . "
there 's the informal one , " du " in german , used with close friends , family members and little children .
then there 's " sie , " used with everyone else .
most workplaces are " sie " kinds of places , while in schoolyards , for example , the " du " predominates . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goofy ties could be next but now teambank is all warm and fuzzy , and the informal " you " form can be used with everyone from the copyboy to director graband himself .
he says taking the formality down a notch can help strengthen team spirit at the bank , which is all the rage in 21st century management manuals . graband is not forcing his " du " on anyone , and says the new form address should be adopted " voluntarily " by the bank 's 1,250 employees .
but those who refuse to bend will face a bit of peer pressure .
" we want to be as unifed as possible , " graband said . over the next several weeks , teambank is holding " teamcamps " to get any starched-shirts used to the bank 's new jaunty ways . whether there 'll be a teamgroan going up among employees remains to be seen . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de top cop busted for bank heist a high-ranking german police officer has been arrested for robbing a bank near his police station and getting away with tens of thousands in cash .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 24.01.2007 opinion : time for explanations großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unless he manages to produce new evidence , germany 's foreign minister will have to resign over the failure to get a german-born guantanamo prisoner released despite a us offer to do so , says dw 's heinz dylong . it seems right to keep asking why the former social democratic-green party government had so little interest in getting bremen-born turk murat kurnaz released from the us detention camp at guantanamo - especially since a us offer apparently existed to set kurnaz free after he had been wrongly accused of terrorist activities .
berlin allegedly rejected that , and a special committee of the european parliament says there 's enough proof to back the allegation . this alone would be a scandal that can not be covered up by claiming that kurnaz has turkish and not german citizenship and placing the blame on ankara instead of berlin .
a visit by german secret agents to kurnaz in guantanamo completes the picture . let 's be clear about this : barely 20 years of age , kurnaz was captured by the americans in pakistan .
he was possibly naive , but certainly not a terror suspect .
in january 2002 , he ended up at guantanamo , he was abused , but even the americans were eventually convinced of his innocence and wanted to send him back to germany .
berlin rejected the offer .
what 's more : the german authorities did n't merely not work towards his release , rather they boycotted it .
the man was n't able to leave the camp until 2006 . political responsibility for the germans ' behavior lies with a group of state secretaries and intelligence agency heads , who regularly discussed the security situation under the leadership of the chancellery 's chief-of-staff .
at the time in question , the latter position was occupied by frank-walter steinmeier , the current foreign minister .
he 'll have quite a bit of explaining to do to a parliamentary committee which is investigating the case .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 24.01.2007 opinion : time for explanations großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unless he manages to produce new evidence , germany 's foreign minister will have to resign over the failure to get a german-born guantanamo prisoner released despite a us offer to do so , says dw 's heinz dylong . it seems right to keep asking why the former social democratic-green party government had so little interest in getting bremen-born turk murat kurnaz released from the us detention camp at guantanamo - especially since a us offer apparently existed to set kurnaz free after he had been wrongly accused of terrorist activities .
berlin allegedly rejected that , and a special committee of the european parliament says there 's enough proof to back the allegation . this alone would be a scandal that can not be covered up by claiming that kurnaz has turkish and not german citizenship and placing the blame on ankara instead of berlin .
a visit by german secret agents to kurnaz in guantanamo completes the picture . let 's be clear about this : barely 20 years of age , kurnaz was captured by the americans in pakistan .
he was possibly naive , but certainly not a terror suspect .
in january 2002 , he ended up at guantanamo , he was abused , but even the americans were eventually convinced of his innocence and wanted to send him back to germany .
berlin rejected the offer .
what 's more : the german authorities did n't merely not work towards his release , rather they boycotted it .
the man was n't able to leave the camp until 2006 . political responsibility for the germans ' behavior lies with a group of state secretaries and intelligence agency heads , who regularly discussed the security situation under the leadership of the chancellery 's chief-of-staff .
at the time in question , the latter position was occupied by frank-walter steinmeier , the current foreign minister .
he 'll have quite a bit of explaining to do to a parliamentary committee which is investigating the case .
it 's certain that steinmeier will have to resign if he can not offer any new information to make berlin 's behavior plausible . his resignation would obviously not explain why berlin behaved the way it did .
foreign policy considerations may have played a role .
the german-american relationship was already tense because of germany 's " no " to the war in iraq .

the text , adopted by 28 votes in favor , 17 against and three abstentions , criticized eu states for a failure to fulfill " european obligations , such as the respect of human rights . " more than 1,245 cia-operated flights flew over european airspace or stopped over at airports in europe , members of the european parliament -lrb- meps -rrb- concluded .
they urged member states to investigate these so-called extraordinary rendition flights . us president george w. bush in september acknowledged for the first time that the cia was running secret prisons for holding and interrogating high-level al-qaeda figures who had been captured since the september 11 , 2001 attacks . allegations that cia agents shipped prisoners through european airports to secret detention centers , including compounds in eastern europe , were first reported in november 2005 . eu involvement in torture eu deputies " condemned the fact that european countries have been relinquishing their control over their airspace and airports by turning a blind eye or admitting flights operated by the cia which , on some occasions , were being used for extraordinary renditions , " the report said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian claudio fava is a member of the eu investigation committee italian socialist mep claudio fava , who drafted the final conclusions of the probe , told reporters that " involvement in detainment amounts to a certain extent to involvement in torture . " the report , which goes to a vote of the full parliament next month , said that claims that the cia had a secret prison in poland were unproven .
however , the parliamentarians stressed that poland was the eu country least cooperative with the parliament probe . the report also mentioned the eu 's foreign policy and security chief javier solana , saying that he did not reveal his knowledge about the detention program . in addition , the meps called on the bloc to more strictly monitor data transfer to non-eu countries and the use of european airspace .
they also demanded more eu competencies in combating international terrorism . human rights organization human rights watch , in new york , responded to the report by saying european countries need to go further to stop their own policies that allow torture to continue worldwide . in a briefing paper , the non-profit group said eu states used " ' diplomatic assurances " to justify returning terrorism suspects to places where they were likely to be tortured .
the group said such policies are unreliable , unenforceable and ineffective and do little to protect against torture . " european governments have used these empty promises as a fig leaf to justify sending people to places where they risk being tortured , " holly cartner , the group 's europe and central asia director , said in a statement . german failures the eu committee 's final conclusions also accused the former german governmental coalition of the social democrats and greens of failing to work for the release of german resident murat kurnaz , who was imprisoned in the us camp at guantanamo bay . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier - who was former chancellor gerhard schröder 's chief of staff at the time and thus in charge of intelligence - on tuesday rejected charges that he had known about a us offer in 2002 to release a german-born turk from the us military prison at guantanamo . kurnaz was not freed until august 2006 , after intervention from the present government led by chancellor angela merkel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor merkel , right , has backed steinmeier in the ex-guantanamo inmate affair ahead of a meeting with the european parliament 's foreign affairs committee in brussels , steinmeier said that the former german government had repeatedly tried to free kurnaz . " on various occasions , we made efforts for a release , " steinmeier said .
charges that the former government had obstructed a release of kurnaz were " firstly wrong and simply mean , " he added . kurnaz spent four-and-a-half years at guantanamo on cuba after his arrest as a suspected al-qaeda supporter in pakistan , shortly after the september 11 , 2001 attacks . but eu lawmakers stressed that " according to confidential institutional information , the german government did not accept the us offer , made in 2002 , to release murat kurnaz from guantanamo .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 24.01.2007 opinion : time for explanations großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unless he manages to produce new evidence , germany 's foreign minister will have to resign over the failure to get a german-born guantanamo prisoner released despite a us offer to do so , says dw 's heinz dylong . it seems right to keep asking why the former social democratic-green party government had so little interest in getting bremen-born turk murat kurnaz released from the us detention camp at guantanamo - especially since a us offer apparently existed to set kurnaz free after he had been wrongly accused of terrorist activities .
berlin allegedly rejected that , and a special committee of the european parliament says there 's enough proof to back the allegation . this alone would be a scandal that can not be covered up by claiming that kurnaz has turkish and not german citizenship and placing the blame on ankara instead of berlin .
a visit by german secret agents to kurnaz in guantanamo completes the picture . let 's be clear about this : barely 20 years of age , kurnaz was captured by the americans in pakistan .
he was possibly naive , but certainly not a terror suspect .
in january 2002 , he ended up at guantanamo , he was abused , but even the americans were eventually convinced of his innocence and wanted to send him back to germany .
berlin rejected the offer .
what 's more : the german authorities did n't merely not work towards his release , rather they boycotted it .
the man was n't able to leave the camp until 2006 . political responsibility for the germans ' behavior lies with a group of state secretaries and intelligence agency heads , who regularly discussed the security situation under the leadership of the chancellery 's chief-of-staff .
at the time in question , the latter position was occupied by frank-walter steinmeier , the current foreign minister .
he 'll have quite a bit of explaining to do to a parliamentary committee which is investigating the case .
it 's certain that steinmeier will have to resign if he can not offer any new information to make berlin 's behavior plausible . his resignation would obviously not explain why berlin behaved the way it did .
foreign policy considerations may have played a role .
the german-american relationship was already tense because of germany 's " no " to the war in iraq .
it might have made sense not to put additional strain on ties with the us - whether by insisting in the case of guantanamo or by the released prisoner one day possibly making public accusations .
be that as it may ; it 's certainly not in line with a foreign policy oriented toward human rights which the social democratic-green party government had claimed to pursue . heinz dylong is an editor at dw-radio -lrb- win -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu report slams members for involvement in secret cia affair european union lawmakers have approved a report which lashes out at eu countries for tolerating or assisting the united states ' practice of secret detentions of terrorist suspects .

berlin allegedly rejected that , and a special committee of the european parliament says there 's enough proof to back the allegation . this alone would be a scandal that can not be covered up by claiming that kurnaz has turkish and not german citizenship and placing the blame on ankara instead of berlin .
a visit by german secret agents to kurnaz in guantanamo completes the picture . let 's be clear about this : barely 20 years of age , kurnaz was captured by the americans in pakistan .
he was possibly naive , but certainly not a terror suspect .
in january 2002 , he ended up at guantanamo , he was abused , but even the americans were eventually convinced of his innocence and wanted to send him back to germany .
berlin rejected the offer .
what 's more : the german authorities did n't merely not work towards his release , rather they boycotted it .
the man was n't able to leave the camp until 2006 . political responsibility for the germans ' behavior lies with a group of state secretaries and intelligence agency heads , who regularly discussed the security situation under the leadership of the chancellery 's chief-of-staff .
at the time in question , the latter position was occupied by frank-walter steinmeier , the current foreign minister .
he 'll have quite a bit of explaining to do to a parliamentary committee which is investigating the case .
it 's certain that steinmeier will have to resign if he can not offer any new information to make berlin 's behavior plausible . his resignation would obviously not explain why berlin behaved the way it did .
foreign policy considerations may have played a role .
the german-american relationship was already tense because of germany 's " no " to the war in iraq .
it might have made sense not to put additional strain on ties with the us - whether by insisting in the case of guantanamo or by the released prisoner one day possibly making public accusations .

berlin allegedly rejected that , and a special committee of the european parliament says there 's enough proof to back the allegation . this alone would be a scandal that can not be covered up by claiming that kurnaz has turkish and not german citizenship and placing the blame on ankara instead of berlin .
a visit by german secret agents to kurnaz in guantanamo completes the picture . let 's be clear about this : barely 20 years of age , kurnaz was captured by the americans in pakistan .
he was possibly naive , but certainly not a terror suspect .
in january 2002 , he ended up at guantanamo , he was abused , but even the americans were eventually convinced of his innocence and wanted to send him back to germany .
berlin rejected the offer .
what 's more : the german authorities did n't merely not work towards his release , rather they boycotted it .
the man was n't able to leave the camp until 2006 . political responsibility for the germans ' behavior lies with a group of state secretaries and intelligence agency heads , who regularly discussed the security situation under the leadership of the chancellery 's chief-of-staff .
at the time in question , the latter position was occupied by frank-walter steinmeier , the current foreign minister .
he 'll have quite a bit of explaining to do to a parliamentary committee which is investigating the case .
it 's certain that steinmeier will have to resign if he can not offer any new information to make berlin 's behavior plausible . his resignation would obviously not explain why berlin behaved the way it did .
foreign policy considerations may have played a role .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 24.01.2007 at davos kick-off , merkel says no to protectionism großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel focused on the challenges of globalization during her speech in a wide-ranging speech at the world economic forum , german chancellor angela merkel on wednesday staunchly rejected protectionism as a solution to the economic and social challenges of globalization . chancellor merkel said some countries might be tempted to exploit their economic might to its fullest , by selfishly consuming global resources and setting up customs barriers to protect " their own weaknesses . " " my clear and succinct answer is : no ! "
merkel told the gathering of business and political leaders in the swiss resort of davos . speaking as the current president of the european union , merkel said she wanted the bloc to use the motto " more freedom for a new security " as its guiding principle for the future . she also said germany , during its presidency of the group of eight industrialized nations , would aim at removing exchange rate imbalances , boosting hedge fund transparency and starting a new dialogue with emerging powers . more opportunity merkel said recent deep rooted shifts in the structure of the world economy had spread opportunity for economic growth more widely , especially in emerging nations .
but she cautioned that the trend had also created greater uncertainty . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : movers and shakers in abundance , few celebrities this year " those who regard themselves as the winners of tomorrow can not feel sure that they will that they will also be the winners the day after tomorrow , " she warned the gathering of business and political leaders gathered here . the theme of this year 's world economic forum -lrb- wef -rrb- meeting - " the shifting power equation " - sought to take in everything from the growing geopolitical clout of asia to the increasing influence of the internet in business and information gathering . " we have a shift of power in many ways ... with the rise of china and india , and the next layer of countries like vietnam , brazil and korea , " said wef founder klaus schwab .
" at the same time we see the shift of power from business leaders to customers and shareholders , " schwab said . upbeat mood about 2007 the 2,400 registered participants at davos included 800 corporate chief executives or chairmen , 24 heads of state or government and 85 cabinet ministers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barbed wire in downtown davos business leaders were in upbeat mood about prospects for 2007 and beyond , amid strong corporate profits and forecasts for another year of global expansion , despite a predicted slowdown in the united states . a poll of davos participants by the organizers showed that 65 percent of corporate chiefs and politicians thought their children would live in a more prosperous world . economist laura tyson of the university of california , berkeley , sounded a cautious note when she said 2007 could be another fairytale year but warned that unresolved global imbalances meant " the big bad wolf is hiding in the forest . " an unusual lack of snow at davos in the run-up to this year 's forum helped to highlight the issue of climate change , which schwab expected to top the gathering 's agenda . cautious welcome for us proposals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us plans to cut emissions across the board there was a cautious welcome for us president george bush 's proposals for a long-term cut in us gasoline consumption , as business leaders urged greater government action on global warming . " i think it is a movement in the right direction , there is a recognition of the link between climate change and human activity , " said nicholas stern , the british government 's chief economic advisor . stern recently penned a major report that warned of the dire economic consequences of climate change unless swift action was taken . bush 's state of the union address on tuesday promised to cut us gasoline consumption by 20 percent by 2017 and favor alternative fuels like corn-based ethanol .
but it failed to meet growing expectations of federal limits on carbon emissions to match international ones . " you have to recognize what everyone is doing .
the united states is doing a lot on technology , a lot on standards .
but then of course we have to scale up our action , " stern said . shifting spheres of influence the theme of shifting spheres of influence was party reflected in the absence of big name us officials , while india sent a high-profile 100-member delegation and the prime minister of vietnam - the newest member of the world trade organization - also showed up . another notable " shift " was the lack of celebrities . with the exception of davos regular bono , famous names from the world of entertainment were scarce on the ground compared to previous years when the likes of angelina jolie , brad pitt and sharon stone stole the media spotlight from the corporate bigwigs and political leaders . " it is not our policy to invite stars , " schwab explained .
" it is our policy to invite people who can make contributions to specific sessions .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 24.01.2007 at davos kick-off , merkel says no to protectionism großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel focused on the challenges of globalization during her speech in a wide-ranging speech at the world economic forum , german chancellor angela merkel on wednesday staunchly rejected protectionism as a solution to the economic and social challenges of globalization . chancellor merkel said some countries might be tempted to exploit their economic might to its fullest , by selfishly consuming global resources and setting up customs barriers to protect " their own weaknesses . " " my clear and succinct answer is : no ! "
merkel told the gathering of business and political leaders in the swiss resort of davos . speaking as the current president of the european union , merkel said she wanted the bloc to use the motto " more freedom for a new security " as its guiding principle for the future . she also said germany , during its presidency of the group of eight industrialized nations , would aim at removing exchange rate imbalances , boosting hedge fund transparency and starting a new dialogue with emerging powers . more opportunity merkel said recent deep rooted shifts in the structure of the world economy had spread opportunity for economic growth more widely , especially in emerging nations .
but she cautioned that the trend had also created greater uncertainty . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : movers and shakers in abundance , few celebrities this year " those who regard themselves as the winners of tomorrow can not feel sure that they will that they will also be the winners the day after tomorrow , " she warned the gathering of business and political leaders gathered here . the theme of this year 's world economic forum -lrb- wef -rrb- meeting - " the shifting power equation " - sought to take in everything from the growing geopolitical clout of asia to the increasing influence of the internet in business and information gathering . " we have a shift of power in many ways ... with the rise of china and india , and the next layer of countries like vietnam , brazil and korea , " said wef founder klaus schwab .
" at the same time we see the shift of power from business leaders to customers and shareholders , " schwab said . upbeat mood about 2007 the 2,400 registered participants at davos included 800 corporate chief executives or chairmen , 24 heads of state or government and 85 cabinet ministers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barbed wire in downtown davos business leaders were in upbeat mood about prospects for 2007 and beyond , amid strong corporate profits and forecasts for another year of global expansion , despite a predicted slowdown in the united states . a poll of davos participants by the organizers showed that 65 percent of corporate chiefs and politicians thought their children would live in a more prosperous world . economist laura tyson of the university of california , berkeley , sounded a cautious note when she said 2007 could be another fairytale year but warned that unresolved global imbalances meant " the big bad wolf is hiding in the forest . " an unusual lack of snow at davos in the run-up to this year 's forum helped to highlight the issue of climate change , which schwab expected to top the gathering 's agenda . cautious welcome for us proposals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us plans to cut emissions across the board there was a cautious welcome for us president george bush 's proposals for a long-term cut in us gasoline consumption , as business leaders urged greater government action on global warming . " i think it is a movement in the right direction , there is a recognition of the link between climate change and human activity , " said nicholas stern , the british government 's chief economic advisor . stern recently penned a major report that warned of the dire economic consequences of climate change unless swift action was taken . bush 's state of the union address on tuesday promised to cut us gasoline consumption by 20 percent by 2017 and favor alternative fuels like corn-based ethanol .
but it failed to meet growing expectations of federal limits on carbon emissions to match international ones . " you have to recognize what everyone is doing .
the united states is doing a lot on technology , a lot on standards .
but then of course we have to scale up our action , " stern said . shifting spheres of influence the theme of shifting spheres of influence was party reflected in the absence of big name us officials , while india sent a high-profile 100-member delegation and the prime minister of vietnam - the newest member of the world trade organization - also showed up . another notable " shift " was the lack of celebrities . with the exception of davos regular bono , famous names from the world of entertainment were scarce on the ground compared to previous years when the likes of angelina jolie , brad pitt and sharon stone stole the media spotlight from the corporate bigwigs and political leaders . " it is not our policy to invite stars , " schwab explained .

the nation 's family minister said she would like customers of women forced into the profession to be prosecuted . family minister ursula von der leyen said that there are still too many illegal prostitutes in germany and that it is still too hard for many of the woman in the field to leave , even if they want to . referring to a report on prostitution commissioned by the federal cabinet , von der leyen told reporters at a press conference on wednesday that the attempt to improve that lives of prostitutes by giving them access to healthcare , social security and pensions in a groundbreaking 2002 law still did not do enough for large numbers of sex workers in germany . " the possibilities in practice are almost never used , " she said , and announced new measures aimed at protecting women forced into sex work and underage prostitutes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : family minister ursula von der leyen " the prostitution law has only reached part of its goal , " she said , adding that health and hygiene conditions of most prostitutes have not improved since the law 's passage .
there are an estimated 400,000 registered prostitutes in germany . but von der leyen , a member of angela merkel 's conservative christian democratic party , said she was not aiming at turning back and clock and making prostitution illegal again , but wanted to offer sex workers viable ways out of the profession . " we want to rigorously go after the criminal element surrounding prostitution , " she said .
" that includes punishing customers of forced prostitutes , raising the minimal age and much stricter controls over brothels , with the message that prostitution is not just a job like any other . " the final goal must be to encourage prostitutes to get out of the field , she said . ignorance no excuse chancellor merkel 's grand coalition government is now drafting new legislation that would raise the legal age for prostitution from 16 to 18 and would plug a legal loophole that allows clients of women forced into prostitution to escape prosecution by pleading ignorance of their situation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are some 400,000 registered prostitites in germany " if the prostitute speaks no german and has bruises on her body then the client has to assume this is forced prostitution , " von der leyen said .
" he can no longer say : ' i did n't notice ' . " more than half of the prostitutes in germany are thought to be here illegally , many from eastern europe , and because most have no legal papers , leaving the profession or the men who control their lives , is next to impossible . however , the family minister offered no details on how such measures would be enforced . her proposals will have to be approved by the german cabinet and then approved by the parliament before becoming law . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a job like none other : being a prostitute in germany morning , noon and night - the demand for prostitutes is huge .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de music -pipe- 24.01.2007 " downloading music is a negative trend " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siegel said he does not want cd stores to become a thing of the past the writer of several compositions for the eurovision song contest , german folk-rock musician and producer ralph siegel talked to dw-world.de about the damage being done to the music industry by the internet . siegel wrote 18 songs for the eurovision song contest , including the 1982 german hit " ein bisschen frieden . "
he owns jupiter records and has registered over 2,000 titles with germany 's music rights authority , gema . dw-world.de : mr. siegel , what do you think of the shift of music distribution from records to cds and now to internet downloads ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siegel owns a record label and a music publishing company ralph siegel : it 's a huge catastrophe .
it used to be when you wanted a cd you had to go out and buy it .
now you pay 99 cents that the artist has to share with the internet site - there 's actually not much left . it 's getting harder and harder to put new products on the market , because the marketing costs are crazily high .
this download nonsense is n't enough , it 's just drop in the bucket .
when the normal means of distribution for a cd , which you can hold in your hands , is lost , the business - sooner or later - will be reduced to a couple of big acts or purely internet-based platforms where some people put something on the internet and then hope to make a couple of euros off it .
that wo n't be enough to keep the music market above water . but the trend seems unstoppable . that 's completely true , but it 's a negative trend that i think is terrible .
of course it 's wonderful that these days everyone can say , " i composed a song and put it on the internet " and then see what happens .
but turns it into a hobby occupation , and professionalism gets watered down . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siegel said platforms like apple 's itunes do n't help artists you can put 100,000 songs on the internet , even from new composers , but no one knows what to find where .
and no one receives any more support .
in and of itself , the internet is not a support , because after an artist is listed on the internet someone needs to work with him , which i think is the most important thing .
he has to learn new things .
there has to be a job description for artists getting into this profession again . when there are only small revenues and small amounts of money generated , no one is going to be interested in getting involved in training artists or getting them started on paths that take 10 or 20 years .
this is what the music industry has done , but it can only do it when it has the opportunity to make money .
but this small-time business going on now is downright absurd . young artists like will.i.am from the " black eyed peas " as well as the band " shiny toy guns " say they can make a living from it . when a couple of people can do it , that 's wonderful .
of course there are always a few good examples , a few people that it 's good for .
but in the long run this wo n't be the case .
i do n't think so anyway . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : online sales wo n't be enough to support artists , according to siegel it 's just like all the newspapers that open up and then close down .
i think it 's dangerous .
there always has to be some professionalism in the world .
by the time a little internet site makes it worldwide - that 's going to take a long time and an internet shop is n't going to be enough . something has to be done for the artists .
management has to nurture them , there has to be a real structure and the internet ca n't do that by itself .
it 's one thing to present or market something - which is a good - but it 's not everything . what are the advantages of the old-fashioned means of distribution you promote ? the biggest problem is that the internet is n't alive .
the exchanges you have in conversations and in cooperating with others , or in a lot of other private ways , are what keeps music alive and are what music needs . creativity ca n't just be hunted down in the ether or created alone in a room .
i know what i 'm talking about , i 've been in front of a computer many a time in the past 20 years and always look forward to when i can be with my artists in the studio or out on the road .
the human touch is very important .
i do n't get that from the internet . julia elvers-guyot interviewed ralph siegel -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " mozart new edition " now online for free as the end of a full year of mozart celebrations nears , the musical scores of his complete works have been made available for free on the web .

from now on , teambank , the buddy-buddy bank , is going with first names and the informal form of address . the world of finance around the globe is not known for its breezy atmosphere .
besides the occasional dress-down friday , the order of the day is generally pressed pants and tie clips and a rather reserved formality -lrb- save on the trading-room floor -rrb- . in germany , the serious tone in the workplace is often ratcheted up a notch .
germans offices in many sectors are often more formal than , say their american counterparts , with employees who 've worked together for years often still calling each other mr. schmidt or ms. bauer instead of dieter or gisela . so when a bank in germany puts a new policy in place that asks employees to get all touchy-feely , it 's touted as a revolution .
theophil graband , the chairman of teambank , has n't mandated the singing of kumbayah and holding hands , but he has asked him employees to address each other using the familiar form of the word " you . " dual ' you ' german , like many languages but unlike english , has two forms of " you . "
there 's the informal one , " du " in german , used with close friends , family members and little children .
then there 's " sie , " used with everyone else .
most workplaces are " sie " kinds of places , while in schoolyards , for example , the " du " predominates . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goofy ties could be next but now teambank is all warm and fuzzy , and the informal " you " form can be used with everyone from the copyboy to director graband himself .
he says taking the formality down a notch can help strengthen team spirit at the bank , which is all the rage in 21st century management manuals . graband is not forcing his " du " on anyone , and says the new form address should be adopted " voluntarily " by the bank 's 1,250 employees .
but those who refuse to bend will face a bit of peer pressure .
" we want to be as unifed as possible , " graband said . over the next several weeks , teambank is holding " teamcamps " to get any starched-shirts used to the bank 's new jaunty ways . whether there 'll be a teamgroan going up among employees remains to be seen . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de top cop busted for bank heist a high-ranking german police officer has been arrested for robbing a bank near his police station and getting away with tens of thousands in cash .

" " my clear and succinct answer is : no ! "
merkel told the gathering of business and political leaders in the swiss resort of davos . speaking as the current president of the european union , merkel said she wanted the bloc to use the motto " more freedom for a new security " as its guiding principle for the future . she also said germany , during its presidency of the group of eight industrialized nations , would aim at removing exchange rate imbalances , boosting hedge fund transparency and starting a new dialogue with emerging powers . more opportunity merkel said recent deep rooted shifts in the structure of the world economy had spread opportunity for economic growth more widely , especially in emerging nations .
but she cautioned that the trend had also created greater uncertainty . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : movers and shakers in abundance , few celebrities this year " those who regard themselves as the winners of tomorrow can not feel sure that they will that they will also be the winners the day after tomorrow , " she warned the gathering of business and political leaders gathered here . the theme of this year 's world economic forum -lrb- wef -rrb- meeting - " the shifting power equation " - sought to take in everything from the growing geopolitical clout of asia to the increasing influence of the internet in business and information gathering . " we have a shift of power in many ways ... with the rise of china and india , and the next layer of countries like vietnam , brazil and korea , " said wef founder klaus schwab .
" at the same time we see the shift of power from business leaders to customers and shareholders , " schwab said . upbeat mood about 2007 the 2,400 registered participants at davos included 800 corporate chief executives or chairmen , 24 heads of state or government and 85 cabinet ministers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barbed wire in downtown davos business leaders were in upbeat mood about prospects for 2007 and beyond , amid strong corporate profits and forecasts for another year of global expansion , despite a predicted slowdown in the united states . a poll of davos participants by the organizers showed that 65 percent of corporate chiefs and politicians thought their children would live in a more prosperous world . economist laura tyson of the university of california , berkeley , sounded a cautious note when she said 2007 could be another fairytale year but warned that unresolved global imbalances meant " the big bad wolf is hiding in the forest . " an unusual lack of snow at davos in the run-up to this year 's forum helped to highlight the issue of climate change , which schwab expected to top the gathering 's agenda . cautious welcome for us proposals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us plans to cut emissions across the board there was a cautious welcome for us president george bush 's proposals for a long-term cut in us gasoline consumption , as business leaders urged greater government action on global warming . " i think it is a movement in the right direction , there is a recognition of the link between climate change and human activity , " said nicholas stern , the british government 's chief economic advisor . stern recently penned a major report that warned of the dire economic consequences of climate change unless swift action was taken . bush 's state of the union address on tuesday promised to cut us gasoline consumption by 20 percent by 2017 and favor alternative fuels like corn-based ethanol .
but it failed to meet growing expectations of federal limits on carbon emissions to match international ones . " you have to recognize what everyone is doing .
the united states is doing a lot on technology , a lot on standards .
but then of course we have to scale up our action , " stern said . shifting spheres of influence the theme of shifting spheres of influence was party reflected in the absence of big name us officials , while india sent a high-profile 100-member delegation and the prime minister of vietnam - the newest member of the world trade organization - also showed up . another notable " shift " was the lack of celebrities . with the exception of davos regular bono , famous names from the world of entertainment were scarce on the ground compared to previous years when the likes of angelina jolie , brad pitt and sharon stone stole the media spotlight from the corporate bigwigs and political leaders . " it is not our policy to invite stars , " schwab explained .

berlin allegedly rejected that , and a special committee of the european parliament says there 's enough proof to back the allegation . this alone would be a scandal that can not be covered up by claiming that kurnaz has turkish and not german citizenship and placing the blame on ankara instead of berlin .
a visit by german secret agents to kurnaz in guantanamo completes the picture . let 's be clear about this : barely 20 years of age , kurnaz was captured by the americans in pakistan .
he was possibly naive , but certainly not a terror suspect .
in january 2002 , he ended up at guantanamo , he was abused , but even the americans were eventually convinced of his innocence and wanted to send him back to germany .
berlin rejected the offer .
what 's more : the german authorities did n't merely not work towards his release , rather they boycotted it .
the man was n't able to leave the camp until 2006 . political responsibility for the germans ' behavior lies with a group of state secretaries and intelligence agency heads , who regularly discussed the security situation under the leadership of the chancellery 's chief-of-staff .
at the time in question , the latter position was occupied by frank-walter steinmeier , the current foreign minister .
he 'll have quite a bit of explaining to do to a parliamentary committee which is investigating the case .
it 's certain that steinmeier will have to resign if he can not offer any new information to make berlin 's behavior plausible . his resignation would obviously not explain why berlin behaved the way it did .
foreign policy considerations may have played a role .
the german-american relationship was already tense because of germany 's " no " to the war in iraq .
it might have made sense not to put additional strain on ties with the us - whether by insisting in the case of guantanamo or by the released prisoner one day possibly making public accusations .
be that as it may ; it 's certainly not in line with a foreign policy oriented toward human rights which the social democratic-green party government had claimed to pursue . heinz dylong is an editor at dw-radio -lrb- win -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu report slams members for involvement in secret cia affair european union lawmakers have approved a report which lashes out at eu countries for tolerating or assisting the united states ' practice of secret detentions of terrorist suspects .

the text , adopted by 28 votes in favor , 17 against and three abstentions , criticized eu states for a failure to fulfill " european obligations , such as the respect of human rights . " more than 1,245 cia-operated flights flew over european airspace or stopped over at airports in europe , members of the european parliament -lrb- meps -rrb- concluded .
they urged member states to investigate these so-called extraordinary rendition flights . us president george w. bush in september acknowledged for the first time that the cia was running secret prisons for holding and interrogating high-level al-qaeda figures who had been captured since the september 11 , 2001 attacks . allegations that cia agents shipped prisoners through european airports to secret detention centers , including compounds in eastern europe , were first reported in november 2005 . eu involvement in torture eu deputies " condemned the fact that european countries have been relinquishing their control over their airspace and airports by turning a blind eye or admitting flights operated by the cia which , on some occasions , were being used for extraordinary renditions , " the report said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian claudio fava is a member of the eu investigation committee italian socialist mep claudio fava , who drafted the final conclusions of the probe , told reporters that " involvement in detainment amounts to a certain extent to involvement in torture . " the report , which goes to a vote of the full parliament next month , said that claims that the cia had a secret prison in poland were unproven .
however , the parliamentarians stressed that poland was the eu country least cooperative with the parliament probe . the report also mentioned the eu 's foreign policy and security chief javier solana , saying that he did not reveal his knowledge about the detention program . in addition , the meps called on the bloc to more strictly monitor data transfer to non-eu countries and the use of european airspace .
they also demanded more eu competencies in combating international terrorism . human rights organization human rights watch , in new york , responded to the report by saying european countries need to go further to stop their own policies that allow torture to continue worldwide . in a briefing paper , the non-profit group said eu states used " ' diplomatic assurances " to justify returning terrorism suspects to places where they were likely to be tortured .
the group said such policies are unreliable , unenforceable and ineffective and do little to protect against torture . " european governments have used these empty promises as a fig leaf to justify sending people to places where they risk being tortured , " holly cartner , the group 's europe and central asia director , said in a statement . german failures the eu committee 's final conclusions also accused the former german governmental coalition of the social democrats and greens of failing to work for the release of german resident murat kurnaz , who was imprisoned in the us camp at guantanamo bay . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier - who was former chancellor gerhard schröder 's chief of staff at the time and thus in charge of intelligence - on tuesday rejected charges that he had known about a us offer in 2002 to release a german-born turk from the us military prison at guantanamo . kurnaz was not freed until august 2006 , after intervention from the present government led by chancellor angela merkel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor merkel , right , has backed steinmeier in the ex-guantanamo inmate affair ahead of a meeting with the european parliament 's foreign affairs committee in brussels , steinmeier said that the former german government had repeatedly tried to free kurnaz . " on various occasions , we made efforts for a release , " steinmeier said .
charges that the former government had obstructed a release of kurnaz were " firstly wrong and simply mean , " he added . kurnaz spent four-and-a-half years at guantanamo on cuba after his arrest as a suspected al-qaeda supporter in pakistan , shortly after the september 11 , 2001 attacks . but eu lawmakers stressed that " according to confidential institutional information , the german government did not accept the us offer , made in 2002 , to release murat kurnaz from guantanamo .

the house in wittenberg that held his massive workshop has recently been restored and was reopened wednesday . lucas cranach was a true renaissance man .
he possessed the rare combination of talent and wealth and , not only did he become one of the most significant painters of the german renaissance , he also enjoyed success as a merchant , politician and even a pharmacist . when the ruler of saxony , frederick iii , invited cranach to wittenberg in 1505 to become his court painter , the 33-year-old artist could n't have suspected that he would spend the next 45 years of his life there .
working as court painter , crafting mainly portraits and scenes from the bible and mythology , was only part of cranach 's broad career . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portions of cranach 's residence were renovated in 1998 , the rest is now complete in 1512 he bought a house in the center of town for both his family and his flourishing art workshop .
parts of this house , located at market square 4 in wittenberg , have been under reconstruction since 2003 , a 3.2 million euro -lrb- $ 4.1 million -rrb- project that officially drew to an end on wednesday . the building , restored in authentic renaissance style , will house permanent and rotating exhibitions , a youth art academy , offices for the cranach foundation , guest rooms and - fittingly - workshop space for artists . unusually large workshop cranach 's a workshop on market square quickly outgrew its quarters .
in 1518 , he bought another larger accommodation down the road , which at that time was the single largest house under private ownership in wittenberg .
up to 30 young apprentices were eventually employed there under cranach 's guidance . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a self-portrait from 1550 such a large-scale workshop , where journeymen painted but used cranach 's signature , was unusual at that time , said eva löber from the cranach foundation in wittenberg .
that 's part of what makes him notable . cranach , together with his apprentices , produced some 5,000 works , said löber , a thousand of which still exist today .
his paintings and woodcarvings are scattered among various museums throughout the world . a man of many trades already an influential man in town , cranach entered local politics in 1519 as the town treasurer .
two decades later , he served as mayor of wittenberg . in 1520 , cranach was granted a license to practice as an apothecary . his new workplace was located at on schloss street , and there he also sold wine and other sundries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " annunciation to joachim among the shepherds " the schloss street location held cranach 's precious printing presses .
invented just over half a century before , the devices were still extremely rare .
cranach put his presses to work publishing some of the significant documents of the protestant reformation , including martin luther 's september testament . cranach and the reformation luther and cranach were close friends - cranach and his wife barbara even served as witnesses at the theologian 's wedding in 1525 .
not only did the artist fashion portraits of luther and other reformation leaders , it was also his personal support for the movement that earned him a nickname as " painter of the reformation . " " cranach 's ' wittenberg altar ' is the best testimony to the reformation , " said eva löber .
" it points toward christ and the bible .
the orientation to the word was very important to luther . " it was in wittenberg that luther posted a copy of his famed 95 theses in the fall of 1517 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cranach 's " the resurrection of lazarus " is in the gemäldegalerie in dresden the europe-wide conflict over reforms to the powerful catholic church eventually drew cranach away from wittenberg and he did not spend out his final years in the town in which he 'd invested so much . after losing the battle of mühlberg in 1547 , saxony 's elector at the time johann frederick i , called john the magnanimous , was sent into exile because of his support for the reformation .
cranach followed and served as johann frederick 's court painter in augsburg and then in weimar , where the painter died in 1553 . cranach 's house in the 20th century located in eastern germany , cranach 's wittenberg houses lapsed into disrepair under the communists in the 20th century .
the city bought the buildings in 1991 as a result of a citizen initiative started the first of two restoration projects . following the completion of the second restoration project , the keys to the historic complex were handed over to wittenberg 's mayor on wednesday in an official ceremony . kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany aims for better restitution process for nazi-looted art the german government has invited museum directors and legal experts to berlin on monday to discuss claims for art bought or seized by the nazis .

berlin allegedly rejected that , and a special committee of the european parliament says there 's enough proof to back the allegation . this alone would be a scandal that can not be covered up by claiming that kurnaz has turkish and not german citizenship and placing the blame on ankara instead of berlin .
a visit by german secret agents to kurnaz in guantanamo completes the picture . let 's be clear about this : barely 20 years of age , kurnaz was captured by the americans in pakistan .
he was possibly naive , but certainly not a terror suspect .
in january 2002 , he ended up at guantanamo , he was abused , but even the americans were eventually convinced of his innocence and wanted to send him back to germany .
berlin rejected the offer .
what 's more : the german authorities did n't merely not work towards his release , rather they boycotted it .
the man was n't able to leave the camp until 2006 . political responsibility for the germans ' behavior lies with a group of state secretaries and intelligence agency heads , who regularly discussed the security situation under the leadership of the chancellery 's chief-of-staff .
at the time in question , the latter position was occupied by frank-walter steinmeier , the current foreign minister .
he 'll have quite a bit of explaining to do to a parliamentary committee which is investigating the case .
it 's certain that steinmeier will have to resign if he can not offer any new information to make berlin 's behavior plausible . his resignation would obviously not explain why berlin behaved the way it did .
foreign policy considerations may have played a role .
the german-american relationship was already tense because of germany 's " no " to the war in iraq .
it might have made sense not to put additional strain on ties with the us - whether by insisting in the case of guantanamo or by the released prisoner one day possibly making public accusations .

it used to be when you wanted a cd you had to go out and buy it .
now you pay 99 cents that the artist has to share with the internet site - there 's actually not much left . it 's getting harder and harder to put new products on the market , because the marketing costs are crazily high .

that wo n't be enough to keep the music market above water . but the trend seems unstoppable . that 's completely true , but it 's a negative trend that i think is terrible .

but this small-time business going on now is downright absurd . young artists like will.i.am from the " black eyed peas " as well as the band " shiny toy guns " say they can make a living from it . when a couple of people can do it , that 's wonderful .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de music -pipe- 24.01.2007 " downloading music is a negative trend " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siegel said he does not want cd stores to become a thing of the past the writer of several compositions for the eurovision song contest , german folk-rock musician and producer ralph siegel talked to dw-world.de about the damage being done to the music industry by the internet . siegel wrote 18 songs for the eurovision song contest , including the 1982 german hit " ein bisschen frieden . "
he owns jupiter records and has registered over 2,000 titles with germany 's music rights authority , gema . dw-world.de : mr. siegel , what do you think of the shift of music distribution from records to cds and now to internet downloads ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siegel owns a record label and a music publishing company ralph siegel : it 's a huge catastrophe .
it used to be when you wanted a cd you had to go out and buy it .
now you pay 99 cents that the artist has to share with the internet site - there 's actually not much left . it 's getting harder and harder to put new products on the market , because the marketing costs are crazily high .
this download nonsense is n't enough , it 's just drop in the bucket .
when the normal means of distribution for a cd , which you can hold in your hands , is lost , the business - sooner or later - will be reduced to a couple of big acts or purely internet-based platforms where some people put something on the internet and then hope to make a couple of euros off it .
that wo n't be enough to keep the music market above water . but the trend seems unstoppable . that 's completely true , but it 's a negative trend that i think is terrible .
of course it 's wonderful that these days everyone can say , " i composed a song and put it on the internet " and then see what happens .
but turns it into a hobby occupation , and professionalism gets watered down . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siegel said platforms like apple 's itunes do n't help artists you can put 100,000 songs on the internet , even from new composers , but no one knows what to find where .
and no one receives any more support .
in and of itself , the internet is not a support , because after an artist is listed on the internet someone needs to work with him , which i think is the most important thing .
he has to learn new things .
there has to be a job description for artists getting into this profession again . when there are only small revenues and small amounts of money generated , no one is going to be interested in getting involved in training artists or getting them started on paths that take 10 or 20 years .
this is what the music industry has done , but it can only do it when it has the opportunity to make money .
but this small-time business going on now is downright absurd . young artists like will.i.am from the " black eyed peas " as well as the band " shiny toy guns " say they can make a living from it . when a couple of people can do it , that 's wonderful .
of course there are always a few good examples , a few people that it 's good for .
but in the long run this wo n't be the case .
i do n't think so anyway . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : online sales wo n't be enough to support artists , according to siegel it 's just like all the newspapers that open up and then close down .
i think it 's dangerous .
there always has to be some professionalism in the world .
by the time a little internet site makes it worldwide - that 's going to take a long time and an internet shop is n't going to be enough . something has to be done for the artists .
management has to nurture them , there has to be a real structure and the internet ca n't do that by itself .
it 's one thing to present or market something - which is a good - but it 's not everything . what are the advantages of the old-fashioned means of distribution you promote ? the biggest problem is that the internet is n't alive .
the exchanges you have in conversations and in cooperating with others , or in a lot of other private ways , are what keeps music alive and are what music needs . creativity ca n't just be hunted down in the ether or created alone in a room .
i know what i 'm talking about , i 've been in front of a computer many a time in the past 20 years and always look forward to when i can be with my artists in the studio or out on the road .

"
but environmentalists in europe say his measures do n't go far enough . german leaders on wednesday reacted positively to us president george w. bush 's annual state of the union speech in which he called climate change a " serious issue " and urged americans to cut their gasoline consumption by 20 percent over a decade , mostly through a nearly five-fold increase in use of home-grown fuels such as ethanol . bush also pushed for tighter vehicle fuel efficiency standards . " a positive sign " " the fact that the american president acknowledges climate change as a problem is definitely a positive sign , " karsten voigt , the government 's coordinator of transatlantic relations told spiegel online . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush said climate change was a " serious challenge " voigt said bush had realized that saving energy was not just important on the political level , but also for security reasons . former german environment minister , jürgen trittin told german radio that bush had realized that oil-dependency massively undermined his leveraging power .
bush 's speech , said trittin , could " improve transatlantic cooperation in the fight against climate change . " bärbel höhn , deputy leader of the green group in parliament urged the german government to set similar ambitious goals on renewable energy like the american president did in his address . " we have to be careful that we do n't squander our leadership and technological edge in renewable energy , " höhn said . " moving in the right direction " sir nicholas stern , chief economic adviser to the british government and author of a report in 2006 that warned of the mounting costs of climate change , said bush 's speech was " a movement in the right direction . " " there is a recognition of the link between climate change and human activity , " he told reporters at the world economic forum in davos , switzerland . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush 's comments made for much debate in davos " you have to recognise what everyone is doing .
the united states is doing a lot on technology , a lot on standards .
but then of course we have to scale up our action . " the executive secretary of the un framework convention on climate change -lrb- unfccc -rrb- , yvo de boer , said bush 's speech marked a shift towards a more sustainable form of energy and noted his choice of words about climate change . " he did not talk in his state of the union address about international cooperation on climate change .
but at the same time , he did put his remarks in the context of the need for global response , " de boer told reporters in tokyo .
" that i think is very encouraging . " green groups say too little too late but environmentalists and green groups in europe were less impressed with the president 's address and said his measures did n't go far enough . jan kowalzig at friends of the earth europe told news agency afp that biofuel and fuel-efficiency initiatives were " worthwhile measures " but did not tackle the critical problem posed by us emissions of greenhouse gases . bush declined in his annual address to support mandatory caps on heat-trapping carbon gases that big us companies such as general electric co. have pushed for . only a mandatory cap on these emissions could drive down this pollution , said kowalzig .
he added that biofuels could in fact worsen the greenhouse-gas problem . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush does n't support mandatory carbon caps " in theory , they only produce as many greenhouse gas emissions as they suck up when growing , so they would be carbon neutral , " kowalzig said .
" in practice , in most places , they are not , because transportation of the fuels , processing of the fuels , all that requires energy which is currently driven by a fossil-fuel economy , " he said .
" so all these biofuels projects currently add to the greenhouse-gas effect . " bush u-turns on climate change bush 's address had been trailed by several media reports that forecast a u-turn on climate change . in 2001 , bush abandoned the kyoto protocol for curbing greenhouse-gas emissions , saying the pact 's binding caps were unfair and too costly for the us economy . bereft of the united states , which by itself accounts for nearly a quarter of global carbon pollution , kyoto has limped along and negotiations on cuts beyond 2012 are set to be long and bitter . but bush made no reference at all to the kyoto process or the voluntary initiatives on emissions and alternative energy that he has launched bilaterally and regionally . he did refer to global climate change , though , as a " serious challenge " that these technologies would help to confront . " bush out of step " some of corporate america 's industrial giants , including alcoa , general electric and dupont , this week called for mandatory caps on businesses ' greenhouse gas emissions , and trading of emissions permits . some observers said bush was out of kilter with domestic demands for action on climate change . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush 's plans for iraq found few takers in germany " he 's clearly out of step with where the american public and us congress are right now on climate change , which is ready to go much further than continuing technology initiatives , " jennifer morgan , a europe-based consultant on climate change and former spokesman with the green group wwf , told afp . european leaders however were less enthusiastic about bush 's plans for iraq in his address which involve sending 20,000 more american troops to the violence-racked country . both voigt and trittin criticized the plans , saying they could not detect any coherent political strategy . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de global warming bubbles to the surface in davos an exceptionally mild first half of winter in the swiss alps is helping to fuel growing concern about climate change at the annual meeting of the world economic forum , beginning on wednesday in davos .

"
but environmentalists in europe say his measures do n't go far enough . german leaders on wednesday reacted positively to us president george w. bush 's annual state of the union speech in which he called climate change a " serious issue " and urged americans to cut their gasoline consumption by 20 percent over a decade , mostly through a nearly five-fold increase in use of home-grown fuels such as ethanol . bush also pushed for tighter vehicle fuel efficiency standards . " a positive sign " " the fact that the american president acknowledges climate change as a problem is definitely a positive sign , " karsten voigt , the government 's coordinator of transatlantic relations told spiegel online . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush said climate change was a " serious challenge " voigt said bush had realized that saving energy was not just important on the political level , but also for security reasons . former german environment minister , jürgen trittin told german radio that bush had realized that oil-dependency massively undermined his leveraging power .
bush 's speech , said trittin , could " improve transatlantic cooperation in the fight against climate change . " bärbel höhn , deputy leader of the green group in parliament urged the german government to set similar ambitious goals on renewable energy like the american president did in his address . " we have to be careful that we do n't squander our leadership and technological edge in renewable energy , " höhn said . " moving in the right direction " sir nicholas stern , chief economic adviser to the british government and author of a report in 2006 that warned of the mounting costs of climate change , said bush 's speech was " a movement in the right direction . " " there is a recognition of the link between climate change and human activity , " he told reporters at the world economic forum in davos , switzerland . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush 's comments made for much debate in davos " you have to recognise what everyone is doing .
the united states is doing a lot on technology , a lot on standards .
but then of course we have to scale up our action . " the executive secretary of the un framework convention on climate change -lrb- unfccc -rrb- , yvo de boer , said bush 's speech marked a shift towards a more sustainable form of energy and noted his choice of words about climate change . " he did not talk in his state of the union address about international cooperation on climate change .
but at the same time , he did put his remarks in the context of the need for global response , " de boer told reporters in tokyo .
" that i think is very encouraging . " green groups say too little too late but environmentalists and green groups in europe were less impressed with the president 's address and said his measures did n't go far enough . jan kowalzig at friends of the earth europe told news agency afp that biofuel and fuel-efficiency initiatives were " worthwhile measures " but did not tackle the critical problem posed by us emissions of greenhouse gases . bush declined in his annual address to support mandatory caps on heat-trapping carbon gases that big us companies such as general electric co. have pushed for . only a mandatory cap on these emissions could drive down this pollution , said kowalzig .
he added that biofuels could in fact worsen the greenhouse-gas problem . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush does n't support mandatory carbon caps " in theory , they only produce as many greenhouse gas emissions as they suck up when growing , so they would be carbon neutral , " kowalzig said .
" in practice , in most places , they are not , because transportation of the fuels , processing of the fuels , all that requires energy which is currently driven by a fossil-fuel economy , " he said .
" so all these biofuels projects currently add to the greenhouse-gas effect .

" bush out of step " some of corporate america 's industrial giants , including alcoa , general electric and dupont , this week called for mandatory caps on businesses ' greenhouse gas emissions , and trading of emissions permits . some observers said bush was out of kilter with domestic demands for action on climate change . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush 's plans for iraq found few takers in germany " he 's clearly out of step with where the american public and us congress are right now on climate change , which is ready to go much further than continuing technology initiatives , " jennifer morgan , a europe-based consultant on climate change and former spokesman with the green group wwf , told afp . european leaders however were less enthusiastic about bush 's plans for iraq in his address which involve sending 20,000 more american troops to the violence-racked country . both voigt and trittin criticized the plans , saying they could not detect any coherent political strategy . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de global warming bubbles to the surface in davos an exceptionally mild first half of winter in the swiss alps is helping to fuel growing concern about climate change at the annual meeting of the world economic forum , beginning on wednesday in davos .

the nation 's family minister said she would like customers of women forced into the profession to be prosecuted . family minister ursula von der leyen said that there are still too many illegal prostitutes in germany and that it is still too hard for many of the woman in the field to leave , even if they want to . referring to a report on prostitution commissioned by the federal cabinet , von der leyen told reporters at a press conference on wednesday that the attempt to improve that lives of prostitutes by giving them access to healthcare , social security and pensions in a groundbreaking 2002 law still did not do enough for large numbers of sex workers in germany . " the possibilities in practice are almost never used , " she said , and announced new measures aimed at protecting women forced into sex work and underage prostitutes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : family minister ursula von der leyen " the prostitution law has only reached part of its goal , " she said , adding that health and hygiene conditions of most prostitutes have not improved since the law 's passage .
there are an estimated 400,000 registered prostitutes in germany . but von der leyen , a member of angela merkel 's conservative christian democratic party , said she was not aiming at turning back and clock and making prostitution illegal again , but wanted to offer sex workers viable ways out of the profession . " we want to rigorously go after the criminal element surrounding prostitution , " she said .
" that includes punishing customers of forced prostitutes , raising the minimal age and much stricter controls over brothels , with the message that prostitution is not just a job like any other . " the final goal must be to encourage prostitutes to get out of the field , she said . ignorance no excuse chancellor merkel 's grand coalition government is now drafting new legislation that would raise the legal age for prostitution from 16 to 18 and would plug a legal loophole that allows clients of women forced into prostitution to escape prosecution by pleading ignorance of their situation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are some 400,000 registered prostitites in germany " if the prostitute speaks no german and has bruises on her body then the client has to assume this is forced prostitution , " von der leyen said .
" he can no longer say : ' i did n't notice ' . " more than half of the prostitutes in germany are thought to be here illegally , many from eastern europe , and because most have no legal papers , leaving the profession or the men who control their lives , is next to impossible . however , the family minister offered no details on how such measures would be enforced . her proposals will have to be approved by the german cabinet and then approved by the parliament before becoming law . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a job like none other : being a prostitute in germany morning , noon and night - the demand for prostitutes is huge .

berlin allegedly rejected that , and a special committee of the european parliament says there 's enough proof to back the allegation . this alone would be a scandal that can not be covered up by claiming that kurnaz has turkish and not german citizenship and placing the blame on ankara instead of berlin .
a visit by german secret agents to kurnaz in guantanamo completes the picture . let 's be clear about this : barely 20 years of age , kurnaz was captured by the americans in pakistan .
he was possibly naive , but certainly not a terror suspect .
in january 2002 , he ended up at guantanamo , he was abused , but even the americans were eventually convinced of his innocence and wanted to send him back to germany .
berlin rejected the offer .
what 's more : the german authorities did n't merely not work towards his release , rather they boycotted it .
the man was n't able to leave the camp until 2006 . political responsibility for the germans ' behavior lies with a group of state secretaries and intelligence agency heads , who regularly discussed the security situation under the leadership of the chancellery 's chief-of-staff .
at the time in question , the latter position was occupied by frank-walter steinmeier , the current foreign minister .
he 'll have quite a bit of explaining to do to a parliamentary committee which is investigating the case .
it 's certain that steinmeier will have to resign if he can not offer any new information to make berlin 's behavior plausible . his resignation would obviously not explain why berlin behaved the way it did .
foreign policy considerations may have played a role .
the german-american relationship was already tense because of germany 's " no " to the war in iraq .
it might have made sense not to put additional strain on ties with the us - whether by insisting in the case of guantanamo or by the released prisoner one day possibly making public accusations .
be that as it may ; it 's certainly not in line with a foreign policy oriented toward human rights which the social democratic-green party government had claimed to pursue . heinz dylong is an editor at dw-radio -lrb- win -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu report slams members for involvement in secret cia affair european union lawmakers have approved a report which lashes out at eu countries for tolerating or assisting the united states ' practice of secret detentions of terrorist suspects .

the nation 's family minister said she would like customers of women forced into the profession to be prosecuted . family minister ursula von der leyen said that there are still too many illegal prostitutes in germany and that it is still too hard for many of the woman in the field to leave , even if they want to . referring to a report on prostitution commissioned by the federal cabinet , von der leyen told reporters at a press conference on wednesday that the attempt to improve that lives of prostitutes by giving them access to healthcare , social security and pensions in a groundbreaking 2002 law still did not do enough for large numbers of sex workers in germany . " the possibilities in practice are almost never used , " she said , and announced new measures aimed at protecting women forced into sex work and underage prostitutes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : family minister ursula von der leyen " the prostitution law has only reached part of its goal , " she said , adding that health and hygiene conditions of most prostitutes have not improved since the law 's passage .
there are an estimated 400,000 registered prostitutes in germany . but von der leyen , a member of angela merkel 's conservative christian democratic party , said she was not aiming at turning back and clock and making prostitution illegal again , but wanted to offer sex workers viable ways out of the profession . " we want to rigorously go after the criminal element surrounding prostitution , " she said .
" that includes punishing customers of forced prostitutes , raising the minimal age and much stricter controls over brothels , with the message that prostitution is not just a job like any other . " the final goal must be to encourage prostitutes to get out of the field , she said . ignorance no excuse chancellor merkel 's grand coalition government is now drafting new legislation that would raise the legal age for prostitution from 16 to 18 and would plug a legal loophole that allows clients of women forced into prostitution to escape prosecution by pleading ignorance of their situation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are some 400,000 registered prostitites in germany " if the prostitute speaks no german and has bruises on her body then the client has to assume this is forced prostitution , " von der leyen said .
" he can no longer say : ' i did n't notice ' . " more than half of the prostitutes in germany are thought to be here illegally , many from eastern europe , and because most have no legal papers , leaving the profession or the men who control their lives , is next to impossible . however , the family minister offered no details on how such measures would be enforced . her proposals will have to be approved by the german cabinet and then approved by the parliament before becoming law . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : a job like none other : being a prostitute in germany morning , noon and night - the demand for prostitutes is huge .

" we believe it will take two years at most for china to overtake the us , " an official at the china internet network information center told state media .
china had 137m internet users by the end of 2006 , an increase of 23 % from the year before , the centre reported .
this figure means that more than 10 % of the population is now online .
about 210 million of america 's 300 million people now use the internet , according to us government figures .
china will only surpass this number if it keeps up a 24 % annual growth rate in the next two years .
the china daily admitted that the two-year estimate for overtaking the us was " bullish " , citing a recent research report by jp morgan which forecast that china 's internet population would reach 190 million by 2010 .
but wang enhai , a spokesman for the internet centre , told the newspaper : " the growth is now gaining much momentum .
we are expecting even faster growth in 2007 and 2008 . "
' array of opportunities ' the chinese government encourages people to go online for education or business purposes .
the rapid rise in internet use has boosted the country 's online commerce , advertising and games industries .
with 10 % of the population - and more than 30 % of people in beijing - now online , the internet will create a " vast array of opportunities " for business , according to the china daily .
but china has also been criticised for censoring items on the internet which it deems subversive or offensive .
several people have been jailed in recent years for producing such information .
but the chinese government insists its regulation of the internet is in line with the rest of the world .

the five-day talking shop in the swiss alps brings together business leaders , politicians and campaigners , among them bill gates , tony blair and bono .
more than 30 trade ministers will meet on the sidelines in the hope of reviving stalled global trade talks .
davos attracts 2,400 participants from 90 countries .
they will discuss the geopolitical changes that have resulted in an " increasingly schizophrenic world " that is " harder and harder to understand " , said the forum 's founder professor klaus schwab .
have your say " the principal dilemma of the world is how to stop the processes of impoverishment " john stewart , nairobi send us your comments participants can expect a daily reminder of what global warming could mean : usually the davos valley is buried under a metre or two of snow at this time of year , but until tuesday the mild winter left the hills mostly green .
overnight there has been some snow , but it compares poorly to the huge amount of snow that participants have come to expect .
big politics , big business many of the forum 's key events will focus on big politics , like the war in iraq and the fight against terrorism .
german chancellor angela merkel , who is currently holding both the chair of the g8 group of top industrialised nations and the presidency of the european union , is expected to outline her international agenda .
most of the sessions , however , cater to the needs of company bosses , who will tackle topics like activist investment funds , the recent commodities boom and the rise of new internet technologies .
among the business leaders at this year 's world economic forum will be the bosses of more than 70 of the world 's 100 largest companies .
they will be joined by technology pioneers , social entrepreneurs running not-for-profit companies , and campaigners from organisations like greenpeace , oxfam and islamic relief .
dimmed star power this year 's davos will suffer from a distinct lack of showbiz glamour .
at the past two davos events , participants and photographers clustered around mega stars like angelina jolie , brad pitt , michael douglas and sharon stone .
this time the forum is kept more low key .
supermodel claudia schiffer and rock star and anti-poverty campaigner bono are two of the few stars sharing the limelight .
instead , the forum is trying to find new digital fans , with professor schwab due to make an appearance in the virtual online world second life .
davos is also trying to open up to the general public , not only encouraging participants to blog , but also inviting people around the world to quiz world leaders by sending a question via webcam to the forum .
tight security that , however , is probably the closest that the public will get to the movers and shakers in davos .
as always , security is tight , with thousands of police and soldiers guarding the remote mountain valley .
the swiss air force is already enforcing a no-fly zone .
because of the tight controls on access to davos , there have been few demonstrations by anti-globalisation protestors in the mountain resort itself .
however , critics of the forum have called for " creative and direct action " across switzerland on saturday , 27 january .
lack of faith the official theme of the davos event is " the shifting power equation " , and the forum 's agenda suggests that this is happening across all aspects of our life .
globalisation is changing our economies ; terrorism , wars , oil politics and the rise of asia are shifting geopolitics ; technology - and especially the internet - is transforming societies in east and west , north and south ; and companies need to understand how to run their business and engage consumers in the connected world .
all that change creates uncertainties , the organisers say , and is reflected in the results of a survey commissioned by the world economic forum .
around the world people are losing faith in their leaders .
politicians are the least trusted leaders , with business leaders everywhere getting better marks from the 55,000 people surveyed in 60 countries .
still , 40 % of those surveyed believe that the next generation will be better off , while just 31 % believe their children will be in a worse position .

here is the full text : dear prime minister , the church of england , along with others in the voluntary sector , including other churches and faith communities , have been in discussion with the government for some time over what has become known as the sexual orientation regulations .
those discussions have been conducted in good faith , in mutual respect and with an appropriate level of confidence on all sides .
last week that changed .
speculation about splits within government , fuelled by public comment from government ministers , appears to have created an atmosphere that threatens to polarise opinions .
this does no justice to any of those whose interests are at stake , not least vulnerable children whose life chances could be adversely , and possibly irrevocably , affected by the overriding of reasoned discussion and proper negotiation in an atmosphere of mistrust and political expediency .
the one thing on which all seem able to agree is that these are serious matters requiring the most careful consideration .
there is a great deal to gain .
it is becoming increasingly evident , however , that much could also be lost , as the letter from cardinal cormac murphy o 'connor makes clear .
many in the voluntary sector are dedicated to public service because of the dictates of their conscience .
in legislating to protect and promote the rights of particular groups the government is faced with the delicate but important challenge of not thereby creating the conditions within which others feel their rights to have been ignored or sacrificed , or in which the dictates of personal conscience are put at risk .
the rights of conscience can not be made subject to legislation , however well meaning .
on numerous occasions in the past proper consideration has been given to the requirements of consciences alongside other considerations contributing to the common good , such as social need or human rights - the right , for example , of some doctors not to perform abortions , even though employed by the national health service .
it would be deeply regrettable if in seeking , quite properly , better to defend the rights of a particular group not to be discriminated against , a climate were to be created in which , for example , some feel free to argue that members of the government are not fit to hold public office on the grounds of their faith affiliation .
this is hardly evidence of a balanced and reasonable public debate .
as you approach the final phase of what has , until very recently , been a careful and respectful consideration of the best way in which to introduce and administer new protection from discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation in england and wales , we hope you , and cabinet colleagues , will do justice to the interests of the much wider grouping of interests within the nation that will be affected .
it is vitally important that the interests of vulnerable children are not relegated to suit any political interest .
and that conditions are not inadvertently created which make the claims of conscience an obstacle to , rather than the inspiration for , the invaluable public service rendered by parts of the voluntary sector .

here is the full text : " dear prime minister , the church of england , along with others in the voluntary sector , including other churches and faith communities , have been in discussion with the government for some time over what has become known as the sexual orientation regulations .
those discussions have been conducted in good faith , in mutual respect and with an appropriate level of confidence on all sides .
last week that changed .
speculation about splits within government , fuelled by public comment from government ministers , appears to have created an atmosphere that threatens to polarise opinions .
this does no justice to any of those whose interests are at stake , not least vulnerable children whose life chances could be adversely , and possibly irrevocably , affected by the overriding of reasoned discussion and proper negotiation in an atmosphere of mistrust and political expediency .
the one thing on which all seem able to agree is that these are serious matters requiring the most careful consideration .
there is a great deal to gain .
it is becoming increasingly evident , however , that much could also be lost , as the letter from cardinal cormac murphy o 'connor makes clear .
many in the voluntary sector are dedicated to public service because of the dictates of their conscience .
in legislating to protect and promote the rights of particular groups the government is faced with the delicate but important challenge of not thereby creating the conditions within which others feel their rights to have been ignored or sacrificed , or in which the dictates of personal conscience are put at risk .
the rights of conscience can not be made subject to legislation , however well meaning .
on numerous occasions in the past proper consideration has been given to the requirements of consciences alongside other considerations contributing to the common good , such as social need or human rights - the right , for example , of some doctors not to perform abortions , even though employed by the national health service .
it would be deeply regrettable if in seeking , quite properly , better to defend the rights of a particular group not to be discriminated against , a climate were to be created in which , for example , some feel free to argue that members of the government are not fit to hold public office on the grounds of their faith affiliation .
this is hardly evidence of a balanced and reasonable public debate .

it is vitally important that the interests of vulnerable children are not relegated to suit any political interest .
and that conditions are not inadvertently created which make the claims of conscience an obstacle to , rather than the inspiration for , the invaluable public service rendered by parts of the voluntary sector .

hilton , who was not in court in los angeles , was also ordered to attend an alcohol education programme .
the socialite and singer , 25 , was stopped in her car last september .
police said her blood-alcohol level was 0.08 % , the minimum to warrant arrest .
" she 's happy that the matter is over , " her spokesman said after the hearing .
shortly after her arrest , hilton told a radio interviewer she had drunk a single margarita cocktail at a charity event that evening .
speeding she denied driving recklessly but conceded : " maybe i was speeding a little bit . "
she was on her way to get a hamburger because she had been filming a music video all day without eating , she added .
the original charge of driving under the influence of alcohol was dropped to alcohol-related reckless driving .
under californian law , hilton 's plea of no contest is not an admission of guilt but is the equivalent of a guilty plea when determining sentencing .
" we felt that this deal was appropriate given the circumstances and we 're satisfied with the outcome , " los angeles city attorney 's spokesman frank mateljan said .
the terms of hilton 's probation say she must not drive with any measurable amount of alcohol in her system and can not refuse alcohol tests .
the alcohol education programme involves attending a dozen classes .

professor ted cowan said he spoke for all his staff in calling for the university 's presence in the town to be saved in the face of a funding crisis .
he has compiled a detailed defence stressing its educational and economic importance to dumfries and galloway .
the university has said it could quit the campus due to heavy annual losses .
it has appealed for extra funding as the crichton operation is reported to be losing £ 800,000 a year .
unless the scottish funding council comes up with more cash , the university has said it could start a phased withdrawal from dumfries .
prof cowan has written to a range of groups across dumfries and galloway urging them to protest to the university principal and the funding council .
economic contribution he said the university had 49 staff , contributing £ 2.5m to the local economy .
he added that it had helped to stem rural depopulation by retaining young people who previously would have moved away .
paisley university and bell college share the crichton campus with glasgow , but prof cowan said they were complementary establishments .
he argued they would not be able to match the range and excellence of the university of glasgow 's core courses , nor the exceptional academic qualifications of its staff .
the sfc is due to meet with glasgow university later this week to discuss the funding situation .

professor ted cowan said he spoke for all his staff in calling for the university 's presence in the town to be saved in the face of a funding crisis .
he has compiled a detailed defence stressing its educational and economic importance to dumfries and galloway .
the university has said it could quit the campus due to heavy annual losses .
it has appealed for extra funding as the crichton operation is reported to be losing £ 800,000 a year .
unless the scottish funding council comes up with more cash , the university has said it could start a phased withdrawal from dumfries .
prof cowan has written to a range of groups across dumfries and galloway urging them to protest to the university principal and the funding council .
economic contribution he said the university had 49 staff , contributing £ 2.5m to the local economy .
he added that it had helped to stem rural depopulation by retaining young people who previously would have moved away .
paisley university and bell college share the crichton campus with glasgow , but prof cowan said they were complementary establishments .
he argued they would not be able to match the range and excellence of the university of glasgow 's core courses , nor the exceptional academic qualifications of its staff .

charities cancerbackup and bowel cancer uk appealed against a decision by the health watchdog to reject the drug erbitux -lrb- cetuximab -rrb- for use on the nhs .
the national institute for health and clinical excellence -lrb- nice -rrb- ruled last august that erbitux was not cost-effective .
and it upheld its decision after considering the appeal .
a separate appeal by manufacturer merck , which helps fund both the charities , also failed . "
the current system lacks transparency and needs an overhaul " professor alex markham , cancer research uk bowel cancer is the third most common cancer in the uk , with 35,000 people newly-diagnosed every year .
around 16,000 people die from it every year and more than half of new cases reach the advanced stage , which erbitux is designed to treat .
the drug , which costs around £ 700 a week , has been shown to shrink tumours allowing the possibility of surgery , but is not a cure .
announcing the decision , peter littlejohns , clinical and public health director , said the committee which made the decision was aware that bowel cancer was an aggressive disease and that treatment options were limited .
but he said it had to balance the additional therapeutic benefit offered by new treatments against their cost .
" the assessment of the evidence shows that neither of these drugs represents a good use of nhs resources . "
overhaul needed campaigners branded the nice decision ironic , given that british scientists led the way in erbitux clinical trials .
ian beaumont , from bowel cancer uk , said : " this decision demonstrates nice 's continued indifference to people living with advanced bowel cancer .
" no one should be in any doubt that the basis for it is financial and bears no relation to the efficacy of the drug , which is well proven .
" erbitux offers hope to patients when other treatments have failed and nice is taking away that hope .
" whilst we are naturally disappointed , we will continue to campaign for this and other valuable treatments , which enable many thousands of people with bowel cancer to live longer and have an improved quality of life . "
professor alex markham , chief executive of cancer research uk , said the decision was " extremely worrying " .
" we do n't understand the cost framework used by nice to come to this decision and we feel there needs to be a public debate on how much the nhs ought to be spending on any individual cancer patient .
" the current system lacks transparency and needs an overhaul .
" as well as a lack of clarity about what the nhs thinks a single life is worth , we need a debate about how drug companies agree their pricing with the department of health . "
professor markham said the uk was one of the slowest countries in europe to adopt new medicines through the nhs .
" cetuximab has been available to us cancer patients for three years and it is unacceptable that uk cancer patients have had to wait this long for a disappointing decision that they wo n't understand . "
" cancer research uk is committed to making new treatments available and therefore is conducting further research which we hope will ensure that treatments like this are available to uk patients in the future . "

charities cancerbackup and bowel cancer uk appealed against a decision by the health watchdog to reject the drug erbitux -lrb- cetuximab -rrb- for use on the nhs .
the national institute for health and clinical excellence -lrb- nice -rrb- ruled last august that erbitux was not cost-effective .
and it upheld its decision after considering the appeal .
a separate appeal by manufacturer merck , which helps fund both the charities , also failed .
the current system lacks transparency and needs an overhaul professor alex markham , cancer research uk bowel cancer is the third most common cancer in the uk , with 35,000 people newly-diagnosed every year .
around 16,000 people die from it every year and more than half of new cases reach the advanced stage , which erbitux is designed to treat .
the drug , which costs around £ 700 a week , has been shown to shrink tumours allowing the possibility of surgery , but is not a cure .
announcing the decision , peter littlejohns , clinical and public health director , said the committee which made the decision was aware that bowel cancer was an aggressive disease and that treatment options were limited .
but he said it had to balance the additional therapeutic benefit offered by new treatments against their cost .
" the assessment of the evidence shows that neither of these drugs represents a good use of nhs resources . "
overhaul needed campaigners branded the nice decision ironic , given that british scientists led the way in erbitux clinical trials .
ian beaumont , from bowel cancer uk , said : " this decision demonstrates nice 's continued indifference to people living with advanced bowel cancer .
" no one should be in any doubt that the basis for it is financial and bears no relation to the efficacy of the drug , which is well proven .
" erbitux offers hope to patients when other treatments have failed and nice is taking away that hope .

here is what some of the key nominees had to say about their selection . "
it is one of the hardest roles to play , not just a living person but one who is part of our everyday lives in britain .
i hope that my performance has conveyed a sense of elizabeth the woman as well as the queen . "
dame helen mirren , best actress nominee for the queen . "
i 'm in frighteningly good company .
it is very nice of the queen to allow me in for a minute . "
dame judi dench , best actress nominee for notes on a scandal . "
without a doubt , receiving this nomination will stand out as one of the highlights of my career . "
eddie murphy , supporting actor nominee for dreamgirls . "
i 'm amazed and thrilled and flattered .
this is a tremendous honour for the film but panic sets in now because you think : ' oh , my god .
this is where the chaos is about to start ' . "
stephen frears , best director nominee for the queen . "
i am going to be screaming and whooping all day long .
i really thought i was n't going to get a nomination .
i am really going to try to enjoy this moment .
i 'm speechless . "
kate winslet , best actress nominee for little children " they said my name and it 's like for a few seconds everything stopped .
i was a little bit overwhelmed and confused .
i was n't sure what was going on . "
penelope cruz , best actress nominee for volver " i could n't be happier , i could n't be happier - this is a movie i am very , very proud of . "
leonardo dicaprio , best actor nominee for blood diamond " i think it is a celebration of the world cinematic community , and not only mexican film-making - though there are eight mexicans nominated and babel has six nominations .
that i am the first mexican director nominated fills me with pride . "
alejandro gonzalez inarritu , best director nominee for babel " the film has brought awareness of the climate crisis to people in the united states and all over the world .
i am so grateful to the entire team and pleased that the academy has recognised their work .
this film proves that movies really can make a difference . "
al gore , whose an inconvenient truth is shortlisted for best longform documentary " it 's obviously very thrilling , not just on a personal level but on a professional level .
what 's really wonderful about it is to be part of a film that dealt with these difficult events , and that cinema that deals with the contentious and difficult can have its place at the oscar nominations . "
paul greengrass , best director nominee for united 93 " i think the academy responded to the movie on an emotional level . "
jon kilik , a producer of best picture nominee babel . "
we knew that we had something good when the ugandans that were on the crew were all saying it felt like idi amin was speaking and i think that 's part of the reason that we approached forest whitaker for the role .
you know , he learnt swahili , he was in character the whole time .
but he was quite tough to be with some of the time . "
andrea calderwood , producer of the last king of scotland - which earned forest whitaker a best actor nomination . "
if each one of them got nominated on their own , that would be great , but the fact that they all did - that 's just too much for one little girl this early in the morning " shortlist presenter salma hayek on a raft of nominations for hispanic actors and spanish-language films . "
i was obviously rooting for the film and to be included in that is very exciting . "
stephen mirrione , editing nominee for babel . "
you know , if there are prestigious awards given to the film it increases the chances it will be seen by people .
and so i guess that 's not a bad thing . "
james longley , director of best documentary nominee iraq in fragments . "
any time someone says you have an opportunity to work with martin scorsese you jump at the chance . "
mark wahlberg , supporting actor nominee for the departed . "

they say they are " disturbed " that the projected cost of hosting the games has risen £ 900m since the bid was made .
in a report , the culture , media and sport committee said it was surprised £ 400m extra was needed for a " delivery partner to exercise cost control " .
the government said much of the cost was to ensure a good legacy for london .
' not thought out ' the original bid had not included the costs of vat , a " programme contingency " or inflation , the committee reported .
costs were still rising and any extra should be met by the treasury , not londoners or the national lottery , the mps said .
doubts about final costs must be resolved if public confidence in the project is to be maintained john whittingdale committee chairman games ' greenest ever ' they voiced concern that a recent ban on advertising some food on television could mean a dip in sponsorship money .
" we can only conclude that cost-control procedures were not fully thought through at the time the bid was submitted , " the report said .
" the committee is concerned about the distance between the figures submitted in the bid and the true costs , which will not become evident until after the games . "
' unacceptable burden ' the committee 's chairman , conservative mp john whittingdale , said grassroots sport would lose out if the lottery had to contribute any more money .
he added : " we remain convinced that london can and will host a games as good as any ever seen before .
" but doubts about final costs must be resolved if public confidence in the project is to be maintained . "
in november , culture secretary tessa jowell said the cost of the olympic park had risen from £ 2.4bn to £ 3.3bn.
she said it was due to inflation and the decision to spend £ 400m on " delivery partner " clm , which will aim to make sure the games come in on budget and on time .
but the committee 's report said the government 's " apparent intention " that the extra money be met from the lottery and london 's council tax payers was " placing an unacceptable burden on both " .
' short space of time ' instead the treasury should help by foregoing the tax payable on olympics proceeds , while the london development agency should pay more from profits from land sales , it said .
the report pointed out that ms jowell had said in october that rigorous attention was being paid to costs , but by november the extra £ 900m had been identified .
" the committee is disturbed that such statements have been disproved in such a relatively short space of time , " said the report .
the original £ 1.5bn budget for staging the games had not taken inflation into account , but this had not been " clearly stated " in the bid .
mps said the rationale for a " programme contingency " , not mentioned in the bid and which could reach £ 2bn , had to be " thoroughly explained " .
vat was not included in the original bid , apparently on the assumption that the olympic delivery authority would be exempt , but has since been estimated at £ 250m or more .
mps welcomed assurances that the taxpayer would not be liable but criticised the treasury for not establishing the position from the start .

' short space of time ' instead the treasury should help by foregoing the tax payable on olympics proceeds , while the london development agency should pay more from profits from land sales , it said .
the report pointed out that ms jowell had said in october that rigorous attention was being paid to costs , but by november the extra £ 900m had been identified .
" the committee is disturbed that such statements have been disproved in such a relatively short space of time , " said the report .
the original £ 1.5bn budget for staging the games had not taken inflation into account , but this had not been " clearly stated " in the bid .
mps said the rationale for a " programme contingency " , not mentioned in the bid and which could reach £ 2bn , had to be " thoroughly explained " .
vat was not included in the original bid , apparently on the assumption that the olympic delivery authority would be exempt , but has since been estimated at £ 250m or more .
mps welcomed assurances that the taxpayer would not be liable but criticised the treasury for not establishing the position from the start .
a department for culture , media and sport spokesman said : " we are applying rigorous financial controls to ensure that every pound we spend is well-spent .
" some costs have risen , but that is principally because of the importance of ensuring a long-term legacy from 2012 . "

they say they are " disturbed " that the projected cost of hosting the games has risen £ 900m since the bid was made .
in a report , the culture , media and sport committee said it was surprised £ 400m extra was needed for a " delivery partner to exercise cost control " .
the government said much of the cost was to ensure a good legacy for london .
' not thought out ' the original bid had not included the costs of vat , a " programme contingency " or inflation , the committee reported .
costs were still rising and any extra should be met by the treasury , not londoners or the national lottery , the mps said .
doubts about final costs must be resolved if public confidence in the project is to be maintained john whittingdale committee chairman games ' greenest ever ' they voiced concern that a recent ban on advertising some food on television could mean a dip in sponsorship money .
" we can only conclude that cost-control procedures were not fully thought through at the time the bid was submitted , " the report said .
" the committee is concerned about the distance between the figures submitted in the bid and the true costs , which will not become evident until after the games . "
' unacceptable burden ' the committee 's chairman , conservative mp john whittingdale , said grassroots sport would lose out if the lottery had to contribute any more money .
he added : " we remain convinced that london can and will host a games as good as any ever seen before .
" but doubts about final costs must be resolved if public confidence in the project is to be maintained . "
in november , culture secretary tessa jowell said the cost of the olympic park had risen from £ 2.4bn to £ 3.3bn.
she said it was due to inflation and the decision to spend £ 400m on " delivery partner " clm , which will aim to make sure the games come in on budget and on time .
but the committee 's report said the government 's " apparent intention " that the extra money be met from the lottery and london 's council tax payers was " placing an unacceptable burden on both " .

they say they are " disturbed " that the projected cost of hosting the games has risen £ 900m since the bid was made .
in a report , the culture , media and sport committee said it was surprised £ 400m extra was needed for a " delivery partner to exercise cost control " .
the government said much of the cost was to ensure a good legacy for london .
' not thought out ' the original bid had not included the costs of vat , a " programme contingency " or inflation , the committee reported .
costs were still rising and any extra should be met by the treasury , not londoners or the national lottery , the mps said . "
doubts about final costs must be resolved if public confidence in the project is to be maintained " john whittingdale committee chairman games ' greenest ever ' they voiced concern that a recent ban on advertising some food on television could mean a dip in sponsorship money .
" we can only conclude that cost-control procedures were not fully thought through at the time the bid was submitted , " the report said .
" the committee is concerned about the distance between the figures submitted in the bid and the true costs , which will not become evident until after the games . "
' unacceptable burden ' the committee 's chairman , conservative mp john whittingdale , said grassroots sport would lose out if the lottery had to contribute any more money .
he added : " we remain convinced that london can and will host a games as good as any ever seen before .
" but doubts about final costs must be resolved if public confidence in the project is to be maintained . "
in november , culture secretary tessa jowell said the cost of the olympic park had risen from £ 2.4bn to £ 3.3bn.
she said it was due to inflation and the decision to spend £ 400m on " delivery partner " clm , which will aim to make sure the games come in on budget and on time .
but the committee 's report said the government 's " apparent intention " that the extra money be met from the lottery and london 's council tax payers was " placing an unacceptable burden on both " .
' short space of time ' instead the treasury should help by foregoing the tax payable on olympics proceeds , while the london development agency should pay more from profits from land sales , it said .
the report pointed out that ms jowell had said in october that rigorous attention was being paid to costs , but by november the extra £ 900m had been identified .
" the committee is disturbed that such statements have been disproved in such a relatively short space of time , " said the report .
the original £ 1.5bn budget for staging the games had not taken inflation into account , but this had not been " clearly stated " in the bid .
mps said the rationale for a " programme contingency " , not mentioned in the bid and which could reach £ 2bn , had to be " thoroughly explained " .
vat was not included in the original bid , apparently on the assumption that the olympic delivery authority would be exempt , but has since been estimated at £ 250m or more .
mps welcomed assurances that the taxpayer would not be liable but criticised the treasury for not establishing the position from the start .
a department for culture , media and sport spokesman said : " we are applying rigorous financial controls to ensure that every pound we spend is well-spent .
" some costs have risen , but that is principally because of the importance of ensuring a long-term legacy from 2012 . "

ocean housing said 5,000 people are currently registered on its lists , but it can only build 150 new homes a year .
it said problems included shortages of building space , developers buying land and potential neighbours ' " nimbyism " .
cornwall county council said that the issue of affordable housing was a critical problem .
space shortages ocean housing said waiting lists were growing so fast only the most desperate cases can expect a property .
managing director chris blackbeard said the organisation had 200 vacancies in 2005 .
" if we 're only homing 200 a year , then it could take us up to 20 years to clear a list of 5,000 , " he added .
the association said problems included potential neighbours ' objecting to social housing built close to them when plans were published .
but competition for development land is also a major issue .
mr blackbeard said : " we 're a non-profit-making organisation , and we 're competing against private developers who are looking to build home for the private sector and can afford to pay more than we can . "
cornwall county council said providing enough affordable housing was a problem that had come about over several decades and there was no easy solution .
it believes new developments should include a mix of house types and tenure that meets the needs of the community .

estyn 's annual report found only 40 % of 16-year-olds had gained good gcses in english or welsh , maths and science .
however , chief inspector susan lewis praised the standard of lessons .
but she also said every day about 20,000 children were missing from secondary school - the equivalent of 20 schools across wales being empty .
ms lewis , who launched estyn 's annual report on a visit to barry in the vale of glamorgan , was concerned about progress in core subjects for teenagers .
she said : " by the end of their time in compulsory education only about 40 % of 16 year olds have gained good gcse or equivalent qualifications in welsh or english , mathematics and science .
" during recent years , these results have improved only slowly . "
" local authorities are failing to give pupils who are permanently excluded from school the full 25 hours a week of education " susan lewis , chief inspector of schools the report said underachievement was often accompanied by problems with attendance , bullying and anti-social behaviour .
many schools , it says , were working more closely with youth support services , other providers , parents and communities to try to overcome these problems .
the report also highlights the continuing problems surrounding school attendance .
every day around 20,000 children are missing from secondary schools .
some were absent because their parents were taking them on term time holidays , but the majority were playing truant .
' sound foundation ' " on recent performance , secondary schools are unlikely to meet the welsh assembly government target to reduce absenteeism to below 7 % by 2007 , " said ms lewis .
the number of pupils being excluded from school is rising .
the most recent figures show 20,242 pupils were excluded for fixed periods - compared with 16,530 in 2003-4 .
while from 2004-05 the number of permanent exclusions from mainstream schools have increased by just over 10 % .
estyn said only one in seven permanently excluded pupils move to other schools .
special pupil referral units provide education for 10 per cent of excluded children . "
we remain on track to realise our ambition that wales will be a country where everyone has the opportunity to learn and prosper " jane davidson , education minister " local authorities are failing to give pupils who are permanently excluded from school the full 25 hours a week of education , " the report says .
but there was praise for the standard of lessons , with 73 % of lessons for pupils of all ages inspected by estyn being given two grades .
the report says there was very little unsatisfactory work , describing the position as a " sound foundation for the welsh assembly government 's targets on standards . "
further education colleges inspected for this year 's report also met assembly government targets , with 81 % of work described as " good " or " very good " .
standards in subjects including hair and beauty , hospitality and catering , leisure , travel and tourism were among those described as " outstanding . "
more than three quarters of lessons had what were described as " good " or " outstanding " features .
ms lewis said " overall colleges are doing better than the welsh assembly government 's targets for learner achievement and for the quality of the teaching " .
' revolution ' but there were still serious concerns about work-based training .
nearly half of training providers still had unsatisfactory standards this year compared with 28 % last year .
commenting on the report , education minister jane davidson said it provided an overview of the progress made in just about every area of education and training .
" i was pleased with her conclusion that providers in most sectors have improved a great deal since they were last inspected , " she said .
" we have begun a revolution in education and lifelong learning in wales .
this report confirms that we remain on track to realise our ambition that wales will be a country where everyone has the opportunity to learn and prosper . "

local authorities are failing to give pupils who are permanently excluded from school the full 25 hours a week of education susan lewis , chief inspector of schools the report said underachievement was often accompanied by problems with attendance , bullying and anti-social behaviour .
many schools , it says , were working more closely with youth support services , other providers , parents and communities to try to overcome these problems .
the report also highlights the continuing problems surrounding school attendance .
every day around 20,000 children are missing from secondary schools .
some were absent because their parents were taking them on term time holidays , but the majority were playing truant .
' sound foundation ' " on recent performance , secondary schools are unlikely to meet the welsh assembly government target to reduce absenteeism to below 7 % by 2007 , " said ms lewis .
the number of pupils being excluded from school is rising .
the most recent figures show 20,242 pupils were excluded for fixed periods - compared with 16,530 in 2003-4 .
while from 2004-05 the number of permanent exclusions from mainstream schools have increased by just over 10 % .
estyn said only one in seven permanently excluded pupils move to other schools .
special pupil referral units provide education for 10 per cent of excluded children .
we remain on track to realise our ambition that wales will be a country where everyone has the opportunity to learn and prosper jane davidson , education minister " local authorities are failing to give pupils who are permanently excluded from school the full 25 hours a week of education , " the report says .
but there was praise for the standard of lessons , with 73 % of lessons for pupils of all ages inspected by estyn being given two grades .
the report says there was very little unsatisfactory work , describing the position as a " sound foundation for the welsh assembly government 's targets on standards . "
further education colleges inspected for this year 's report also met assembly government targets , with 81 % of work described as " good " or " very good " .
standards in subjects including hair and beauty , hospitality and catering , leisure , travel and tourism were among those described as " outstanding . "
more than three quarters of lessons had what were described as " good " or " outstanding " features .
ms lewis said " overall colleges are doing better than the welsh assembly government 's targets for learner achievement and for the quality of the teaching " .
' revolution ' but there were still serious concerns about work-based training .
nearly half of training providers still had unsatisfactory standards this year compared with 28 % last year .
commenting on the report , education minister jane davidson said it provided an overview of the progress made in just about every area of education and training .
" i was pleased with her conclusion that providers in most sectors have improved a great deal since they were last inspected , " she said .
" we have begun a revolution in education and lifelong learning in wales .
this report confirms that we remain on track to realise our ambition that wales will be a country where everyone has the opportunity to learn and prosper . "

bbc news -pipe- business -pipe- q & a : the fall of the dollar bbc news / business graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- business contents : your money -pipe- economy companies wednesday , 24 january 2007 , 11:19 gmt q & a : the fall of the dollar the us dollar has continued its recent decline , hitting fresh lows against the pound .
sterling hit a 14-year record against the dollar on tuesday - above $ 1.99 on currency exchanges - almost breaking the key $ 2 rate .
the downward pressure on the greenback looks set to continue , with wide-ranging consequences at home and abroad , for both companies and consumers .
how will the dollar 's slide affect ordinary people ?
back in the 1960s when governments , not markets , decided the fate of currencies , britain once lowered the pound 's exchange rate by 18 % while telling the public that " the pound in your pocket " had not been devalued .
of course it had .
the purchasing power of the pound was eroded as the cost of imported goods went up , although british firms were able to sell their goods abroad at more competitive prices .
the us is now going through the same process .
as the dollar falls against other currencies , goods imported from abroad become more expensive for us consumers .
the impact will be particularly be felt on oil prices , as two-thirds of us oil is imported .
dearer oil means petrol price hikes , higher transport costs for goods and more expensive heating .
i do n't live in the us , but i 'm planning a trip there to do some shopping .
surely it 's good news for me ?
yes , indeed .
your pounds , euros or yen will buy more dollars than before , making goods in us stores much cheaper for you .
but the upward pressure on prices could lead to a hike in us inflation this year , which would cancel out some of those gains for those of you planning to travel later .
and if you work in tourism , you have to bear in mind that people in the us are less likely to visit your own country because their holidays abroad will become more expensive .
what about the wider us economic impact ?
the fall in the dollar could actually do the us economy some good , by helping to reduce the country 's huge trade deficit - the difference between the amount the us imports from the rest of the world and the amount it can sell to the rest of the world .
that deficit is now heading above $ 800bn for 2006 , or 7 % of the us economy .
as the dollar declines in value , us consumers have an incentive to buy domestic goods rather than foreign ones , helping to correct what has become a huge global imbalance .
but if us inflation does surge ahead , it might force the federal reserve , the country 's central bank , to raise interest rates in a bid to keep price rises in check .
that could make the country 's highly-indebted consumers more reluctant to buy any goods at all , choking off economic growth and increasing fears of an economic slowdown .
how will uk jobs and industry be affected ?
the dollar 's fall could be bad news for uk and european manufacturing industry .
it will create difficulties for uk and other firms trying to sell their goods to the us public , since americans will have to pay more for them in dollar terms .
in recent years the us has been the engine of world economic growth , and its export market has been very important .
but some europeans now argue that with an economic revival at home , the impact could be lessened .
how long will the dollar 's slide continue ?
while no one can predict the course of currency markets , the pressures are growing on the dollar .
economists have been saying for many years that the growing trade deficit is unsustainable in the long-term .
in addition , the us economy is weakening , while the economies of europe and japan are getting stronger .
this is likely to mean interest rates rising in those countries , which could attract more funds from the us .

the buckinghamshire school , which can not be named , allows its 100 muslim pupils to wear headscarves .
but the father of a 12-year-old pupil wants her to wear the niqab , covering the whole face except for the eyes .
the local council says the school might be forced to back down because of the high cost of the legal proceedings .
buckinghamshire county council says it has been advised the cost would be up to £ 500,000 and is considering whether it would it be right to fight the case as it would mean cutting funds to other schools and services .
the girl involved has not been excluded from the secondary school but has been asked not to come wearing the niqab .
the school says the full face veil does not comply with its uniform code because it hampers communication .
legal costs the pupil , who joined the school in september , has not been in lessons since october .
she has had some tuition at home .
her father is seeking a ruling through a judicial review in the high court in london .
the family and the school can not be identified for legal reasons .
a hearing is due early next month to decide whether the review should go ahead .
however , there are doubts about whether the school will be able to defend its position .
buckinghamshire county council is reluctant to meet the legal costs even though it supports the school 's decision , saying there are more pressing demands on its funds . "
we have been working with the school to try and achieve a resolution in the best interests of the pupil and the school " marion clayton , buckinghamshire council it says the school has been trying hard to reach a compromise with the girl 's parents .
the councillor in charge of the county 's schools , marion clayton , said : " i can confirm that a parent has asked for a judicial review regarding his daughter not being allowed to attend a buckinghamshire school wearing a niqab .
" neither the school nor this council feel it is appropriate to comment on the issues of the case until the review , if any , has taken place .
" we have been working with the school throughout to try and achieve a resolution in the best interests of the pupil and the school . "
last year , the law lords ruled that a luton school was justified in banning the jilbab , a long gown , but it took a lengthy legal battle before this was established .
government guidance says schools can decide their own uniform code in consultation with the community .

the buckinghamshire school , which can not be named , allows its 100 muslim pupils to wear headscarves .
but the father of a 12-year-old pupil wants her to wear the niqab , covering the whole face except for the eyes .
the local council says the school might be forced to back down because of the high cost of the legal proceedings .
buckinghamshire county council says it has been advised the cost would be up to £ 500,000 and is considering whether it would it be right to fight the case as it would mean cutting funds to other schools and services .
the girl involved has not been excluded from the secondary school but has been asked not to come wearing the niqab .
the school says the full face veil does not comply with its uniform code because it hampers communication .
legal costs the pupil , who joined the school in september , has not been in lessons since october .
she has had some tuition at home .
her father is seeking a ruling through a judicial review in the high court in london .
the family and the school can not be identified for legal reasons .
a hearing is due early next month to decide whether the review should go ahead .
however , there are doubts about whether the school will be able to defend its position .
buckinghamshire county council is reluctant to meet the legal costs even though it supports the school 's decision , saying there are more pressing demands on its funds .
we have been working with the school to try and achieve a resolution in the best interests of the pupil and the school marion clayton , buckinghamshire council it says the school has been trying hard to reach a compromise with the girl 's parents .
the councillor in charge of the county 's schools , marion clayton , said : " i can confirm that a parent has asked for a judicial review regarding his daughter not being allowed to attend a buckinghamshire school wearing a niqab .
" neither the school nor this council feel it is appropriate to comment on the issues of the case until the review , if any , has taken place .
" we have been working with the school throughout to try and achieve a resolution in the best interests of the pupil and the school . "
last year , the law lords ruled that a luton school was justified in banning the jilbab , a long gown , but it took a lengthy legal battle before this was established .
