" you have spoken loud and clear and chosen the course the country will take in the next few years , " he said . the election , called six months early , pitted karamanlis , the 52-year-old nephew of the late president and prime minister constantine karamanlis , against pasok leader giorgos papandreou , son of the late charismatic prime minister andreas papandreou . both major parties lost support to smaller parties . new democracy held 165 seats in the outgoing parliament and will retain a slim majority with considerably fewer seats , hinting at some public discontent .
fewer seats will make it harder for the next government to carry out austere economic and education reforms , which analysts say are necessary to move the country forward . turning away from the socialists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these general elections were seen as crucial initial results also showed the greek public turning away from the main opposition socialist party , which was at 38.23 percent compared to 40.6 percent in the 2004 elections . the far-right laos party was seen winning 3.71 percent of the vote and 10 seats - just above the 3-percent threshold needed to enter parliament for the first time . the communist party -lrb- kke -rrb- had 7.97 percent -lrb- 21 seats -rrb- , up from 5.9 percent in 2004 , and the left-coalition was at 4.93 percent -lrb- 13 seats -rrb- , up from 3.3 percent . the elections were seen as critical for implementing reforms needed in the euro zone 's second poorest economy , including overhaul of the pension system , which risks going bankrupt within 20 years , and completing state privatizations . greece 's per capita gross domestic product is the second lowest in the eurozone after portugal , and nearly 20 per cent of greeks live below the poverty line . a risky move bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : catastrophic fires swept across greece last month karamanlis has been applauded by the european union for cutting deficits and creating thousands of jobs , but the unemployment rate still hovers above the eu average . confident that he could secure an easy victory , karamanlis called for snap elections in august but barely a week later found himself facing harsh criticism over the government 's slow and confused response to the recent forest fires , which killed 65 people . the socialists , accused of their own scandals over their 20-year ruling history , did not seem to take advantage in their election campaign of the government 's own woes . dpa news agency -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" you have spoken loud and clear and chosen the course the country will take in the next few years , " he said . the election , called six months early , pitted karamanlis , the 52-year-old nephew of the late president and prime minister constantine karamanlis , against pasok leader giorgos papandreou , son of the late charismatic prime minister andreas papandreou . both major parties lost support to smaller parties . new democracy held 165 seats in the outgoing parliament and will retain a slim majority with considerably fewer seats , hinting at some public discontent .
fewer seats will make it harder for the next government to carry out austere economic and education reforms , which analysts say are necessary to move the country forward . turning away from the socialists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these general elections were seen as crucial initial results also showed the greek public turning away from the main opposition socialist party , which was at 38.23 percent compared to 40.6 percent in the 2004 elections . the far-right laos party was seen winning 3.71 percent of the vote and 10 seats - just above the 3-percent threshold needed to enter parliament for the first time . the communist party -lrb- kke -rrb- had 7.97 percent -lrb- 21 seats -rrb- , up from 5.9 percent in 2004 , and the left-coalition was at 4.93 percent -lrb- 13 seats -rrb- , up from 3.3 percent . the elections were seen as critical for implementing reforms needed in the euro zone 's second poorest economy , including overhaul of the pension system , which risks going bankrupt within 20 years , and completing state privatizations . greece 's per capita gross domestic product is the second lowest in the eurozone after portugal , and nearly 20 per cent of greeks live below the poverty line . a risky move bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : catastrophic fires swept across greece last month karamanlis has been applauded by the european union for cutting deficits and creating thousands of jobs , but the unemployment rate still hovers above the eu average . confident that he could secure an easy victory , karamanlis called for snap elections in august but barely a week later found himself facing harsh criticism over the government 's slow and confused response to the recent forest fires , which killed 65 people . the socialists , accused of their own scandals over their 20-year ruling history , did not seem to take advantage in their election campaign of the government 's own woes . dpa news agency -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de labor market -pipe- 16.09.2007 every third german worker unhappy with job , poll says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : being stressed at work is not uncommon among german employees a new survey on working conditions in germany says every third employee is discontented with his job .
labor unions say the dismal result bolsters their demand for a statutory minimum wage . every third employee in germany believes he wo n't be able to continue working until reaching retirement age ; only every eighth worker is happy with his job and working conditions while every third person finds it problematic .
that is the bleak conclusion reached by a new survey commissioned by the dgb german trade union federation and presented in berlin this week .
the representative survey polled around 6,100 employees across a wide range of sectors in germany .
temporary workers worst affected almost half of those surveyed -lrb- 54 percent -rrb- assessed their working conditions as being " average " with lower stress levels but also fewer chances for promotion and meager pay packages .
the situation was worst for temporary workers with high stress levels and work pressures , a total lack of perspective , bad management and poor wages .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german engineers are happiest with their working conditions in contrast , engineers topped the list of those happiest with their jobs , followed by employees in the chemical industry and administrative sector .
the factors contributing to their positive ratings included good remuneration , low physical and emotional pressures as well as sufficient chances to develop their careers .
the study showed that , in general , workers do n't feel that their wages adequately reflect their skills .
many complain about a lack of appreciation for their work , unsatisfying collegial atmosphere and few chances to further hone their skills .
many of those polled also said their bosses had little understanding for their family commitments .
" generally , the lower the qualification , the lower the pay and poorer the working conditions , " said ernst kistler , director of the international institute for empirical social economics -lrb- inifes -rrb- , which assessed the survey together with the dgb .
labor unions emboldened by survey labor unions have seized on the poll results as confirmation of their opposition to the raising of the official retirement age to 67 from 65 this year as well as their long-standing demand for a statutory minimum wage .
unlike the us and many other eu countries , germany has no statutory minimum wage , and debate continues over introducing one .
while trade unions say it 's about social justice , german business views it as a job killer .
michael sommer , head of the dgb trade union federation said the results of the survey are " further proof for the miserable conditions in the low-wage sector . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's senior citizens have less to laugh about since the retirement age was raised sommer said it was especially dramatic that 73 percent of employees satisfied with their working conditions foresaw no problems in continuing working until retirement age while only 27 percent of those working in poor conditions expected the same .
the dgb boss said the unions would now step up their fight against the newly introduced retirement age . the german government passed the measure earlier this year , arguing that in view of the ageing population and falling birth rate , the country could no longer afford to let its workers retire by 65 .
jürgen peters , head of the metal-workers ' union , ig-metall , said the poll was a wake-up call .
according to peters , companies that singularly pursue cost-cutting strategies do n't just " damage good work , but also undermines the motivation and readiness to perform among workers , " which is a key prerequisite for innovation and competition . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

do you take encouragement from that ? oskar lafontaine : of course that 's encouraging - especially when you take into account that a wide range of polls this summer indicated that the political standpoints that our young left party has taken and the concrete demands that it has made are supported by a large majority of the people .
in other words , that means the policies of the parties that are competing with us are not accepted by the majority of the people . what standpoints do you mean ? they 're very simple , you do n't need to talk about philosophy to understand them , you just have to talk straight with people .
one point is the legal minimum wage .
it 's a question about how much a person needs to earn in an industrialized country to feed himself .
for a long time france has led the way on this .
at the moment , the minimum wage in france is 8.44 euros -lrb- $ 11.72 -rrb- .
we believe that what works in france can also work in germany .
unfortunately the cdu -lsb- chancellor merkel 's christian democratic union -rsb- in particular is against this humane idea . the discussion about the minimum wage also came about as a result of the pressure that globalization put on the german economy .
do you think globalization can be controlled in a national context ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : globalization has vocal opponents in germany it 's never been possible to control globalization in a national context .
it 's an old wives ' tale to say that globalization is something new .
it existed in past centuries - of course in a different form .
it 's always been the case that it was easier to source certain products abroad rather than here at home .
the answer to globalization is high productivity and that 's the direction we should be taking .
germany has already come a long way . at the moment there 's a big discussion going on about climate-change .
atomic power is not an issue in germany .
you 've always opposed nuclear energy , do you still hold to that ? because i used to be a physicist , i have to explain this in detail : i was not against atomic technology .
i was not against luminous watch faces or against x-rays , but i am against electricity generated in its present form from atomic power simply because we do n't have a solution for the disposal of nuclear waste .
atomic energy is a technology that can be badly abused .
that 's why we should get away from this technology .
the answer is renewable energy .
but we still need to have some technological breakthroughs in that area . bildunterschrift : the newly founded left party that you lead appears to be establishing itself in germany as the third political force .
will it stay that way ? of course it 's not possible to say that , but the way it 's looking now , the other parties remain convinced that cuts in social services and reducing taxes for the rich lay the groundwork for economic prosperity .
we will be needed and we 'll have growing support as long as they foolishly maintain that path . do you have a goal ?
do you want to change the government and the country ? we want to change politics .
we 've come part of the way to achieving that goal .
the spd -lsb- social democratic party -rsb- and the greens are debating intensively the reasoning behind military peacekeeping missions .
the cdu and fdp -lsb- free-market , liberal free democratic party -rsb- are doing the same .
it 's good that we have forced the other parties to have this discussion . there was an astounding development during the summer .
they were debating cut-backs and rolling back the welfare state .
they called it reform because reform has positive associations but really it was about cut-backs .
now , they 're talking about increasing payments for the unemployed , about increasing benefits for students and for children .
although nothing has been decided yet , at least they 're changing the way they think and in that respect the left party has changed german politics . a characteristic of your politics is the relatively categorical " no " to every form of military intervention .
does that apply to afghanistan , the horn of africa , kosovo and bosnia ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lafontaine wants german troops out of afghanistan we 're against military intervention because we believe that you can not kill people and at the same time say you are doing it to stop other people from being killed .
that 's the contradiction in afghanistan , for example , where a growing number of innocent people have been victims of nato bombs .
we still support what -lsb- former german chancellor -rsb- willy brandt said : " renouncing violence should be the basis of german foreign policy " and " a war must never be started from german soil again . " the left party is the merger of a western german and an eastern german party .
are there still problems between the two parts ? there are different experiences between eastern germans and western germans and we wo n't be able to overcome those in a generation .
but that does n't just affect us , it also affects the other parties .
people have overlooked that the cdu and the fdp - two parties that compete with us - have swallowed former east german parties and do n't want to talk about it .
we can learn from one another and that 's apparent when it comes to social issues .
eastern germans are much more aware of social justice issues than people in western germany .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de labor market -pipe- 16.09.2007 every third german worker unhappy with job , poll says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : being stressed at work is not uncommon among german employees a new survey on working conditions in germany says every third employee is discontented with his job .
labor unions say the dismal result bolsters their demand for a statutory minimum wage . every third employee in germany believes he wo n't be able to continue working until reaching retirement age ; only every eighth worker is happy with his job and working conditions while every third person finds it problematic .
that is the bleak conclusion reached by a new survey commissioned by the dgb german trade union federation and presented in berlin this week .
the representative survey polled around 6,100 employees across a wide range of sectors in germany .
temporary workers worst affected almost half of those surveyed -lrb- 54 percent -rrb- assessed their working conditions as being " average " with lower stress levels but also fewer chances for promotion and meager pay packages .
the situation was worst for temporary workers with high stress levels and work pressures , a total lack of perspective , bad management and poor wages .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german engineers are happiest with their working conditions in contrast , engineers topped the list of those happiest with their jobs , followed by employees in the chemical industry and administrative sector .
the factors contributing to their positive ratings included good remuneration , low physical and emotional pressures as well as sufficient chances to develop their careers .
the study showed that , in general , workers do n't feel that their wages adequately reflect their skills .
many complain about a lack of appreciation for their work , unsatisfying collegial atmosphere and few chances to further hone their skills .
many of those polled also said their bosses had little understanding for their family commitments .
" generally , the lower the qualification , the lower the pay and poorer the working conditions , " said ernst kistler , director of the international institute for empirical social economics -lrb- inifes -rrb- , which assessed the survey together with the dgb .
labor unions emboldened by survey labor unions have seized on the poll results as confirmation of their opposition to the raising of the official retirement age to 67 from 65 this year as well as their long-standing demand for a statutory minimum wage .
unlike the us and many other eu countries , germany has no statutory minimum wage , and debate continues over introducing one .
while trade unions say it 's about social justice , german business views it as a job killer .
michael sommer , head of the dgb trade union federation said the results of the survey are " further proof for the miserable conditions in the low-wage sector . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's senior citizens have less to laugh about since the retirement age was raised sommer said it was especially dramatic that 73 percent of employees satisfied with their working conditions foresaw no problems in continuing working until retirement age while only 27 percent of those working in poor conditions expected the same .
the dgb boss said the unions would now step up their fight against the newly introduced retirement age . the german government passed the measure earlier this year , arguing that in view of the ageing population and falling birth rate , the country could no longer afford to let its workers retire by 65 .
jürgen peters , head of the metal-workers ' union , ig-metall , said the poll was a wake-up call .
according to peters , companies that singularly pursue cost-cutting strategies do n't just " damage good work , but also undermines the motivation and readiness to perform among workers , " which is a key prerequisite for innovation and competition . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

do you take encouragement from that ? oskar lafontaine : of course that 's encouraging - especially when you take into account that a wide range of polls this summer indicated that the political standpoints that our young left party has taken and the concrete demands that it has made are supported by a large majority of the people .
in other words , that means the policies of the parties that are competing with us are not accepted by the majority of the people . what standpoints do you mean ? they 're very simple , you do n't need to talk about philosophy to understand them , you just have to talk straight with people .
one point is the legal minimum wage .
it 's a question about how much a person needs to earn in an industrialized country to feed himself .
for a long time france has led the way on this .
at the moment , the minimum wage in france is 8.44 euros -lrb- $ 11.72 -rrb- .
we believe that what works in france can also work in germany .
unfortunately the cdu -lsb- chancellor merkel 's christian democratic union -rsb- in particular is against this humane idea . the discussion about the minimum wage also came about as a result of the pressure that globalization put on the german economy .
do you think globalization can be controlled in a national context ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : globalization has vocal opponents in germany it 's never been possible to control globalization in a national context .
it 's an old wives ' tale to say that globalization is something new .
it existed in past centuries - of course in a different form .
it 's always been the case that it was easier to source certain products abroad rather than here at home .
the answer to globalization is high productivity and that 's the direction we should be taking .
germany has already come a long way . at the moment there 's a big discussion going on about climate-change .
atomic power is not an issue in germany .
you 've always opposed nuclear energy , do you still hold to that ? because i used to be a physicist , i have to explain this in detail : i was not against atomic technology .
i was not against luminous watch faces or against x-rays , but i am against electricity generated in its present form from atomic power simply because we do n't have a solution for the disposal of nuclear waste .
atomic energy is a technology that can be badly abused .
that 's why we should get away from this technology .
the answer is renewable energy .
but we still need to have some technological breakthroughs in that area . bildunterschrift : the newly founded left party that you lead appears to be establishing itself in germany as the third political force .
will it stay that way ? of course it 's not possible to say that , but the way it 's looking now , the other parties remain convinced that cuts in social services and reducing taxes for the rich lay the groundwork for economic prosperity .
we will be needed and we 'll have growing support as long as they foolishly maintain that path . do you have a goal ?
do you want to change the government and the country ? we want to change politics .
we 've come part of the way to achieving that goal .
the spd -lsb- social democratic party -rsb- and the greens are debating intensively the reasoning behind military peacekeeping missions .
the cdu and fdp -lsb- free-market , liberal free democratic party -rsb- are doing the same .
it 's good that we have forced the other parties to have this discussion . there was an astounding development during the summer .
they were debating cut-backs and rolling back the welfare state .
they called it reform because reform has positive associations but really it was about cut-backs .
now , they 're talking about increasing payments for the unemployed , about increasing benefits for students and for children .
although nothing has been decided yet , at least they 're changing the way they think and in that respect the left party has changed german politics . a characteristic of your politics is the relatively categorical " no " to every form of military intervention .
does that apply to afghanistan , the horn of africa , kosovo and bosnia ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lafontaine wants german troops out of afghanistan we 're against military intervention because we believe that you can not kill people and at the same time say you are doing it to stop other people from being killed .
that 's the contradiction in afghanistan , for example , where a growing number of innocent people have been victims of nato bombs .
we still support what -lsb- former german chancellor -rsb- willy brandt said : " renouncing violence should be the basis of german foreign policy " and " a war must never be started from german soil again . " the left party is the merger of a western german and an eastern german party .
are there still problems between the two parts ? there are different experiences between eastern germans and western germans and we wo n't be able to overcome those in a generation .
but that does n't just affect us , it also affects the other parties .
people have overlooked that the cdu and the fdp - two parties that compete with us - have swallowed former east german parties and do n't want to talk about it .
we can learn from one another and that 's apparent when it comes to social issues .
eastern germans are much more aware of social justice issues than people in western germany .
but in the last couple of years , the topic has also become a hot-button issue in western german homes again . interview : alexander kudascheff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a survey by the food standards agency -lrb- fsa -rrb- suggests widespread ignorance about how much starchy food like rice , bread and pasta should be eaten .
and there is confusion over what can contribute towards the target " five a day " intake of fruit and vegetables .
conflicting messages from different weight-loss diets could be responsible for the misconceptions , says the fsa .
only 11 % of people correctly said it was important to eat lots of starchy foods , the survey of 2,094 people found .
fsa survey 45 % realised tinned fruit and veg count towards " five a day " 54 % correct in saying frozen fruit and veg can count 53 % realised dried fruit count 73 % recognised importance of eating lots of fresh fruit and vegetables 19 % wrongly thought eating plenty of fruit and veg could " outweigh " eating fatty , sugary foods 58 % realised foods high in fat and sugar should only be eaten occasionally the fsa has re-designed the image it uses to show what makes up a healthy diet - the newly-designed " eatwell plate " uses photos of different foods and renames some food groups .
the organisation 's head of nutrition , rosemary hignett , said consumers ought to know the proportions of each food group needed for a healthy balanced diet .
" it 's not a 10-minute fad .
it 's a diet for life that we know will help reduce the number of diet-related illnesses such as heart disease , stroke , diabetes and some cancers which are on the rise in the uk , " she said .
" this is about a simple , straightforward approach that allows us to enjoy a varied diet that includes foods from all groups . "
potatoes do not count towards the target " five a day " portions of fruit and vegetables , says the fsa , but baked beans do .
a healthy , balanced diet , according to its guidelines , should be made up of around one third fruit and vegetables one third bread , rice , potatoes , pasta and other starchy foods 15 % milk and dairy foods 12 % meat , fish , eggs , beans and other non-dairy sources of protein and just 8 % food and drink high in fat or sugar the new image will be used by , among others , dieticians , nutritionists and the national institute of health and clinical excellence .

and there is confusion over what can contribute towards the target " five a day " intake of fruit and vegetables .
conflicting messages from different weight-loss diets could be responsible for the misconceptions , says the fsa .
only 11 % of people correctly said it was important to eat lots of starchy foods , the survey of 2,094 people found .
fsa survey 45 % realised tinned fruit and veg count towards " five a day " 54 % correct in saying frozen fruit and veg can count 53 % realised dried fruit count 73 % recognised importance of eating lots of fresh fruit and vegetables 19 % wrongly thought eating plenty of fruit and veg could " outweigh " eating fatty , sugary foods 58 % realised foods high in fat and sugar should only be eaten occasionally the fsa has re-designed the image it uses to show what makes up a healthy diet - the newly-designed " eatwell plate " uses photos of different foods and renames some food groups .
the organisation 's head of nutrition , rosemary hignett , said consumers ought to know the proportions of each food group needed for a healthy balanced diet .
" it 's not a 10-minute fad .
it 's a diet for life that we know will help reduce the number of diet-related illnesses such as heart disease , stroke , diabetes and some cancers which are on the rise in the uk , " she said .
" this is about a simple , straightforward approach that allows us to enjoy a varied diet that includes foods from all groups . "
potatoes do not count towards the target " five a day " portions of fruit and vegetables , says the fsa , but baked beans do .
a healthy , balanced diet , according to its guidelines , should be made up of around one third fruit and vegetables one third bread , rice , potatoes , pasta and other starchy foods 15 % milk and dairy foods 12 % meat , fish , eggs , beans and other non-dairy sources of protein and just 8 % food and drink high in fat or sugar the new image will be used by , among others , dieticians , nutritionists and the national institute of health and clinical excellence .

carcasses , usually spotted by the public , have been collected over the course of the 13-year otter project .
mainly roadkill from across wales and england , they are examined in cardiff and at a field centre in powys .
one finding is a drop in lead levels in otters since the early 1990s which reflects the ban on lead in car fuel .
project manager dr liz chadwick , said post-mortem examinations were a key way to learn about otters as they are so elusive .
they had received 962 dead otters since the project began , most of which are initially reported by a member of the public , she said .
the carcasses are sent in frozen by organisations such as the environment agency , the countryside council for wales or the wildlife trust .
the alternative to post-mortem examinations , is looking for otter " spraint " -lrb- faeces -rrb- along the river bank , explained dr chadwick .
it looks like they are spreading back into areas where they had become extinct dr liz chadwick " they are very difficult species to study , they are quite elusive .
very few people see them in the wild alive . "
she added : " if you are surveying them by looking at poo on rocks , it does n't tell you a great deal about otters that way .
" with carcasses , it 's unfortunate they have been killed by a car but you can get a whole range of extra information .
" their stomach content tells you what they 've been feeding on , we test the liver for pesticides and other pollutants . "
examining dead otters is a useful way of monitoring river pollution levels because pollutants accumulate up the food chain and they are at the top .
the team have recently discovered otters also eat worms and slugs it appears that the otter population is on the increase , said dr chadwick - one sign of this was the higher number of carcasses being sent in .
she said : " we do have to treat that with caution because there are more cars on the road now and more people are aware of the project .
but it ties in with survey data . "
wales had always remained a " stronghold " for otters , said dr chadwick , explaining : " there are so many rivers , good quality rivers with good fish stocks that are not too polluted . "
however , they are now receiving dead otters from more areas than before , including middle england where they had largely disappeared .
" it looks like they are spreading back into areas where they had become extinct , " said dr chadwick .
lead levels if several otters have been killed on the same road , the team can take steps to get ledges built underneath the highway to provide them with a safer route .
another element of their work involves analysing bone samples to monitor lead levels .
since the early 1990s , they have noticed a significant drop in lead levels found in otters which reflects the ban of lead in car fuel .
in recent months , the team have also started using dna profiling to get a more accurate picture of the otters ' diet .
traditional methods had relied on finding hard remains , such as bone , in otter faeces .
dr chadwick explained : " we can investigate some of the prey items you would not find using other ways .
" we 've found good evidence they are feeding on slugs and worms , which is new information and quite exciting as it 's not been found before because they do n't have bones . "

it looks like they are spreading back into areas where they had become extinct " dr liz chadwick " they are very difficult species to study , they are quite elusive .
very few people see them in the wild alive . "
she added : " if you are surveying them by looking at poo on rocks , it does n't tell you a great deal about otters that way .
" with carcasses , it 's unfortunate they have been killed by a car but you can get a whole range of extra information .
" their stomach content tells you what they 've been feeding on , we test the liver for pesticides and other pollutants . "
examining dead otters is a useful way of monitoring river pollution levels because pollutants accumulate up the food chain and they are at the top .
it appears that the otter population is on the increase , said dr chadwick - one sign of this was the higher number of carcasses being sent in .
she said : " we do have to treat that with caution because there are more cars on the road now and more people are aware of the project .
but it ties in with survey data . "
wales had always remained a " stronghold " for otters , said dr chadwick , explaining : " there are so many rivers , good quality rivers with good fish stocks that are not too polluted . "
however , they are now receiving dead otters from more areas than before , including middle england where they had largely disappeared .
" it looks like they are spreading back into areas where they had become extinct , " said dr chadwick .
lead levels if several otters have been killed on the same road , the team can take steps to get ledges built underneath the highway to provide them with a safer route .
another element of their work involves analysing bone samples to monitor lead levels .
since the early 1990s , they have noticed a significant drop in lead levels found in otters which reflects the ban of lead in car fuel .
in recent months , the team have also started using dna profiling to get a more accurate picture of the otters ' diet .
traditional methods had relied on finding hard remains , such as bone , in otter faeces .
dr chadwick explained : " we can investigate some of the prey items you would not find using other ways .
" we 've found good evidence they are feeding on slugs and worms , which is new information and quite exciting as it 's not been found before because they do n't have bones . "

he told bbc one 's the andrew marr show his tax policies would help 90 % of the population and the gap between rich and poor had become " too great " .
the comments come after senior lib dem lord rodgers said some party members were " disappointed " with their leader .
but ahead of the lib dem annual conference in brighton on sunday , sir menzies said he will stay on as boss .
" i 've made it perfectly clear ... that i will lead the party into the next general election and into the next parliament , " he said . "
we are going for these people who have done the best of all out of the last 10 years " sir menzies campbell he added that he was ready to fight an election , challenging prime minister gordon brown to " bring it on " .
of labour 's time in power , sir menzies said : " the people at the top have done very well .
in fact , they 've done too well .
" the division between rich and poor has become too great and it 's time for it to be redressed . "
sir menzies said his party 's policy of replacing council tax with a local income tax would only leave those households earning more that £ 70,000 a year paying more .
' no mandate ' he criticised gordon brown 's decision to abolish the lowest , 10p in the pound , rate of income tax in his last budget as chancellor earlier this year .
this would leave households earning £ 18,500 a year , which did not receive tax credits , worse off , he added .
he said : " we are going for these people who have done the best of all out of the last 10 years . "
sir menzies reiterated his party 's policy to reduce the basic rate of income tax by 4p in the pound , saying this could be funded by increases in environmental taxes and changes to capital gains tax and tax relief on investments and pensions .
he also said a lib dem government would offer a referendum on whether the uk stays in the european union , rather than the vote demanded by tories and trade unions on whether the country signs up to the eu treaty .
sir menzies has been lib dem leader since early 2006 .
earlier , lord rodgers told the bbc : " i think he 's a very able man and an intelligent man and he 's very good on foreign affairs , and i always want to listen to him and i respect what he 's going to say .
" but he 's had a very difficult task and some people are disappointed .
" there is a feeling that there 's a lack of energy and an absence of direction , so i very much hope the conference will be different and change the mood really . "
but sir menzies said the lib dems under him had " maintained a distinctive position in british politics " .
he added : " the great divisions are no longer between left and right but between liberal and authoritarian . "
the lib dem conference runs until thursday .
