" we do not accept the curbs on the media and we demand that the government immediately withdraw brutal restrictions that have been imposed , " bhutto said in islamabad , amid a continuing blackout of news channels on the country 's cable networks .
bhutto also called upon journalists , lawyers ' associations , trade unionists and civil society organizations to join her in opposition to the military regime of musharraf , an army general who came to power in 1999 .
" our country is passing through dark times and we have mounted a united struggle against dictatorship , " she told around 200 chanting media workers gathered in front of the offices of one of the affected channels .
despite having confined bhutto to her islamabad house on friday , thereby thwarting her plans to lead a mass rally , law enforcers made no moves to prevent her from addressing the journalists .
bhutto urges merkel for support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bhutto called on merkel to use her influence in the crisis she spoke to german mass-circulation tabloid bild on friday in a bid to secure germany 's support for her campaign against musharraf .
" chancellor merkel should exert pressure on musharraf , " bhutto told germany 's mass-circulation bild newspaper .
" we demand the immediate resignation of president musharraf as head of the military and a clear timetable for elections . "
referring to merkel 's visit to us president george w. bush at his ranch in crawford , texas later friday , bhutto added : " chancellor , please inform president bush that the people want democracy in pakistan and not the empty promises that president musharraf makes to us . "
the german government immediately called on musharraf to release bhutto from house arrest , along with the political activists detained in recent days .
" we call on the pakistani leadership also to reverse the numerous arrests of political activists , " foreign ministry spokesman martin jaeger said in berlin .
bundestag condemns crackdown on opposition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier talked of concern over pakistan 's future bundestag members condemned the detention of opposition supporters and members of the judiciary , warning musharraf 's actions were playing into the hands of islamists .
foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said the declaration of a state of emergency was a " severe blow " not only to democracy but also a threat to long-term stability of pakistan .
he added that germany would re-examine its arms exports to pakistan and would also restrict economic assistance to projects which solely benefit the population .
bhutto demands the restoration of the constitution and the release of thousands of political detainees rounded up by security forces since the emergency measures were introduced a week earlier .
despite months of covert talks with musharraf towards a suspected deal that would bolster his political support while bringing her back into government , there is speculation of a real and widening rift behind her trademark rhetoric against the us-backed military leader .
bhutto has said her dialogue with musharraf was suspended when he suspended the constitution and dissolved the supreme court .
international pressure on musharraf grows bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : musharraf has been urged to end the state of emergency but as international pressure grows on musharraf 's government to restore democratic rule in pakistan , a senior official said saturday emergency measures were likely to be lifted in a few weeks .
" the law and order situation is fast improving , and if the trend continued the state of emergency will be lifted by the middle or the end of the next month , " the country 's attorney general malik mohammad qayyum told private news channel geo .
" we do not want to make it a permanent feature of our government , " qayyum told other broadcasters .
musharraf announced authoritarian rule largely on the grounds that it would stem rising islamic militancy in pakistan , particularly in the volatile tribal belt bordering afghanistan .
but many believe the main objective of the measure was to prevent the judiciary from ruling against his re-election for the next week by deposing all but four judges of the supreme court . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german train drivers threatened wider strike action next week after goods services resumed on saturday morning , following a 42-hour shutdown . manfred schell , chairman of the gdl union which called the strike , said passenger services could be hit from tuesday if state-owned rail operator deutsche bahn fails to make a new pay offer .
the union said the strike that began at midday on thursday paralyzed goods traffic in germany 's eastern states and also hit two-thirds of the trains in the west of the country .
deutsche bahn board member norbert bensel said it was " the worst strike we have ever experienced in the rail freight transport sector " and had a knock-on effect in neighboring countries .
" several hundred trains are waiting at international borders to enter germany , " he said shortly before drivers began returning to work at 6 am .
" it is a terrible thing that 1,000 train drivers can threaten germany 's industrial base , " he said , although most large manufacturing companies said production had not been seriously affected by the stoppage .
the union , which represents around 15,500 of germany 's 19,600 train drivers , is seeking a rise of up to 31 per cent in a separate wage contract to the one deutsche bahn signed with two larger unions .
the rail operator rejects this , fearing it could prompt other sectors of the company to demand their own pay deals , making collective bargaining more difficult .

despite being one of the main targets , the north-eastern port of rostock on the baltic coast continued to operate .
gdl boss schell claimed 3,500 goods train drivers had heeded the strike call and that around 1,000 of the 5,000 goods trains that db runs daily had been halted .
schell threatened to expand the strike next week to hit the commuter and long-distance passenger traffic used by around 5 million people daily .

" we do not accept the curbs on the media and we demand that the government immediately withdraw brutal restrictions that have been imposed , " bhutto said in islamabad , amid a continuing blackout of news channels on the country 's cable networks .
bhutto also called upon journalists , lawyers ' associations , trade unionists and civil society organizations to join her in opposition to the military regime of musharraf , an army general who came to power in 1999 .
" our country is passing through dark times and we have mounted a united struggle against dictatorship , " she told around 200 chanting media workers gathered in front of the offices of one of the affected channels .
despite having confined bhutto to her islamabad house on friday , thereby thwarting her plans to lead a mass rally , law enforcers made no moves to prevent her from addressing the journalists .
bhutto urges merkel for support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bhutto called on merkel to use her influence in the crisis she spoke to german mass-circulation tabloid bild on friday in a bid to secure germany 's support for her campaign against musharraf .
" chancellor merkel should exert pressure on musharraf , " bhutto told germany 's mass-circulation bild newspaper .
" we demand the immediate resignation of president musharraf as head of the military and a clear timetable for elections . "
referring to merkel 's visit to us president george w. bush at his ranch in crawford , texas later friday , bhutto added : " chancellor , please inform president bush that the people want democracy in pakistan and not the empty promises that president musharraf makes to us . "
the german government immediately called on musharraf to release bhutto from house arrest , along with the political activists detained in recent days .
" we call on the pakistani leadership also to reverse the numerous arrests of political activists , " foreign ministry spokesman martin jaeger said in berlin .
bundestag condemns crackdown on opposition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier talked of concern over pakistan 's future bundestag members condemned the detention of opposition supporters and members of the judiciary , warning musharraf 's actions were playing into the hands of islamists .
foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said the declaration of a state of emergency was a " severe blow " not only to democracy but also a threat to long-term stability of pakistan .
he added that germany would re-examine its arms exports to pakistan and would also restrict economic assistance to projects which solely benefit the population .
bhutto demands the restoration of the constitution and the release of thousands of political detainees rounded up by security forces since the emergency measures were introduced a week earlier .
despite months of covert talks with musharraf towards a suspected deal that would bolster his political support while bringing her back into government , there is speculation of a real and widening rift behind her trademark rhetoric against the us-backed military leader .
bhutto has said her dialogue with musharraf was suspended when he suspended the constitution and dissolved the supreme court .
international pressure on musharraf grows bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : musharraf has been urged to end the state of emergency but as international pressure grows on musharraf 's government to restore democratic rule in pakistan , a senior official said saturday emergency measures were likely to be lifted in a few weeks .

" we do not want to make it a permanent feature of our government , " qayyum told other broadcasters .
musharraf announced authoritarian rule largely on the grounds that it would stem rising islamic militancy in pakistan , particularly in the volatile tribal belt bordering afghanistan .

german train drivers threatened wider strike action next week after goods services resumed on saturday morning , following a 42-hour shutdown . manfred schell , chairman of the gdl union which called the strike , said passenger services could be hit from tuesday if state-owned rail operator deutsche bahn fails to make a new pay offer .
the union said the strike that began at midday on thursday paralyzed goods traffic in germany 's eastern states and also hit two-thirds of the trains in the west of the country .
deutsche bahn board member norbert bensel said it was " the worst strike we have ever experienced in the rail freight transport sector " and had a knock-on effect in neighboring countries .
" several hundred trains are waiting at international borders to enter germany , " he said shortly before drivers began returning to work at 6 am .
" it is a terrible thing that 1,000 train drivers can threaten germany 's industrial base , " he said , although most large manufacturing companies said production had not been seriously affected by the stoppage .
the union , which represents around 15,500 of germany 's 19,600 train drivers , is seeking a rise of up to 31 per cent in a separate wage contract to the one deutsche bahn signed with two larger unions .
the rail operator rejects this , fearing it could prompt other sectors of the company to demand their own pay deals , making collective bargaining more difficult .
industry relatively unaffected by goods suspension bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : car and steel production continued despite the strike carmakers vw and bmw said production was continuing as normal , while steelmakers thyssenkrupp and salzgitter also said they had been relatively unaffected .
despite being one of the main targets , the north-eastern port of rostock on the baltic coast continued to operate .
gdl boss schell claimed 3,500 goods train drivers had heeded the strike call and that around 1,000 of the 5,000 goods trains that db runs daily had been halted .
schell threatened to expand the strike next week to hit the commuter and long-distance passenger traffic used by around 5 million people daily .
according to an opinion poll taken by public television , 57 per cent of the population backs the train drivers , while 39 per cent are opposed . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german train drivers threatened wider strike action next week after goods services resumed on saturday morning , following a 42-hour shutdown . manfred schell , chairman of the gdl union which called the strike , said passenger services could be hit from tuesday if state-owned rail operator deutsche bahn fails to make a new pay offer .
the union said the strike that began at midday on thursday paralyzed goods traffic in germany 's eastern states and also hit two-thirds of the trains in the west of the country .
deutsche bahn board member norbert bensel said it was " the worst strike we have ever experienced in the rail freight transport sector " and had a knock-on effect in neighboring countries .
" several hundred trains are waiting at international borders to enter germany , " he said shortly before drivers began returning to work at 6 am .
" it is a terrible thing that 1,000 train drivers can threaten germany 's industrial base , " he said , although most large manufacturing companies said production had not been seriously affected by the stoppage .
the union , which represents around 15,500 of germany 's 19,600 train drivers , is seeking a rise of up to 31 per cent in a separate wage contract to the one deutsche bahn signed with two larger unions .
the rail operator rejects this , fearing it could prompt other sectors of the company to demand their own pay deals , making collective bargaining more difficult .
industry relatively unaffected by goods suspension bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : car and steel production continued despite the strike carmakers vw and bmw said production was continuing as normal , while steelmakers thyssenkrupp and salzgitter also said they had been relatively unaffected .
despite being one of the main targets , the north-eastern port of rostock on the baltic coast continued to operate .
gdl boss schell claimed 3,500 goods train drivers had heeded the strike call and that around 1,000 of the 5,000 goods trains that db runs daily had been halted .
schell threatened to expand the strike next week to hit the commuter and long-distance passenger traffic used by around 5 million people daily .
according to an opinion poll taken by public television , 57 per cent of the population backs the train drivers , while 39 per cent are opposed . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we do not accept the curbs on the media and we demand that the government immediately withdraw brutal restrictions that have been imposed , " bhutto said in islamabad , amid a continuing blackout of news channels on the country 's cable networks .
bhutto also called upon journalists , lawyers ' associations , trade unionists and civil society organizations to join her in opposition to the military regime of musharraf , an army general who came to power in 1999 .
" our country is passing through dark times and we have mounted a united struggle against dictatorship , " she told around 200 chanting media workers gathered in front of the offices of one of the affected channels .
despite having confined bhutto to her islamabad house on friday , thereby thwarting her plans to lead a mass rally , law enforcers made no moves to prevent her from addressing the journalists .
bhutto urges merkel for support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bhutto called on merkel to use her influence in the crisis she spoke to german mass-circulation tabloid bild on friday in a bid to secure germany 's support for her campaign against musharraf .
" chancellor merkel should exert pressure on musharraf , " bhutto told germany 's mass-circulation bild newspaper .
" we demand the immediate resignation of president musharraf as head of the military and a clear timetable for elections . "
referring to merkel 's visit to us president george w. bush at his ranch in crawford , texas later friday , bhutto added : " chancellor , please inform president bush that the people want democracy in pakistan and not the empty promises that president musharraf makes to us . "
the german government immediately called on musharraf to release bhutto from house arrest , along with the political activists detained in recent days .
" we call on the pakistani leadership also to reverse the numerous arrests of political activists , " foreign ministry spokesman martin jaeger said in berlin .
bundestag condemns crackdown on opposition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier talked of concern over pakistan 's future bundestag members condemned the detention of opposition supporters and members of the judiciary , warning musharraf 's actions were playing into the hands of islamists .
foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said the declaration of a state of emergency was a " severe blow " not only to democracy but also a threat to long-term stability of pakistan .
he added that germany would re-examine its arms exports to pakistan and would also restrict economic assistance to projects which solely benefit the population .
bhutto demands the restoration of the constitution and the release of thousands of political detainees rounded up by security forces since the emergency measures were introduced a week earlier .
despite months of covert talks with musharraf towards a suspected deal that would bolster his political support while bringing her back into government , there is speculation of a real and widening rift behind her trademark rhetoric against the us-backed military leader .
bhutto has said her dialogue with musharraf was suspended when he suspended the constitution and dissolved the supreme court .
international pressure on musharraf grows bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : musharraf has been urged to end the state of emergency but as international pressure grows on musharraf 's government to restore democratic rule in pakistan , a senior official said saturday emergency measures were likely to be lifted in a few weeks .
" the law and order situation is fast improving , and if the trend continued the state of emergency will be lifted by the middle or the end of the next month , " the country 's attorney general malik mohammad qayyum told private news channel geo .
" we do not want to make it a permanent feature of our government , " qayyum told other broadcasters .
musharraf announced authoritarian rule largely on the grounds that it would stem rising islamic militancy in pakistan , particularly in the volatile tribal belt bordering afghanistan .
but many believe the main objective of the measure was to prevent the judiciary from ruling against his re-election for the next week by deposing all but four judges of the supreme court . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we do not accept the curbs on the media and we demand that the government immediately withdraw brutal restrictions that have been imposed , " bhutto said in islamabad , amid a continuing blackout of news channels on the country 's cable networks .
bhutto also called upon journalists , lawyers ' associations , trade unionists and civil society organizations to join her in opposition to the military regime of musharraf , an army general who came to power in 1999 .
" our country is passing through dark times and we have mounted a united struggle against dictatorship , " she told around 200 chanting media workers gathered in front of the offices of one of the affected channels .
despite having confined bhutto to her islamabad house on friday , thereby thwarting her plans to lead a mass rally , law enforcers made no moves to prevent her from addressing the journalists .
bhutto urges merkel for support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bhutto called on merkel to use her influence in the crisis she spoke to german mass-circulation tabloid bild on friday in a bid to secure germany 's support for her campaign against musharraf .
" chancellor merkel should exert pressure on musharraf , " bhutto told germany 's mass-circulation bild newspaper .
" we demand the immediate resignation of president musharraf as head of the military and a clear timetable for elections . "
referring to merkel 's visit to us president george w. bush at his ranch in crawford , texas later friday , bhutto added : " chancellor , please inform president bush that the people want democracy in pakistan and not the empty promises that president musharraf makes to us . "
the german government immediately called on musharraf to release bhutto from house arrest , along with the political activists detained in recent days .
" we call on the pakistani leadership also to reverse the numerous arrests of political activists , " foreign ministry spokesman martin jaeger said in berlin .
bundestag condemns crackdown on opposition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier talked of concern over pakistan 's future bundestag members condemned the detention of opposition supporters and members of the judiciary , warning musharraf 's actions were playing into the hands of islamists .
foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said the declaration of a state of emergency was a " severe blow " not only to democracy but also a threat to long-term stability of pakistan .
he added that germany would re-examine its arms exports to pakistan and would also restrict economic assistance to projects which solely benefit the population .
bhutto demands the restoration of the constitution and the release of thousands of political detainees rounded up by security forces since the emergency measures were introduced a week earlier .
despite months of covert talks with musharraf towards a suspected deal that would bolster his political support while bringing her back into government , there is speculation of a real and widening rift behind her trademark rhetoric against the us-backed military leader .
bhutto has said her dialogue with musharraf was suspended when he suspended the constitution and dissolved the supreme court .
international pressure on musharraf grows bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : musharraf has been urged to end the state of emergency but as international pressure grows on musharraf 's government to restore democratic rule in pakistan , a senior official said saturday emergency measures were likely to be lifted in a few weeks .
" the law and order situation is fast improving , and if the trend continued the state of emergency will be lifted by the middle or the end of the next month , " the country 's attorney general malik mohammad qayyum told private news channel geo .
" we do not want to make it a permanent feature of our government , " qayyum told other broadcasters .
musharraf announced authoritarian rule largely on the grounds that it would stem rising islamic militancy in pakistan , particularly in the volatile tribal belt bordering afghanistan .
but many believe the main objective of the measure was to prevent the judiciary from ruling against his re-election for the next week by deposing all but four judges of the supreme court . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german train drivers threatened wider strike action next week after goods services resumed on saturday morning , following a 42-hour shutdown . manfred schell , chairman of the gdl union which called the strike , said passenger services could be hit from tuesday if state-owned rail operator deutsche bahn fails to make a new pay offer .
the union said the strike that began at midday on thursday paralyzed goods traffic in germany 's eastern states and also hit two-thirds of the trains in the west of the country .
deutsche bahn board member norbert bensel said it was " the worst strike we have ever experienced in the rail freight transport sector " and had a knock-on effect in neighboring countries .
" several hundred trains are waiting at international borders to enter germany , " he said shortly before drivers began returning to work at 6 am .
" it is a terrible thing that 1,000 train drivers can threaten germany 's industrial base , " he said , although most large manufacturing companies said production had not been seriously affected by the stoppage .
the union , which represents around 15,500 of germany 's 19,600 train drivers , is seeking a rise of up to 31 per cent in a separate wage contract to the one deutsche bahn signed with two larger unions .
the rail operator rejects this , fearing it could prompt other sectors of the company to demand their own pay deals , making collective bargaining more difficult .
industry relatively unaffected by goods suspension bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : car and steel production continued despite the strike carmakers vw and bmw said production was continuing as normal , while steelmakers thyssenkrupp and salzgitter also said they had been relatively unaffected .
despite being one of the main targets , the north-eastern port of rostock on the baltic coast continued to operate .
gdl boss schell claimed 3,500 goods train drivers had heeded the strike call and that around 1,000 of the 5,000 goods trains that db runs daily had been halted .
schell threatened to expand the strike next week to hit the commuter and long-distance passenger traffic used by around 5 million people daily .

german train drivers threatened wider strike action next week after goods services resumed on saturday morning , following a 42-hour shutdown . manfred schell , chairman of the gdl union which called the strike , said passenger services could be hit from tuesday if state-owned rail operator deutsche bahn fails to make a new pay offer .
the union said the strike that began at midday on thursday paralyzed goods traffic in germany 's eastern states and also hit two-thirds of the trains in the west of the country .
deutsche bahn board member norbert bensel said it was " the worst strike we have ever experienced in the rail freight transport sector " and had a knock-on effect in neighboring countries .
" several hundred trains are waiting at international borders to enter germany , " he said shortly before drivers began returning to work at 6 am .
" it is a terrible thing that 1,000 train drivers can threaten germany 's industrial base , " he said , although most large manufacturing companies said production had not been seriously affected by the stoppage .
the union , which represents around 15,500 of germany 's 19,600 train drivers , is seeking a rise of up to 31 per cent in a separate wage contract to the one deutsche bahn signed with two larger unions .
the rail operator rejects this , fearing it could prompt other sectors of the company to demand their own pay deals , making collective bargaining more difficult .
industry relatively unaffected by goods suspension bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : car and steel production continued despite the strike carmakers vw and bmw said production was continuing as normal , while steelmakers thyssenkrupp and salzgitter also said they had been relatively unaffected .
despite being one of the main targets , the north-eastern port of rostock on the baltic coast continued to operate .
gdl boss schell claimed 3,500 goods train drivers had heeded the strike call and that around 1,000 of the 5,000 goods trains that db runs daily had been halted .
schell threatened to expand the strike next week to hit the commuter and long-distance passenger traffic used by around 5 million people daily .
according to an opinion poll taken by public television , 57 per cent of the population backs the train drivers , while 39 per cent are opposed . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de court rules german train strikes can be expanded in a reveral of a previous ruling , a german court will allow train drivers to expand their strikes to long-haul and freight routes .
there are fears that more strikes could hit the economy hard .
-lrb- 02.11.2007 -rrb- german commuters take to freeways as train drivers strike a day-long national strike called by the union representing most german train drivers caused severe disruption to rail and road transport in most urban areas on friday .
the union is demanding a 30 percent pay increase .

" we do not accept the curbs on the media and we demand that the government immediately withdraw brutal restrictions that have been imposed , " bhutto said in islamabad , amid a continuing blackout of news channels on the country 's cable networks .
bhutto also called upon journalists , lawyers ' associations , trade unionists and civil society organizations to join her in opposition to the military regime of musharraf , an army general who came to power in 1999 .
" our country is passing through dark times and we have mounted a united struggle against dictatorship , " she told around 200 chanting media workers gathered in front of the offices of one of the affected channels .
despite having confined bhutto to her islamabad house on friday , thereby thwarting her plans to lead a mass rally , law enforcers made no moves to prevent her from addressing the journalists .
bhutto urges merkel for support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bhutto called on merkel to use her influence in the crisis she spoke to german mass-circulation tabloid bild on friday in a bid to secure germany 's support for her campaign against musharraf .
" chancellor merkel should exert pressure on musharraf , " bhutto told germany 's mass-circulation bild newspaper .
" we demand the immediate resignation of president musharraf as head of the military and a clear timetable for elections . "
referring to merkel 's visit to us president george w. bush at his ranch in crawford , texas later friday , bhutto added : " chancellor , please inform president bush that the people want democracy in pakistan and not the empty promises that president musharraf makes to us . "
the german government immediately called on musharraf to release bhutto from house arrest , along with the political activists detained in recent days .
" we call on the pakistani leadership also to reverse the numerous arrests of political activists , " foreign ministry spokesman martin jaeger said in berlin .
bundestag condemns crackdown on opposition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier talked of concern over pakistan 's future bundestag members condemned the detention of opposition supporters and members of the judiciary , warning musharraf 's actions were playing into the hands of islamists .
foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said the declaration of a state of emergency was a " severe blow " not only to democracy but also a threat to long-term stability of pakistan .
he added that germany would re-examine its arms exports to pakistan and would also restrict economic assistance to projects which solely benefit the population .
bhutto demands the restoration of the constitution and the release of thousands of political detainees rounded up by security forces since the emergency measures were introduced a week earlier .
despite months of covert talks with musharraf towards a suspected deal that would bolster his political support while bringing her back into government , there is speculation of a real and widening rift behind her trademark rhetoric against the us-backed military leader .
bhutto has said her dialogue with musharraf was suspended when he suspended the constitution and dissolved the supreme court .
international pressure on musharraf grows bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : musharraf has been urged to end the state of emergency but as international pressure grows on musharraf 's government to restore democratic rule in pakistan , a senior official said saturday emergency measures were likely to be lifted in a few weeks .
" the law and order situation is fast improving , and if the trend continued the state of emergency will be lifted by the middle or the end of the next month , " the country 's attorney general malik mohammad qayyum told private news channel geo .
" we do not want to make it a permanent feature of our government , " qayyum told other broadcasters .
musharraf announced authoritarian rule largely on the grounds that it would stem rising islamic militancy in pakistan , particularly in the volatile tribal belt bordering afghanistan .
but many believe the main objective of the measure was to prevent the judiciary from ruling against his re-election for the next week by deposing all but four judges of the supreme court . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he later called a snap presidential election for january 5 .
the european union 's envoy to the south caucasus on saturday called on georgia to lift the state of emergency , restore private media channels and resume dialogue between the government and the opposition .
" the most important point right now is to look forward and that should involve lifting the state of emergency as soon as possible , " peter semneby , the eu special representative to the south caucasus , told reporters .
georgian government officials and the opposition were to officially meet later on saturday for the first time since the clashes to discuss election laws , officials said .
us envoy to fly in to demand end to emergency rule bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-government riots rocked the georgian capital matthew bryza , the us deputy assistant secretary for european and eurasian affairs , was also due to arrive in tbilisi later in the day to insist on an immediate lifting of emergency rule , the us state department said .
meanwhile , badri patarkatsishvili , a prominent georgian businessman who has financed the country 's opposition , said he will run in january 's presidential election .
" i will take part in the election campaign and the presidential election in january 2008 , " patarkatsishvili was quoted as saying in a statement from the bell pottinger group , a london-based public relations agency .
patarkatsishvili said that he would campaign with the slogan " georgia without saakashvili is georgia without terror " and call a referendum on boosting the parliament 's powers , if elected .
media tycoon accused of planning coup bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saakashvili is accused of stamping on democracy georgian authorities earlier said patarkatsishvili , who is believed to be out of the country , was suspected of plotting a coup against saakashvili and that he was wanted for questioning .
the tycoon is co-owner with new york-based news corp. of the private georgian broadcaster imedi , a network seen as sympathetic to the opposition that was taken off the air following the clashes .
in the statement , patarkatsishvili accused saakashvili of cracking down on democracy in georgia and called on the authorities to lift the state of emergency " immediately " and stop " politically motivated criminal cases . "
he also said he could change his mind about running for president if opposition forces united and " put forward a joint candidate with a very clear objective - to defeat the saakashvili regime . "
end of emergency first , candidature second the leader of the opposition republican party , levan berdzenishvili , told reporters after patarkatsishvili 's announcement that opposition forces would only discuss candidatures after emergency is lifted .
georgia 's parliament endorsed saakashvili 's state of emergency ruling on friday , but top officials said they expected it to be lifted much sooner than the approved 15 days , which runs out on november 22 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saakashvili ordered the police out in force saakashvili prompted international condemnation when he ordered the state of emergency after riot police used rubber bullets , tear gas and water cannons to disperse thousands of people who had gathered to call for his resignation .
saakashvili said wednesday 's events were part of a coup attempt masterminded by russia to overthrow his government .
moscow has dismissed the accusation and said saakashvili was looking for a scapegoat for his domestic political troubles .
the georgian leader was in danger this week of seeing his image as one of the most democratic presidents of the former soviet republics tarnished by the brutal police crackdown and imposition of emergency rule .
opponents have accused saakashvili of hoarding power and becoming arrogant since he swept to office after the 2003 pro-democracy uprising dubbed the rose revolution . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we do not accept the curbs on the media and we demand that the government immediately withdraw brutal restrictions that have been imposed , " bhutto said in islamabad , amid a continuing blackout of news channels on the country 's cable networks .
bhutto also called upon journalists , lawyers ' associations , trade unionists and civil society organizations to join her in opposition to the military regime of musharraf , an army general who came to power in 1999 .
" our country is passing through dark times and we have mounted a united struggle against dictatorship , " she told around 200 chanting media workers gathered in front of the offices of one of the affected channels .
despite having confined bhutto to her islamabad house on friday , thereby thwarting her plans to lead a mass rally , law enforcers made no moves to prevent her from addressing the journalists .
bhutto urges merkel for support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bhutto called on merkel to use her influence in the crisis she spoke to german mass-circulation tabloid bild on friday in a bid to secure germany 's support for her campaign against musharraf .
" chancellor merkel should exert pressure on musharraf , " bhutto told germany 's mass-circulation bild newspaper .
" we demand the immediate resignation of president musharraf as head of the military and a clear timetable for elections . "
referring to merkel 's visit to us president george w. bush at his ranch in crawford , texas later friday , bhutto added : " chancellor , please inform president bush that the people want democracy in pakistan and not the empty promises that president musharraf makes to us . "
the german government immediately called on musharraf to release bhutto from house arrest , along with the political activists detained in recent days .
" we call on the pakistani leadership also to reverse the numerous arrests of political activists , " foreign ministry spokesman martin jaeger said in berlin .
bundestag condemns crackdown on opposition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier talked of concern over pakistan 's future bundestag members condemned the detention of opposition supporters and members of the judiciary , warning musharraf 's actions were playing into the hands of islamists .
foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said the declaration of a state of emergency was a " severe blow " not only to democracy but also a threat to long-term stability of pakistan .
he added that germany would re-examine its arms exports to pakistan and would also restrict economic assistance to projects which solely benefit the population .
bhutto demands the restoration of the constitution and the release of thousands of political detainees rounded up by security forces since the emergency measures were introduced a week earlier .
despite months of covert talks with musharraf towards a suspected deal that would bolster his political support while bringing her back into government , there is speculation of a real and widening rift behind her trademark rhetoric against the us-backed military leader .
bhutto has said her dialogue with musharraf was suspended when he suspended the constitution and dissolved the supreme court .
international pressure on musharraf grows bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : musharraf has been urged to end the state of emergency but as international pressure grows on musharraf 's government to restore democratic rule in pakistan , a senior official said saturday emergency measures were likely to be lifted in a few weeks .
" the law and order situation is fast improving , and if the trend continued the state of emergency will be lifted by the middle or the end of the next month , " the country 's attorney general malik mohammad qayyum told private news channel geo .
" we do not want to make it a permanent feature of our government , " qayyum told other broadcasters .
musharraf announced authoritarian rule largely on the grounds that it would stem rising islamic militancy in pakistan , particularly in the volatile tribal belt bordering afghanistan .
but many believe the main objective of the measure was to prevent the judiciary from ruling against his re-election for the next week by deposing all but four judges of the supreme court . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german train drivers threatened wider strike action next week after goods services resumed on saturday morning , following a 42-hour shutdown . manfred schell , chairman of the gdl union which called the strike , said passenger services could be hit from tuesday if state-owned rail operator deutsche bahn fails to make a new pay offer .
the union said the strike that began at midday on thursday paralyzed goods traffic in germany 's eastern states and also hit two-thirds of the trains in the west of the country .
deutsche bahn board member norbert bensel said it was " the worst strike we have ever experienced in the rail freight transport sector " and had a knock-on effect in neighboring countries .
" several hundred trains are waiting at international borders to enter germany , " he said shortly before drivers began returning to work at 6 am .
" it is a terrible thing that 1,000 train drivers can threaten germany 's industrial base , " he said , although most large manufacturing companies said production had not been seriously affected by the stoppage .
the union , which represents around 15,500 of germany 's 19,600 train drivers , is seeking a rise of up to 31 per cent in a separate wage contract to the one deutsche bahn signed with two larger unions .
the rail operator rejects this , fearing it could prompt other sectors of the company to demand their own pay deals , making collective bargaining more difficult .
industry relatively unaffected by goods suspension bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : car and steel production continued despite the strike carmakers vw and bmw said production was continuing as normal , while steelmakers thyssenkrupp and salzgitter also said they had been relatively unaffected .
despite being one of the main targets , the north-eastern port of rostock on the baltic coast continued to operate .
gdl boss schell claimed 3,500 goods train drivers had heeded the strike call and that around 1,000 of the 5,000 goods trains that db runs daily had been halted .
schell threatened to expand the strike next week to hit the commuter and long-distance passenger traffic used by around 5 million people daily .
according to an opinion poll taken by public television , 57 per cent of the population backs the train drivers , while 39 per cent are opposed . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we do not accept the curbs on the media and we demand that the government immediately withdraw brutal restrictions that have been imposed , " bhutto said in islamabad , amid a continuing blackout of news channels on the country 's cable networks .
bhutto also called upon journalists , lawyers ' associations , trade unionists and civil society organizations to join her in opposition to the military regime of musharraf , an army general who came to power in 1999 .
" our country is passing through dark times and we have mounted a united struggle against dictatorship , " she told around 200 chanting media workers gathered in front of the offices of one of the affected channels .
despite having confined bhutto to her islamabad house on friday , thereby thwarting her plans to lead a mass rally , law enforcers made no moves to prevent her from addressing the journalists .
bhutto urges merkel for support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bhutto called on merkel to use her influence in the crisis she spoke to german mass-circulation tabloid bild on friday in a bid to secure germany 's support for her campaign against musharraf .
" chancellor merkel should exert pressure on musharraf , " bhutto told germany 's mass-circulation bild newspaper .
" we demand the immediate resignation of president musharraf as head of the military and a clear timetable for elections . "
referring to merkel 's visit to us president george w. bush at his ranch in crawford , texas later friday , bhutto added : " chancellor , please inform president bush that the people want democracy in pakistan and not the empty promises that president musharraf makes to us . "
the german government immediately called on musharraf to release bhutto from house arrest , along with the political activists detained in recent days .
" we call on the pakistani leadership also to reverse the numerous arrests of political activists , " foreign ministry spokesman martin jaeger said in berlin .
bundestag condemns crackdown on opposition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier talked of concern over pakistan 's future bundestag members condemned the detention of opposition supporters and members of the judiciary , warning musharraf 's actions were playing into the hands of islamists .
foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said the declaration of a state of emergency was a " severe blow " not only to democracy but also a threat to long-term stability of pakistan .
he added that germany would re-examine its arms exports to pakistan and would also restrict economic assistance to projects which solely benefit the population .
bhutto demands the restoration of the constitution and the release of thousands of political detainees rounded up by security forces since the emergency measures were introduced a week earlier .
despite months of covert talks with musharraf towards a suspected deal that would bolster his political support while bringing her back into government , there is speculation of a real and widening rift behind her trademark rhetoric against the us-backed military leader .
bhutto has said her dialogue with musharraf was suspended when he suspended the constitution and dissolved the supreme court .
international pressure on musharraf grows bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : musharraf has been urged to end the state of emergency but as international pressure grows on musharraf 's government to restore democratic rule in pakistan , a senior official said saturday emergency measures were likely to be lifted in a few weeks .
" the law and order situation is fast improving , and if the trend continued the state of emergency will be lifted by the middle or the end of the next month , " the country 's attorney general malik mohammad qayyum told private news channel geo .

" we do not accept the curbs on the media and we demand that the government immediately withdraw brutal restrictions that have been imposed , " bhutto said in islamabad , amid a continuing blackout of news channels on the country 's cable networks .
bhutto also called upon journalists , lawyers ' associations , trade unionists and civil society organizations to join her in opposition to the military regime of musharraf , an army general who came to power in 1999 .
" our country is passing through dark times and we have mounted a united struggle against dictatorship , " she told around 200 chanting media workers gathered in front of the offices of one of the affected channels .
despite having confined bhutto to her islamabad house on friday , thereby thwarting her plans to lead a mass rally , law enforcers made no moves to prevent her from addressing the journalists .
bhutto urges merkel for support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bhutto called on merkel to use her influence in the crisis she spoke to german mass-circulation tabloid bild on friday in a bid to secure germany 's support for her campaign against musharraf .
" chancellor merkel should exert pressure on musharraf , " bhutto told germany 's mass-circulation bild newspaper .
" we demand the immediate resignation of president musharraf as head of the military and a clear timetable for elections . "
referring to merkel 's visit to us president george w. bush at his ranch in crawford , texas later friday , bhutto added : " chancellor , please inform president bush that the people want democracy in pakistan and not the empty promises that president musharraf makes to us . "
the german government immediately called on musharraf to release bhutto from house arrest , along with the political activists detained in recent days .
" we call on the pakistani leadership also to reverse the numerous arrests of political activists , " foreign ministry spokesman martin jaeger said in berlin .
bundestag condemns crackdown on opposition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier talked of concern over pakistan 's future bundestag members condemned the detention of opposition supporters and members of the judiciary , warning musharraf 's actions were playing into the hands of islamists .
foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said the declaration of a state of emergency was a " severe blow " not only to democracy but also a threat to long-term stability of pakistan .
he added that germany would re-examine its arms exports to pakistan and would also restrict economic assistance to projects which solely benefit the population .
bhutto demands the restoration of the constitution and the release of thousands of political detainees rounded up by security forces since the emergency measures were introduced a week earlier .
despite months of covert talks with musharraf towards a suspected deal that would bolster his political support while bringing her back into government , there is speculation of a real and widening rift behind her trademark rhetoric against the us-backed military leader .
bhutto has said her dialogue with musharraf was suspended when he suspended the constitution and dissolved the supreme court .
international pressure on musharraf grows bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : musharraf has been urged to end the state of emergency but as international pressure grows on musharraf 's government to restore democratic rule in pakistan , a senior official said saturday emergency measures were likely to be lifted in a few weeks .
" the law and order situation is fast improving , and if the trend continued the state of emergency will be lifted by the middle or the end of the next month , " the country 's attorney general malik mohammad qayyum told private news channel geo .
" we do not want to make it a permanent feature of our government , " qayyum told other broadcasters .
musharraf announced authoritarian rule largely on the grounds that it would stem rising islamic militancy in pakistan , particularly in the volatile tribal belt bordering afghanistan .

" we do not accept the curbs on the media and we demand that the government immediately withdraw brutal restrictions that have been imposed , " bhutto said in islamabad , amid a continuing blackout of news channels on the country 's cable networks .
bhutto also called upon journalists , lawyers ' associations , trade unionists and civil society organizations to join her in opposition to the military regime of musharraf , an army general who came to power in 1999 .
" our country is passing through dark times and we have mounted a united struggle against dictatorship , " she told around 200 chanting media workers gathered in front of the offices of one of the affected channels .
despite having confined bhutto to her islamabad house on friday , thereby thwarting her plans to lead a mass rally , law enforcers made no moves to prevent her from addressing the journalists .
bhutto urges merkel for support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bhutto called on merkel to use her influence in the crisis she spoke to german mass-circulation tabloid bild on friday in a bid to secure germany 's support for her campaign against musharraf .
" chancellor merkel should exert pressure on musharraf , " bhutto told germany 's mass-circulation bild newspaper .
" we demand the immediate resignation of president musharraf as head of the military and a clear timetable for elections . "
referring to merkel 's visit to us president george w. bush at his ranch in crawford , texas later friday , bhutto added : " chancellor , please inform president bush that the people want democracy in pakistan and not the empty promises that president musharraf makes to us . "
the german government immediately called on musharraf to release bhutto from house arrest , along with the political activists detained in recent days .
" we call on the pakistani leadership also to reverse the numerous arrests of political activists , " foreign ministry spokesman martin jaeger said in berlin .
bundestag condemns crackdown on opposition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier talked of concern over pakistan 's future bundestag members condemned the detention of opposition supporters and members of the judiciary , warning musharraf 's actions were playing into the hands of islamists .
foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said the declaration of a state of emergency was a " severe blow " not only to democracy but also a threat to long-term stability of pakistan .
he added that germany would re-examine its arms exports to pakistan and would also restrict economic assistance to projects which solely benefit the population .
bhutto demands the restoration of the constitution and the release of thousands of political detainees rounded up by security forces since the emergency measures were introduced a week earlier .
despite months of covert talks with musharraf towards a suspected deal that would bolster his political support while bringing her back into government , there is speculation of a real and widening rift behind her trademark rhetoric against the us-backed military leader .
bhutto has said her dialogue with musharraf was suspended when he suspended the constitution and dissolved the supreme court .
international pressure on musharraf grows bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : musharraf has been urged to end the state of emergency but as international pressure grows on musharraf 's government to restore democratic rule in pakistan , a senior official said saturday emergency measures were likely to be lifted in a few weeks .
" the law and order situation is fast improving , and if the trend continued the state of emergency will be lifted by the middle or the end of the next month , " the country 's attorney general malik mohammad qayyum told private news channel geo .
" we do not want to make it a permanent feature of our government , " qayyum told other broadcasters .
musharraf announced authoritarian rule largely on the grounds that it would stem rising islamic militancy in pakistan , particularly in the volatile tribal belt bordering afghanistan .
but many believe the main objective of the measure was to prevent the judiciary from ruling against his re-election for the next week by deposing all but four judges of the supreme court . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german train drivers threatened wider strike action next week after goods services resumed on saturday morning , following a 42-hour shutdown . manfred schell , chairman of the gdl union which called the strike , said passenger services could be hit from tuesday if state-owned rail operator deutsche bahn fails to make a new pay offer .
the union said the strike that began at midday on thursday paralyzed goods traffic in germany 's eastern states and also hit two-thirds of the trains in the west of the country .
deutsche bahn board member norbert bensel said it was " the worst strike we have ever experienced in the rail freight transport sector " and had a knock-on effect in neighboring countries .
" several hundred trains are waiting at international borders to enter germany , " he said shortly before drivers began returning to work at 6 am .
" it is a terrible thing that 1,000 train drivers can threaten germany 's industrial base , " he said , although most large manufacturing companies said production had not been seriously affected by the stoppage .
the union , which represents around 15,500 of germany 's 19,600 train drivers , is seeking a rise of up to 31 per cent in a separate wage contract to the one deutsche bahn signed with two larger unions .
the rail operator rejects this , fearing it could prompt other sectors of the company to demand their own pay deals , making collective bargaining more difficult .

despite being one of the main targets , the north-eastern port of rostock on the baltic coast continued to operate .
gdl boss schell claimed 3,500 goods train drivers had heeded the strike call and that around 1,000 of the 5,000 goods trains that db runs daily had been halted .
schell threatened to expand the strike next week to hit the commuter and long-distance passenger traffic used by around 5 million people daily .

german train drivers threatened wider strike action next week after goods services resumed on saturday morning , following a 42-hour shutdown . manfred schell , chairman of the gdl union which called the strike , said passenger services could be hit from tuesday if state-owned rail operator deutsche bahn fails to make a new pay offer .
the union said the strike that began at midday on thursday paralyzed goods traffic in germany 's eastern states and also hit two-thirds of the trains in the west of the country .
deutsche bahn board member norbert bensel said it was " the worst strike we have ever experienced in the rail freight transport sector " and had a knock-on effect in neighboring countries .
" several hundred trains are waiting at international borders to enter germany , " he said shortly before drivers began returning to work at 6 am .
" it is a terrible thing that 1,000 train drivers can threaten germany 's industrial base , " he said , although most large manufacturing companies said production had not been seriously affected by the stoppage .
the union , which represents around 15,500 of germany 's 19,600 train drivers , is seeking a rise of up to 31 per cent in a separate wage contract to the one deutsche bahn signed with two larger unions .
the rail operator rejects this , fearing it could prompt other sectors of the company to demand their own pay deals , making collective bargaining more difficult .
industry relatively unaffected by goods suspension bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : car and steel production continued despite the strike carmakers vw and bmw said production was continuing as normal , while steelmakers thyssenkrupp and salzgitter also said they had been relatively unaffected .
despite being one of the main targets , the north-eastern port of rostock on the baltic coast continued to operate .
gdl boss schell claimed 3,500 goods train drivers had heeded the strike call and that around 1,000 of the 5,000 goods trains that db runs daily had been halted .
schell threatened to expand the strike next week to hit the commuter and long-distance passenger traffic used by around 5 million people daily .
according to an opinion poll taken by public television , 57 per cent of the population backs the train drivers , while 39 per cent are opposed . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we do not accept the curbs on the media and we demand that the government immediately withdraw brutal restrictions that have been imposed , " bhutto said in islamabad , amid a continuing blackout of news channels on the country 's cable networks .
bhutto also called upon journalists , lawyers ' associations , trade unionists and civil society organizations to join her in opposition to the military regime of musharraf , an army general who came to power in 1999 .
" our country is passing through dark times and we have mounted a united struggle against dictatorship , " she told around 200 chanting media workers gathered in front of the offices of one of the affected channels .
despite having confined bhutto to her islamabad house on friday , thereby thwarting her plans to lead a mass rally , law enforcers made no moves to prevent her from addressing the journalists .
bhutto urges merkel for support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bhutto called on merkel to use her influence in the crisis she spoke to german mass-circulation tabloid bild on friday in a bid to secure germany 's support for her campaign against musharraf .
" chancellor merkel should exert pressure on musharraf , " bhutto told germany 's mass-circulation bild newspaper .
" we demand the immediate resignation of president musharraf as head of the military and a clear timetable for elections . "
referring to merkel 's visit to us president george w. bush at his ranch in crawford , texas later friday , bhutto added : " chancellor , please inform president bush that the people want democracy in pakistan and not the empty promises that president musharraf makes to us . "
the german government immediately called on musharraf to release bhutto from house arrest , along with the political activists detained in recent days .
" we call on the pakistani leadership also to reverse the numerous arrests of political activists , " foreign ministry spokesman martin jaeger said in berlin .
bundestag condemns crackdown on opposition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier talked of concern over pakistan 's future bundestag members condemned the detention of opposition supporters and members of the judiciary , warning musharraf 's actions were playing into the hands of islamists .
foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said the declaration of a state of emergency was a " severe blow " not only to democracy but also a threat to long-term stability of pakistan .
he added that germany would re-examine its arms exports to pakistan and would also restrict economic assistance to projects which solely benefit the population .
bhutto demands the restoration of the constitution and the release of thousands of political detainees rounded up by security forces since the emergency measures were introduced a week earlier .
despite months of covert talks with musharraf towards a suspected deal that would bolster his political support while bringing her back into government , there is speculation of a real and widening rift behind her trademark rhetoric against the us-backed military leader .
bhutto has said her dialogue with musharraf was suspended when he suspended the constitution and dissolved the supreme court .
international pressure on musharraf grows bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : musharraf has been urged to end the state of emergency but as international pressure grows on musharraf 's government to restore democratic rule in pakistan , a senior official said saturday emergency measures were likely to be lifted in a few weeks .
" the law and order situation is fast improving , and if the trend continued the state of emergency will be lifted by the middle or the end of the next month , " the country 's attorney general malik mohammad qayyum told private news channel geo .
" we do not want to make it a permanent feature of our government , " qayyum told other broadcasters .
musharraf announced authoritarian rule largely on the grounds that it would stem rising islamic militancy in pakistan , particularly in the volatile tribal belt bordering afghanistan .
but many believe the main objective of the measure was to prevent the judiciary from ruling against his re-election for the next week by deposing all but four judges of the supreme court . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" our country is passing through dark times and we have mounted a united struggle against dictatorship , " she told around 200 chanting media workers gathered in front of the offices of one of the affected channels .
despite having confined bhutto to her islamabad house on friday , thereby thwarting her plans to lead a mass rally , law enforcers made no moves to prevent her from addressing the journalists .
bhutto urges merkel for support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bhutto called on merkel to use her influence in the crisis she spoke to german mass-circulation tabloid bild on friday in a bid to secure germany 's support for her campaign against musharraf .
" chancellor merkel should exert pressure on musharraf , " bhutto told germany 's mass-circulation bild newspaper .
" we demand the immediate resignation of president musharraf as head of the military and a clear timetable for elections . "
referring to merkel 's visit to us president george w. bush at his ranch in crawford , texas later friday , bhutto added : " chancellor , please inform president bush that the people want democracy in pakistan and not the empty promises that president musharraf makes to us . "
the german government immediately called on musharraf to release bhutto from house arrest , along with the political activists detained in recent days .
" we call on the pakistani leadership also to reverse the numerous arrests of political activists , " foreign ministry spokesman martin jaeger said in berlin .
bundestag condemns crackdown on opposition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier talked of concern over pakistan 's future bundestag members condemned the detention of opposition supporters and members of the judiciary , warning musharraf 's actions were playing into the hands of islamists .
foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said the declaration of a state of emergency was a " severe blow " not only to democracy but also a threat to long-term stability of pakistan .
he added that germany would re-examine its arms exports to pakistan and would also restrict economic assistance to projects which solely benefit the population .
bhutto demands the restoration of the constitution and the release of thousands of political detainees rounded up by security forces since the emergency measures were introduced a week earlier .
despite months of covert talks with musharraf towards a suspected deal that would bolster his political support while bringing her back into government , there is speculation of a real and widening rift behind her trademark rhetoric against the us-backed military leader .
bhutto has said her dialogue with musharraf was suspended when he suspended the constitution and dissolved the supreme court .
international pressure on musharraf grows bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : musharraf has been urged to end the state of emergency but as international pressure grows on musharraf 's government to restore democratic rule in pakistan , a senior official said saturday emergency measures were likely to be lifted in a few weeks .
" the law and order situation is fast improving , and if the trend continued the state of emergency will be lifted by the middle or the end of the next month , " the country 's attorney general malik mohammad qayyum told private news channel geo .
" we do not want to make it a permanent feature of our government , " qayyum told other broadcasters .
musharraf announced authoritarian rule largely on the grounds that it would stem rising islamic militancy in pakistan , particularly in the volatile tribal belt bordering afghanistan .
but many believe the main objective of the measure was to prevent the judiciary from ruling against his re-election for the next week by deposing all but four judges of the supreme court . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german train drivers threatened wider strike action next week after goods services resumed on saturday morning , following a 42-hour shutdown . manfred schell , chairman of the gdl union which called the strike , said passenger services could be hit from tuesday if state-owned rail operator deutsche bahn fails to make a new pay offer .
the union said the strike that began at midday on thursday paralyzed goods traffic in germany 's eastern states and also hit two-thirds of the trains in the west of the country .
deutsche bahn board member norbert bensel said it was " the worst strike we have ever experienced in the rail freight transport sector " and had a knock-on effect in neighboring countries .
" several hundred trains are waiting at international borders to enter germany , " he said shortly before drivers began returning to work at 6 am .
" it is a terrible thing that 1,000 train drivers can threaten germany 's industrial base , " he said , although most large manufacturing companies said production had not been seriously affected by the stoppage .
the union , which represents around 15,500 of germany 's 19,600 train drivers , is seeking a rise of up to 31 per cent in a separate wage contract to the one deutsche bahn signed with two larger unions .
the rail operator rejects this , fearing it could prompt other sectors of the company to demand their own pay deals , making collective bargaining more difficult .
industry relatively unaffected by goods suspension bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : car and steel production continued despite the strike carmakers vw and bmw said production was continuing as normal , while steelmakers thyssenkrupp and salzgitter also said they had been relatively unaffected .
despite being one of the main targets , the north-eastern port of rostock on the baltic coast continued to operate .
gdl boss schell claimed 3,500 goods train drivers had heeded the strike call and that around 1,000 of the 5,000 goods trains that db runs daily had been halted .
schell threatened to expand the strike next week to hit the commuter and long-distance passenger traffic used by around 5 million people daily .
according to an opinion poll taken by public television , 57 per cent of the population backs the train drivers , while 39 per cent are opposed . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he later called a snap presidential election for january 5 .
the european union 's envoy to the south caucasus on saturday called on georgia to lift the state of emergency , restore private media channels and resume dialogue between the government and the opposition .
" the most important point right now is to look forward and that should involve lifting the state of emergency as soon as possible , " peter semneby , the eu special representative to the south caucasus , told reporters .
georgian government officials and the opposition were to officially meet later on saturday for the first time since the clashes to discuss election laws , officials said .
us envoy to fly in to demand end to emergency rule bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-government riots rocked the georgian capital matthew bryza , the us deputy assistant secretary for european and eurasian affairs , was also due to arrive in tbilisi later in the day to insist on an immediate lifting of emergency rule , the us state department said .
meanwhile , badri patarkatsishvili , a prominent georgian businessman who has financed the country 's opposition , said he will run in january 's presidential election .
" i will take part in the election campaign and the presidential election in january 2008 , " patarkatsishvili was quoted as saying in a statement from the bell pottinger group , a london-based public relations agency .
patarkatsishvili said that he would campaign with the slogan " georgia without saakashvili is georgia without terror " and call a referendum on boosting the parliament 's powers , if elected .
media tycoon accused of planning coup bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saakashvili is accused of stamping on democracy georgian authorities earlier said patarkatsishvili , who is believed to be out of the country , was suspected of plotting a coup against saakashvili and that he was wanted for questioning .
the tycoon is co-owner with new york-based news corp. of the private georgian broadcaster imedi , a network seen as sympathetic to the opposition that was taken off the air following the clashes .
in the statement , patarkatsishvili accused saakashvili of cracking down on democracy in georgia and called on the authorities to lift the state of emergency " immediately " and stop " politically motivated criminal cases . "
he also said he could change his mind about running for president if opposition forces united and " put forward a joint candidate with a very clear objective - to defeat the saakashvili regime . "
end of emergency first , candidature second the leader of the opposition republican party , levan berdzenishvili , told reporters after patarkatsishvili 's announcement that opposition forces would only discuss candidatures after emergency is lifted .
georgia 's parliament endorsed saakashvili 's state of emergency ruling on friday , but top officials said they expected it to be lifted much sooner than the approved 15 days , which runs out on november 22 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saakashvili ordered the police out in force saakashvili prompted international condemnation when he ordered the state of emergency after riot police used rubber bullets , tear gas and water cannons to disperse thousands of people who had gathered to call for his resignation .
saakashvili said wednesday 's events were part of a coup attempt masterminded by russia to overthrow his government .
moscow has dismissed the accusation and said saakashvili was looking for a scapegoat for his domestic political troubles .
the georgian leader was in danger this week of seeing his image as one of the most democratic presidents of the former soviet republics tarnished by the brutal police crackdown and imposition of emergency rule .
opponents have accused saakashvili of hoarding power and becoming arrogant since he swept to office after the 2003 pro-democracy uprising dubbed the rose revolution . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he later called a snap presidential election for january 5 .
the european union 's envoy to the south caucasus on saturday called on georgia to lift the state of emergency , restore private media channels and resume dialogue between the government and the opposition .
" the most important point right now is to look forward and that should involve lifting the state of emergency as soon as possible , " peter semneby , the eu special representative to the south caucasus , told reporters .
georgian government officials and the opposition were to officially meet later on saturday for the first time since the clashes to discuss election laws , officials said .
us envoy to fly in to demand end to emergency rule bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-government riots rocked the georgian capital matthew bryza , the us deputy assistant secretary for european and eurasian affairs , was also due to arrive in tbilisi later in the day to insist on an immediate lifting of emergency rule , the us state department said .
meanwhile , badri patarkatsishvili , a prominent georgian businessman who has financed the country 's opposition , said he will run in january 's presidential election .
" i will take part in the election campaign and the presidential election in january 2008 , " patarkatsishvili was quoted as saying in a statement from the bell pottinger group , a london-based public relations agency .
patarkatsishvili said that he would campaign with the slogan " georgia without saakashvili is georgia without terror " and call a referendum on boosting the parliament 's powers , if elected .
media tycoon accused of planning coup bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saakashvili is accused of stamping on democracy georgian authorities earlier said patarkatsishvili , who is believed to be out of the country , was suspected of plotting a coup against saakashvili and that he was wanted for questioning .
the tycoon is co-owner with new york-based news corp. of the private georgian broadcaster imedi , a network seen as sympathetic to the opposition that was taken off the air following the clashes .
in the statement , patarkatsishvili accused saakashvili of cracking down on democracy in georgia and called on the authorities to lift the state of emergency " immediately " and stop " politically motivated criminal cases . "
he also said he could change his mind about running for president if opposition forces united and " put forward a joint candidate with a very clear objective - to defeat the saakashvili regime . "
end of emergency first , candidature second the leader of the opposition republican party , levan berdzenishvili , told reporters after patarkatsishvili 's announcement that opposition forces would only discuss candidatures after emergency is lifted .
georgia 's parliament endorsed saakashvili 's state of emergency ruling on friday , but top officials said they expected it to be lifted much sooner than the approved 15 days , which runs out on november 22 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saakashvili ordered the police out in force saakashvili prompted international condemnation when he ordered the state of emergency after riot police used rubber bullets , tear gas and water cannons to disperse thousands of people who had gathered to call for his resignation .
saakashvili said wednesday 's events were part of a coup attempt masterminded by russia to overthrow his government .
moscow has dismissed the accusation and said saakashvili was looking for a scapegoat for his domestic political troubles .
the georgian leader was in danger this week of seeing his image as one of the most democratic presidents of the former soviet republics tarnished by the brutal police crackdown and imposition of emergency rule .
opponents have accused saakashvili of hoarding power and becoming arrogant since he swept to office after the 2003 pro-democracy uprising dubbed the rose revolution . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we do not accept the curbs on the media and we demand that the government immediately withdraw brutal restrictions that have been imposed , " bhutto said in islamabad , amid a continuing blackout of news channels on the country 's cable networks .
bhutto also called upon journalists , lawyers ' associations , trade unionists and civil society organizations to join her in opposition to the military regime of musharraf , an army general who came to power in 1999 .
" our country is passing through dark times and we have mounted a united struggle against dictatorship , " she told around 200 chanting media workers gathered in front of the offices of one of the affected channels .
despite having confined bhutto to her islamabad house on friday , thereby thwarting her plans to lead a mass rally , law enforcers made no moves to prevent her from addressing the journalists .
bhutto urges merkel for support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bhutto called on merkel to use her influence in the crisis she spoke to german mass-circulation tabloid bild on friday in a bid to secure germany 's support for her campaign against musharraf .
" chancellor merkel should exert pressure on musharraf , " bhutto told germany 's mass-circulation bild newspaper .
" we demand the immediate resignation of president musharraf as head of the military and a clear timetable for elections . "
referring to merkel 's visit to us president george w. bush at his ranch in crawford , texas later friday , bhutto added : " chancellor , please inform president bush that the people want democracy in pakistan and not the empty promises that president musharraf makes to us . "
the german government immediately called on musharraf to release bhutto from house arrest , along with the political activists detained in recent days .
" we call on the pakistani leadership also to reverse the numerous arrests of political activists , " foreign ministry spokesman martin jaeger said in berlin .
bundestag condemns crackdown on opposition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier talked of concern over pakistan 's future bundestag members condemned the detention of opposition supporters and members of the judiciary , warning musharraf 's actions were playing into the hands of islamists .
foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said the declaration of a state of emergency was a " severe blow " not only to democracy but also a threat to long-term stability of pakistan .
he added that germany would re-examine its arms exports to pakistan and would also restrict economic assistance to projects which solely benefit the population .
bhutto demands the restoration of the constitution and the release of thousands of political detainees rounded up by security forces since the emergency measures were introduced a week earlier .
despite months of covert talks with musharraf towards a suspected deal that would bolster his political support while bringing her back into government , there is speculation of a real and widening rift behind her trademark rhetoric against the us-backed military leader .
bhutto has said her dialogue with musharraf was suspended when he suspended the constitution and dissolved the supreme court .
international pressure on musharraf grows bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : musharraf has been urged to end the state of emergency but as international pressure grows on musharraf 's government to restore democratic rule in pakistan , a senior official said saturday emergency measures were likely to be lifted in a few weeks .

" we do not want to make it a permanent feature of our government , " qayyum told other broadcasters .
musharraf announced authoritarian rule largely on the grounds that it would stem rising islamic militancy in pakistan , particularly in the volatile tribal belt bordering afghanistan .
but many believe the main objective of the measure was to prevent the judiciary from ruling against his re-election for the next week by deposing all but four judges of the supreme court . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" our country is passing through dark times and we have mounted a united struggle against dictatorship , " she told around 200 chanting media workers gathered in front of the offices of one of the affected channels .

he later called a snap presidential election for january 5 .
the european union 's envoy to the south caucasus on saturday called on georgia to lift the state of emergency , restore private media channels and resume dialogue between the government and the opposition .
" the most important point right now is to look forward and that should involve lifting the state of emergency as soon as possible , " peter semneby , the eu special representative to the south caucasus , told reporters .

meanwhile , badri patarkatsishvili , a prominent georgian businessman who has financed the country 's opposition , said he will run in january 's presidential election .

he also said he could change his mind about running for president if opposition forces united and " put forward a joint candidate with a very clear objective - to defeat the saakashvili regime . "
end of emergency first , candidature second the leader of the opposition republican party , levan berdzenishvili , told reporters after patarkatsishvili 's announcement that opposition forces would only discuss candidatures after emergency is lifted .

moscow has dismissed the accusation and said saakashvili was looking for a scapegoat for his domestic political troubles .
the georgian leader was in danger this week of seeing his image as one of the most democratic presidents of the former soviet republics tarnished by the brutal police crackdown and imposition of emergency rule .

he later called a snap presidential election for january 5 .
the european union 's envoy to the south caucasus on saturday called on georgia to lift the state of emergency , restore private media channels and resume dialogue between the government and the opposition .
" the most important point right now is to look forward and that should involve lifting the state of emergency as soon as possible , " peter semneby , the eu special representative to the south caucasus , told reporters .
georgian government officials and the opposition were to officially meet later on saturday for the first time since the clashes to discuss election laws , officials said .

in the statement , patarkatsishvili accused saakashvili of cracking down on democracy in georgia and called on the authorities to lift the state of emergency " immediately " and stop " politically motivated criminal cases . "

" we do not accept the curbs on the media and we demand that the government immediately withdraw brutal restrictions that have been imposed , " bhutto said in islamabad , amid a continuing blackout of news channels on the country 's cable networks .
bhutto also called upon journalists , lawyers ' associations , trade unionists and civil society organizations to join her in opposition to the military regime of musharraf , an army general who came to power in 1999 .
" our country is passing through dark times and we have mounted a united struggle against dictatorship , " she told around 200 chanting media workers gathered in front of the offices of one of the affected channels .
despite having confined bhutto to her islamabad house on friday , thereby thwarting her plans to lead a mass rally , law enforcers made no moves to prevent her from addressing the journalists .
bhutto urges merkel for support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bhutto called on merkel to use her influence in the crisis she spoke to german mass-circulation tabloid bild on friday in a bid to secure germany 's support for her campaign against musharraf .
" chancellor merkel should exert pressure on musharraf , " bhutto told germany 's mass-circulation bild newspaper .
" we demand the immediate resignation of president musharraf as head of the military and a clear timetable for elections . "
referring to merkel 's visit to us president george w. bush at his ranch in crawford , texas later friday , bhutto added : " chancellor , please inform president bush that the people want democracy in pakistan and not the empty promises that president musharraf makes to us . "
the german government immediately called on musharraf to release bhutto from house arrest , along with the political activists detained in recent days .
" we call on the pakistani leadership also to reverse the numerous arrests of political activists , " foreign ministry spokesman martin jaeger said in berlin .
bundestag condemns crackdown on opposition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier talked of concern over pakistan 's future bundestag members condemned the detention of opposition supporters and members of the judiciary , warning musharraf 's actions were playing into the hands of islamists .
foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said the declaration of a state of emergency was a " severe blow " not only to democracy but also a threat to long-term stability of pakistan .
he added that germany would re-examine its arms exports to pakistan and would also restrict economic assistance to projects which solely benefit the population .
bhutto demands the restoration of the constitution and the release of thousands of political detainees rounded up by security forces since the emergency measures were introduced a week earlier .
despite months of covert talks with musharraf towards a suspected deal that would bolster his political support while bringing her back into government , there is speculation of a real and widening rift behind her trademark rhetoric against the us-backed military leader .
bhutto has said her dialogue with musharraf was suspended when he suspended the constitution and dissolved the supreme court .
international pressure on musharraf grows bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : musharraf has been urged to end the state of emergency but as international pressure grows on musharraf 's government to restore democratic rule in pakistan , a senior official said saturday emergency measures were likely to be lifted in a few weeks .
" the law and order situation is fast improving , and if the trend continued the state of emergency will be lifted by the middle or the end of the next month , " the country 's attorney general malik mohammad qayyum told private news channel geo .
" we do not want to make it a permanent feature of our government , " qayyum told other broadcasters .
musharraf announced authoritarian rule largely on the grounds that it would stem rising islamic militancy in pakistan , particularly in the volatile tribal belt bordering afghanistan .
but many believe the main objective of the measure was to prevent the judiciary from ruling against his re-election for the next week by deposing all but four judges of the supreme court . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german train drivers threatened wider strike action next week after goods services resumed on saturday morning , following a 42-hour shutdown . manfred schell , chairman of the gdl union which called the strike , said passenger services could be hit from tuesday if state-owned rail operator deutsche bahn fails to make a new pay offer .
the union said the strike that began at midday on thursday paralyzed goods traffic in germany 's eastern states and also hit two-thirds of the trains in the west of the country .
deutsche bahn board member norbert bensel said it was " the worst strike we have ever experienced in the rail freight transport sector " and had a knock-on effect in neighboring countries .
" several hundred trains are waiting at international borders to enter germany , " he said shortly before drivers began returning to work at 6 am .
" it is a terrible thing that 1,000 train drivers can threaten germany 's industrial base , " he said , although most large manufacturing companies said production had not been seriously affected by the stoppage .
the union , which represents around 15,500 of germany 's 19,600 train drivers , is seeking a rise of up to 31 per cent in a separate wage contract to the one deutsche bahn signed with two larger unions .
the rail operator rejects this , fearing it could prompt other sectors of the company to demand their own pay deals , making collective bargaining more difficult .
industry relatively unaffected by goods suspension bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : car and steel production continued despite the strike carmakers vw and bmw said production was continuing as normal , while steelmakers thyssenkrupp and salzgitter also said they had been relatively unaffected .
despite being one of the main targets , the north-eastern port of rostock on the baltic coast continued to operate .
gdl boss schell claimed 3,500 goods train drivers had heeded the strike call and that around 1,000 of the 5,000 goods trains that db runs daily had been halted .
schell threatened to expand the strike next week to hit the commuter and long-distance passenger traffic used by around 5 million people daily .
according to an opinion poll taken by public television , 57 per cent of the population backs the train drivers , while 39 per cent are opposed . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german train drivers threatened wider strike action next week after goods services resumed on saturday morning , following a 42-hour shutdown . manfred schell , chairman of the gdl union which called the strike , said passenger services could be hit from tuesday if state-owned rail operator deutsche bahn fails to make a new pay offer .
the union said the strike that began at midday on thursday paralyzed goods traffic in germany 's eastern states and also hit two-thirds of the trains in the west of the country .
deutsche bahn board member norbert bensel said it was " the worst strike we have ever experienced in the rail freight transport sector " and had a knock-on effect in neighboring countries .
" several hundred trains are waiting at international borders to enter germany , " he said shortly before drivers began returning to work at 6 am .
" it is a terrible thing that 1,000 train drivers can threaten germany 's industrial base , " he said , although most large manufacturing companies said production had not been seriously affected by the stoppage .
the union , which represents around 15,500 of germany 's 19,600 train drivers , is seeking a rise of up to 31 per cent in a separate wage contract to the one deutsche bahn signed with two larger unions .
the rail operator rejects this , fearing it could prompt other sectors of the company to demand their own pay deals , making collective bargaining more difficult .
industry relatively unaffected by goods suspension bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : car and steel production continued despite the strike carmakers vw and bmw said production was continuing as normal , while steelmakers thyssenkrupp and salzgitter also said they had been relatively unaffected .
despite being one of the main targets , the north-eastern port of rostock on the baltic coast continued to operate .
gdl boss schell claimed 3,500 goods train drivers had heeded the strike call and that around 1,000 of the 5,000 goods trains that db runs daily had been halted .
schell threatened to expand the strike next week to hit the commuter and long-distance passenger traffic used by around 5 million people daily .

" we do not accept the curbs on the media and we demand that the government immediately withdraw brutal restrictions that have been imposed , " bhutto said in islamabad , amid a continuing blackout of news channels on the country 's cable networks .
bhutto also called upon journalists , lawyers ' associations , trade unionists and civil society organizations to join her in opposition to the military regime of musharraf , an army general who came to power in 1999 .
" our country is passing through dark times and we have mounted a united struggle against dictatorship , " she told around 200 chanting media workers gathered in front of the offices of one of the affected channels .
despite having confined bhutto to her islamabad house on friday , thereby thwarting her plans to lead a mass rally , law enforcers made no moves to prevent her from addressing the journalists .
bhutto urges merkel for support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bhutto called on merkel to use her influence in the crisis she spoke to german mass-circulation tabloid bild on friday in a bid to secure germany 's support for her campaign against musharraf .
" chancellor merkel should exert pressure on musharraf , " bhutto told germany 's mass-circulation bild newspaper .
" we demand the immediate resignation of president musharraf as head of the military and a clear timetable for elections . "
referring to merkel 's visit to us president george w. bush at his ranch in crawford , texas later friday , bhutto added : " chancellor , please inform president bush that the people want democracy in pakistan and not the empty promises that president musharraf makes to us . "
the german government immediately called on musharraf to release bhutto from house arrest , along with the political activists detained in recent days .
" we call on the pakistani leadership also to reverse the numerous arrests of political activists , " foreign ministry spokesman martin jaeger said in berlin .
bundestag condemns crackdown on opposition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier talked of concern over pakistan 's future bundestag members condemned the detention of opposition supporters and members of the judiciary , warning musharraf 's actions were playing into the hands of islamists .
foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said the declaration of a state of emergency was a " severe blow " not only to democracy but also a threat to long-term stability of pakistan .
he added that germany would re-examine its arms exports to pakistan and would also restrict economic assistance to projects which solely benefit the population .
bhutto demands the restoration of the constitution and the release of thousands of political detainees rounded up by security forces since the emergency measures were introduced a week earlier .
despite months of covert talks with musharraf towards a suspected deal that would bolster his political support while bringing her back into government , there is speculation of a real and widening rift behind her trademark rhetoric against the us-backed military leader .
bhutto has said her dialogue with musharraf was suspended when he suspended the constitution and dissolved the supreme court .
international pressure on musharraf grows bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : musharraf has been urged to end the state of emergency but as international pressure grows on musharraf 's government to restore democratic rule in pakistan , a senior official said saturday emergency measures were likely to be lifted in a few weeks .
" the law and order situation is fast improving , and if the trend continued the state of emergency will be lifted by the middle or the end of the next month , " the country 's attorney general malik mohammad qayyum told private news channel geo .
" we do not want to make it a permanent feature of our government , " qayyum told other broadcasters .

" we do not accept the curbs on the media and we demand that the government immediately withdraw brutal restrictions that have been imposed , " bhutto said in islamabad , amid a continuing blackout of news channels on the country 's cable networks .
bhutto also called upon journalists , lawyers ' associations , trade unionists and civil society organizations to join her in opposition to the military regime of musharraf , an army general who came to power in 1999 .
" our country is passing through dark times and we have mounted a united struggle against dictatorship , " she told around 200 chanting media workers gathered in front of the offices of one of the affected channels .
despite having confined bhutto to her islamabad house on friday , thereby thwarting her plans to lead a mass rally , law enforcers made no moves to prevent her from addressing the journalists .
bhutto urges merkel for support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bhutto called on merkel to use her influence in the crisis she spoke to german mass-circulation tabloid bild on friday in a bid to secure germany 's support for her campaign against musharraf .
" chancellor merkel should exert pressure on musharraf , " bhutto told germany 's mass-circulation bild newspaper .
" we demand the immediate resignation of president musharraf as head of the military and a clear timetable for elections . "
referring to merkel 's visit to us president george w. bush at his ranch in crawford , texas later friday , bhutto added : " chancellor , please inform president bush that the people want democracy in pakistan and not the empty promises that president musharraf makes to us . "
the german government immediately called on musharraf to release bhutto from house arrest , along with the political activists detained in recent days .
" we call on the pakistani leadership also to reverse the numerous arrests of political activists , " foreign ministry spokesman martin jaeger said in berlin .
bundestag condemns crackdown on opposition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier talked of concern over pakistan 's future bundestag members condemned the detention of opposition supporters and members of the judiciary , warning musharraf 's actions were playing into the hands of islamists .
foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said the declaration of a state of emergency was a " severe blow " not only to democracy but also a threat to long-term stability of pakistan .
he added that germany would re-examine its arms exports to pakistan and would also restrict economic assistance to projects which solely benefit the population .
bhutto demands the restoration of the constitution and the release of thousands of political detainees rounded up by security forces since the emergency measures were introduced a week earlier .
despite months of covert talks with musharraf towards a suspected deal that would bolster his political support while bringing her back into government , there is speculation of a real and widening rift behind her trademark rhetoric against the us-backed military leader .
bhutto has said her dialogue with musharraf was suspended when he suspended the constitution and dissolved the supreme court .
international pressure on musharraf grows bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : musharraf has been urged to end the state of emergency but as international pressure grows on musharraf 's government to restore democratic rule in pakistan , a senior official said saturday emergency measures were likely to be lifted in a few weeks .
" the law and order situation is fast improving , and if the trend continued the state of emergency will be lifted by the middle or the end of the next month , " the country 's attorney general malik mohammad qayyum told private news channel geo .
" we do not want to make it a permanent feature of our government , " qayyum told other broadcasters .
musharraf announced authoritarian rule largely on the grounds that it would stem rising islamic militancy in pakistan , particularly in the volatile tribal belt bordering afghanistan .

german train drivers threatened wider strike action next week after goods services resumed on saturday morning , following a 42-hour shutdown . manfred schell , chairman of the gdl union which called the strike , said passenger services could be hit from tuesday if state-owned rail operator deutsche bahn fails to make a new pay offer .
the union said the strike that began at midday on thursday paralyzed goods traffic in germany 's eastern states and also hit two-thirds of the trains in the west of the country .
deutsche bahn board member norbert bensel said it was " the worst strike we have ever experienced in the rail freight transport sector " and had a knock-on effect in neighboring countries .
" several hundred trains are waiting at international borders to enter germany , " he said shortly before drivers began returning to work at 6 am .
" it is a terrible thing that 1,000 train drivers can threaten germany 's industrial base , " he said , although most large manufacturing companies said production had not been seriously affected by the stoppage .
the union , which represents around 15,500 of germany 's 19,600 train drivers , is seeking a rise of up to 31 per cent in a separate wage contract to the one deutsche bahn signed with two larger unions .
the rail operator rejects this , fearing it could prompt other sectors of the company to demand their own pay deals , making collective bargaining more difficult .

despite being one of the main targets , the north-eastern port of rostock on the baltic coast continued to operate .
gdl boss schell claimed 3,500 goods train drivers had heeded the strike call and that around 1,000 of the 5,000 goods trains that db runs daily had been halted .
schell threatened to expand the strike next week to hit the commuter and long-distance passenger traffic used by around 5 million people daily .

deutsche bahn board member norbert bensel said it was " the worst strike we have ever experienced in the rail freight transport sector " and had a knock-on effect in neighboring countries .
" several hundred trains are waiting at international borders to enter germany , " he said shortly before drivers began returning to work at 6 am .
" it is a terrible thing that 1,000 train drivers can threaten germany 's industrial base , " he said , although most large manufacturing companies said production had not been seriously affected by the stoppage .
the union , which represents around 15,500 of germany 's 19,600 train drivers , is seeking a rise of up to 31 per cent in a separate wage contract to the one deutsche bahn signed with two larger unions .
the rail operator rejects this , fearing it could prompt other sectors of the company to demand their own pay deals , making collective bargaining more difficult .

despite being one of the main targets , the north-eastern port of rostock on the baltic coast continued to operate .
gdl boss schell claimed 3,500 goods train drivers had heeded the strike call and that around 1,000 of the 5,000 goods trains that db runs daily had been halted .
schell threatened to expand the strike next week to hit the commuter and long-distance passenger traffic used by around 5 million people daily .

german train drivers threatened wider strike action next week after goods services resumed on saturday morning , following a 42-hour shutdown . manfred schell , chairman of the gdl union which called the strike , said passenger services could be hit from tuesday if state-owned rail operator deutsche bahn fails to make a new pay offer .
the union said the strike that began at midday on thursday paralyzed goods traffic in germany 's eastern states and also hit two-thirds of the trains in the west of the country .
deutsche bahn board member norbert bensel said it was " the worst strike we have ever experienced in the rail freight transport sector " and had a knock-on effect in neighboring countries .
" several hundred trains are waiting at international borders to enter germany , " he said shortly before drivers began returning to work at 6 am .
" it is a terrible thing that 1,000 train drivers can threaten germany 's industrial base , " he said , although most large manufacturing companies said production had not been seriously affected by the stoppage .
the union , which represents around 15,500 of germany 's 19,600 train drivers , is seeking a rise of up to 31 per cent in a separate wage contract to the one deutsche bahn signed with two larger unions .
the rail operator rejects this , fearing it could prompt other sectors of the company to demand their own pay deals , making collective bargaining more difficult .
industry relatively unaffected by goods suspension bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : car and steel production continued despite the strike carmakers vw and bmw said production was continuing as normal , while steelmakers thyssenkrupp and salzgitter also said they had been relatively unaffected .
despite being one of the main targets , the north-eastern port of rostock on the baltic coast continued to operate .
gdl boss schell claimed 3,500 goods train drivers had heeded the strike call and that around 1,000 of the 5,000 goods trains that db runs daily had been halted .
schell threatened to expand the strike next week to hit the commuter and long-distance passenger traffic used by around 5 million people daily .
according to an opinion poll taken by public television , 57 per cent of the population backs the train drivers , while 39 per cent are opposed . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we do not accept the curbs on the media and we demand that the government immediately withdraw brutal restrictions that have been imposed , " bhutto said in islamabad , amid a continuing blackout of news channels on the country 's cable networks .
bhutto also called upon journalists , lawyers ' associations , trade unionists and civil society organizations to join her in opposition to the military regime of musharraf , an army general who came to power in 1999 .
" our country is passing through dark times and we have mounted a united struggle against dictatorship , " she told around 200 chanting media workers gathered in front of the offices of one of the affected channels .
despite having confined bhutto to her islamabad house on friday , thereby thwarting her plans to lead a mass rally , law enforcers made no moves to prevent her from addressing the journalists .
bhutto urges merkel for support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bhutto called on merkel to use her influence in the crisis she spoke to german mass-circulation tabloid bild on friday in a bid to secure germany 's support for her campaign against musharraf .
" chancellor merkel should exert pressure on musharraf , " bhutto told germany 's mass-circulation bild newspaper .
" we demand the immediate resignation of president musharraf as head of the military and a clear timetable for elections . "
referring to merkel 's visit to us president george w. bush at his ranch in crawford , texas later friday , bhutto added : " chancellor , please inform president bush that the people want democracy in pakistan and not the empty promises that president musharraf makes to us . "
the german government immediately called on musharraf to release bhutto from house arrest , along with the political activists detained in recent days .
" we call on the pakistani leadership also to reverse the numerous arrests of political activists , " foreign ministry spokesman martin jaeger said in berlin .

foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said the declaration of a state of emergency was a " severe blow " not only to democracy but also a threat to long-term stability of pakistan .
he added that germany would re-examine its arms exports to pakistan and would also restrict economic assistance to projects which solely benefit the population .
bhutto demands the restoration of the constitution and the release of thousands of political detainees rounded up by security forces since the emergency measures were introduced a week earlier .
despite months of covert talks with musharraf towards a suspected deal that would bolster his political support while bringing her back into government , there is speculation of a real and widening rift behind her trademark rhetoric against the us-backed military leader .
bhutto has said her dialogue with musharraf was suspended when he suspended the constitution and dissolved the supreme court .
international pressure on musharraf grows bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : musharraf has been urged to end the state of emergency but as international pressure grows on musharraf 's government to restore democratic rule in pakistan , a senior official said saturday emergency measures were likely to be lifted in a few weeks .

" we do not want to make it a permanent feature of our government , " qayyum told other broadcasters .
musharraf announced authoritarian rule largely on the grounds that it would stem rising islamic militancy in pakistan , particularly in the volatile tribal belt bordering afghanistan .

" we do not accept the curbs on the media and we demand that the government immediately withdraw brutal restrictions that have been imposed , " bhutto said in islamabad , amid a continuing blackout of news channels on the country 's cable networks .
bhutto also called upon journalists , lawyers ' associations , trade unionists and civil society organizations to join her in opposition to the military regime of musharraf , an army general who came to power in 1999 .
" our country is passing through dark times and we have mounted a united struggle against dictatorship , " she told around 200 chanting media workers gathered in front of the offices of one of the affected channels .
despite having confined bhutto to her islamabad house on friday , thereby thwarting her plans to lead a mass rally , law enforcers made no moves to prevent her from addressing the journalists .
bhutto urges merkel for support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bhutto called on merkel to use her influence in the crisis she spoke to german mass-circulation tabloid bild on friday in a bid to secure germany 's support for her campaign against musharraf .
" chancellor merkel should exert pressure on musharraf , " bhutto told germany 's mass-circulation bild newspaper .
" we demand the immediate resignation of president musharraf as head of the military and a clear timetable for elections . "
referring to merkel 's visit to us president george w. bush at his ranch in crawford , texas later friday , bhutto added : " chancellor , please inform president bush that the people want democracy in pakistan and not the empty promises that president musharraf makes to us . "
the german government immediately called on musharraf to release bhutto from house arrest , along with the political activists detained in recent days .
" we call on the pakistani leadership also to reverse the numerous arrests of political activists , " foreign ministry spokesman martin jaeger said in berlin .
bundestag condemns crackdown on opposition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier talked of concern over pakistan 's future bundestag members condemned the detention of opposition supporters and members of the judiciary , warning musharraf 's actions were playing into the hands of islamists .
foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said the declaration of a state of emergency was a " severe blow " not only to democracy but also a threat to long-term stability of pakistan .
he added that germany would re-examine its arms exports to pakistan and would also restrict economic assistance to projects which solely benefit the population .
bhutto demands the restoration of the constitution and the release of thousands of political detainees rounded up by security forces since the emergency measures were introduced a week earlier .
despite months of covert talks with musharraf towards a suspected deal that would bolster his political support while bringing her back into government , there is speculation of a real and widening rift behind her trademark rhetoric against the us-backed military leader .
bhutto has said her dialogue with musharraf was suspended when he suspended the constitution and dissolved the supreme court .
international pressure on musharraf grows bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : musharraf has been urged to end the state of emergency but as international pressure grows on musharraf 's government to restore democratic rule in pakistan , a senior official said saturday emergency measures were likely to be lifted in a few weeks .
" the law and order situation is fast improving , and if the trend continued the state of emergency will be lifted by the middle or the end of the next month , " the country 's attorney general malik mohammad qayyum told private news channel geo .
" we do not want to make it a permanent feature of our government , " qayyum told other broadcasters .
musharraf announced authoritarian rule largely on the grounds that it would stem rising islamic militancy in pakistan , particularly in the volatile tribal belt bordering afghanistan .
but many believe the main objective of the measure was to prevent the judiciary from ruling against his re-election for the next week by deposing all but four judges of the supreme court . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he later called a snap presidential election for january 5 .
the european union 's envoy to the south caucasus on saturday called on georgia to lift the state of emergency , restore private media channels and resume dialogue between the government and the opposition .
" the most important point right now is to look forward and that should involve lifting the state of emergency as soon as possible , " peter semneby , the eu special representative to the south caucasus , told reporters .
georgian government officials and the opposition were to officially meet later on saturday for the first time since the clashes to discuss election laws , officials said .
us envoy to fly in to demand end to emergency rule bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-government riots rocked the georgian capital matthew bryza , the us deputy assistant secretary for european and eurasian affairs , was also due to arrive in tbilisi later in the day to insist on an immediate lifting of emergency rule , the us state department said .
meanwhile , badri patarkatsishvili , a prominent georgian businessman who has financed the country 's opposition , said he will run in january 's presidential election .
" i will take part in the election campaign and the presidential election in january 2008 , " patarkatsishvili was quoted as saying in a statement from the bell pottinger group , a london-based public relations agency .
patarkatsishvili said that he would campaign with the slogan " georgia without saakashvili is georgia without terror " and call a referendum on boosting the parliament 's powers , if elected .
media tycoon accused of planning coup bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saakashvili is accused of stamping on democracy georgian authorities earlier said patarkatsishvili , who is believed to be out of the country , was suspected of plotting a coup against saakashvili and that he was wanted for questioning .
the tycoon is co-owner with new york-based news corp. of the private georgian broadcaster imedi , a network seen as sympathetic to the opposition that was taken off the air following the clashes .
in the statement , patarkatsishvili accused saakashvili of cracking down on democracy in georgia and called on the authorities to lift the state of emergency " immediately " and stop " politically motivated criminal cases . "
he also said he could change his mind about running for president if opposition forces united and " put forward a joint candidate with a very clear objective - to defeat the saakashvili regime . "
end of emergency first , candidature second the leader of the opposition republican party , levan berdzenishvili , told reporters after patarkatsishvili 's announcement that opposition forces would only discuss candidatures after emergency is lifted .
georgia 's parliament endorsed saakashvili 's state of emergency ruling on friday , but top officials said they expected it to be lifted much sooner than the approved 15 days , which runs out on november 22 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saakashvili ordered the police out in force saakashvili prompted international condemnation when he ordered the state of emergency after riot police used rubber bullets , tear gas and water cannons to disperse thousands of people who had gathered to call for his resignation .
saakashvili said wednesday 's events were part of a coup attempt masterminded by russia to overthrow his government .
moscow has dismissed the accusation and said saakashvili was looking for a scapegoat for his domestic political troubles .
the georgian leader was in danger this week of seeing his image as one of the most democratic presidents of the former soviet republics tarnished by the brutal police crackdown and imposition of emergency rule .
opponents have accused saakashvili of hoarding power and becoming arrogant since he swept to office after the 2003 pro-democracy uprising dubbed the rose revolution . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he later called a snap presidential election for january 5 .
the european union 's envoy to the south caucasus on saturday called on georgia to lift the state of emergency , restore private media channels and resume dialogue between the government and the opposition .
" the most important point right now is to look forward and that should involve lifting the state of emergency as soon as possible , " peter semneby , the eu special representative to the south caucasus , told reporters .
georgian government officials and the opposition were to officially meet later on saturday for the first time since the clashes to discuss election laws , officials said .
us envoy to fly in to demand end to emergency rule bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-government riots rocked the georgian capital matthew bryza , the us deputy assistant secretary for european and eurasian affairs , was also due to arrive in tbilisi later in the day to insist on an immediate lifting of emergency rule , the us state department said .
meanwhile , badri patarkatsishvili , a prominent georgian businessman who has financed the country 's opposition , said he will run in january 's presidential election .
" i will take part in the election campaign and the presidential election in january 2008 , " patarkatsishvili was quoted as saying in a statement from the bell pottinger group , a london-based public relations agency .
patarkatsishvili said that he would campaign with the slogan " georgia without saakashvili is georgia without terror " and call a referendum on boosting the parliament 's powers , if elected .
media tycoon accused of planning coup bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saakashvili is accused of stamping on democracy georgian authorities earlier said patarkatsishvili , who is believed to be out of the country , was suspected of plotting a coup against saakashvili and that he was wanted for questioning .
the tycoon is co-owner with new york-based news corp. of the private georgian broadcaster imedi , a network seen as sympathetic to the opposition that was taken off the air following the clashes .
in the statement , patarkatsishvili accused saakashvili of cracking down on democracy in georgia and called on the authorities to lift the state of emergency " immediately " and stop " politically motivated criminal cases . "
he also said he could change his mind about running for president if opposition forces united and " put forward a joint candidate with a very clear objective - to defeat the saakashvili regime . "
end of emergency first , candidature second the leader of the opposition republican party , levan berdzenishvili , told reporters after patarkatsishvili 's announcement that opposition forces would only discuss candidatures after emergency is lifted .
georgia 's parliament endorsed saakashvili 's state of emergency ruling on friday , but top officials said they expected it to be lifted much sooner than the approved 15 days , which runs out on november 22 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saakashvili ordered the police out in force saakashvili prompted international condemnation when he ordered the state of emergency after riot police used rubber bullets , tear gas and water cannons to disperse thousands of people who had gathered to call for his resignation .
saakashvili said wednesday 's events were part of a coup attempt masterminded by russia to overthrow his government .
moscow has dismissed the accusation and said saakashvili was looking for a scapegoat for his domestic political troubles .
the georgian leader was in danger this week of seeing his image as one of the most democratic presidents of the former soviet republics tarnished by the brutal police crackdown and imposition of emergency rule .
opponents have accused saakashvili of hoarding power and becoming arrogant since he swept to office after the 2003 pro-democracy uprising dubbed the rose revolution . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he later called a snap presidential election for january 5 .
the european union 's envoy to the south caucasus on saturday called on georgia to lift the state of emergency , restore private media channels and resume dialogue between the government and the opposition .
" the most important point right now is to look forward and that should involve lifting the state of emergency as soon as possible , " peter semneby , the eu special representative to the south caucasus , told reporters .
georgian government officials and the opposition were to officially meet later on saturday for the first time since the clashes to discuss election laws , officials said .
us envoy to fly in to demand end to emergency rule bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-government riots rocked the georgian capital matthew bryza , the us deputy assistant secretary for european and eurasian affairs , was also due to arrive in tbilisi later in the day to insist on an immediate lifting of emergency rule , the us state department said .
meanwhile , badri patarkatsishvili , a prominent georgian businessman who has financed the country 's opposition , said he will run in january 's presidential election .
" i will take part in the election campaign and the presidential election in january 2008 , " patarkatsishvili was quoted as saying in a statement from the bell pottinger group , a london-based public relations agency .
patarkatsishvili said that he would campaign with the slogan " georgia without saakashvili is georgia without terror " and call a referendum on boosting the parliament 's powers , if elected .
media tycoon accused of planning coup bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saakashvili is accused of stamping on democracy georgian authorities earlier said patarkatsishvili , who is believed to be out of the country , was suspected of plotting a coup against saakashvili and that he was wanted for questioning .
the tycoon is co-owner with new york-based news corp. of the private georgian broadcaster imedi , a network seen as sympathetic to the opposition that was taken off the air following the clashes .
in the statement , patarkatsishvili accused saakashvili of cracking down on democracy in georgia and called on the authorities to lift the state of emergency " immediately " and stop " politically motivated criminal cases . "
he also said he could change his mind about running for president if opposition forces united and " put forward a joint candidate with a very clear objective - to defeat the saakashvili regime . "
end of emergency first , candidature second the leader of the opposition republican party , levan berdzenishvili , told reporters after patarkatsishvili 's announcement that opposition forces would only discuss candidatures after emergency is lifted .
georgia 's parliament endorsed saakashvili 's state of emergency ruling on friday , but top officials said they expected it to be lifted much sooner than the approved 15 days , which runs out on november 22 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saakashvili ordered the police out in force saakashvili prompted international condemnation when he ordered the state of emergency after riot police used rubber bullets , tear gas and water cannons to disperse thousands of people who had gathered to call for his resignation .
saakashvili said wednesday 's events were part of a coup attempt masterminded by russia to overthrow his government .
moscow has dismissed the accusation and said saakashvili was looking for a scapegoat for his domestic political troubles .
the georgian leader was in danger this week of seeing his image as one of the most democratic presidents of the former soviet republics tarnished by the brutal police crackdown and imposition of emergency rule .
opponents have accused saakashvili of hoarding power and becoming arrogant since he swept to office after the 2003 pro-democracy uprising dubbed the rose revolution . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

media tycoon accused of planning coup bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saakashvili is accused of stamping on democracy georgian authorities earlier said patarkatsishvili , who is believed to be out of the country , was suspected of plotting a coup against saakashvili and that he was wanted for questioning .
the tycoon is co-owner with new york-based news corp. of the private georgian broadcaster imedi , a network seen as sympathetic to the opposition that was taken off the air following the clashes .
in the statement , patarkatsishvili accused saakashvili of cracking down on democracy in georgia and called on the authorities to lift the state of emergency " immediately " and stop " politically motivated criminal cases . "
he also said he could change his mind about running for president if opposition forces united and " put forward a joint candidate with a very clear objective - to defeat the saakashvili regime . "
end of emergency first , candidature second the leader of the opposition republican party , levan berdzenishvili , told reporters after patarkatsishvili 's announcement that opposition forces would only discuss candidatures after emergency is lifted .
georgia 's parliament endorsed saakashvili 's state of emergency ruling on friday , but top officials said they expected it to be lifted much sooner than the approved 15 days , which runs out on november 22 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saakashvili ordered the police out in force saakashvili prompted international condemnation when he ordered the state of emergency after riot police used rubber bullets , tear gas and water cannons to disperse thousands of people who had gathered to call for his resignation .
saakashvili said wednesday 's events were part of a coup attempt masterminded by russia to overthrow his government .
moscow has dismissed the accusation and said saakashvili was looking for a scapegoat for his domestic political troubles .
the georgian leader was in danger this week of seeing his image as one of the most democratic presidents of the former soviet republics tarnished by the brutal police crackdown and imposition of emergency rule .
opponents have accused saakashvili of hoarding power and becoming arrogant since he swept to office after the 2003 pro-democracy uprising dubbed the rose revolution . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the group will involve more than 20 health organisations and it is thought it will lobby for tighter regulation of the industry and higher tax on alcohol .
five drinks industry bodies have written to the alliance warning its campaign could make matters worse .
full details of the alliance 's policies have not yet been announced however .
' considerable risk ' the letter was sent to the chairman of the group , professor ian gilmore , president of the royal college of physicians .
it read : " we are questioning some of the basic assumptions at the heart of this campaign because we do not believe the evidence base supports the call for higher taxes , more regulation and health warnings .
" indeed our experience from around the world strongly suggests that the measures you are seeking carry considerable risk of exacerbating the situation . "
it was signed on behalf of the british beer and pub association , the gin and vodka association , the national association of cider makers , the scotch whisky association and the wine and spirit trade association .

publisher roger rapoport said the book will not be published until a judge rules on whether it violates rowling 's intellectual property rights .
a judge in new york has issued an order barring completion , distribution , marketing or advance sales of the book until further notice .
written by steve vander ark , it was scheduled for release on 28 november .
entitled harry potter lexicon , it is based on material from an internet fan site of the same name .
mr rapoport , whose company is based in michigan , said he had given a copy of the lexicon to warner bros lawyers - who hold the copyright to the harry potter books - in the hope that they would read it and decide that it did not violate copyright .
" i think they should drop it .
i 'm hopeful that they will , " he said .
' massively disappointed ' rowling 's lawsuit , filed on 31 october , sought an injunction blocking publication of the book on the grounds that it would borrow too heavily from her work and spoil plans to eventually publish her own encyclopaedia of harry potter 's world .
rowling had supported the lexicon website , but she and warner bros said they saw a difference between fans publishing information for free on the internet , and selling it in the form of a book .
rowling said she took " no pleasure " in preventing the lexicon 's publication .
" on the contrary , i feel massively disappointed that this matter had to come to court at all , " she said .
" given my past good relations with the lexicon fan site , i can only feel sad and disillusioned that this is where we have ended up . "

parliament must choose the next lebanese president before november 24 issam - a 50-year-old owner of a large business - sends his wife to stock up on tinned food for their mountain house in fear of a possible war .
at a jeweller 's shop , the talk is all about the rising price of gold .
" every time the price of gold rises like that , there 's a war in the region , " says one woman .
trying to make appointments with people is sometimes impossible - " call me tomorrow , who knows if we 'll still be alive then " is often the answer .
and then there are those who have postponed all their plans , from going on holiday to buying new clothes , until after 24 november - the date on which the current president , pro-syrian emile lahoud is meant to leave office .
parliament needs to elect a new president before then or the country will plunge deeper into a crisis that has paralysed political life for the last year .
the election has been postponed twice already because of a lack of quorum , as rival camps - the anti-syrians and the pro-syrians - try to hammer out an agreement outside parliament .
the next attempt has been slated for 12 november but is most likely to be postponed again .
assassinations the 6-year-long mandate of president emile lahoud was extended for three years by a vote in parliament in 2004 .
the extension required a constitutional amendment which legislators approved after much pressure and arm-twisting from damascus .
at the time , syria was still the political power-broker in lebanon , where it maintained more than 10,000 troops .
the vote extension turned out to be the start of lebanon 's worst crisis since the end of the 15-year-long civil war in 1990 .
president lahoud had his term extended in 2004 since 2004 , there have been eight assassinations of high-profile anti-syrian figures , including legislators and the former prime minister rafik hariri , massive demonstrations by both syria 's opponents and its supporters , and a devastating war between hezbollah and israel .
today , the situation is as follows : the anti-syrian camp has a majority in parliament for the first time in decades and wants to use it to install someone from its bloc as president , thus reclaiming one of the last vestiges of syrian influence in lebanon .
four anti-syrian legislators have already been assassinated , and to avoid being deprived of the slim majority they still have in parliament , members of the anti-syrian bloc have checked in en masse into a highly-secured hotel until a president has been elected .
stand-off the pro-syrian opposition accuses the majority of doing america 's bidding in lebanon and insists on a compromise candidate , someone who will protect hezbollah and its weapons .
the two sides have been in a stand-off for two years , with the opposition maintaining a sit-in in the centre of beirut , effectively besieging the prime minister 's offices and other government buildings .
for such a small country , lebanon commands a lot of international attention .
prime minister siniora could assume the presidency the country 's presidential election was on the agenda of the us secretary of state condoleezza rice when she held talks with some of her european counterparts in turkey over the weekend , on the sidelines of a summit on iraq and its neighbours .
lebanon also came up in talks between us president george w bush and french president nicolas sarkozy in washington this week , and french presidential envoys have been sent to damascus and beirut .
the arab league regularly sends representatives to beirut and the russians have also weighed in with a call on lebanese leaders to " realise the historic responsibility and reach accord " at this " fateful " moment for lebanon .
regional tensions many of the regional issues and tensions come together here and often threaten to boil over : the arab-israeli conflict , shia-sunni tensions and more importantly the us-iran stand-off .
the battle for influence over the middle east is being fought not just in iraq but also in lebanon , and the election of a new president has in effect become a showdown between the us and europe on one side , backing the parliamentary majority , and iran and syria on the other , supporting the opposition , led by the shia militant group hezbollah .
there are fears that if lebanon fails to elect a new president , it could plunge into a constitutional vacuum and possibly civil strife .
the fate of lebanon is in the hands of bush and sarkozy headline , al akhbar newspaper this in turn could have implications for the wider region , with the possibility that a conflagration could start in beirut and spread throughout the middle east .
many observers , including some members of the anti-syrian camp , advocate a compromise solution in the form of a consensus candidate to avoid rocking the boat at a time when the region is unstable and talk of war between the us and iran is in the air .
staunch members of the anti-syrian camp say a compromise candidate would mean giving in to hezbollah , however .
rival administrations ?
the us , worried about the possibility of losing lebanon to the syria-iran camp , is sending strong signals - in statements by condoleezza rice and the us ambassador to the un , zalmay khalilzad - that it believes the majority should choose the president .
if no president is elected by november 24 , the prime minister fouad siniora , an ally of the west , takes over executive power under the constitution .
but the opposition has already warned it will not recognise mr siniora 's powers and there are fears it might form a rival cabinet .
the parliamentary majority has also threatened to elect a president by a simple majority vote in the assembly , instead of the required two thirds - a move the opposition rejects as illegal .
constitutional crisis if no president is elected by november 24 , the prime minister fouad siniora takes over executive power under the constitution the president must be elected by a two-thirds majority in parliament the current president had his term extended by three years in 2004 such a split could also lead to the setting up of two rival administrations , a sad reminder of the last few years of lebanon 's civil war when a similar situation arose .
" the fate of lebanon is in the hands of bush and sarkozy " was the headline of the opposition al akhbar newspaper on wednesday - and in the hands of syria and iran , the anti-syrian camp might retort .
what is clear is that as so often in its history , lebanon finds itself - or allows itself to be - at the centre of a tug-of-war between world powers , a struggle that is probably not going to end on november 24 , unless signs of a regional agreement somehow emerge .

parliament must choose the next lebanese president before november 24 issam - a 50-year-old owner of a large business - sends his wife to stock up on tinned food for their mountain house in fear of a possible war .
at a jeweller 's shop , the talk is all about the rising price of gold .
" every time the price of gold rises like that , there 's a war in the region , " says one woman .
trying to make appointments with people is sometimes impossible - " call me tomorrow , who knows if we 'll still be alive then " is often the answer .
and then there are those who have postponed all their plans , from going on holiday to buying new clothes , until after 24 november - the date on which the current president , pro-syrian emile lahoud is meant to leave office .
parliament needs to elect a new president before then or the country will plunge deeper into a crisis that has paralysed political life for the last year .
the election has been postponed twice already because of a lack of quorum , as rival camps - the anti-syrians and the pro-syrians - try to hammer out an agreement outside parliament .
the next attempt has been slated for 12 november but is most likely to be postponed again .
assassinations the 6-year-long mandate of president emile lahoud was extended for three years by a vote in parliament in 2004 .
the extension required a constitutional amendment which legislators approved after much pressure and arm-twisting from damascus .
at the time , syria was still the political power-broker in lebanon , where it maintained more than 10,000 troops .
the vote extension turned out to be the start of lebanon 's worst crisis since the end of the 15-year-long civil war in 1990 .
president lahoud had his term extended in 2004 since 2004 , there have been eight assassinations of high-profile anti-syrian figures , including legislators and the former prime minister rafik hariri , massive demonstrations by both syria 's opponents and its supporters , and a devastating war between hezbollah and israel .
today , the situation is as follows : the anti-syrian camp has a majority in parliament for the first time in decades and wants to use it to install someone from its bloc as president , thus reclaiming one of the last vestiges of syrian influence in lebanon .
four anti-syrian legislators have already been assassinated , and to avoid being deprived of the slim majority they still have in parliament , members of the anti-syrian bloc have checked in en masse into a highly-secured hotel until a president has been elected .
stand-off the pro-syrian opposition accuses the majority of doing america 's bidding in lebanon and insists on a compromise candidate , someone who will protect hezbollah and its weapons .
the two sides have been in a stand-off for two years , with the opposition maintaining a sit-in in the centre of beirut , effectively besieging the prime minister 's offices and other government buildings .
for such a small country , lebanon commands a lot of international attention .
prime minister siniora could assume the presidency the country 's presidential election was on the agenda of the us secretary of state condoleezza rice when she held talks with some of her european counterparts in turkey over the weekend , on the sidelines of a summit on iraq and its neighbours .
lebanon also came up in talks between us president george w bush and french president nicolas sarkozy in washington this week , and french presidential envoys have been sent to damascus and beirut .
the arab league regularly sends representatives to beirut and the russians have also weighed in with a call on lebanese leaders to " realise the historic responsibility and reach accord " at this " fateful " moment for lebanon .
regional tensions many of the regional issues and tensions come together here and often threaten to boil over : the arab-israeli conflict , shia-sunni tensions and more importantly the us-iran stand-off .
the battle for influence over the middle east is being fought not just in iraq but also in lebanon , and the election of a new president has in effect become a showdown between the us and europe on one side , backing the parliamentary majority , and iran and syria on the other , supporting the opposition , led by the shia militant group hezbollah .
there are fears that if lebanon fails to elect a new president , it could plunge into a constitutional vacuum and possibly civil strife .
the fate of lebanon is in the hands of bush and sarkozy headline , al akhbar newspaper this in turn could have implications for the wider region , with the possibility that a conflagration could start in beirut and spread throughout the middle east .
many observers , including some members of the anti-syrian camp , advocate a compromise solution in the form of a consensus candidate to avoid rocking the boat at a time when the region is unstable and talk of war between the us and iran is in the air .
staunch members of the anti-syrian camp say a compromise candidate would mean giving in to hezbollah , however .
rival administrations ?
the us , worried about the possibility of losing lebanon to the syria-iran camp , is sending strong signals - in statements by condoleezza rice and the us ambassador to the un , zalmay khalilzad - that it believes the majority should choose the president .
if no president is elected by november 24 , the prime minister fouad siniora , an ally of the west , takes over executive power under the constitution .
but the opposition has already warned it will not recognise mr siniora 's powers and there are fears it might form a rival cabinet .
the parliamentary majority has also threatened to elect a president by a simple majority vote in the assembly , instead of the required two thirds - a move the opposition rejects as illegal .
constitutional crisis if no president is elected by november 24 , the prime minister fouad siniora takes over executive power under the constitution the president must be elected by a two-thirds majority in parliament the current president had his term extended by three years in 2004 such a split could also lead to the setting up of two rival administrations , a sad reminder of the last few years of lebanon 's civil war when a similar situation arose .
" the fate of lebanon is in the hands of bush and sarkozy " was the headline of the opposition al akhbar newspaper on wednesday - and in the hands of syria and iran , the anti-syrian camp might retort .
what is clear is that as so often in its history , lebanon finds itself - or allows itself to be - at the centre of a tug-of-war between world powers , a struggle that is probably not going to end on november 24 , unless signs of a regional agreement somehow emerge .
and so holidays and clothes-buying will most likely be postponed again and more tinned food bought .

parliament must choose the next lebanese president before november 24 issam - a 50-year-old owner of a large business - sends his wife to stock up on tinned food for their mountain house in fear of a possible war .
at a jeweller 's shop , the talk is all about the rising price of gold .
" every time the price of gold rises like that , there 's a war in the region , " says one woman .
trying to make appointments with people is sometimes impossible - " call me tomorrow , who knows if we 'll still be alive then " is often the answer .
and then there are those who have postponed all their plans , from going on holiday to buying new clothes , until after 24 november - the date on which the current president , pro-syrian emile lahoud is meant to leave office .
parliament needs to elect a new president before then or the country will plunge deeper into a crisis that has paralysed political life for the last year .
the election has been postponed twice already because of a lack of quorum , as rival camps - the anti-syrians and the pro-syrians - try to hammer out an agreement outside parliament .
the next attempt has been slated for 12 november but is most likely to be postponed again .
assassinations the 6-year-long mandate of president emile lahoud was extended for three years by a vote in parliament in 2004 .
the extension required a constitutional amendment which legislators approved after much pressure and arm-twisting from damascus .
at the time , syria was still the political power-broker in lebanon , where it maintained more than 10,000 troops .
the vote extension turned out to be the start of lebanon 's worst crisis since the end of the 15-year-long civil war in 1990 .
president lahoud had his term extended in 2004 since 2004 , there have been eight assassinations of high-profile anti-syrian figures , including legislators and the former prime minister rafik hariri , massive demonstrations by both syria 's opponents and its supporters , and a devastating war between hezbollah and israel .
today , the situation is as follows : the anti-syrian camp has a majority in parliament for the first time in decades and wants to use it to install someone from its bloc as president , thus reclaiming one of the last vestiges of syrian influence in lebanon .
four anti-syrian legislators have already been assassinated , and to avoid being deprived of the slim majority they still have in parliament , members of the anti-syrian bloc have checked in en masse into a highly-secured hotel until a president has been elected .
stand-off the pro-syrian opposition accuses the majority of doing america 's bidding in lebanon and insists on a compromise candidate , someone who will protect hezbollah and its weapons .
the two sides have been in a stand-off for two years , with the opposition maintaining a sit-in in the centre of beirut , effectively besieging the prime minister 's offices and other government buildings .
for such a small country , lebanon commands a lot of international attention .
prime minister siniora could assume the presidency the country 's presidential election was on the agenda of the us secretary of state condoleezza rice when she held talks with some of her european counterparts in turkey over the weekend , on the sidelines of a summit on iraq and its neighbours .
lebanon also came up in talks between us president george w bush and french president nicolas sarkozy in washington this week , and french presidential envoys have been sent to damascus and beirut .
the arab league regularly sends representatives to beirut and the russians have also weighed in with a call on lebanese leaders to " realise the historic responsibility and reach accord " at this " fateful " moment for lebanon .
regional tensions many of the regional issues and tensions come together here and often threaten to boil over : the arab-israeli conflict , shia-sunni tensions and more importantly the us-iran stand-off .

the election has been postponed twice already because of a lack of quorum , as rival camps - the anti-syrians and the pro-syrians - try to hammer out an agreement outside parliament .
the next attempt has been slated for 12 november but is most likely to be postponed again .
assassinations the 6-year-long mandate of president emile lahoud was extended for three years by a vote in parliament in 2004 .
the extension required a constitutional amendment which legislators approved after much pressure and arm-twisting from damascus .
at the time , syria was still the political power-broker in lebanon , where it maintained more than 10,000 troops .
the vote extension turned out to be the start of lebanon 's worst crisis since the end of the 15-year-long civil war in 1990 .
since 2004 , there have been eight assassinations of high-profile anti-syrian figures , including legislators and the former prime minister rafik hariri , massive demonstrations by both syria 's opponents and its supporters , and a devastating war between hezbollah and israel .
today , the situation is as follows : the anti-syrian camp has a majority in parliament for the first time in decades and wants to use it to install someone from its bloc as president , thus reclaiming one of the last vestiges of syrian influence in lebanon .
four anti-syrian legislators have already been assassinated , and to avoid being deprived of the slim majority they still have in parliament , members of the anti-syrian bloc have checked in en masse into a highly-secured hotel until a president has been elected .
stand-off the pro-syrian opposition accuses the majority of doing america 's bidding in lebanon and insists on a compromise candidate , someone who will protect hezbollah and its weapons .
the two sides have been in a stand-off for two years , with the opposition maintaining a sit-in in the centre of beirut , effectively besieging the prime minister 's offices and other government buildings .
for such a small country , lebanon commands a lot of international attention .
the country 's presidential election was on the agenda of the us secretary of state condoleezza rice when she held talks with some of her european counterparts in turkey over the weekend , on the sidelines of a summit on iraq and its neighbours .
lebanon also came up in talks between us president george w bush and french president nicolas sarkozy in washington this week , and french presidential envoys have been sent to damascus and beirut .
the arab league regularly sends representatives to beirut and the russians have also weighed in with a call on lebanese leaders to " realise the historic responsibility and reach accord " at this " fateful " moment for lebanon .
regional tensions many of the regional issues and tensions come together here and often threaten to boil over : the arab-israeli conflict , shia-sunni tensions and more importantly the us-iran stand-off .
the battle for influence over the middle east is being fought not just in iraq but also in lebanon , and the election of a new president has in effect become a showdown between the us and europe on one side , backing the parliamentary majority , and iran and syria on the other , supporting the opposition , led by the shia militant group hezbollah .
there are fears that if lebanon fails to elect a new president , it could plunge into a constitutional vacuum and possibly civil strife . "
the fate of lebanon is in the hands of bush and sarkozy " headline , al akhbar newspaper this in turn could have implications for the wider region , with the possibility that a conflagration could start in beirut and spread throughout the middle east .
many observers , including some members of the anti-syrian camp , advocate a compromise solution in the form of a consensus candidate to avoid rocking the boat at a time when the region is unstable and talk of war between the us and iran is in the air .
staunch members of the anti-syrian camp say a compromise candidate would mean giving in to hezbollah , however .
rival administrations ?
the us , worried about the possibility of losing lebanon to the syria-iran camp , is sending strong signals - in statements by condoleezza rice and the us ambassador to the un , zalmay khalilzad - that it believes the majority should choose the president .
if no president is elected by november 24 , the prime minister fouad siniora , an ally of the west , takes over executive power under the constitution .
but the opposition has already warned it will not recognise mr siniora 's powers and there are fears it might form a rival cabinet .
the parliamentary majority has also threatened to elect a president by a simple majority vote in the assembly , instead of the required two thirds - a move the opposition rejects as illegal .
constitutional crisis if no president is elected by november 24 , the prime minister fouad siniora takes over executive power under the constitution the president must be elected by a two-thirds majority in parliament the current president had his term extended by three years in 2004 such a split could also lead to the setting up of two rival administrations , a sad reminder of the last few years of lebanon 's civil war when a similar situation arose .
" the fate of lebanon is in the hands of bush and sarkozy " was the headline of the opposition al akhbar newspaper on wednesday - and in the hands of syria and iran , the anti-syrian camp might retort .
what is clear is that as so often in its history , lebanon finds itself - or allows itself to be - at the centre of a tug-of-war between world powers , a struggle that is probably not going to end on november 24 , unless signs of a regional agreement somehow emerge .
and so holidays and clothes-buying will most likely be postponed again and more tinned food bought .

some still suffer the physical effects due to injury , but many more also struggle with the invisible trauma of being involved in such a bitter war .
now , to mark the quarter of a century anniversary of the end of the conflict , more than 200 veterans have travelled the 8,000 miles to the islands to remember the 255 fellow uk servicemen who lost their lives .
some are also hoping the 10-day pilgrimage - timed to coincide with remembrance sunday - will help to heal some of the psychological wounds .
emotional journey for former scots guard gordon hoggan , 48 , who suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder and who has tried to take his own life , the journey has provided relief .
" i was apprehensive before coming but when we arrived the welcome was absolutely amazing .
we can not even buy ourselves a drink here - the people are so appreciative of what we did . "
" you have to face your demons - when i walked off that mountain that morning , i felt like a new man " gordon hoggan former scots guard mr hoggan , who was 23 at the time of the war , fought in the battle for mount tumbledown , in which eight of his fellow servicemen lost their lives .
another 47 were seriously injured .
he chose to return to the mountain last week to , in his own words , " face the demons " .
in the end , he and a group of five others opted to stay there overnight , just as they had 25 years ago .
" we had tents , but we threw them away and just stayed in our sleeping bags .
we lit a fire and had a couple of bottles of whisky and talked until two thirty in the morning .
" we went through the bad times during the day - and it was very emotional .
but that night when we stayed up there we had a real laugh - it was like we had never been away . "
facing the future mr hoggan , originally from kirkcaldy , fife , but who now lives near birmingham , says he was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder last year after " hiding it " for 24 years .
now he receives help from combat stress , a charity supporting war veterans with mental health problems , and says coming back to the falklands has changed how he feels about his future .
" you have to face your demons .
when i walked off that mountain that morning , i felt like a new man .
once i get back to the uk i feel i can get on with my life .
i feel stronger . "
fellow former scots guard jim gillanders , 43 , from windsor , was just 17 when he went to war .
for him the trip has also been a chance to share memories with those with whom he served and to go back to the places he remembers .
" it 's been absolutely fantastic , " he says .
" i was climbing the walls before i came .
but the support we have had here has been second to none .
" i was asked if i wanted to come back before , but i did n't think i was ready .
i am just grateful i got another opportunity . "
individual struggles trained clinical support staff have been on hand to help the former servicemen with the trauma of the return trip , which has been organised by the south atlantic medal association and combat stress .
col mike bowles , a retired soldier and chairman of the organisers , says most who have taken the journey have found it a " very positive experience " . "
these are the guys who liberated us from an unwanted military dictatorship - we want to show our gratitude " patrick watts former head of falklands radio " everyone is doing it in their own particular way , " he adds .
those living in the falklands have watched the returning servicemen and ex-servicemen make the pilgrimage .
" we recognise for many veterans coming back to the falklands it is an opportunity to clear their minds , " says patrick watts , former head of falklands radio and who was broadcasting as argentine soldiers bearing guns stormed into his station on 2 april 1982 at the start of the war .
search for sites most veterans want to return to specific areas where they had their most traumatic experiences , which can cause problems , he says .
" what people have difficulty in understanding is that 25 years ago it was dark , miserable and snowing .
now , for many on their first time back , it is sunny and daylight and we have to find the places they remember .
we can spend hours looking for places and positions . "
according to the falklands veterans foundation -lrb- fvf -rrb- , 320 men who served in the conflict have since taken their own lives .
and maj peter biggs , commanding officer of the falklands islands defence force , says it would be naive to believe a trip back to the old battlefields is able to heal all wounds .
" it does n't always work out that way .
it often brings it all back to them . "
but the trip has been a great chance for islanders to thank those who came to fight on their behalf .
most of the veterans are staying with local people , and many residents have even taken a week off work to drive the party around . "
we have roads , a self-sustaining economy - life has totally changed solely because of what they did " richard cockwell falklands legislative council " these are the guys who liberated us from an unwanted military dictatorship .
we want to show our gratitude , " says mr watts .
richard cockwell , member of the falklands ' legislative council , agrees that islanders want to repay a debt .
" it is extremely important for the falkland islanders to show their thanks and their appreciation - and to show that they -lsb- the veterans -rsb- have n't been forgotten .
" and we are able to show them that everything did n't go back to how it was before the war .

sir cyril taylor said there were about 17,000 " poor " teachers in england .
they were unable to control classes and were damaging the education of about 400,000 children , he told the bbc .
but head teachers said it was sometimes difficult to recruit good staff , while teachers said their job was made harder by issues such as paperwork .
' recruit fantastic teachers ' sir cyril , chairman of the specialist schools and academies trust , called on head teachers to be stronger in getting rid of poor performers .
he said : " we 've got 400,000 of our children attending low-attaining schools ; 75,000 leave schools at 16 with hardly any qualifications at all ; five million adults are functionally illiterate .
have your say " we need principals who can get rid of bad teachers , reward good teachers and deal in a fair way with problem students and parents " martin , london send us your comments " that 's a serious problem .
" the head teacher that is good can take the necessary action , you get the wrong people off the bus and get the right people on the bus in the right seats .
" that means if you have weak heads of department you ask them to move on and you go out and recruit fantastic teachers . "
the government says that ultimately head teachers are responsible for the quality of teaching and they should take action against poor performers .
but head teachers ' unions say recruitment can be difficult , especially with shortages in maths and science .
national association of head teachers deputy head clarissa williams said : " faced with a crisis in recruitment , some head teachers may feel that it 's better to have anyone in front of a class than no-one , simply because they have a responsibility to have that class taught by a qualified teachers .
