it is the finale of that symphony , based on friedrich schiller 's " ode an die freude " -lrb- ode to joy -rrb- , that provides the motto for this year 's festival . beethoven also wrote a patriotic symphonic work , " wellingtons sieg oder die schlacht bei vittoria , " celebrating the duke of wellington 's victory over the french at the battle of vitoria in spain in 1821 .
the work makes use of the anthems " rule britannia " and " god save the king .

this year 's festival is being headed by ilona schmiel and has a budget of 3.65 million euros -lrb- $ 4.8 million -rrb- . disclosure : deutsche welle is an official partner of the annual beethovenfest and dw-world.de will offer selected festival works as free podcasts . dw staff / afp -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de beethovenfest bonn : symphonies and premieres click here to read dw-world.de 's coverage of the 2006 beethovenfest .

amid increasing consumer awareness of global warming and other environmental issues , german carmakers have had to fight off growing criticism about their apparent lack of will to build environmentally friendly cars . energy-efficient cars have long been the talk of the automotive industry .
but while they have been working on improving the mileage that can be gotten out of regular petrol- and diesel-burning engines , german carmakers have yet to produce a hybrid - a car that combines an electric motor and battery with standard combustion engine in order to cut fuel consumption . in fact , germany trails the world 's automakers in terms of environmental developments , according to the german auto club -lrb- vcd -rrb- consumer group .
the country only has one entry - vw 's polo blue motion - in the list of the ten most environmentally friendly cars . japan leads the pack with its two hybrid cars , the toyota prius and the honda civic , the group said . now , just ahead of the 77th international motor show in geneva , it seems high-end german manufacturers are clamoring to get on the eco-car bandwagon anywhere they can . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a toyota hybrid x concept car presented in geneva volkswagen presented its super-efficient , ultra-low emission blue motion line , and vw and porsche have announced they are working together on a line of eco-friendly cars to come out by 2008 .
bmw and chrysler , meanwhile , announced plans to team up to develop a " mild hybrid " transmission system for rear-wheel-drive premium cars .
even full hybrids might be on the horizon . emissions battle " we had n't expected this to become such an emotionally charged issue , " said vw ceo martin winterkorn , explaining to der spiegel magazine why his company was so late to get into the eco-car market .
he noted that audi had tried to bring a hybrid car to market in the 1990s , but it was a flop ; the market was n't yet ripe . but the tide has definitely turned , and some observers wonder if the current german effort is too little , too late . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : toyota prius - engine of the future ?
after all , in recent weeks the industry has spent much of its energy loudly battling the eu over its plan to regulate car emissions .
the severe co2 emissions reduction would have endangered all the best-sellers in the german fleet . in the end , the eu called for increased use of bio-fuels and cleaner fossil fuels - but revised its regulation standards to give the heavy , fast , gas-guzzling german cars more breathing room . and until now , the german auto industry had openly dismissed hybrids as a passing fad . but their evident popularity , along with increasing concerns about global warming , seem to have carmakers rethinking earlier assumptions . hybrids ' success japanese carmaker toyota , which rolled out its gas-saving prius hybrid nine years ago , has been cashing in on that move ever since .
and the outlook is good in an otherwise stagnant market . " over the next few years we plan to double our hybrid vehicle offering , anticipating annual sales of over one million hybrid vehicles by early in the next decade , " toyota europe vp tierry dombreval told reporters in geneva . meanwhile , other european and us manufacturers have made inroads in creating an eco-friendly image for thesmelves , beating germany to the punch . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : style counts , and small cars are more fuel efficient in september , citroën and peugeot introduced eco-cars of their own .

" it is great to be in the last eight , it is good for our image and everything is possible , " he said .
" we can be proud of beating real . " call for aggressive start answered bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lucio , left , headed in the goal that put munich through to the next round hitzfeld planned the spanish team 's downfall by calling for an aggressive start from his team - and reaped the reward of the fastest goal in champions league history when roy makaay struck just 10 seconds into the game , punishing a lapse on the part of madrid defender roberto carlos . munich managed to keep control for the better part of the match , but madrid were able to impress with bursts of skill they are known for and putting pressure on the bayern defense at the end of both halves . brazilian defender lucio 's second-half header seemed to have secured bayern 's victory before ruud van nistelrooy gave real faint hope with a well-struck penalty with 10 minutes remaining after lucio was adjudged to have brought down robinho . " the penalty was a gift to real and put them back in the saddle , " hitzfeld said .
" the last three or four minutes were tough , but we were still trying to attack . " real sealed own fate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : real madrid were without david beckham wednesday due to a knee injury real madrid coach fabio capello , however , said the reason for his side 's elimination was ultimately the gifts they provided to the bavarians . " we gave them two presents , makaay 's goal and van bommel 's at the end of the first leg , " capello told reporters .
" the early goal -lrb- on wednesday -rrb- changed the match completely .
all our plans and preparation went out of the window . " munich 's mark van bommel scored what ended up being a crucial second away goal late in the first leg two weeks ago in madrid that bayern lost 3-2 . bayern 's quarterfinal opponent will be decided in a draw on friday . no silverware yet this season bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitzfeld said this season will be his only chance to lift another trophy at bayern hitzfeld returned to bayern at the start of february after the sacking of felix magath , who booked a string of poor results to which the defending german champions were unaccustomed . bayern also stuttered in hitzfeld 's early games , losing to nuremberg and minnows alemannia aachen before hitting their stride with a 3-2 victory at hertha berlin at the weekend . they currently are placed fourth in the bundesliga , six points behind leaders schalke 04 . but despite injecting new life into germany 's biggest club , hitzfeld called for caution from any bayern fans already dreaming of a fourth continental crown . " we still have n't achieved anything this season , " he said .
" everything is at a critical stage . " one thing is for sure - if bayern do lift europe 's top club prize in athens on may 23 , it will be hitzfeld 's last game in charge .

" today 's decision is an important step in improving prosecution of people who engage in doping , " said german interior minister wolfgang schäuble in berlin .
" with this draft law we are taking action against doping , together with sports authorities . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pro cycling is one of the sports most affected by doping the decision to sign off on the draft came in the wake of the usual arguments : athletes who take illegal performance enhancing drugs deceive not only competitors , but the public and sports organizers as well .
doping is bad for the athlete 's own health and society at large , since top athletes are role modes for children . details to come ... the government is hoping for a rapid passage of the bill in germany 's two legislative bodies , the bundestag and bundesrat .
after months-long debate , the ruling coalition of christian democrats and social democrats agreed to the major points of the law , which makes possession of " larger " amounts of frequently used doping substances punishable by law . a list of which , and how much , of these substances will be decided upon later . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drug commissioner bätzing said doping 's a huge problem the law gives investigative authority for internationally organized dealing in certain substances to germany 's federal criminal police -lrb- bka -rrb- .

" banning access to the web site does not punish those who did that -lrb- posted the videos -rrb- but the citizens of the turkish republic , " said student kursat cetinkoz , reading from a petition the group submitted to the court in istanbul . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : youtube is an incredibly popular portal for video amateurs turkey 's largest telecommunications provider , turk telekom , has blocked access to the youtube web site on a court order over a video - submitted by a greek user - which portrayed the founding father of modern turkey mustafa kemal ataturk as a homosexual . " the court order was faxed to us last night -lrb- tuesday -rrb- and as a result the company 's services were suspended in turkey , " paul doany , chairman of turk telekom told the anatolia news agency on wednesday . according to the liberal daily vatan , the video in question was part of a cyber battle between turks and greeks on the web site since the beginning of the year , with both parties submitting videos or comments allegedly mocking or insulting the other . a national hero bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ataturk is turkey 's national hero ataturk , who proclaimed modern day turkey in 1923 , is seen as a national hero by secular turks and his legacy is protected under a special law . " i am not in a position to say whether what youtube did was an insult or whether it was right or wrong , " doany said .
" we have been notified of a court order and we are doing what that order says . " youtube was dismayed by the move , adding that the offending video had been removed from the site . " we are disappointed that youtube has been blocked in turkey , " the company said in a statement .
" while technology can bring great opportunity and access to information globally , it can also present new and unique cultural challenges . " turkish media expert fatih vulcan was cautions about welcoming the court decision . " if there is an insult to ataturk , that should prevent the showing of the video , " vulcan said .
" but if you prevent the publication of the web site altogether , that 's censorship . " protecting turkishness bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 100,000 people marched in a funeral procession for hrant dink youtube is the latest victim in the growing campaign being waged in the courts by the country 's nationalist movement .
over 50 writers and intellectuals have been prosecuted under article 301 of the turkish penal code that makes insulting " turkishness " a crime - including nobel prize winner orhan pamuk and armenian-turkish journalist hrant dink .
dink was gunned down and killed by a nationalist youth in january . this is also not the first time the web site has been sucked into turkish politics .
an extreme-right turkish group , which has been blamed for several political murders , recently produced a video threatening turkey 's liberal intellectuals with the same fate as hrant dink .
that clip was removed by youtube after numerous complaints , but it did not lead to the general ban of the web site . the court order banning youtube in turkey , which is hoping to join the european union , comes at a particularly sensitive moment for the country as it tries to improve its human rights image . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german google offline after internet mix-up google , the world 's biggest web-search engine , had its german web site cut off from the internet early tuesday , apparently after somebody reassigned the rights to its google.de address .

" our action plan emphasizes the need to implement preventive measures for specific groups of the population , " schmidt said . targeting migrants " we ’ re going to offer special measures for people with a migrant origin , " schmidt added .
" we need to take into account their different cultural backgrounds and the fact that many of these people don ’ t have a sufficient command of the german language to understand anti-aids spots for native germans . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german health minister ulla schmidt wants to raise awareness of hiv / aids the federal government is willing to keep its annual budget for aids awareness campaigns above 9 million euros -lrb- $ 11.8 million -rrb- .
at the same time , it has called on the german media to keep the subject in the news . developing countries are key reports on aids in germany have declined in number and have primarily focused on the epidemic as a problem of developing nations and eastern europe .
tv stations ’ willingness to show anti-aids spots for free has declined dramatically , also within the public broadcasting networks . development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul added that germany would spend about 400 million euros this year on measures to fight aids , malaria and tuberculosis world-wide . “ it ’ s our task to ensure , together with the world bank and other institutions , that health centers in developing countries have enough personnel to do a good job , " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ad campaigns must also be aimed at immigrants , the cabinet said " within the european union we must agree on a code of conduct which would keep us from luring medical staff from africa to our countries . ” increasing drug-resistance schmidt said it was important to increase research into drug-resistant hiv strains .
about 15 percent of newly infected germans develop such dangerous strains . # b # their upsurge is threatening to nullify many of the recent medical advances in aids treatment .
it is expected that drug-resistant strains will continue to be on the rise over the next few years . a special government program allocates 3 million euros until 2009 to study drug-resistant strains in the hope to better understand their nature and find cures for them . hardy graupner -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu aims to coordinate national development aid programs the german development institute appealed to the eu to push for more efficiency in development programs .

" our action plan emphasizes the need to implement preventive measures for specific groups of the population , " schmidt said . targeting migrants " we ’ re going to offer special measures for people with a migrant origin , " schmidt added .
" we need to take into account their different cultural backgrounds and the fact that many of these people don ’ t have a sufficient command of the german language to understand anti-aids spots for native germans . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german health minister ulla schmidt wants to raise awareness of hiv / aids the federal government is willing to keep its annual budget for aids awareness campaigns above 9 million euros -lrb- $ 11.8 million -rrb- .
at the same time , it has called on the german media to keep the subject in the news . developing countries are key reports on aids in germany have declined in number and have primarily focused on the epidemic as a problem of developing nations and eastern europe .
tv stations ’ willingness to show anti-aids spots for free has declined dramatically , also within the public broadcasting networks . development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul added that germany would spend about 400 million euros this year on measures to fight aids , malaria and tuberculosis world-wide . “ it ’ s our task to ensure , together with the world bank and other institutions , that health centers in developing countries have enough personnel to do a good job , " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ad campaigns must also be aimed at immigrants , the cabinet said " within the european union we must agree on a code of conduct which would keep us from luring medical staff from africa to our countries . ” increasing drug-resistance schmidt said it was important to increase research into drug-resistant hiv strains .
about 15 percent of newly infected germans develop such dangerous strains . # b # their upsurge is threatening to nullify many of the recent medical advances in aids treatment .
it is expected that drug-resistant strains will continue to be on the rise over the next few years . a special government program allocates 3 million euros until 2009 to study drug-resistant strains in the hope to better understand their nature and find cures for them . hardy graupner -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu aims to coordinate national development aid programs the german development institute appealed to the eu to push for more efficiency in development programs .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : about 11 percent of the library 's collection will be posted to the internet books still subject to copyright law will not be available in full online , he said , adding that only excerpts would accompany the book 's bibliographic information , including its title and author . founded in 1558 and currently with some 9 million volumes , the bavarian library is one of the largest in the german-speaking world , and joins university libraries from oxford , madrid and barcelona as well as a number of us institutions in allowing google to index at least part of its collection . search engine has some critics while the plan would make the books available to anyone unable to make the journey to southern germany , not everyone in europe is pleased with the idea of an american corporation cataloging european literature . jean-noel jeanneney , director of the french national library , said google 's attempt to index world knowledge would lead to " cultural homogenization " as it would have a near monopoly on deciding which books are made available digitally . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : microsoft said authors are n't profiting from having their books indexed online it 's a charge david drummond , google 's chief legal officer , denied . " the goal ... of products like google book search is to help users find information from content producers of every size , " he said in a statement . " we do this by complying with international copyright laws , and the result has been more exposure and in many cases more revenue for authors , publishers , and producers of content , " drummond added . google accused of copyright infringement google competitor microsoft also leveled an attack at google 's book search project this week . top microsoft lawyer tom rubin came as the two corporate titans step up their competition in both the software and online content markets . google " appears to be trying wherever possible to skirt copyright law 's boundaries , " rubin , microsoft 's associate general counsel for intellectual property , wrote in a financial times opinion piece . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google said authors and publishers can choose not to have their work digitized " this project may well bring significant commercial advantage to google , " rubin said .
" by contrast , those who own the copyrights in these works would gain little or nothing from google 's plan . " the microsoft lawyer criticized google 's justification of its book scanning as " fair use " under us copyright law , calling it a " novel " interpretation that would stretch to countries where the fair use concept is not recognized . drummond said the company offered authors and publishers the opportunity to opt-out of the book search feature , adding that google has more than 10,000 partners in publishing , and its newly acquired video-sharing web site youtube has recently tied up with the british broadcasting corp. and the national basketball association . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de belgian newspapers win copyright case against google a belgian court dealt a blow to google on tuesday by ruling against the us internet giant in a copyright case lodged by french-language belgian newspapers and closely watched by other media in europe .

" it is great to be in the last eight , it is good for our image and everything is possible , " he said .
" we can be proud of beating real . " call for aggressive start answered bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lucio , left , headed in the goal that put munich through to the next round hitzfeld planned the spanish team 's downfall by calling for an aggressive start from his team - and reaped the reward of the fastest goal in champions league history when roy makaay struck just 10 seconds into the game , punishing a lapse on the part of madrid defender roberto carlos . munich managed to keep control for the better part of the match , but madrid were able to impress with bursts of skill they are known for and putting pressure on the bayern defense at the end of both halves . brazilian defender lucio 's second-half header seemed to have secured bayern 's victory before ruud van nistelrooy gave real faint hope with a well-struck penalty with 10 minutes remaining after lucio was adjudged to have brought down robinho . " the penalty was a gift to real and put them back in the saddle , " hitzfeld said .
" the last three or four minutes were tough , but we were still trying to attack . " real sealed own fate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : real madrid were without david beckham wednesday due to a knee injury real madrid coach fabio capello , however , said the reason for his side 's elimination was ultimately the gifts they provided to the bavarians . " we gave them two presents , makaay 's goal and van bommel 's at the end of the first leg , " capello told reporters .
" the early goal -lrb- on wednesday -rrb- changed the match completely .
all our plans and preparation went out of the window . " munich 's mark van bommel scored what ended up being a crucial second away goal late in the first leg two weeks ago in madrid that bayern lost 3-2 . bayern 's quarterfinal opponent will be decided in a draw on friday . no silverware yet this season bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitzfeld said this season will be his only chance to lift another trophy at bayern hitzfeld returned to bayern at the start of february after the sacking of felix magath , who booked a string of poor results to which the defending german champions were unaccustomed . bayern also stuttered in hitzfeld 's early games , losing to nuremberg and minnows alemannia aachen before hitting their stride with a 3-2 victory at hertha berlin at the weekend . they currently are placed fourth in the bundesliga , six points behind leaders schalke 04 . but despite injecting new life into germany 's biggest club , hitzfeld called for caution from any bayern fans already dreaming of a fourth continental crown .

amid increasing consumer awareness of global warming and other environmental issues , german carmakers have had to fight off growing criticism about their apparent lack of will to build environmentally friendly cars . energy-efficient cars have long been the talk of the automotive industry .
but while they have been working on improving the mileage that can be gotten out of regular petrol- and diesel-burning engines , german carmakers have yet to produce a hybrid - a car that combines an electric motor and battery with standard combustion engine in order to cut fuel consumption . in fact , germany trails the world 's automakers in terms of environmental developments , according to the german auto club -lrb- vcd -rrb- consumer group .

amid increasing consumer awareness of global warming and other environmental issues , german carmakers have had to fight off growing criticism about their apparent lack of will to build environmentally friendly cars . energy-efficient cars have long been the talk of the automotive industry .
but while they have been working on improving the mileage that can be gotten out of regular petrol- and diesel-burning engines , german carmakers have yet to produce a hybrid - a car that combines an electric motor and battery with standard combustion engine in order to cut fuel consumption . in fact , germany trails the world 's automakers in terms of environmental developments , according to the german auto club -lrb- vcd -rrb- consumer group .
the country only has one entry - vw 's polo blue motion - in the list of the ten most environmentally friendly cars . japan leads the pack with its two hybrid cars , the toyota prius and the honda civic , the group said . now , just ahead of the 77th international motor show in geneva , it seems high-end german manufacturers are clamoring to get on the eco-car bandwagon anywhere they can . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a toyota hybrid x concept car presented in geneva volkswagen presented its super-efficient , ultra-low emission blue motion line , and vw and porsche have announced they are working together on a line of eco-friendly cars to come out by 2008 .

after all , in recent weeks the industry has spent much of its energy loudly battling the eu over its plan to regulate car emissions .
the severe co2 emissions reduction would have endangered all the best-sellers in the german fleet . in the end , the eu called for increased use of bio-fuels and cleaner fossil fuels - but revised its regulation standards to give the heavy , fast , gas-guzzling german cars more breathing room . and until now , the german auto industry had openly dismissed hybrids as a passing fad . but their evident popularity , along with increasing concerns about global warming , seem to have carmakers rethinking earlier assumptions . hybrids ' success japanese carmaker toyota , which rolled out its gas-saving prius hybrid nine years ago , has been cashing in on that move ever since .

" banning access to the web site does not punish those who did that -lrb- posted the videos -rrb- but the citizens of the turkish republic , " said student kursat cetinkoz , reading from a petition the group submitted to the court in istanbul . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : youtube is an incredibly popular portal for video amateurs turkey 's largest telecommunications provider , turk telekom , has blocked access to the youtube web site on a court order over a video - submitted by a greek user - which portrayed the founding father of modern turkey mustafa kemal ataturk as a homosexual . " the court order was faxed to us last night -lrb- tuesday -rrb- and as a result the company 's services were suspended in turkey , " paul doany , chairman of turk telekom told the anatolia news agency on wednesday . according to the liberal daily vatan , the video in question was part of a cyber battle between turks and greeks on the web site since the beginning of the year , with both parties submitting videos or comments allegedly mocking or insulting the other . a national hero bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ataturk is turkey 's national hero ataturk , who proclaimed modern day turkey in 1923 , is seen as a national hero by secular turks and his legacy is protected under a special law . " i am not in a position to say whether what youtube did was an insult or whether it was right or wrong , " doany said .
" we have been notified of a court order and we are doing what that order says . " youtube was dismayed by the move , adding that the offending video had been removed from the site . " we are disappointed that youtube has been blocked in turkey , " the company said in a statement .
" while technology can bring great opportunity and access to information globally , it can also present new and unique cultural challenges . " turkish media expert fatih vulcan was cautions about welcoming the court decision . " if there is an insult to ataturk , that should prevent the showing of the video , " vulcan said .
" but if you prevent the publication of the web site altogether , that 's censorship . " protecting turkishness bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 100,000 people marched in a funeral procession for hrant dink youtube is the latest victim in the growing campaign being waged in the courts by the country 's nationalist movement .
over 50 writers and intellectuals have been prosecuted under article 301 of the turkish penal code that makes insulting " turkishness " a crime - including nobel prize winner orhan pamuk and armenian-turkish journalist hrant dink .
dink was gunned down and killed by a nationalist youth in january . this is also not the first time the web site has been sucked into turkish politics .

a ruling in their favor by the european court would pave the way for further legal action in home courts . group members said they were subjected to a lifetime of discrimination and charge the norwegian government with inaction that violated civil rights granted to them by the european convention on human rights . " i hope the court will get enough information so that it can take up our case and judge it , " one of the plaintiffs , 65-year-old gerd fleischer , told the afp news agency . children often tormented by others bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fleischer said she suffered a lifetime of discrimination like fleischer , between 10,000 and 12,000 children were born to norwegian mothers and german soldiers during germany 's occupation of norway .
among the best known of the " war children " is anni-frid lyngstad of famed swedish disco group abba . many of the children were born and raised in the lebensborn or font of life project , which created centers organized by ss leader heinrich himmler to promote a genetically pure " aryan race . " the nazis set up homes in occupied territories including france , belgium and especially norway , to look after local women expecting children from german soldiers . " what the ss wanted was people who were resilient , dutiful and disciplined .
the kind of people who would be suited to run things in the new occupied areas , " said matthias meissner , managing director of lebensspuren -lrb- " traces of life " -rrb- , a group representing the lebensborn children that also setup the first meeting of grown lebensborn children in november . after the war , they became the focus of hatred .
they were commonly placed in host families or special institutions and were subjected to physical or mental harassment , abuse and even rape . harrowing experiences bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the children were well-taken care during the war , but faced severe discrimination after it " i understood that there was something terribly wrong with me when i started school at seven , " fleischer said .
" the other children would call me a ' german whore ' and i did not know what these words meant .
i had to ask my mother to explain them . " fleischer 's life was not much better at home .
her mother married a norwegian resistance fighter who used violence on the child . " when he was drunk , he would show his hatred towards me , " said fleischer , who ran away from home as a teenager . the norwegian government was so concerned with the issue of war children that it even tried to deport them to germany , sweden and australia .
after it was turned down , it decided to place the children with foster families or in institutions . some , wrongly labeled as mentally retarded , ended up in psychiatric institutions where they stayed until the age of 15 or 16 . claims rejected by norwegian courts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the strasbourg court is the group 's final chance to win compensation often , real identity papers of war children were destroyed , altered , or , in some cases , classified as " defense secrets " until 1986 , preventing many of them from ever finding their biological parents .
many are still unaware of their past . despite the tragic lives they led , their fight against the norwegian state has proven fruitless since every legal action they attempted in national courts was turned down .
the norwegian state has made some efforts to address the situation .
in 2000 , then prime minister kjell magne bondevik apologized to the war children in his new year 's speech .
in 2005 , the norwegian parliament decided that war children were eligible for financial compensation of up to 20,000 kroner each -lrb- $ 3,200 , 2,440 euros -rrb- , a decision the now-grown children met with scorn .
" it is yet another insult , " fleischer said .
" it is the smallest compensation the parliament has ever given to anyone .
they call what we have been through ' bullying ' , not at all the right word for the harassment and the ordeals the norwegian state put us through . " if the european court turns us down , " she adds , " it would be a terrible blow for many of us -lrb- who -rrb- feel such a need for recognition and reparation .

" with today 's announcement we are literally opening the library to the entire world and bringing the real purpose of libraries - namely the discovery of knowledge and books - a deciding step further into the digital age , " he said .
" it is a fascinating challenge to present germany 's rich literary tradition to every reader in the world . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : about 11 percent of the library 's collection will be posted to the internet books still subject to copyright law will not be available in full online , he said , adding that only excerpts would accompany the book 's bibliographic information , including its title and author . founded in 1558 and currently with some 9 million volumes , the bavarian library is one of the largest in the german-speaking world , and joins university libraries from oxford , madrid and barcelona as well as a number of us institutions in allowing google to index at least part of its collection . search engine has some critics while the plan would make the books available to anyone unable to make the journey to southern germany , not everyone in europe is pleased with the idea of an american corporation cataloging european literature . jean-noel jeanneney , director of the french national library , said google 's attempt to index world knowledge would lead to " cultural homogenization " as it would have a near monopoly on deciding which books are made available digitally . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : microsoft said authors are n't profiting from having their books indexed online it 's a charge david drummond , google 's chief legal officer , denied . " the goal ... of products like google book search is to help users find information from content producers of every size , " he said in a statement . " we do this by complying with international copyright laws , and the result has been more exposure and in many cases more revenue for authors , publishers , and producers of content , " drummond added . google accused of copyright infringement google competitor microsoft also leveled an attack at google 's book search project this week . top microsoft lawyer tom rubin came as the two corporate titans step up their competition in both the software and online content markets . google " appears to be trying wherever possible to skirt copyright law 's boundaries , " rubin , microsoft 's associate general counsel for intellectual property , wrote in a financial times opinion piece . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google said authors and publishers can choose not to have their work digitized " this project may well bring significant commercial advantage to google , " rubin said .
" by contrast , those who own the copyrights in these works would gain little or nothing from google 's plan . " the microsoft lawyer criticized google 's justification of its book scanning as " fair use " under us copyright law , calling it a " novel " interpretation that would stretch to countries where the fair use concept is not recognized . drummond said the company offered authors and publishers the opportunity to opt-out of the book search feature , adding that google has more than 10,000 partners in publishing , and its newly acquired video-sharing web site youtube has recently tied up with the british broadcasting corp. and the national basketball association . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de belgian newspapers win copyright case against google a belgian court dealt a blow to google on tuesday by ruling against the us internet giant in a copyright case lodged by french-language belgian newspapers and closely watched by other media in europe .

" our action plan emphasizes the need to implement preventive measures for specific groups of the population , " schmidt said . targeting migrants " we ’ re going to offer special measures for people with a migrant origin , " schmidt added .
" we need to take into account their different cultural backgrounds and the fact that many of these people don ’ t have a sufficient command of the german language to understand anti-aids spots for native germans .

at the same time , it has called on the german media to keep the subject in the news . developing countries are key reports on aids in germany have declined in number and have primarily focused on the epidemic as a problem of developing nations and eastern europe .
tv stations ’ willingness to show anti-aids spots for free has declined dramatically , also within the public broadcasting networks . development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul added that germany would spend about 400 million euros this year on measures to fight aids , malaria and tuberculosis world-wide . “ it ’ s our task to ensure , together with the world bank and other institutions , that health centers in developing countries have enough personnel to do a good job , " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ad campaigns must also be aimed at immigrants , the cabinet said " within the european union we must agree on a code of conduct which would keep us from luring medical staff from africa to our countries . ” increasing drug-resistance schmidt said it was important to increase research into drug-resistant hiv strains .
about 15 percent of newly infected germans develop such dangerous strains . # b # their upsurge is threatening to nullify many of the recent medical advances in aids treatment .
it is expected that drug-resistant strains will continue to be on the rise over the next few years . a special government program allocates 3 million euros until 2009 to study drug-resistant strains in the hope to better understand their nature and find cures for them . hardy graupner -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu aims to coordinate national development aid programs the german development institute appealed to the eu to push for more efficiency in development programs .

a ruling in their favor by the european court would pave the way for further legal action in home courts . group members said they were subjected to a lifetime of discrimination and charge the norwegian government with inaction that violated civil rights granted to them by the european convention on human rights . " i hope the court will get enough information so that it can take up our case and judge it , " one of the plaintiffs , 65-year-old gerd fleischer , told the afp news agency . children often tormented by others bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fleischer said she suffered a lifetime of discrimination like fleischer , between 10,000 and 12,000 children were born to norwegian mothers and german soldiers during germany 's occupation of norway .
among the best known of the " war children " is anni-frid lyngstad of famed swedish disco group abba . many of the children were born and raised in the lebensborn or font of life project , which created centers organized by ss leader heinrich himmler to promote a genetically pure " aryan race . " the nazis set up homes in occupied territories including france , belgium and especially norway , to look after local women expecting children from german soldiers . " what the ss wanted was people who were resilient , dutiful and disciplined .
the kind of people who would be suited to run things in the new occupied areas , " said matthias meissner , managing director of lebensspuren -lrb- " traces of life " -rrb- , a group representing the lebensborn children that also setup the first meeting of grown lebensborn children in november . after the war , they became the focus of hatred .
they were commonly placed in host families or special institutions and were subjected to physical or mental harassment , abuse and even rape . harrowing experiences bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the children were well-taken care during the war , but faced severe discrimination after it " i understood that there was something terribly wrong with me when i started school at seven , " fleischer said .
" the other children would call me a ' german whore ' and i did not know what these words meant .
i had to ask my mother to explain them . " fleischer 's life was not much better at home .
her mother married a norwegian resistance fighter who used violence on the child . " when he was drunk , he would show his hatred towards me , " said fleischer , who ran away from home as a teenager . the norwegian government was so concerned with the issue of war children that it even tried to deport them to germany , sweden and australia .
after it was turned down , it decided to place the children with foster families or in institutions . some , wrongly labeled as mentally retarded , ended up in psychiatric institutions where they stayed until the age of 15 or 16 . claims rejected by norwegian courts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the strasbourg court is the group 's final chance to win compensation often , real identity papers of war children were destroyed , altered , or , in some cases , classified as " defense secrets " until 1986 , preventing many of them from ever finding their biological parents .
many are still unaware of their past . despite the tragic lives they led , their fight against the norwegian state has proven fruitless since every legal action they attempted in national courts was turned down .
the norwegian state has made some efforts to address the situation .
in 2000 , then prime minister kjell magne bondevik apologized to the war children in his new year 's speech .
in 2005 , the norwegian parliament decided that war children were eligible for financial compensation of up to 20,000 kroner each -lrb- $ 3,200 , 2,440 euros -rrb- , a decision the now-grown children met with scorn .
" it is yet another insult , " fleischer said .
" it is the smallest compensation the parliament has ever given to anyone .
they call what we have been through ' bullying ' , not at all the right word for the harassment and the ordeals the norwegian state put us through . " if the european court turns us down , " she adds , " it would be a terrible blow for many of us -lrb- who -rrb- feel such a need for recognition and reparation .

it 's a hard life offering unconditional comfort and support to stressed-out humans .
once in a while , stuffed animals have to think about themselves - and when they do , they go to germany . being a cuddly toy is apparently just like any other job .
the hours can be long and the repetitive stroking can get a little boring at times .
and while the wages of eternal love and affection from one 's human companion can make it all worthwhile , even the most dedicated comforter can do with a break every now and again . but where does one go when the stresses and strains of constant petting and listening to people 's problems get to be too much ?
well , it seems that germany would be the best bet for a stuffed animal looking to let its faux hair down . germany is rapidly becoming the holiday destination of choice for frazzled fake furry friends .
companies offering getaways for tired teddies and burnt-out bunnies have spread across the country like wildfire in a stuffing department .
while it is not a new trend , the cuddly toy vacation business is now booming . the niche market in germany initially took off on the back of successful teddy tour operators in munich and frankfurt , but now companies all over the country are providing accommodation and activity plans geared to the character and personality of the specific toys . travel plans tailor-made bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world travel can be a real eye-opener for teddies furry frogs can enjoy fishing and diving experiences at the lake of constance while loveable moles , presumably , could take part in potholing expeditions in the swabian alps .
teddy bears , however , have had their outdoor choices reduced in bavaria after the killing of live brethren bruno last summer . the latest cities to latch on to the holidaying needs of the cuddly classes are hamburg and berlin .
teddy tour berlin offers three categories for the discerning stuffed toy : compact , exclusive and deluxe . the more money you spend , the more your plush pal can enjoy the german capital .
the prices range from 75 euros -lrb- $ 98.40 -rrb- for a compact tour for a german toy to 140 euros -lrb- $ 183.70 -rrb- for an animal from outside western europe taking the full deluxe tour of the city 's landmarks . hamburg popular with night-owls and rabbits in hamburg , woolly wanderers can enjoy a chauffeur service around the hanseatic port before taking in a bit of rock- ' n ' -roll history at the star club , where the beatles played , and heading to the seedier side of town for a night out on the city 's notorious reeperbahn .
this offer is particularly popular with the rabbits . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the teddies on tour are in good hands " we offer a complete visitor 's program , " hamburg tour guide niklas knippschild told german press agency dpa .
" i think this is a first-class idea .
hamburg needs a tour for teddies . "
his business partner , yvonne werny , assured potential customers that their much-loved companions would be in good hands .
" we treat those animals that are entrusted to us very carefully , " she added . toys who go for the hamburg experience come home with a photo cd of all the places they have visited , a popular extra within the price of many tour packages across germany .
many provide a detailed photo album of the holiday as a leaving present before the animal has to return to a life of stroking and nuzzling . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de tired teddies take bavarian break everyone needs a vacation from time to time , so why should your loyal bedtime companion - teddy bear or otherwise - be any different ?

" banning access to the web site does not punish those who did that -lrb- posted the videos -rrb- but the citizens of the turkish republic , " said student kursat cetinkoz , reading from a petition the group submitted to the court in istanbul . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : youtube is an incredibly popular portal for video amateurs turkey 's largest telecommunications provider , turk telekom , has blocked access to the youtube web site on a court order over a video - submitted by a greek user - which portrayed the founding father of modern turkey mustafa kemal ataturk as a homosexual . " the court order was faxed to us last night -lrb- tuesday -rrb- and as a result the company 's services were suspended in turkey , " paul doany , chairman of turk telekom told the anatolia news agency on wednesday . according to the liberal daily vatan , the video in question was part of a cyber battle between turks and greeks on the web site since the beginning of the year , with both parties submitting videos or comments allegedly mocking or insulting the other . a national hero bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ataturk is turkey 's national hero ataturk , who proclaimed modern day turkey in 1923 , is seen as a national hero by secular turks and his legacy is protected under a special law . " i am not in a position to say whether what youtube did was an insult or whether it was right or wrong , " doany said .
" we have been notified of a court order and we are doing what that order says . " youtube was dismayed by the move , adding that the offending video had been removed from the site . " we are disappointed that youtube has been blocked in turkey , " the company said in a statement .
" while technology can bring great opportunity and access to information globally , it can also present new and unique cultural challenges . " turkish media expert fatih vulcan was cautions about welcoming the court decision . " if there is an insult to ataturk , that should prevent the showing of the video , " vulcan said .

23 . out of 55 national and regional projects by the iaea that provide technical aid to iran , 10 have been suspended , while another 12 may only proceed in part after " case-by-case screening by the -lrb- iaea -rrb- secretariat . " a total of 33 projects listed in a feb .
9 report by iaea chief mohamed el baradei will continue . " the reduction in aid was adopted by consensus , " an agency spokesman said . the security council resolution imposed sanctions on iran for continuing to enrich uranium , which makes nuclear reactor fuel but also atom bomb material , and called for iaea aid to iran to be slashed , although the cuts can be rolled back if iran complies with the resolution . only two other countries in the iaea 's 50-year history have been stripped of their nuclear aid over concerns about possible attempts to make bombs - north korea and saddam hussein 's iraq . the united states has accused iran of carrying out research to build a nuclear bomb . a peaceful effort ? iaea chief mohamed el baradei said monday his agency is still unable to verify that iran is not seeking nuclear weapons , in a report to this week 's meeting of the iaea 's governing board about iran 's defiance of un demands . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ali asghar soltanieh insisted the cuts would not hurt iran 's uranium enrichment iran says its program is a peaceful effort to generate electricity and iran 's ambassador ali asghar soltanieh said the iaea aid cuts would not affect its uranium enrichment work .

we will neither stop our nuclear activities , enrichment , nor will we stop our work with the iaea and we will continue this trend and policy , " he said . developing nations are concerned that politically motivated action could set a precedent that could hurt their aid projects .
but they backed the cuts on the recommendation of iaea chief mohamed el baradei , diplomats said . a sensitive area german ambassador peter gottwald , speaking for the european union , told the board wednesday that nations clearly have a right to the peaceful use of nuclear energy . but he said " it is the european union 's understanding that no assistance shall be provided to the islamic republic of iran in the proliferation-sensitive areas of enrichment related , reprocessing or heavy water related activities or the development of nuclear weapon delivery systems , " according to a copy of his speech . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu has held extensive talks with iran - here iran 's chief nuclear negotiator ali larijani with eu foreign policy chief , javier solana gottwald recalled the un resolution 's stipulation that aid is only to be given for food , agricultural , medical , safety or other humanitarian purposes . in november last year , the iaea had already rejected tehran 's request for technical help in building a heavy-water reactor in arak that the west fears could provide plutonium , also a possible nuclear weapons material . examples from an iaea report show approval of a project to help iran " prepare therapeutic sources . . . and radiopharmaceuticals for cancer treatment , " saying this was " entirely for medical purposes . " but the agency rejected a project " to strengthen ... capabilities ... for provision of safe and reliable nuclear power generation capacities , " saying this was outside what is allowed in the un resolution . a thorn in the west 's eye there was no question , however , of blocking iaea aid to the construction of iran 's first nuclear reactor in bushehr , for which russia has a billion-dollar contract , as the un resolution said this project was untouchable . the iaea board also debated israel 's nuclear program , as the arab league has expressed " deep concern and great disquiet " over israeli prime minister ehud olmert 's comments in december that seemed to confirm that israel has nuclear weapons . cuban ambassador norma estenoz , speaking for the non-aligned movement , said nam states on the board reiterated their " support for the establishment in the middle east of a zone free of all weapons of mass destruction .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 08.03.2007 german carmakers rev up effort to enter hybrid market großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the market for hybrids is growing - so where are the german cars ?
amid increasing consumer awareness of global warming and other environmental issues , german carmakers have had to fight off growing criticism about their apparent lack of will to build environmentally friendly cars . energy-efficient cars have long been the talk of the automotive industry .
but while they have been working on improving the mileage that can be gotten out of regular petrol- and diesel-burning engines , german carmakers have yet to produce a hybrid - a car that combines an electric motor and battery with standard combustion engine in order to cut fuel consumption . in fact , germany trails the world 's automakers in terms of environmental developments , according to the german auto club -lrb- vcd -rrb- consumer group .
the country only has one entry - vw 's polo blue motion - in the list of the ten most environmentally friendly cars . japan leads the pack with its two hybrid cars , the toyota prius and the honda civic , the group said . now , just ahead of the 77th international motor show in geneva , it seems high-end german manufacturers are clamoring to get on the eco-car bandwagon anywhere they can . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a toyota hybrid x concept car presented in geneva volkswagen presented its super-efficient , ultra-low emission blue motion line , and vw and porsche have announced they are working together on a line of eco-friendly cars to come out by 2008 .
bmw and chrysler , meanwhile , announced plans to team up to develop a " mild hybrid " transmission system for rear-wheel-drive premium cars .
even full hybrids might be on the horizon . emissions battle " we had n't expected this to become such an emotionally charged issue , " said vw ceo martin winterkorn , explaining to der spiegel magazine why his company was so late to get into the eco-car market .
he noted that audi had tried to bring a hybrid car to market in the 1990s , but it was a flop ; the market was n't yet ripe . but the tide has definitely turned , and some observers wonder if the current german effort is too little , too late . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : toyota prius - engine of the future ?
after all , in recent weeks the industry has spent much of its energy loudly battling the eu over its plan to regulate car emissions .
the severe co2 emissions reduction would have endangered all the best-sellers in the german fleet . in the end , the eu called for increased use of bio-fuels and cleaner fossil fuels - but revised its regulation standards to give the heavy , fast , gas-guzzling german cars more breathing room . and until now , the german auto industry had openly dismissed hybrids as a passing fad . but their evident popularity , along with increasing concerns about global warming , seem to have carmakers rethinking earlier assumptions . hybrids ' success japanese carmaker toyota , which rolled out its gas-saving prius hybrid nine years ago , has been cashing in on that move ever since .
and the outlook is good in an otherwise stagnant market . " over the next few years we plan to double our hybrid vehicle offering , anticipating annual sales of over one million hybrid vehicles by early in the next decade , " toyota europe vp tierry dombreval told reporters in geneva . meanwhile , other european and us manufacturers have made inroads in creating an eco-friendly image for thesmelves , beating germany to the punch . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : style counts , and small cars are more fuel efficient in september , citroën and peugeot introduced eco-cars of their own .
saab 's plan for a cabriolet hybrid that can run on pure ethanol as well as classic petrol wowed critics at the paris auto show in september . and us carmaker ford is promising an expansion of similar " flexifuel " technology , allowing the use of cleaner vegetable based bio-fuels across a whole model range by next year . will germany 's relative silence on the subject give consumers the impression that toyota and other companies care more about the environment than vw , mercedes , audi , porsche et al ?
critics think so .
and they warn that the german car industry may soon be kicking itself for missed a window of market opportunity . push for diesel but vw 's winterkorn , who used to lead audi , dismisses this criticism . " for years we 've been investing billions to reduce fuel consumption with direct-injection diesel and gasoline engines .
we reduced weight at audi with aluminium bodies and at vw with lightweight steel , to name a few examples , " he told der spiegel . so far , the germans have put most of their environmental energy into developing cleaner diesel fuels and engines . their hopes were to spark a diesel revolution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vw 's martin winterkorn " whoever comes out on top in terms of diesel technology is in the best position when it comes to c02 emissions , " said bernd gottschalk , head of the german automobile manufacturers association . but the push has been largely ignored in the world 's largest car market , the us , where essentially only large trucks tend to pump diesel .
and critics note that while diesel engines produce less carbon dioxide , they contribute more harmful nitrates to the environment .
hybrids , on the other hand , produce less co2 and less nitrates as well . according to gottschalk , the fact that german manufacturers have presented plans for more fuel-efficient , low-emission cars in geneva " proves that we did n't just start developing environmentally friendly cars today , and that we are n't only interested in the premium car segment . " jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans encouraged to holiday at home for environment 's sake an intense debate has begun in germany on the kind of lifestyle changes needed to cut greenhouse gas emissions , days before eu leaders hold a summit on energy and climate change .
holidaying at home is one suggestion .

amid increasing consumer awareness of global warming and other environmental issues , german carmakers have had to fight off growing criticism about their apparent lack of will to build environmentally friendly cars . energy-efficient cars have long been the talk of the automotive industry .
but while they have been working on improving the mileage that can be gotten out of regular petrol- and diesel-burning engines , german carmakers have yet to produce a hybrid - a car that combines an electric motor and battery with standard combustion engine in order to cut fuel consumption . in fact , germany trails the world 's automakers in terms of environmental developments , according to the german auto club -lrb- vcd -rrb- consumer group .
the country only has one entry - vw 's polo blue motion - in the list of the ten most environmentally friendly cars . japan leads the pack with its two hybrid cars , the toyota prius and the honda civic , the group said . now , just ahead of the 77th international motor show in geneva , it seems high-end german manufacturers are clamoring to get on the eco-car bandwagon anywhere they can . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a toyota hybrid x concept car presented in geneva volkswagen presented its super-efficient , ultra-low emission blue motion line , and vw and porsche have announced they are working together on a line of eco-friendly cars to come out by 2008 .
bmw and chrysler , meanwhile , announced plans to team up to develop a " mild hybrid " transmission system for rear-wheel-drive premium cars .
even full hybrids might be on the horizon . emissions battle " we had n't expected this to become such an emotionally charged issue , " said vw ceo martin winterkorn , explaining to der spiegel magazine why his company was so late to get into the eco-car market .
he noted that audi had tried to bring a hybrid car to market in the 1990s , but it was a flop ; the market was n't yet ripe . but the tide has definitely turned , and some observers wonder if the current german effort is too little , too late . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : toyota prius - engine of the future ?
after all , in recent weeks the industry has spent much of its energy loudly battling the eu over its plan to regulate car emissions .
the severe co2 emissions reduction would have endangered all the best-sellers in the german fleet . in the end , the eu called for increased use of bio-fuels and cleaner fossil fuels - but revised its regulation standards to give the heavy , fast , gas-guzzling german cars more breathing room . and until now , the german auto industry had openly dismissed hybrids as a passing fad . but their evident popularity , along with increasing concerns about global warming , seem to have carmakers rethinking earlier assumptions . hybrids ' success japanese carmaker toyota , which rolled out its gas-saving prius hybrid nine years ago , has been cashing in on that move ever since .
and the outlook is good in an otherwise stagnant market . " over the next few years we plan to double our hybrid vehicle offering , anticipating annual sales of over one million hybrid vehicles by early in the next decade , " toyota europe vp tierry dombreval told reporters in geneva . meanwhile , other european and us manufacturers have made inroads in creating an eco-friendly image for thesmelves , beating germany to the punch . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : style counts , and small cars are more fuel efficient in september , citroën and peugeot introduced eco-cars of their own .

23 . out of 55 national and regional projects by the iaea that provide technical aid to iran , 10 have been suspended , while another 12 may only proceed in part after " case-by-case screening by the -lrb- iaea -rrb- secretariat . " a total of 33 projects listed in a feb .
9 report by iaea chief mohamed el baradei will continue . " the reduction in aid was adopted by consensus , " an agency spokesman said . the security council resolution imposed sanctions on iran for continuing to enrich uranium , which makes nuclear reactor fuel but also atom bomb material , and called for iaea aid to iran to be slashed , although the cuts can be rolled back if iran complies with the resolution . only two other countries in the iaea 's 50-year history have been stripped of their nuclear aid over concerns about possible attempts to make bombs - north korea and saddam hussein 's iraq . the united states has accused iran of carrying out research to build a nuclear bomb . a peaceful effort ? iaea chief mohamed el baradei said monday his agency is still unable to verify that iran is not seeking nuclear weapons , in a report to this week 's meeting of the iaea 's governing board about iran 's defiance of un demands . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ali asghar soltanieh insisted the cuts would not hurt iran 's uranium enrichment iran says its program is a peaceful effort to generate electricity and iran 's ambassador ali asghar soltanieh said the iaea aid cuts would not affect its uranium enrichment work . " none of these projects are related to the enrichment program , " soltanieh told reporters . " the enrichment program will continue as planned under iaea safeguards .
we will neither stop our nuclear activities , enrichment , nor will we stop our work with the iaea and we will continue this trend and policy , " he said . developing nations are concerned that politically motivated action could set a precedent that could hurt their aid projects .
but they backed the cuts on the recommendation of iaea chief mohamed el baradei , diplomats said . a sensitive area german ambassador peter gottwald , speaking for the european union , told the board wednesday that nations clearly have a right to the peaceful use of nuclear energy . but he said " it is the european union 's understanding that no assistance shall be provided to the islamic republic of iran in the proliferation-sensitive areas of enrichment related , reprocessing or heavy water related activities or the development of nuclear weapon delivery systems , " according to a copy of his speech . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu has held extensive talks with iran - here iran 's chief nuclear negotiator ali larijani with eu foreign policy chief , javier solana gottwald recalled the un resolution 's stipulation that aid is only to be given for food , agricultural , medical , safety or other humanitarian purposes . in november last year , the iaea had already rejected tehran 's request for technical help in building a heavy-water reactor in arak that the west fears could provide plutonium , also a possible nuclear weapons material . examples from an iaea report show approval of a project to help iran " prepare therapeutic sources . . . and radiopharmaceuticals for cancer treatment , " saying this was " entirely for medical purposes . " but the agency rejected a project " to strengthen ... capabilities ... for provision of safe and reliable nuclear power generation capacities , " saying this was outside what is allowed in the un resolution . a thorn in the west 's eye there was no question , however , of blocking iaea aid to the construction of iran 's first nuclear reactor in bushehr , for which russia has a billion-dollar contract , as the un resolution said this project was untouchable . the iaea board also debated israel 's nuclear program , as the arab league has expressed " deep concern and great disquiet " over israeli prime minister ehud olmert 's comments in december that seemed to confirm that israel has nuclear weapons . cuban ambassador norma estenoz , speaking for the non-aligned movement , said nam states on the board reiterated their " support for the establishment in the middle east of a zone free of all weapons of mass destruction . " soltanieh spoke against israel having nuclear weapons as " a uniquely grave threat " to world peace . israel is believed to have some 200 atom bombs but has a policy of neither confirming nor denying this . dw staff / afp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran sets preconditions for new nuclear talks president mahmoud ahmadinejad has rejected a looming un deadline for iran to suspend uranium enrichment .

23 . out of 55 national and regional projects by the iaea that provide technical aid to iran , 10 have been suspended , while another 12 may only proceed in part after " case-by-case screening by the -lrb- iaea -rrb- secretariat . " a total of 33 projects listed in a feb .
9 report by iaea chief mohamed el baradei will continue . " the reduction in aid was adopted by consensus , " an agency spokesman said . the security council resolution imposed sanctions on iran for continuing to enrich uranium , which makes nuclear reactor fuel but also atom bomb material , and called for iaea aid to iran to be slashed , although the cuts can be rolled back if iran complies with the resolution . only two other countries in the iaea 's 50-year history have been stripped of their nuclear aid over concerns about possible attempts to make bombs - north korea and saddam hussein 's iraq . the united states has accused iran of carrying out research to build a nuclear bomb . a peaceful effort ? iaea chief mohamed el baradei said monday his agency is still unable to verify that iran is not seeking nuclear weapons , in a report to this week 's meeting of the iaea 's governing board about iran 's defiance of un demands . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ali asghar soltanieh insisted the cuts would not hurt iran 's uranium enrichment iran says its program is a peaceful effort to generate electricity and iran 's ambassador ali asghar soltanieh said the iaea aid cuts would not affect its uranium enrichment work . " none of these projects are related to the enrichment program , " soltanieh told reporters . " the enrichment program will continue as planned under iaea safeguards .
we will neither stop our nuclear activities , enrichment , nor will we stop our work with the iaea and we will continue this trend and policy , " he said . developing nations are concerned that politically motivated action could set a precedent that could hurt their aid projects .
but they backed the cuts on the recommendation of iaea chief mohamed el baradei , diplomats said . a sensitive area german ambassador peter gottwald , speaking for the european union , told the board wednesday that nations clearly have a right to the peaceful use of nuclear energy . but he said " it is the european union 's understanding that no assistance shall be provided to the islamic republic of iran in the proliferation-sensitive areas of enrichment related , reprocessing or heavy water related activities or the development of nuclear weapon delivery systems , " according to a copy of his speech . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu has held extensive talks with iran - here iran 's chief nuclear negotiator ali larijani with eu foreign policy chief , javier solana gottwald recalled the un resolution 's stipulation that aid is only to be given for food , agricultural , medical , safety or other humanitarian purposes . in november last year , the iaea had already rejected tehran 's request for technical help in building a heavy-water reactor in arak that the west fears could provide plutonium , also a possible nuclear weapons material . examples from an iaea report show approval of a project to help iran " prepare therapeutic sources . . . and radiopharmaceuticals for cancer treatment , " saying this was " entirely for medical purposes . " but the agency rejected a project " to strengthen ... capabilities ... for provision of safe and reliable nuclear power generation capacities , " saying this was outside what is allowed in the un resolution . a thorn in the west 's eye there was no question , however , of blocking iaea aid to the construction of iran 's first nuclear reactor in bushehr , for which russia has a billion-dollar contract , as the un resolution said this project was untouchable . the iaea board also debated israel 's nuclear program , as the arab league has expressed " deep concern and great disquiet " over israeli prime minister ehud olmert 's comments in december that seemed to confirm that israel has nuclear weapons . cuban ambassador norma estenoz , speaking for the non-aligned movement , said nam states on the board reiterated their " support for the establishment in the middle east of a zone free of all weapons of mass destruction . " soltanieh spoke against israel having nuclear weapons as " a uniquely grave threat " to world peace . israel is believed to have some 200 atom bombs but has a policy of neither confirming nor denying this . dw staff / afp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran sets preconditions for new nuclear talks president mahmoud ahmadinejad has rejected a looming un deadline for iran to suspend uranium enrichment .

once in a while , stuffed animals have to think about themselves - and when they do , they go to germany . being a cuddly toy is apparently just like any other job .
the hours can be long and the repetitive stroking can get a little boring at times .
and while the wages of eternal love and affection from one 's human companion can make it all worthwhile , even the most dedicated comforter can do with a break every now and again . but where does one go when the stresses and strains of constant petting and listening to people 's problems get to be too much ?
well , it seems that germany would be the best bet for a stuffed animal looking to let its faux hair down . germany is rapidly becoming the holiday destination of choice for frazzled fake furry friends .

it is the finale of that symphony , based on friedrich schiller 's " ode an die freude " -lrb- ode to joy -rrb- , that provides the motto for this year 's festival . beethoven also wrote a patriotic symphonic work , " wellingtons sieg oder die schlacht bei vittoria , " celebrating the duke of wellington 's victory over the french at the battle of vitoria in spain in 1821 .

" with today 's announcement we are literally opening the library to the entire world and bringing the real purpose of libraries - namely the discovery of knowledge and books - a deciding step further into the digital age , " he said .
" it is a fascinating challenge to present germany 's rich literary tradition to every reader in the world . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : about 11 percent of the library 's collection will be posted to the internet books still subject to copyright law will not be available in full online , he said , adding that only excerpts would accompany the book 's bibliographic information , including its title and author . founded in 1558 and currently with some 9 million volumes , the bavarian library is one of the largest in the german-speaking world , and joins university libraries from oxford , madrid and barcelona as well as a number of us institutions in allowing google to index at least part of its collection . search engine has some critics while the plan would make the books available to anyone unable to make the journey to southern germany , not everyone in europe is pleased with the idea of an american corporation cataloging european literature . jean-noel jeanneney , director of the french national library , said google 's attempt to index world knowledge would lead to " cultural homogenization " as it would have a near monopoly on deciding which books are made available digitally . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : microsoft said authors are n't profiting from having their books indexed online it 's a charge david drummond , google 's chief legal officer , denied .

" our action plan emphasizes the need to implement preventive measures for specific groups of the population , " schmidt said . targeting migrants " we ’ re going to offer special measures for people with a migrant origin , " schmidt added .
" we need to take into account their different cultural backgrounds and the fact that many of these people don ’ t have a sufficient command of the german language to understand anti-aids spots for native germans .

at the same time , it has called on the german media to keep the subject in the news . developing countries are key reports on aids in germany have declined in number and have primarily focused on the epidemic as a problem of developing nations and eastern europe .
tv stations ’ willingness to show anti-aids spots for free has declined dramatically , also within the public broadcasting networks . development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul added that germany would spend about 400 million euros this year on measures to fight aids , malaria and tuberculosis world-wide . “ it ’ s our task to ensure , together with the world bank and other institutions , that health centers in developing countries have enough personnel to do a good job , " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ad campaigns must also be aimed at immigrants , the cabinet said " within the european union we must agree on a code of conduct which would keep us from luring medical staff from africa to our countries . ” increasing drug-resistance schmidt said it was important to increase research into drug-resistant hiv strains .
about 15 percent of newly infected germans develop such dangerous strains . # b # their upsurge is threatening to nullify many of the recent medical advances in aids treatment .
it is expected that drug-resistant strains will continue to be on the rise over the next few years . a special government program allocates 3 million euros until 2009 to study drug-resistant strains in the hope to better understand their nature and find cures for them . hardy graupner -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu aims to coordinate national development aid programs the german development institute appealed to the eu to push for more efficiency in development programs .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 08.03.2007 german carmakers rev up effort to enter hybrid market großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the market for hybrids is growing - so where are the german cars ?
amid increasing consumer awareness of global warming and other environmental issues , german carmakers have had to fight off growing criticism about their apparent lack of will to build environmentally friendly cars . energy-efficient cars have long been the talk of the automotive industry .
but while they have been working on improving the mileage that can be gotten out of regular petrol- and diesel-burning engines , german carmakers have yet to produce a hybrid - a car that combines an electric motor and battery with standard combustion engine in order to cut fuel consumption . in fact , germany trails the world 's automakers in terms of environmental developments , according to the german auto club -lrb- vcd -rrb- consumer group .
the country only has one entry - vw 's polo blue motion - in the list of the ten most environmentally friendly cars . japan leads the pack with its two hybrid cars , the toyota prius and the honda civic , the group said . now , just ahead of the 77th international motor show in geneva , it seems high-end german manufacturers are clamoring to get on the eco-car bandwagon anywhere they can . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a toyota hybrid x concept car presented in geneva volkswagen presented its super-efficient , ultra-low emission blue motion line , and vw and porsche have announced they are working together on a line of eco-friendly cars to come out by 2008 .
bmw and chrysler , meanwhile , announced plans to team up to develop a " mild hybrid " transmission system for rear-wheel-drive premium cars .
even full hybrids might be on the horizon . emissions battle " we had n't expected this to become such an emotionally charged issue , " said vw ceo martin winterkorn , explaining to der spiegel magazine why his company was so late to get into the eco-car market .
he noted that audi had tried to bring a hybrid car to market in the 1990s , but it was a flop ; the market was n't yet ripe . but the tide has definitely turned , and some observers wonder if the current german effort is too little , too late . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : toyota prius - engine of the future ?
after all , in recent weeks the industry has spent much of its energy loudly battling the eu over its plan to regulate car emissions .
the severe co2 emissions reduction would have endangered all the best-sellers in the german fleet . in the end , the eu called for increased use of bio-fuels and cleaner fossil fuels - but revised its regulation standards to give the heavy , fast , gas-guzzling german cars more breathing room . and until now , the german auto industry had openly dismissed hybrids as a passing fad . but their evident popularity , along with increasing concerns about global warming , seem to have carmakers rethinking earlier assumptions . hybrids ' success japanese carmaker toyota , which rolled out its gas-saving prius hybrid nine years ago , has been cashing in on that move ever since .
and the outlook is good in an otherwise stagnant market . " over the next few years we plan to double our hybrid vehicle offering , anticipating annual sales of over one million hybrid vehicles by early in the next decade , " toyota europe vp tierry dombreval told reporters in geneva . meanwhile , other european and us manufacturers have made inroads in creating an eco-friendly image for thesmelves , beating germany to the punch . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : style counts , and small cars are more fuel efficient in september , citroën and peugeot introduced eco-cars of their own .
saab 's plan for a cabriolet hybrid that can run on pure ethanol as well as classic petrol wowed critics at the paris auto show in september . and us carmaker ford is promising an expansion of similar " flexifuel " technology , allowing the use of cleaner vegetable based bio-fuels across a whole model range by next year . will germany 's relative silence on the subject give consumers the impression that toyota and other companies care more about the environment than vw , mercedes , audi , porsche et al ?
critics think so .
and they warn that the german car industry may soon be kicking itself for missed a window of market opportunity . push for diesel but vw 's winterkorn , who used to lead audi , dismisses this criticism . " for years we 've been investing billions to reduce fuel consumption with direct-injection diesel and gasoline engines .
we reduced weight at audi with aluminium bodies and at vw with lightweight steel , to name a few examples , " he told der spiegel . so far , the germans have put most of their environmental energy into developing cleaner diesel fuels and engines . their hopes were to spark a diesel revolution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vw 's martin winterkorn " whoever comes out on top in terms of diesel technology is in the best position when it comes to c02 emissions , " said bernd gottschalk , head of the german automobile manufacturers association . but the push has been largely ignored in the world 's largest car market , the us , where essentially only large trucks tend to pump diesel .
and critics note that while diesel engines produce less carbon dioxide , they contribute more harmful nitrates to the environment .
hybrids , on the other hand , produce less co2 and less nitrates as well . according to gottschalk , the fact that german manufacturers have presented plans for more fuel-efficient , low-emission cars in geneva " proves that we did n't just start developing environmentally friendly cars today , and that we are n't only interested in the premium car segment . " jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans encouraged to holiday at home for environment 's sake an intense debate has begun in germany on the kind of lifestyle changes needed to cut greenhouse gas emissions , days before eu leaders hold a summit on energy and climate change .

but while they have been working on improving the mileage that can be gotten out of regular petrol- and diesel-burning engines , german carmakers have yet to produce a hybrid - a car that combines an electric motor and battery with standard combustion engine in order to cut fuel consumption . in fact , germany trails the world 's automakers in terms of environmental developments , according to the german auto club -lrb- vcd -rrb- consumer group .

a ruling in their favor by the european court would pave the way for further legal action in home courts . group members said they were subjected to a lifetime of discrimination and charge the norwegian government with inaction that violated civil rights granted to them by the european convention on human rights . " i hope the court will get enough information so that it can take up our case and judge it , " one of the plaintiffs , 65-year-old gerd fleischer , told the afp news agency . children often tormented by others bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fleischer said she suffered a lifetime of discrimination like fleischer , between 10,000 and 12,000 children were born to norwegian mothers and german soldiers during germany 's occupation of norway .
among the best known of the " war children " is anni-frid lyngstad of famed swedish disco group abba . many of the children were born and raised in the lebensborn or font of life project , which created centers organized by ss leader heinrich himmler to promote a genetically pure " aryan race . " the nazis set up homes in occupied territories including france , belgium and especially norway , to look after local women expecting children from german soldiers . " what the ss wanted was people who were resilient , dutiful and disciplined .
the kind of people who would be suited to run things in the new occupied areas , " said matthias meissner , managing director of lebensspuren -lrb- " traces of life " -rrb- , a group representing the lebensborn children that also setup the first meeting of grown lebensborn children in november . after the war , they became the focus of hatred .
they were commonly placed in host families or special institutions and were subjected to physical or mental harassment , abuse and even rape . harrowing experiences bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the children were well-taken care during the war , but faced severe discrimination after it " i understood that there was something terribly wrong with me when i started school at seven , " fleischer said .
" the other children would call me a ' german whore ' and i did not know what these words meant .
i had to ask my mother to explain them . " fleischer 's life was not much better at home .
her mother married a norwegian resistance fighter who used violence on the child . " when he was drunk , he would show his hatred towards me , " said fleischer , who ran away from home as a teenager . the norwegian government was so concerned with the issue of war children that it even tried to deport them to germany , sweden and australia .
after it was turned down , it decided to place the children with foster families or in institutions . some , wrongly labeled as mentally retarded , ended up in psychiatric institutions where they stayed until the age of 15 or 16 . claims rejected by norwegian courts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the strasbourg court is the group 's final chance to win compensation often , real identity papers of war children were destroyed , altered , or , in some cases , classified as " defense secrets " until 1986 , preventing many of them from ever finding their biological parents .
many are still unaware of their past . despite the tragic lives they led , their fight against the norwegian state has proven fruitless since every legal action they attempted in national courts was turned down .
the norwegian state has made some efforts to address the situation .
in 2000 , then prime minister kjell magne bondevik apologized to the war children in his new year 's speech .
in 2005 , the norwegian parliament decided that war children were eligible for financial compensation of up to 20,000 kroner each -lrb- $ 3,200 , 2,440 euros -rrb- , a decision the now-grown children met with scorn .
" it is yet another insult , " fleischer said .
" it is the smallest compensation the parliament has ever given to anyone .
they call what we have been through ' bullying ' , not at all the right word for the harassment and the ordeals the norwegian state put us through . " if the european court turns us down , " she adds , " it would be a terrible blow for many of us -lrb- who -rrb- feel such a need for recognition and reparation .

" with today 's announcement we are literally opening the library to the entire world and bringing the real purpose of libraries - namely the discovery of knowledge and books - a deciding step further into the digital age , " he said .
" it is a fascinating challenge to present germany 's rich literary tradition to every reader in the world . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : about 11 percent of the library 's collection will be posted to the internet books still subject to copyright law will not be available in full online , he said , adding that only excerpts would accompany the book 's bibliographic information , including its title and author . founded in 1558 and currently with some 9 million volumes , the bavarian library is one of the largest in the german-speaking world , and joins university libraries from oxford , madrid and barcelona as well as a number of us institutions in allowing google to index at least part of its collection . search engine has some critics while the plan would make the books available to anyone unable to make the journey to southern germany , not everyone in europe is pleased with the idea of an american corporation cataloging european literature . jean-noel jeanneney , director of the french national library , said google 's attempt to index world knowledge would lead to " cultural homogenization " as it would have a near monopoly on deciding which books are made available digitally . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : microsoft said authors are n't profiting from having their books indexed online it 's a charge david drummond , google 's chief legal officer , denied . " the goal ... of products like google book search is to help users find information from content producers of every size , " he said in a statement .

" today 's decision is an important step in improving prosecution of people who engage in doping , " said german interior minister wolfgang schäuble in berlin .
" with this draft law we are taking action against doping , together with sports authorities . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pro cycling is one of the sports most affected by doping the decision to sign off on the draft came in the wake of the usual arguments : athletes who take illegal performance enhancing drugs deceive not only competitors , but the public and sports organizers as well .
doping is bad for the athlete 's own health and society at large , since top athletes are role modes for children . details to come ... the government is hoping for a rapid passage of the bill in germany 's two legislative bodies , the bundestag and bundesrat .
after months-long debate , the ruling coalition of christian democrats and social democrats agreed to the major points of the law , which makes possession of " larger " amounts of frequently used doping substances punishable by law . a list of which , and how much , of these substances will be decided upon later . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drug commissioner bätzing said doping 's a huge problem the law gives investigative authority for internationally organized dealing in certain substances to germany 's federal criminal police -lrb- bka -rrb- .
warnings will be included on the package insert instructions for drugs that are known to be used in doping . schäuble stressed the need for a close relationship between sports and politics in the fight against doping .
" we 'll only be successful if we work on this together , " he said , and called on the worlds of sport and business to work closely to combat doping . sending a signal sabine bätzing , germany 's federal commissioner on drugs , said doping had become a " huge problem " in german sports .
" punishing people for possession of doping drugs is a signal against substance abuse , and for overall health , in leisure sports as well , " said bätzing , who is also a parliamentarian . on thursday , germany 's national anti-doping agency published figures showing that 62 of the 8196 , or 0.7 percent , of the doping tests it ran in 2006 were positive .
most of the controls were done in track and field sports .
the numbers were essentially unchanged since 2005 . criticism of the cabinet plan came from the conservative state of bavaria , which said the draft law does not go far enough . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ex-east german shot-putter birgit boese is a victim of doping 's effects " the draft law shows direction , but it needs to be filled out , " said bavarian state justice minister beate merk .
she complained that possession of even small amounts of doping substances should be punishable by law , which currently only applies to larger amounts . this means state prosecutors and police have their hands tied during investigations , because in most cases there will not be sufficient cause for issuing a search warrant , she said . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de jan ullrich announces immediate retirement jan ullrich 's cycling career was irreparable damaged last summer when he was accused of doping , dropped by t-mobile and suspended from the tour de france .

it is the finale of that symphony , based on friedrich schiller 's " ode an die freude " -lrb- ode to joy -rrb- , that provides the motto for this year 's festival . beethoven also wrote a patriotic symphonic work , " wellingtons sieg oder die schlacht bei vittoria , " celebrating the duke of wellington 's victory over the french at the battle of vitoria in spain in 1821 .

this year 's festival is being headed by ilona schmiel and has a budget of 3.65 million euros -lrb- $ 4.8 million -rrb- . disclosure : deutsche welle is an official partner of the annual beethovenfest and dw-world.de will offer selected festival works as free podcasts . dw staff / afp -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de beethovenfest bonn : symphonies and premieres click here to read dw-world.de 's coverage of the 2006 beethovenfest .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 08.03.2007 german carmakers rev up effort to enter hybrid market großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the market for hybrids is growing - so where are the german cars ?
amid increasing consumer awareness of global warming and other environmental issues , german carmakers have had to fight off growing criticism about their apparent lack of will to build environmentally friendly cars . energy-efficient cars have long been the talk of the automotive industry .
but while they have been working on improving the mileage that can be gotten out of regular petrol- and diesel-burning engines , german carmakers have yet to produce a hybrid - a car that combines an electric motor and battery with standard combustion engine in order to cut fuel consumption . in fact , germany trails the world 's automakers in terms of environmental developments , according to the german auto club -lrb- vcd -rrb- consumer group .
the country only has one entry - vw 's polo blue motion - in the list of the ten most environmentally friendly cars . japan leads the pack with its two hybrid cars , the toyota prius and the honda civic , the group said . now , just ahead of the 77th international motor show in geneva , it seems high-end german manufacturers are clamoring to get on the eco-car bandwagon anywhere they can . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a toyota hybrid x concept car presented in geneva volkswagen presented its super-efficient , ultra-low emission blue motion line , and vw and porsche have announced they are working together on a line of eco-friendly cars to come out by 2008 .
bmw and chrysler , meanwhile , announced plans to team up to develop a " mild hybrid " transmission system for rear-wheel-drive premium cars .
even full hybrids might be on the horizon . emissions battle " we had n't expected this to become such an emotionally charged issue , " said vw ceo martin winterkorn , explaining to der spiegel magazine why his company was so late to get into the eco-car market .
he noted that audi had tried to bring a hybrid car to market in the 1990s , but it was a flop ; the market was n't yet ripe . but the tide has definitely turned , and some observers wonder if the current german effort is too little , too late . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : toyota prius - engine of the future ?
after all , in recent weeks the industry has spent much of its energy loudly battling the eu over its plan to regulate car emissions .
the severe co2 emissions reduction would have endangered all the best-sellers in the german fleet . in the end , the eu called for increased use of bio-fuels and cleaner fossil fuels - but revised its regulation standards to give the heavy , fast , gas-guzzling german cars more breathing room . and until now , the german auto industry had openly dismissed hybrids as a passing fad . but their evident popularity , along with increasing concerns about global warming , seem to have carmakers rethinking earlier assumptions . hybrids ' success japanese carmaker toyota , which rolled out its gas-saving prius hybrid nine years ago , has been cashing in on that move ever since .
and the outlook is good in an otherwise stagnant market . " over the next few years we plan to double our hybrid vehicle offering , anticipating annual sales of over one million hybrid vehicles by early in the next decade , " toyota europe vp tierry dombreval told reporters in geneva . meanwhile , other european and us manufacturers have made inroads in creating an eco-friendly image for thesmelves , beating germany to the punch . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : style counts , and small cars are more fuel efficient in september , citroën and peugeot introduced eco-cars of their own .
saab 's plan for a cabriolet hybrid that can run on pure ethanol as well as classic petrol wowed critics at the paris auto show in september . and us carmaker ford is promising an expansion of similar " flexifuel " technology , allowing the use of cleaner vegetable based bio-fuels across a whole model range by next year . will germany 's relative silence on the subject give consumers the impression that toyota and other companies care more about the environment than vw , mercedes , audi , porsche et al ?
critics think so .
and they warn that the german car industry may soon be kicking itself for missed a window of market opportunity . push for diesel but vw 's winterkorn , who used to lead audi , dismisses this criticism . " for years we 've been investing billions to reduce fuel consumption with direct-injection diesel and gasoline engines .
we reduced weight at audi with aluminium bodies and at vw with lightweight steel , to name a few examples , " he told der spiegel . so far , the germans have put most of their environmental energy into developing cleaner diesel fuels and engines . their hopes were to spark a diesel revolution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vw 's martin winterkorn " whoever comes out on top in terms of diesel technology is in the best position when it comes to c02 emissions , " said bernd gottschalk , head of the german automobile manufacturers association . but the push has been largely ignored in the world 's largest car market , the us , where essentially only large trucks tend to pump diesel .
and critics note that while diesel engines produce less carbon dioxide , they contribute more harmful nitrates to the environment .
hybrids , on the other hand , produce less co2 and less nitrates as well . according to gottschalk , the fact that german manufacturers have presented plans for more fuel-efficient , low-emission cars in geneva " proves that we did n't just start developing environmentally friendly cars today , and that we are n't only interested in the premium car segment .

" a decision is not forthcoming , " said the letter sent to keller by the presidential office and undersigned by the president 's assistant secretary , gert haller , under orders from köhler himself .

" a decision is not forthcoming , " said the letter sent to keller by the presidential office and undersigned by the president 's assistant secretary , gert haller , under orders from köhler himself .
" many points of view have to be considered and due to this , a decision may take some time .

" banning access to the web site does not punish those who did that -lrb- posted the videos -rrb- but the citizens of the turkish republic , " said student kursat cetinkoz , reading from a petition the group submitted to the court in istanbul . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : youtube is an incredibly popular portal for video amateurs turkey 's largest telecommunications provider , turk telekom , has blocked access to the youtube web site on a court order over a video - submitted by a greek user - which portrayed the founding father of modern turkey mustafa kemal ataturk as a homosexual . " the court order was faxed to us last night -lrb- tuesday -rrb- and as a result the company 's services were suspended in turkey , " paul doany , chairman of turk telekom told the anatolia news agency on wednesday . according to the liberal daily vatan , the video in question was part of a cyber battle between turks and greeks on the web site since the beginning of the year , with both parties submitting videos or comments allegedly mocking or insulting the other . a national hero bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ataturk is turkey 's national hero ataturk , who proclaimed modern day turkey in 1923 , is seen as a national hero by secular turks and his legacy is protected under a special law .

" we have been notified of a court order and we are doing what that order says . " youtube was dismayed by the move , adding that the offending video had been removed from the site . " we are disappointed that youtube has been blocked in turkey , " the company said in a statement .
" while technology can bring great opportunity and access to information globally , it can also present new and unique cultural challenges . " turkish media expert fatih vulcan was cautions about welcoming the court decision . " if there is an insult to ataturk , that should prevent the showing of the video , " vulcan said .

over 50 writers and intellectuals have been prosecuted under article 301 of the turkish penal code that makes insulting " turkishness " a crime - including nobel prize winner orhan pamuk and armenian-turkish journalist hrant dink .
dink was gunned down and killed by a nationalist youth in january . this is also not the first time the web site has been sucked into turkish politics .
an extreme-right turkish group , which has been blamed for several political murders , recently produced a video threatening turkey 's liberal intellectuals with the same fate as hrant dink .
that clip was removed by youtube after numerous complaints , but it did not lead to the general ban of the web site . the court order banning youtube in turkey , which is hoping to join the european union , comes at a particularly sensitive moment for the country as it tries to improve its human rights image . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german google offline after internet mix-up google , the world 's biggest web-search engine , had its german web site cut off from the internet early tuesday , apparently after somebody reassigned the rights to its google.de address .

23 . out of 55 national and regional projects by the iaea that provide technical aid to iran , 10 have been suspended , while another 12 may only proceed in part after " case-by-case screening by the -lrb- iaea -rrb- secretariat . " a total of 33 projects listed in a feb .
9 report by iaea chief mohamed el baradei will continue . " the reduction in aid was adopted by consensus , " an agency spokesman said . the security council resolution imposed sanctions on iran for continuing to enrich uranium , which makes nuclear reactor fuel but also atom bomb material , and called for iaea aid to iran to be slashed , although the cuts can be rolled back if iran complies with the resolution . only two other countries in the iaea 's 50-year history have been stripped of their nuclear aid over concerns about possible attempts to make bombs - north korea and saddam hussein 's iraq . the united states has accused iran of carrying out research to build a nuclear bomb . a peaceful effort ? iaea chief mohamed el baradei said monday his agency is still unable to verify that iran is not seeking nuclear weapons , in a report to this week 's meeting of the iaea 's governing board about iran 's defiance of un demands . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ali asghar soltanieh insisted the cuts would not hurt iran 's uranium enrichment iran says its program is a peaceful effort to generate electricity and iran 's ambassador ali asghar soltanieh said the iaea aid cuts would not affect its uranium enrichment work . " none of these projects are related to the enrichment program , " soltanieh told reporters . " the enrichment program will continue as planned under iaea safeguards .
we will neither stop our nuclear activities , enrichment , nor will we stop our work with the iaea and we will continue this trend and policy , " he said . developing nations are concerned that politically motivated action could set a precedent that could hurt their aid projects .
but they backed the cuts on the recommendation of iaea chief mohamed el baradei , diplomats said . a sensitive area german ambassador peter gottwald , speaking for the european union , told the board wednesday that nations clearly have a right to the peaceful use of nuclear energy . but he said " it is the european union 's understanding that no assistance shall be provided to the islamic republic of iran in the proliferation-sensitive areas of enrichment related , reprocessing or heavy water related activities or the development of nuclear weapon delivery systems , " according to a copy of his speech . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu has held extensive talks with iran - here iran 's chief nuclear negotiator ali larijani with eu foreign policy chief , javier solana gottwald recalled the un resolution 's stipulation that aid is only to be given for food , agricultural , medical , safety or other humanitarian purposes . in november last year , the iaea had already rejected tehran 's request for technical help in building a heavy-water reactor in arak that the west fears could provide plutonium , also a possible nuclear weapons material . examples from an iaea report show approval of a project to help iran " prepare therapeutic sources . . . and radiopharmaceuticals for cancer treatment , " saying this was " entirely for medical purposes . " but the agency rejected a project " to strengthen ... capabilities ... for provision of safe and reliable nuclear power generation capacities , " saying this was outside what is allowed in the un resolution . a thorn in the west 's eye there was no question , however , of blocking iaea aid to the construction of iran 's first nuclear reactor in bushehr , for which russia has a billion-dollar contract , as the un resolution said this project was untouchable . the iaea board also debated israel 's nuclear program , as the arab league has expressed " deep concern and great disquiet " over israeli prime minister ehud olmert 's comments in december that seemed to confirm that israel has nuclear weapons . cuban ambassador norma estenoz , speaking for the non-aligned movement , said nam states on the board reiterated their " support for the establishment in the middle east of a zone free of all weapons of mass destruction . " soltanieh spoke against israel having nuclear weapons as " a uniquely grave threat " to world peace . israel is believed to have some 200 atom bombs but has a policy of neither confirming nor denying this . dw staff / afp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran sets preconditions for new nuclear talks president mahmoud ahmadinejad has rejected a looming un deadline for iran to suspend uranium enrichment .
he said iran would only halt the sensitive nuclear activity if the west suspended its own nuclear programs .
-lrb- 20.02.2007 -rrb- iran faces eu punishment for nuclear obstinacy even while hoping for a new window of opportunity to start negotiations with tehran , eu ministers agreed monday to imposing sanctions against iran for continuing its uranium enrichment program .

it 's a hard life offering unconditional comfort and support to stressed-out humans .
once in a while , stuffed animals have to think about themselves - and when they do , they go to germany . being a cuddly toy is apparently just like any other job .
the hours can be long and the repetitive stroking can get a little boring at times .
and while the wages of eternal love and affection from one 's human companion can make it all worthwhile , even the most dedicated comforter can do with a break every now and again . but where does one go when the stresses and strains of constant petting and listening to people 's problems get to be too much ?
well , it seems that germany would be the best bet for a stuffed animal looking to let its faux hair down . germany is rapidly becoming the holiday destination of choice for frazzled fake furry friends .

teddy tour berlin offers three categories for the discerning stuffed toy : compact , exclusive and deluxe . the more money you spend , the more your plush pal can enjoy the german capital .
the prices range from 75 euros -lrb- $ 98.40 -rrb- for a compact tour for a german toy to 140 euros -lrb- $ 183.70 -rrb- for an animal from outside western europe taking the full deluxe tour of the city 's landmarks . hamburg popular with night-owls and rabbits in hamburg , woolly wanderers can enjoy a chauffeur service around the hanseatic port before taking in a bit of rock- ' n ' -roll history at the star club , where the beatles played , and heading to the seedier side of town for a night out on the city 's notorious reeperbahn .
this offer is particularly popular with the rabbits . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the teddies on tour are in good hands " we offer a complete visitor 's program , " hamburg tour guide niklas knippschild told german press agency dpa .
" i think this is a first-class idea .

his business partner , yvonne werny , assured potential customers that their much-loved companions would be in good hands .
" we treat those animals that are entrusted to us very carefully , " she added . toys who go for the hamburg experience come home with a photo cd of all the places they have visited , a popular extra within the price of many tour packages across germany .

" our action plan emphasizes the need to implement preventive measures for specific groups of the population , " schmidt said . targeting migrants " we ’ re going to offer special measures for people with a migrant origin , " schmidt added .

tv stations ’ willingness to show anti-aids spots for free has declined dramatically , also within the public broadcasting networks . development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul added that germany would spend about 400 million euros this year on measures to fight aids , malaria and tuberculosis world-wide . “ it ’ s our task to ensure , together with the world bank and other institutions , that health centers in developing countries have enough personnel to do a good job , " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ad campaigns must also be aimed at immigrants , the cabinet said " within the european union we must agree on a code of conduct which would keep us from luring medical staff from africa to our countries . ” increasing drug-resistance schmidt said it was important to increase research into drug-resistant hiv strains .
about 15 percent of newly infected germans develop such dangerous strains . # b # their upsurge is threatening to nullify many of the recent medical advances in aids treatment .
it is expected that drug-resistant strains will continue to be on the rise over the next few years . a special government program allocates 3 million euros until 2009 to study drug-resistant strains in the hope to better understand their nature and find cures for them . hardy graupner -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu aims to coordinate national development aid programs the german development institute appealed to the eu to push for more efficiency in development programs .

doping is bad for the athlete 's own health and society at large , since top athletes are role modes for children . details to come ... the government is hoping for a rapid passage of the bill in germany 's two legislative bodies , the bundestag and bundesrat .
after months-long debate , the ruling coalition of christian democrats and social democrats agreed to the major points of the law , which makes possession of " larger " amounts of frequently used doping substances punishable by law . a list of which , and how much , of these substances will be decided upon later . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drug commissioner bätzing said doping 's a huge problem the law gives investigative authority for internationally organized dealing in certain substances to germany 's federal criminal police -lrb- bka -rrb- .

" we 'll only be successful if we work on this together , " he said , and called on the worlds of sport and business to work closely to combat doping . sending a signal sabine bätzing , germany 's federal commissioner on drugs , said doping had become a " huge problem " in german sports .
" punishing people for possession of doping drugs is a signal against substance abuse , and for overall health , in leisure sports as well , " said bätzing , who is also a parliamentarian . on thursday , germany 's national anti-doping agency published figures showing that 62 of the 8196 , or 0.7 percent , of the doping tests it ran in 2006 were positive .
most of the controls were done in track and field sports .

she complained that possession of even small amounts of doping substances should be punishable by law , which currently only applies to larger amounts . this means state prosecutors and police have their hands tied during investigations , because in most cases there will not be sufficient cause for issuing a search warrant , she said . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de jan ullrich announces immediate retirement jan ullrich 's cycling career was irreparable damaged last summer when he was accused of doping , dropped by t-mobile and suspended from the tour de france .

" with today 's announcement we are literally opening the library to the entire world and bringing the real purpose of libraries - namely the discovery of knowledge and books - a deciding step further into the digital age , " he said .
" it is a fascinating challenge to present germany 's rich literary tradition to every reader in the world . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : about 11 percent of the library 's collection will be posted to the internet books still subject to copyright law will not be available in full online , he said , adding that only excerpts would accompany the book 's bibliographic information , including its title and author . founded in 1558 and currently with some 9 million volumes , the bavarian library is one of the largest in the german-speaking world , and joins university libraries from oxford , madrid and barcelona as well as a number of us institutions in allowing google to index at least part of its collection . search engine has some critics while the plan would make the books available to anyone unable to make the journey to southern germany , not everyone in europe is pleased with the idea of an american corporation cataloging european literature . jean-noel jeanneney , director of the french national library , said google 's attempt to index world knowledge would lead to " cultural homogenization " as it would have a near monopoly on deciding which books are made available digitally . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : microsoft said authors are n't profiting from having their books indexed online it 's a charge david drummond , google 's chief legal officer , denied . " the goal ... of products like google book search is to help users find information from content producers of every size , " he said in a statement . " we do this by complying with international copyright laws , and the result has been more exposure and in many cases more revenue for authors , publishers , and producers of content , " drummond added . google accused of copyright infringement google competitor microsoft also leveled an attack at google 's book search project this week . top microsoft lawyer tom rubin came as the two corporate titans step up their competition in both the software and online content markets . google " appears to be trying wherever possible to skirt copyright law 's boundaries , " rubin , microsoft 's associate general counsel for intellectual property , wrote in a financial times opinion piece . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google said authors and publishers can choose not to have their work digitized " this project may well bring significant commercial advantage to google , " rubin said .
" by contrast , those who own the copyrights in these works would gain little or nothing from google 's plan . " the microsoft lawyer criticized google 's justification of its book scanning as " fair use " under us copyright law , calling it a " novel " interpretation that would stretch to countries where the fair use concept is not recognized . drummond said the company offered authors and publishers the opportunity to opt-out of the book search feature , adding that google has more than 10,000 partners in publishing , and its newly acquired video-sharing web site youtube has recently tied up with the british broadcasting corp. and the national basketball association . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de belgian newspapers win copyright case against google a belgian court dealt a blow to google on tuesday by ruling against the us internet giant in a copyright case lodged by french-language belgian newspapers and closely watched by other media in europe .

23 . out of 55 national and regional projects by the iaea that provide technical aid to iran , 10 have been suspended , while another 12 may only proceed in part after " case-by-case screening by the -lrb- iaea -rrb- secretariat . " a total of 33 projects listed in a feb .
9 report by iaea chief mohamed el baradei will continue . " the reduction in aid was adopted by consensus , " an agency spokesman said . the security council resolution imposed sanctions on iran for continuing to enrich uranium , which makes nuclear reactor fuel but also atom bomb material , and called for iaea aid to iran to be slashed , although the cuts can be rolled back if iran complies with the resolution . only two other countries in the iaea 's 50-year history have been stripped of their nuclear aid over concerns about possible attempts to make bombs - north korea and saddam hussein 's iraq . the united states has accused iran of carrying out research to build a nuclear bomb . a peaceful effort ? iaea chief mohamed el baradei said monday his agency is still unable to verify that iran is not seeking nuclear weapons , in a report to this week 's meeting of the iaea 's governing board about iran 's defiance of un demands . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ali asghar soltanieh insisted the cuts would not hurt iran 's uranium enrichment iran says its program is a peaceful effort to generate electricity and iran 's ambassador ali asghar soltanieh said the iaea aid cuts would not affect its uranium enrichment work . " none of these projects are related to the enrichment program , " soltanieh told reporters . " the enrichment program will continue as planned under iaea safeguards .
we will neither stop our nuclear activities , enrichment , nor will we stop our work with the iaea and we will continue this trend and policy , " he said . developing nations are concerned that politically motivated action could set a precedent that could hurt their aid projects .
but they backed the cuts on the recommendation of iaea chief mohamed el baradei , diplomats said . a sensitive area german ambassador peter gottwald , speaking for the european union , told the board wednesday that nations clearly have a right to the peaceful use of nuclear energy . but he said " it is the european union 's understanding that no assistance shall be provided to the islamic republic of iran in the proliferation-sensitive areas of enrichment related , reprocessing or heavy water related activities or the development of nuclear weapon delivery systems , " according to a copy of his speech . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu has held extensive talks with iran - here iran 's chief nuclear negotiator ali larijani with eu foreign policy chief , javier solana gottwald recalled the un resolution 's stipulation that aid is only to be given for food , agricultural , medical , safety or other humanitarian purposes . in november last year , the iaea had already rejected tehran 's request for technical help in building a heavy-water reactor in arak that the west fears could provide plutonium , also a possible nuclear weapons material . examples from an iaea report show approval of a project to help iran " prepare therapeutic sources . . . and radiopharmaceuticals for cancer treatment , " saying this was " entirely for medical purposes . " but the agency rejected a project " to strengthen ... capabilities ... for provision of safe and reliable nuclear power generation capacities , " saying this was outside what is allowed in the un resolution . a thorn in the west 's eye there was no question , however , of blocking iaea aid to the construction of iran 's first nuclear reactor in bushehr , for which russia has a billion-dollar contract , as the un resolution said this project was untouchable . the iaea board also debated israel 's nuclear program , as the arab league has expressed " deep concern and great disquiet " over israeli prime minister ehud olmert 's comments in december that seemed to confirm that israel has nuclear weapons . cuban ambassador norma estenoz , speaking for the non-aligned movement , said nam states on the board reiterated their " support for the establishment in the middle east of a zone free of all weapons of mass destruction . " soltanieh spoke against israel having nuclear weapons as " a uniquely grave threat " to world peace . israel is believed to have some 200 atom bombs but has a policy of neither confirming nor denying this . dw staff / afp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran sets preconditions for new nuclear talks president mahmoud ahmadinejad has rejected a looming un deadline for iran to suspend uranium enrichment .
he said iran would only halt the sensitive nuclear activity if the west suspended its own nuclear programs .
-lrb- 20.02.2007 -rrb- iran faces eu punishment for nuclear obstinacy even while hoping for a new window of opportunity to start negotiations with tehran , eu ministers agreed monday to imposing sanctions against iran for continuing its uranium enrichment program .
-lrb- 12.02.2007 -rrb- germany takes positives from another controversial conference a " threat " of a new cold war and a potential new stalemate over iran 's nuclear program could have brought this weekend 's munich security conference to a bitter end .

" the court order was faxed to us last night -lrb- tuesday -rrb- and as a result the company 's services were suspended in turkey , " paul doany , chairman of turk telekom told the anatolia news agency on wednesday . according to the liberal daily vatan , the video in question was part of a cyber battle between turks and greeks on the web site since the beginning of the year , with both parties submitting videos or comments allegedly mocking or insulting the other . a national hero bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ataturk is turkey 's national hero ataturk , who proclaimed modern day turkey in 1923 , is seen as a national hero by secular turks and his legacy is protected under a special law .

" while technology can bring great opportunity and access to information globally , it can also present new and unique cultural challenges . " turkish media expert fatih vulcan was cautions about welcoming the court decision . " if there is an insult to ataturk , that should prevent the showing of the video , " vulcan said .

dink was gunned down and killed by a nationalist youth in january . this is also not the first time the web site has been sucked into turkish politics .
an extreme-right turkish group , which has been blamed for several political murders , recently produced a video threatening turkey 's liberal intellectuals with the same fate as hrant dink .
that clip was removed by youtube after numerous complaints , but it did not lead to the general ban of the web site . the court order banning youtube in turkey , which is hoping to join the european union , comes at a particularly sensitive moment for the country as it tries to improve its human rights image . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german google offline after internet mix-up google , the world 's biggest web-search engine , had its german web site cut off from the internet early tuesday , apparently after somebody reassigned the rights to its google.de address .

" it is great to be in the last eight , it is good for our image and everything is possible , " he said .
" we can be proud of beating real . " call for aggressive start answered bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lucio , left , headed in the goal that put munich through to the next round hitzfeld planned the spanish team 's downfall by calling for an aggressive start from his team - and reaped the reward of the fastest goal in champions league history when roy makaay struck just 10 seconds into the game , punishing a lapse on the part of madrid defender roberto carlos . munich managed to keep control for the better part of the match , but madrid were able to impress with bursts of skill they are known for and putting pressure on the bayern defense at the end of both halves . brazilian defender lucio 's second-half header seemed to have secured bayern 's victory before ruud van nistelrooy gave real faint hope with a well-struck penalty with 10 minutes remaining after lucio was adjudged to have brought down robinho . " the penalty was a gift to real and put them back in the saddle , " hitzfeld said .
" the last three or four minutes were tough , but we were still trying to attack . " real sealed own fate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : real madrid were without david beckham wednesday due to a knee injury real madrid coach fabio capello , however , said the reason for his side 's elimination was ultimately the gifts they provided to the bavarians . " we gave them two presents , makaay 's goal and van bommel 's at the end of the first leg , " capello told reporters .
" the early goal -lrb- on wednesday -rrb- changed the match completely .
all our plans and preparation went out of the window . " munich 's mark van bommel scored what ended up being a crucial second away goal late in the first leg two weeks ago in madrid that bayern lost 3-2 . bayern 's quarterfinal opponent will be decided in a draw on friday . no silverware yet this season bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitzfeld said this season will be his only chance to lift another trophy at bayern hitzfeld returned to bayern at the start of february after the sacking of felix magath , who booked a string of poor results to which the defending german champions were unaccustomed . bayern also stuttered in hitzfeld 's early games , losing to nuremberg and minnows alemannia aachen before hitting their stride with a 3-2 victory at hertha berlin at the weekend . they currently are placed fourth in the bundesliga , six points behind leaders schalke 04 . but despite injecting new life into germany 's biggest club , hitzfeld called for caution from any bayern fans already dreaming of a fourth continental crown . " we still have n't achieved anything this season , " he said .
" everything is at a critical stage . " one thing is for sure - if bayern do lift europe 's top club prize in athens on may 23 , it will be hitzfeld 's last game in charge .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 08.03.2007 german carmakers rev up effort to enter hybrid market großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the market for hybrids is growing - so where are the german cars ?
amid increasing consumer awareness of global warming and other environmental issues , german carmakers have had to fight off growing criticism about their apparent lack of will to build environmentally friendly cars . energy-efficient cars have long been the talk of the automotive industry .
but while they have been working on improving the mileage that can be gotten out of regular petrol- and diesel-burning engines , german carmakers have yet to produce a hybrid - a car that combines an electric motor and battery with standard combustion engine in order to cut fuel consumption . in fact , germany trails the world 's automakers in terms of environmental developments , according to the german auto club -lrb- vcd -rrb- consumer group .
the country only has one entry - vw 's polo blue motion - in the list of the ten most environmentally friendly cars . japan leads the pack with its two hybrid cars , the toyota prius and the honda civic , the group said . now , just ahead of the 77th international motor show in geneva , it seems high-end german manufacturers are clamoring to get on the eco-car bandwagon anywhere they can . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a toyota hybrid x concept car presented in geneva volkswagen presented its super-efficient , ultra-low emission blue motion line , and vw and porsche have announced they are working together on a line of eco-friendly cars to come out by 2008 .
bmw and chrysler , meanwhile , announced plans to team up to develop a " mild hybrid " transmission system for rear-wheel-drive premium cars .
even full hybrids might be on the horizon . emissions battle " we had n't expected this to become such an emotionally charged issue , " said vw ceo martin winterkorn , explaining to der spiegel magazine why his company was so late to get into the eco-car market .
he noted that audi had tried to bring a hybrid car to market in the 1990s , but it was a flop ; the market was n't yet ripe . but the tide has definitely turned , and some observers wonder if the current german effort is too little , too late . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : toyota prius - engine of the future ?
after all , in recent weeks the industry has spent much of its energy loudly battling the eu over its plan to regulate car emissions .
the severe co2 emissions reduction would have endangered all the best-sellers in the german fleet . in the end , the eu called for increased use of bio-fuels and cleaner fossil fuels - but revised its regulation standards to give the heavy , fast , gas-guzzling german cars more breathing room . and until now , the german auto industry had openly dismissed hybrids as a passing fad . but their evident popularity , along with increasing concerns about global warming , seem to have carmakers rethinking earlier assumptions . hybrids ' success japanese carmaker toyota , which rolled out its gas-saving prius hybrid nine years ago , has been cashing in on that move ever since .
and the outlook is good in an otherwise stagnant market . " over the next few years we plan to double our hybrid vehicle offering , anticipating annual sales of over one million hybrid vehicles by early in the next decade , " toyota europe vp tierry dombreval told reporters in geneva . meanwhile , other european and us manufacturers have made inroads in creating an eco-friendly image for thesmelves , beating germany to the punch . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : style counts , and small cars are more fuel efficient in september , citroën and peugeot introduced eco-cars of their own .
saab 's plan for a cabriolet hybrid that can run on pure ethanol as well as classic petrol wowed critics at the paris auto show in september . and us carmaker ford is promising an expansion of similar " flexifuel " technology , allowing the use of cleaner vegetable based bio-fuels across a whole model range by next year . will germany 's relative silence on the subject give consumers the impression that toyota and other companies care more about the environment than vw , mercedes , audi , porsche et al ?
critics think so .
and they warn that the german car industry may soon be kicking itself for missed a window of market opportunity . push for diesel but vw 's winterkorn , who used to lead audi , dismisses this criticism . " for years we 've been investing billions to reduce fuel consumption with direct-injection diesel and gasoline engines .
we reduced weight at audi with aluminium bodies and at vw with lightweight steel , to name a few examples , " he told der spiegel . so far , the germans have put most of their environmental energy into developing cleaner diesel fuels and engines . their hopes were to spark a diesel revolution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vw 's martin winterkorn " whoever comes out on top in terms of diesel technology is in the best position when it comes to c02 emissions , " said bernd gottschalk , head of the german automobile manufacturers association . but the push has been largely ignored in the world 's largest car market , the us , where essentially only large trucks tend to pump diesel .
and critics note that while diesel engines produce less carbon dioxide , they contribute more harmful nitrates to the environment .
hybrids , on the other hand , produce less co2 and less nitrates as well . according to gottschalk , the fact that german manufacturers have presented plans for more fuel-efficient , low-emission cars in geneva " proves that we did n't just start developing environmentally friendly cars today , and that we are n't only interested in the premium car segment . " jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans encouraged to holiday at home for environment 's sake an intense debate has begun in germany on the kind of lifestyle changes needed to cut greenhouse gas emissions , days before eu leaders hold a summit on energy and climate change .

amid increasing consumer awareness of global warming and other environmental issues , german carmakers have had to fight off growing criticism about their apparent lack of will to build environmentally friendly cars . energy-efficient cars have long been the talk of the automotive industry .
but while they have been working on improving the mileage that can be gotten out of regular petrol- and diesel-burning engines , german carmakers have yet to produce a hybrid - a car that combines an electric motor and battery with standard combustion engine in order to cut fuel consumption . in fact , germany trails the world 's automakers in terms of environmental developments , according to the german auto club -lrb- vcd -rrb- consumer group .
the country only has one entry - vw 's polo blue motion - in the list of the ten most environmentally friendly cars . japan leads the pack with its two hybrid cars , the toyota prius and the honda civic , the group said . now , just ahead of the 77th international motor show in geneva , it seems high-end german manufacturers are clamoring to get on the eco-car bandwagon anywhere they can . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a toyota hybrid x concept car presented in geneva volkswagen presented its super-efficient , ultra-low emission blue motion line , and vw and porsche have announced they are working together on a line of eco-friendly cars to come out by 2008 .
bmw and chrysler , meanwhile , announced plans to team up to develop a " mild hybrid " transmission system for rear-wheel-drive premium cars .
even full hybrids might be on the horizon . emissions battle " we had n't expected this to become such an emotionally charged issue , " said vw ceo martin winterkorn , explaining to der spiegel magazine why his company was so late to get into the eco-car market .

after all , in recent weeks the industry has spent much of its energy loudly battling the eu over its plan to regulate car emissions .
the severe co2 emissions reduction would have endangered all the best-sellers in the german fleet . in the end , the eu called for increased use of bio-fuels and cleaner fossil fuels - but revised its regulation standards to give the heavy , fast , gas-guzzling german cars more breathing room . and until now , the german auto industry had openly dismissed hybrids as a passing fad . but their evident popularity , along with increasing concerns about global warming , seem to have carmakers rethinking earlier assumptions . hybrids ' success japanese carmaker toyota , which rolled out its gas-saving prius hybrid nine years ago , has been cashing in on that move ever since .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 08.03.2007 war children appeal to european court of human rights großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lebensborn project was the subject of the 2000 film " spring of life " " war children " born to norwegian mothers who had relationships with german soldiers will ask the european court of human rights to consider their demand for compensation for the abuse they suffered since world war ii . in addition to financial compensation , the 154 norwegians , together with four swedish and one german national are hoping that the court will overturn previous decisions by norwegian courts which refused to examine their case because the statute of limitations had expired . the strasbourg court is to examine the request on thursday and decide at a later date whether it will take up their case .
a ruling in their favor by the european court would pave the way for further legal action in home courts . group members said they were subjected to a lifetime of discrimination and charge the norwegian government with inaction that violated civil rights granted to them by the european convention on human rights . " i hope the court will get enough information so that it can take up our case and judge it , " one of the plaintiffs , 65-year-old gerd fleischer , told the afp news agency . children often tormented by others bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fleischer said she suffered a lifetime of discrimination like fleischer , between 10,000 and 12,000 children were born to norwegian mothers and german soldiers during germany 's occupation of norway .
among the best known of the " war children " is anni-frid lyngstad of famed swedish disco group abba . many of the children were born and raised in the lebensborn or font of life project , which created centers organized by ss leader heinrich himmler to promote a genetically pure " aryan race . " the nazis set up homes in occupied territories including france , belgium and especially norway , to look after local women expecting children from german soldiers . " what the ss wanted was people who were resilient , dutiful and disciplined .
the kind of people who would be suited to run things in the new occupied areas , " said matthias meissner , managing director of lebensspuren -lrb- " traces of life " -rrb- , a group representing the lebensborn children that also setup the first meeting of grown lebensborn children in november . after the war , they became the focus of hatred .
they were commonly placed in host families or special institutions and were subjected to physical or mental harassment , abuse and even rape . harrowing experiences bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the children were well-taken care during the war , but faced severe discrimination after it " i understood that there was something terribly wrong with me when i started school at seven , " fleischer said .
" the other children would call me a ' german whore ' and i did not know what these words meant .
i had to ask my mother to explain them . " fleischer 's life was not much better at home .
her mother married a norwegian resistance fighter who used violence on the child . " when he was drunk , he would show his hatred towards me , " said fleischer , who ran away from home as a teenager . the norwegian government was so concerned with the issue of war children that it even tried to deport them to germany , sweden and australia .
after it was turned down , it decided to place the children with foster families or in institutions . some , wrongly labeled as mentally retarded , ended up in psychiatric institutions where they stayed until the age of 15 or 16 . claims rejected by norwegian courts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the strasbourg court is the group 's final chance to win compensation often , real identity papers of war children were destroyed , altered , or , in some cases , classified as " defense secrets " until 1986 , preventing many of them from ever finding their biological parents .
many are still unaware of their past . despite the tragic lives they led , their fight against the norwegian state has proven fruitless since every legal action they attempted in national courts was turned down .
the norwegian state has made some efforts to address the situation .
in 2000 , then prime minister kjell magne bondevik apologized to the war children in his new year 's speech .
in 2005 , the norwegian parliament decided that war children were eligible for financial compensation of up to 20,000 kroner each -lrb- $ 3,200 , 2,440 euros -rrb- , a decision the now-grown children met with scorn .
" it is yet another insult , " fleischer said .
" it is the smallest compensation the parliament has ever given to anyone .
they call what we have been through ' bullying ' , not at all the right word for the harassment and the ordeals the norwegian state put us through . " if the european court turns us down , " she adds , " it would be a terrible blow for many of us -lrb- who -rrb- feel such a need for recognition and reparation .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 08.03.2007 german carmakers rev up effort to enter hybrid market großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the market for hybrids is growing - so where are the german cars ?
amid increasing consumer awareness of global warming and other environmental issues , german carmakers have had to fight off growing criticism about their apparent lack of will to build environmentally friendly cars . energy-efficient cars have long been the talk of the automotive industry .
but while they have been working on improving the mileage that can be gotten out of regular petrol- and diesel-burning engines , german carmakers have yet to produce a hybrid - a car that combines an electric motor and battery with standard combustion engine in order to cut fuel consumption . in fact , germany trails the world 's automakers in terms of environmental developments , according to the german auto club -lrb- vcd -rrb- consumer group .
the country only has one entry - vw 's polo blue motion - in the list of the ten most environmentally friendly cars . japan leads the pack with its two hybrid cars , the toyota prius and the honda civic , the group said . now , just ahead of the 77th international motor show in geneva , it seems high-end german manufacturers are clamoring to get on the eco-car bandwagon anywhere they can . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a toyota hybrid x concept car presented in geneva volkswagen presented its super-efficient , ultra-low emission blue motion line , and vw and porsche have announced they are working together on a line of eco-friendly cars to come out by 2008 .
bmw and chrysler , meanwhile , announced plans to team up to develop a " mild hybrid " transmission system for rear-wheel-drive premium cars .
even full hybrids might be on the horizon . emissions battle " we had n't expected this to become such an emotionally charged issue , " said vw ceo martin winterkorn , explaining to der spiegel magazine why his company was so late to get into the eco-car market .
he noted that audi had tried to bring a hybrid car to market in the 1990s , but it was a flop ; the market was n't yet ripe . but the tide has definitely turned , and some observers wonder if the current german effort is too little , too late . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : toyota prius - engine of the future ?
after all , in recent weeks the industry has spent much of its energy loudly battling the eu over its plan to regulate car emissions .
the severe co2 emissions reduction would have endangered all the best-sellers in the german fleet . in the end , the eu called for increased use of bio-fuels and cleaner fossil fuels - but revised its regulation standards to give the heavy , fast , gas-guzzling german cars more breathing room . and until now , the german auto industry had openly dismissed hybrids as a passing fad . but their evident popularity , along with increasing concerns about global warming , seem to have carmakers rethinking earlier assumptions . hybrids ' success japanese carmaker toyota , which rolled out its gas-saving prius hybrid nine years ago , has been cashing in on that move ever since .
and the outlook is good in an otherwise stagnant market . " over the next few years we plan to double our hybrid vehicle offering , anticipating annual sales of over one million hybrid vehicles by early in the next decade , " toyota europe vp tierry dombreval told reporters in geneva . meanwhile , other european and us manufacturers have made inroads in creating an eco-friendly image for thesmelves , beating germany to the punch . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : style counts , and small cars are more fuel efficient in september , citroën and peugeot introduced eco-cars of their own .
saab 's plan for a cabriolet hybrid that can run on pure ethanol as well as classic petrol wowed critics at the paris auto show in september . and us carmaker ford is promising an expansion of similar " flexifuel " technology , allowing the use of cleaner vegetable based bio-fuels across a whole model range by next year . will germany 's relative silence on the subject give consumers the impression that toyota and other companies care more about the environment than vw , mercedes , audi , porsche et al ?
critics think so .
and they warn that the german car industry may soon be kicking itself for missed a window of market opportunity . push for diesel but vw 's winterkorn , who used to lead audi , dismisses this criticism . " for years we 've been investing billions to reduce fuel consumption with direct-injection diesel and gasoline engines .
we reduced weight at audi with aluminium bodies and at vw with lightweight steel , to name a few examples , " he told der spiegel . so far , the germans have put most of their environmental energy into developing cleaner diesel fuels and engines . their hopes were to spark a diesel revolution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vw 's martin winterkorn " whoever comes out on top in terms of diesel technology is in the best position when it comes to c02 emissions , " said bernd gottschalk , head of the german automobile manufacturers association . but the push has been largely ignored in the world 's largest car market , the us , where essentially only large trucks tend to pump diesel .
and critics note that while diesel engines produce less carbon dioxide , they contribute more harmful nitrates to the environment .
hybrids , on the other hand , produce less co2 and less nitrates as well . according to gottschalk , the fact that german manufacturers have presented plans for more fuel-efficient , low-emission cars in geneva " proves that we did n't just start developing environmentally friendly cars today , and that we are n't only interested in the premium car segment .

amid increasing consumer awareness of global warming and other environmental issues , german carmakers have had to fight off growing criticism about their apparent lack of will to build environmentally friendly cars . energy-efficient cars have long been the talk of the automotive industry .
but while they have been working on improving the mileage that can be gotten out of regular petrol- and diesel-burning engines , german carmakers have yet to produce a hybrid - a car that combines an electric motor and battery with standard combustion engine in order to cut fuel consumption . in fact , germany trails the world 's automakers in terms of environmental developments , according to the german auto club -lrb- vcd -rrb- consumer group .
the country only has one entry - vw 's polo blue motion - in the list of the ten most environmentally friendly cars . japan leads the pack with its two hybrid cars , the toyota prius and the honda civic , the group said . now , just ahead of the 77th international motor show in geneva , it seems high-end german manufacturers are clamoring to get on the eco-car bandwagon anywhere they can . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a toyota hybrid x concept car presented in geneva volkswagen presented its super-efficient , ultra-low emission blue motion line , and vw and porsche have announced they are working together on a line of eco-friendly cars to come out by 2008 .
bmw and chrysler , meanwhile , announced plans to team up to develop a " mild hybrid " transmission system for rear-wheel-drive premium cars .
even full hybrids might be on the horizon . emissions battle " we had n't expected this to become such an emotionally charged issue , " said vw ceo martin winterkorn , explaining to der spiegel magazine why his company was so late to get into the eco-car market .
he noted that audi had tried to bring a hybrid car to market in the 1990s , but it was a flop ; the market was n't yet ripe . but the tide has definitely turned , and some observers wonder if the current german effort is too little , too late . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : toyota prius - engine of the future ?
after all , in recent weeks the industry has spent much of its energy loudly battling the eu over its plan to regulate car emissions .
the severe co2 emissions reduction would have endangered all the best-sellers in the german fleet . in the end , the eu called for increased use of bio-fuels and cleaner fossil fuels - but revised its regulation standards to give the heavy , fast , gas-guzzling german cars more breathing room . and until now , the german auto industry had openly dismissed hybrids as a passing fad . but their evident popularity , along with increasing concerns about global warming , seem to have carmakers rethinking earlier assumptions . hybrids ' success japanese carmaker toyota , which rolled out its gas-saving prius hybrid nine years ago , has been cashing in on that move ever since .
and the outlook is good in an otherwise stagnant market . " over the next few years we plan to double our hybrid vehicle offering , anticipating annual sales of over one million hybrid vehicles by early in the next decade , " toyota europe vp tierry dombreval told reporters in geneva . meanwhile , other european and us manufacturers have made inroads in creating an eco-friendly image for thesmelves , beating germany to the punch . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : style counts , and small cars are more fuel efficient in september , citroën and peugeot introduced eco-cars of their own .
saab 's plan for a cabriolet hybrid that can run on pure ethanol as well as classic petrol wowed critics at the paris auto show in september . and us carmaker ford is promising an expansion of similar " flexifuel " technology , allowing the use of cleaner vegetable based bio-fuels across a whole model range by next year . will germany 's relative silence on the subject give consumers the impression that toyota and other companies care more about the environment than vw , mercedes , audi , porsche et al ?
critics think so .
and they warn that the german car industry may soon be kicking itself for missed a window of market opportunity . push for diesel but vw 's winterkorn , who used to lead audi , dismisses this criticism . " for years we 've been investing billions to reduce fuel consumption with direct-injection diesel and gasoline engines .
we reduced weight at audi with aluminium bodies and at vw with lightweight steel , to name a few examples , " he told der spiegel . so far , the germans have put most of their environmental energy into developing cleaner diesel fuels and engines . their hopes were to spark a diesel revolution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vw 's martin winterkorn " whoever comes out on top in terms of diesel technology is in the best position when it comes to c02 emissions , " said bernd gottschalk , head of the german automobile manufacturers association . but the push has been largely ignored in the world 's largest car market , the us , where essentially only large trucks tend to pump diesel .
and critics note that while diesel engines produce less carbon dioxide , they contribute more harmful nitrates to the environment .
hybrids , on the other hand , produce less co2 and less nitrates as well . according to gottschalk , the fact that german manufacturers have presented plans for more fuel-efficient , low-emission cars in geneva " proves that we did n't just start developing environmentally friendly cars today , and that we are n't only interested in the premium car segment . " jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans encouraged to holiday at home for environment 's sake an intense debate has begun in germany on the kind of lifestyle changes needed to cut greenhouse gas emissions , days before eu leaders hold a summit on energy and climate change .

24 and tickets for 61 performances go on sale april 4 . it will trace the links between ludwig van beethoven -lrb- 1770-1827 -rrb- , one of the world 's most popular and best-known composers , and the musical , cultural and political life of britain at the time . schiller lends a hand to festival 's title bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beethoven 's ode to joy is one of the few musical settings of schiller 's poems musical impresario and concert organizer johann peter salomon -lrb- 1745-1815 -rrb- was responsible for first bringing beethoven 's works to london in the early 1800s . one of beethoven 's friends and pupils , his former copyist and secretary ferdinand ries -lrb- 1784-1838 -rrb- , commissioned a number of works from the composer when he became director of london 's philharmonic society in 1813 . one of those commissions eventually became beethoven 's ninth symphony , nowadays known as the choral symphony -lrb- 1824 -rrb- .
it is the finale of that symphony , based on friedrich schiller 's " ode an die freude " -lrb- ode to joy -rrb- , that provides the motto for this year 's festival . beethoven also wrote a patriotic symphonic work , " wellingtons sieg oder die schlacht bei vittoria , " celebrating the duke of wellington 's victory over the french at the battle of vitoria in spain in 1821 .
the work makes use of the anthems " rule britannia " and " god save the king . " international stars bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bonn has hosted the beethovenfest for over 160 years works by british composers will feature highly on the program of this year 's festival .
as well as musical giants such as henry purcell , edward elgar and benjamin britten , there will also be works by contemporary composers thomas ades , harrison birtwistle , brian ferneyhough and jonathan harvey . the official opening gala concert will be a performance of elgar 's serenade for strings and his enigma variations , as well as beethoven 's violin concerto , by the philharmonia orchestra under british conductor , sir andrew davis . the beethovenfest dates back to 1845 when the beethoven monument on bonn 's münsterplatz was unveiled and a three-day music festival was held in honor of the composer 's 75th birthday .
this year 's festival is being headed by ilona schmiel and has a budget of 3.65 million euros -lrb- $ 4.8 million -rrb- . disclosure : deutsche welle is an official partner of the annual beethovenfest and dw-world.de will offer selected festival works as free podcasts . dw staff / afp -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de beethovenfest bonn : symphonies and premieres click here to read dw-world.de 's coverage of the 2006 beethovenfest .

" it is great to be in the last eight , it is good for our image and everything is possible , " he said .
" we can be proud of beating real . " call for aggressive start answered bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lucio , left , headed in the goal that put munich through to the next round hitzfeld planned the spanish team 's downfall by calling for an aggressive start from his team - and reaped the reward of the fastest goal in champions league history when roy makaay struck just 10 seconds into the game , punishing a lapse on the part of madrid defender roberto carlos . munich managed to keep control for the better part of the match , but madrid were able to impress with bursts of skill they are known for and putting pressure on the bayern defense at the end of both halves . brazilian defender lucio 's second-half header seemed to have secured bayern 's victory before ruud van nistelrooy gave real faint hope with a well-struck penalty with 10 minutes remaining after lucio was adjudged to have brought down robinho . " the penalty was a gift to real and put them back in the saddle , " hitzfeld said .
" the last three or four minutes were tough , but we were still trying to attack . " real sealed own fate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : real madrid were without david beckham wednesday due to a knee injury real madrid coach fabio capello , however , said the reason for his side 's elimination was ultimately the gifts they provided to the bavarians . " we gave them two presents , makaay 's goal and van bommel 's at the end of the first leg , " capello told reporters .
" the early goal -lrb- on wednesday -rrb- changed the match completely .
all our plans and preparation went out of the window . " munich 's mark van bommel scored what ended up being a crucial second away goal late in the first leg two weeks ago in madrid that bayern lost 3-2 . bayern 's quarterfinal opponent will be decided in a draw on friday . no silverware yet this season bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitzfeld said this season will be his only chance to lift another trophy at bayern hitzfeld returned to bayern at the start of february after the sacking of felix magath , who booked a string of poor results to which the defending german champions were unaccustomed . bayern also stuttered in hitzfeld 's early games , losing to nuremberg and minnows alemannia aachen before hitting their stride with a 3-2 victory at hertha berlin at the weekend . they currently are placed fourth in the bundesliga , six points behind leaders schalke 04 . but despite injecting new life into germany 's biggest club , hitzfeld called for caution from any bayern fans already dreaming of a fourth continental crown . " we still have n't achieved anything this season , " he said .
" everything is at a critical stage . " one thing is for sure - if bayern do lift europe 's top club prize in athens on may 23 , it will be hitzfeld 's last game in charge .

" a decision is not forthcoming , " said the letter sent to keller by the presidential office and undersigned by the president 's assistant secretary , gert haller , under orders from köhler himself .
" many points of view have to be considered and due to this , a decision may take some time .

" köhler was responding to a letter sent by keller , who was among those on board a lufthansa passenger plane that was hijacked by the raf in 1977 . keller wrote to the president in february demanding that he take into consideration the damaging effects the raf had had on her and other victims ' lives and refuse to pardon and release klar , who is nearing the end of a 24-year sentence for multiple murders .
his prison term ends in 2009 but his legal team is calling for clemency from the german president . victims lament mohnhaupt 's imminent release relatives of the raf 's victims have denounced campaigns to release the remaining imprisoned former members of the terrorist group , claiming that germany is not ready to draw a line under one of the darkest chapters in its postwar history . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after a court ruling , mohnhaupt will be freed this month a court ruled last month that klar 's former-raf comrade brigitte mohnhaupt should be released from prison in march after spending over 24 years behind bars for her role in the group 's kidnappings and killings .

amid increasing consumer awareness of global warming and other environmental issues , german carmakers have had to fight off growing criticism about their apparent lack of will to build environmentally friendly cars . energy-efficient cars have long been the talk of the automotive industry .
but while they have been working on improving the mileage that can be gotten out of regular petrol- and diesel-burning engines , german carmakers have yet to produce a hybrid - a car that combines an electric motor and battery with standard combustion engine in order to cut fuel consumption . in fact , germany trails the world 's automakers in terms of environmental developments , according to the german auto club -lrb- vcd -rrb- consumer group .
the country only has one entry - vw 's polo blue motion - in the list of the ten most environmentally friendly cars . japan leads the pack with its two hybrid cars , the toyota prius and the honda civic , the group said . now , just ahead of the 77th international motor show in geneva , it seems high-end german manufacturers are clamoring to get on the eco-car bandwagon anywhere they can . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a toyota hybrid x concept car presented in geneva volkswagen presented its super-efficient , ultra-low emission blue motion line , and vw and porsche have announced they are working together on a line of eco-friendly cars to come out by 2008 .
bmw and chrysler , meanwhile , announced plans to team up to develop a " mild hybrid " transmission system for rear-wheel-drive premium cars .
even full hybrids might be on the horizon . emissions battle " we had n't expected this to become such an emotionally charged issue , " said vw ceo martin winterkorn , explaining to der spiegel magazine why his company was so late to get into the eco-car market .
he noted that audi had tried to bring a hybrid car to market in the 1990s , but it was a flop ; the market was n't yet ripe . but the tide has definitely turned , and some observers wonder if the current german effort is too little , too late . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : toyota prius - engine of the future ?
after all , in recent weeks the industry has spent much of its energy loudly battling the eu over its plan to regulate car emissions .
the severe co2 emissions reduction would have endangered all the best-sellers in the german fleet . in the end , the eu called for increased use of bio-fuels and cleaner fossil fuels - but revised its regulation standards to give the heavy , fast , gas-guzzling german cars more breathing room . and until now , the german auto industry had openly dismissed hybrids as a passing fad . but their evident popularity , along with increasing concerns about global warming , seem to have carmakers rethinking earlier assumptions . hybrids ' success japanese carmaker toyota , which rolled out its gas-saving prius hybrid nine years ago , has been cashing in on that move ever since .
and the outlook is good in an otherwise stagnant market . " over the next few years we plan to double our hybrid vehicle offering , anticipating annual sales of over one million hybrid vehicles by early in the next decade , " toyota europe vp tierry dombreval told reporters in geneva . meanwhile , other european and us manufacturers have made inroads in creating an eco-friendly image for thesmelves , beating germany to the punch . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : style counts , and small cars are more fuel efficient in september , citroën and peugeot introduced eco-cars of their own .
saab 's plan for a cabriolet hybrid that can run on pure ethanol as well as classic petrol wowed critics at the paris auto show in september . and us carmaker ford is promising an expansion of similar " flexifuel " technology , allowing the use of cleaner vegetable based bio-fuels across a whole model range by next year . will germany 's relative silence on the subject give consumers the impression that toyota and other companies care more about the environment than vw , mercedes , audi , porsche et al ?
critics think so .
and they warn that the german car industry may soon be kicking itself for missed a window of market opportunity . push for diesel but vw 's winterkorn , who used to lead audi , dismisses this criticism . " for years we 've been investing billions to reduce fuel consumption with direct-injection diesel and gasoline engines .
we reduced weight at audi with aluminium bodies and at vw with lightweight steel , to name a few examples , " he told der spiegel . so far , the germans have put most of their environmental energy into developing cleaner diesel fuels and engines . their hopes were to spark a diesel revolution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vw 's martin winterkorn " whoever comes out on top in terms of diesel technology is in the best position when it comes to c02 emissions , " said bernd gottschalk , head of the german automobile manufacturers association . but the push has been largely ignored in the world 's largest car market , the us , where essentially only large trucks tend to pump diesel .
and critics note that while diesel engines produce less carbon dioxide , they contribute more harmful nitrates to the environment .
hybrids , on the other hand , produce less co2 and less nitrates as well . according to gottschalk , the fact that german manufacturers have presented plans for more fuel-efficient , low-emission cars in geneva " proves that we did n't just start developing environmentally friendly cars today , and that we are n't only interested in the premium car segment . " jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans encouraged to holiday at home for environment 's sake an intense debate has begun in germany on the kind of lifestyle changes needed to cut greenhouse gas emissions , days before eu leaders hold a summit on energy and climate change .

it 's a hard life offering unconditional comfort and support to stressed-out humans .
once in a while , stuffed animals have to think about themselves - and when they do , they go to germany . being a cuddly toy is apparently just like any other job .
the hours can be long and the repetitive stroking can get a little boring at times .
and while the wages of eternal love and affection from one 's human companion can make it all worthwhile , even the most dedicated comforter can do with a break every now and again . but where does one go when the stresses and strains of constant petting and listening to people 's problems get to be too much ?
well , it seems that germany would be the best bet for a stuffed animal looking to let its faux hair down . germany is rapidly becoming the holiday destination of choice for frazzled fake furry friends .
companies offering getaways for tired teddies and burnt-out bunnies have spread across the country like wildfire in a stuffing department .
while it is not a new trend , the cuddly toy vacation business is now booming . the niche market in germany initially took off on the back of successful teddy tour operators in munich and frankfurt , but now companies all over the country are providing accommodation and activity plans geared to the character and personality of the specific toys . travel plans tailor-made bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world travel can be a real eye-opener for teddies furry frogs can enjoy fishing and diving experiences at the lake of constance while loveable moles , presumably , could take part in potholing expeditions in the swabian alps .
teddy bears , however , have had their outdoor choices reduced in bavaria after the killing of live brethren bruno last summer . the latest cities to latch on to the holidaying needs of the cuddly classes are hamburg and berlin .
teddy tour berlin offers three categories for the discerning stuffed toy : compact , exclusive and deluxe . the more money you spend , the more your plush pal can enjoy the german capital .
the prices range from 75 euros -lrb- $ 98.40 -rrb- for a compact tour for a german toy to 140 euros -lrb- $ 183.70 -rrb- for an animal from outside western europe taking the full deluxe tour of the city 's landmarks . hamburg popular with night-owls and rabbits in hamburg , woolly wanderers can enjoy a chauffeur service around the hanseatic port before taking in a bit of rock- ' n ' -roll history at the star club , where the beatles played , and heading to the seedier side of town for a night out on the city 's notorious reeperbahn .
this offer is particularly popular with the rabbits . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the teddies on tour are in good hands " we offer a complete visitor 's program , " hamburg tour guide niklas knippschild told german press agency dpa .
" i think this is a first-class idea .
hamburg needs a tour for teddies . "
his business partner , yvonne werny , assured potential customers that their much-loved companions would be in good hands .
" we treat those animals that are entrusted to us very carefully , " she added . toys who go for the hamburg experience come home with a photo cd of all the places they have visited , a popular extra within the price of many tour packages across germany .
many provide a detailed photo album of the holiday as a leaving present before the animal has to return to a life of stroking and nuzzling . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de tired teddies take bavarian break everyone needs a vacation from time to time , so why should your loyal bedtime companion - teddy bear or otherwise - be any different ?

a ruling in their favor by the european court would pave the way for further legal action in home courts . group members said they were subjected to a lifetime of discrimination and charge the norwegian government with inaction that violated civil rights granted to them by the european convention on human rights . " i hope the court will get enough information so that it can take up our case and judge it , " one of the plaintiffs , 65-year-old gerd fleischer , told the afp news agency . children often tormented by others bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fleischer said she suffered a lifetime of discrimination like fleischer , between 10,000 and 12,000 children were born to norwegian mothers and german soldiers during germany 's occupation of norway .
among the best known of the " war children " is anni-frid lyngstad of famed swedish disco group abba . many of the children were born and raised in the lebensborn or font of life project , which created centers organized by ss leader heinrich himmler to promote a genetically pure " aryan race . " the nazis set up homes in occupied territories including france , belgium and especially norway , to look after local women expecting children from german soldiers . " what the ss wanted was people who were resilient , dutiful and disciplined .

they were commonly placed in host families or special institutions and were subjected to physical or mental harassment , abuse and even rape . harrowing experiences bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the children were well-taken care during the war , but faced severe discrimination after it " i understood that there was something terribly wrong with me when i started school at seven , " fleischer said .
" the other children would call me a ' german whore ' and i did not know what these words meant .
i had to ask my mother to explain them . " fleischer 's life was not much better at home .
her mother married a norwegian resistance fighter who used violence on the child . " when he was drunk , he would show his hatred towards me , " said fleischer , who ran away from home as a teenager . the norwegian government was so concerned with the issue of war children that it even tried to deport them to germany , sweden and australia .
after it was turned down , it decided to place the children with foster families or in institutions . some , wrongly labeled as mentally retarded , ended up in psychiatric institutions where they stayed until the age of 15 or 16 . claims rejected by norwegian courts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the strasbourg court is the group 's final chance to win compensation often , real identity papers of war children were destroyed , altered , or , in some cases , classified as " defense secrets " until 1986 , preventing many of them from ever finding their biological parents .
many are still unaware of their past . despite the tragic lives they led , their fight against the norwegian state has proven fruitless since every legal action they attempted in national courts was turned down .
the norwegian state has made some efforts to address the situation .
in 2000 , then prime minister kjell magne bondevik apologized to the war children in his new year 's speech .
in 2005 , the norwegian parliament decided that war children were eligible for financial compensation of up to 20,000 kroner each -lrb- $ 3,200 , 2,440 euros -rrb- , a decision the now-grown children met with scorn .
" it is yet another insult , " fleischer said .
" it is the smallest compensation the parliament has ever given to anyone .
they call what we have been through ' bullying ' , not at all the right word for the harassment and the ordeals the norwegian state put us through . " if the european court turns us down , " she adds , " it would be a terrible blow for many of us -lrb- who -rrb- feel such a need for recognition and reparation .

a ruling in their favor by the european court would pave the way for further legal action in home courts . group members said they were subjected to a lifetime of discrimination and charge the norwegian government with inaction that violated civil rights granted to them by the european convention on human rights . " i hope the court will get enough information so that it can take up our case and judge it , " one of the plaintiffs , 65-year-old gerd fleischer , told the afp news agency . children often tormented by others bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fleischer said she suffered a lifetime of discrimination like fleischer , between 10,000 and 12,000 children were born to norwegian mothers and german soldiers during germany 's occupation of norway .
among the best known of the " war children " is anni-frid lyngstad of famed swedish disco group abba . many of the children were born and raised in the lebensborn or font of life project , which created centers organized by ss leader heinrich himmler to promote a genetically pure " aryan race . " the nazis set up homes in occupied territories including france , belgium and especially norway , to look after local women expecting children from german soldiers . " what the ss wanted was people who were resilient , dutiful and disciplined .
the kind of people who would be suited to run things in the new occupied areas , " said matthias meissner , managing director of lebensspuren -lrb- " traces of life " -rrb- , a group representing the lebensborn children that also setup the first meeting of grown lebensborn children in november . after the war , they became the focus of hatred .
they were commonly placed in host families or special institutions and were subjected to physical or mental harassment , abuse and even rape . harrowing experiences bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the children were well-taken care during the war , but faced severe discrimination after it " i understood that there was something terribly wrong with me when i started school at seven , " fleischer said .

amid increasing consumer awareness of global warming and other environmental issues , german carmakers have had to fight off growing criticism about their apparent lack of will to build environmentally friendly cars . energy-efficient cars have long been the talk of the automotive industry .
but while they have been working on improving the mileage that can be gotten out of regular petrol- and diesel-burning engines , german carmakers have yet to produce a hybrid - a car that combines an electric motor and battery with standard combustion engine in order to cut fuel consumption . in fact , germany trails the world 's automakers in terms of environmental developments , according to the german auto club -lrb- vcd -rrb- consumer group .
the country only has one entry - vw 's polo blue motion - in the list of the ten most environmentally friendly cars . japan leads the pack with its two hybrid cars , the toyota prius and the honda civic , the group said . now , just ahead of the 77th international motor show in geneva , it seems high-end german manufacturers are clamoring to get on the eco-car bandwagon anywhere they can . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a toyota hybrid x concept car presented in geneva volkswagen presented its super-efficient , ultra-low emission blue motion line , and vw and porsche have announced they are working together on a line of eco-friendly cars to come out by 2008 .
bmw and chrysler , meanwhile , announced plans to team up to develop a " mild hybrid " transmission system for rear-wheel-drive premium cars .
even full hybrids might be on the horizon . emissions battle " we had n't expected this to become such an emotionally charged issue , " said vw ceo martin winterkorn , explaining to der spiegel magazine why his company was so late to get into the eco-car market .
he noted that audi had tried to bring a hybrid car to market in the 1990s , but it was a flop ; the market was n't yet ripe . but the tide has definitely turned , and some observers wonder if the current german effort is too little , too late . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : toyota prius - engine of the future ?
after all , in recent weeks the industry has spent much of its energy loudly battling the eu over its plan to regulate car emissions .
the severe co2 emissions reduction would have endangered all the best-sellers in the german fleet . in the end , the eu called for increased use of bio-fuels and cleaner fossil fuels - but revised its regulation standards to give the heavy , fast , gas-guzzling german cars more breathing room . and until now , the german auto industry had openly dismissed hybrids as a passing fad . but their evident popularity , along with increasing concerns about global warming , seem to have carmakers rethinking earlier assumptions . hybrids ' success japanese carmaker toyota , which rolled out its gas-saving prius hybrid nine years ago , has been cashing in on that move ever since .
and the outlook is good in an otherwise stagnant market . " over the next few years we plan to double our hybrid vehicle offering , anticipating annual sales of over one million hybrid vehicles by early in the next decade , " toyota europe vp tierry dombreval told reporters in geneva . meanwhile , other european and us manufacturers have made inroads in creating an eco-friendly image for thesmelves , beating germany to the punch . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : style counts , and small cars are more fuel efficient in september , citroën and peugeot introduced eco-cars of their own .
saab 's plan for a cabriolet hybrid that can run on pure ethanol as well as classic petrol wowed critics at the paris auto show in september . and us carmaker ford is promising an expansion of similar " flexifuel " technology , allowing the use of cleaner vegetable based bio-fuels across a whole model range by next year . will germany 's relative silence on the subject give consumers the impression that toyota and other companies care more about the environment than vw , mercedes , audi , porsche et al ?
critics think so .
and they warn that the german car industry may soon be kicking itself for missed a window of market opportunity . push for diesel but vw 's winterkorn , who used to lead audi , dismisses this criticism . " for years we 've been investing billions to reduce fuel consumption with direct-injection diesel and gasoline engines .
we reduced weight at audi with aluminium bodies and at vw with lightweight steel , to name a few examples , " he told der spiegel . so far , the germans have put most of their environmental energy into developing cleaner diesel fuels and engines . their hopes were to spark a diesel revolution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vw 's martin winterkorn " whoever comes out on top in terms of diesel technology is in the best position when it comes to c02 emissions , " said bernd gottschalk , head of the german automobile manufacturers association . but the push has been largely ignored in the world 's largest car market , the us , where essentially only large trucks tend to pump diesel .
and critics note that while diesel engines produce less carbon dioxide , they contribute more harmful nitrates to the environment .
hybrids , on the other hand , produce less co2 and less nitrates as well . according to gottschalk , the fact that german manufacturers have presented plans for more fuel-efficient , low-emission cars in geneva " proves that we did n't just start developing environmentally friendly cars today , and that we are n't only interested in the premium car segment .

it 's a hard life offering unconditional comfort and support to stressed-out humans .
once in a while , stuffed animals have to think about themselves - and when they do , they go to germany . being a cuddly toy is apparently just like any other job .
the hours can be long and the repetitive stroking can get a little boring at times .
and while the wages of eternal love and affection from one 's human companion can make it all worthwhile , even the most dedicated comforter can do with a break every now and again . but where does one go when the stresses and strains of constant petting and listening to people 's problems get to be too much ?
well , it seems that germany would be the best bet for a stuffed animal looking to let its faux hair down . germany is rapidly becoming the holiday destination of choice for frazzled fake furry friends .

" we treat those animals that are entrusted to us very carefully , " she added . toys who go for the hamburg experience come home with a photo cd of all the places they have visited , a popular extra within the price of many tour packages across germany .

dink was gunned down and killed by a nationalist youth in january . this is also not the first time the web site has been sucked into turkish politics .

it is the finale of that symphony , based on friedrich schiller 's " ode an die freude " -lrb- ode to joy -rrb- , that provides the motto for this year 's festival . beethoven also wrote a patriotic symphonic work , " wellingtons sieg oder die schlacht bei vittoria , " celebrating the duke of wellington 's victory over the french at the battle of vitoria in spain in 1821 .
the work makes use of the anthems " rule britannia " and " god save the king .

the taxpayers ' alliance has produced a " rich list " of staff from councils including kent , wandsworth and surrey .
the local government association said council salaries were " very good value for money " .
local government minister phil woolas warned that councils must ensure that their salaries were affordable .
the number of staff whose pay packets topped the £ 100,000 mark increased by 35 % last year , according to data obtained by the taxpayers alliance under the freedom of information act .
an ' insult ' the taxpayers ' alliance reported that the highest earner in 2005-6 was tom scholes , chief executive of renfrewshire council in scotland , who received £ 233,029 - although this included a £ 113,015 redundancy payment .
but the council issued a " categoric " denial that mr scholes had been the highest paid official .
" the truth is that mr scholes was paid £ 123,264 in 2005-6 - a salary set in line with national agreements and comparable to similar-sized authorities , " a spokesman said .
it was also revealed that kent chief executive peter gilroy - who earned £ 229,999 - followed by wandsworth 's chief executive and director of administration gerald jones on £ 227,424 .
the top 10 were paid more than prime minister tony blair 's salary of £ 186,429 .
the list , based on responses from 230 councils , gives details of the 578 employees who were paid more than £ 100,000 in 2005-6 .
figures disclosed for the previous year show that only 429 people fell into that category .
the total wage bill for those on the list was £ 72 million - compared to £ 53 million for those in the same earning bracket in 2004-5 .
' gold-plated salaries ' taxpayers ' alliance chairman andrew allum said : " thousands of pensioners are having to choose between heating their homes and paying their council tax bills .
" it 's a complete insult to their dignity that so much of their money goes down the drain on top salaries for council staff .
" town halls need to get a grip and cut back on gold-plated salaries , or they will find that council tax quickly becomes the new poll tax . "
in 2006-7 the average increase in council tax in england and wales was 4.5 % , and critics claim council tax levels have nearly doubled since labour came to power in 1997 .
a spokesman for the local government association , which represents more than 400 councils in england and wales , said : " the people who earn these salaries are responsible for multi-million pound budgets in highly complex organisations , and to attract the best and brightest people to deliver value for money you have to pay a suitable wage .
" when senior salaries in the private sector are compared to senior salaries in the public sector , the taxpayer gets very good value for money . "
' independently vetted ' mr woolas said : " local authorities are responsible for managing their own pay arrangements , not central government .
" we expect them to ensure - like any public body - that these arrangements are affordable and deliver good value for money . "
he added that the government had provided 10 successive years of above-inflation grant increases to local authorities .
eric pickles , the conservatives ' local government spokesman said : " soaring local government salaries , combined with the cost of local government pensions , is one of the many drivers of soaring council taxes under gordon brown . "
renfrewshire council said mr scholes ' salary of £ 123,264 was " in line with national agreements and comparable to similar-sized authorities " .
kent county council its senior staff were paid " appropriate " salaries for their role in managing a local authority with a budget of more than £ 1.5 billion .
wandsworth council said mr jones 's salary was independently vetted by industry specialists .
during his 21 years in post he had helped to ensure that its bills had been the lowest in the country , said a spokesman .

the taxpayers ' alliance has produced a " rich list " of staff from councils including kent , wandsworth and surrey .
the local government association said council salaries were " very good value for money " .
local government minister phil woolas warned that councils must ensure that their salaries were affordable .
the number of staff whose pay packets topped the £ 100,000 mark increased by 35 % last year , according to data obtained by the taxpayers alliance under the freedom of information act .
an ' insult ' the taxpayers ' alliance reported that the highest earner in 2005-6 was tom scholes , chief executive of renfrewshire council in scotland , who received £ 233,029 - although this included a £ 113,015 redundancy payment .
but the council issued a " categoric " denial that mr scholes had been the highest paid official .
" the truth is that mr scholes was paid £ 123,264 in 2005-6 - a salary set in line with national agreements and comparable to similar-sized authorities , " a spokesman said .
it was also revealed that kent chief executive peter gilroy - who earned £ 229,999 - followed by wandsworth 's chief executive and director of administration gerald jones on £ 227,424 .
the top 10 were paid more than prime minister tony blair 's salary of £ 186,429 .
the list , based on responses from 230 councils , gives details of the 578 employees who were paid more than £ 100,000 in 2005-6 .
figures disclosed for the previous year show that only 429 people fell into that category .
the total wage bill for those on the list was £ 72 million - compared to £ 53 million for those in the same earning bracket in 2004-5 .
' gold-plated salaries ' taxpayers ' alliance chairman andrew allum said : " thousands of pensioners are having to choose between heating their homes and paying their council tax bills .
" it 's a complete insult to their dignity that so much of their money goes down the drain on top salaries for council staff .
" town halls need to get a grip and cut back on gold-plated salaries , or they will find that council tax quickly becomes the new poll tax . "
in 2006-7 the average increase in council tax in england and wales was 4.5 % , and critics claim council tax levels have nearly doubled since labour came to power in 1997 .
a spokesman for the local government association , which represents more than 400 councils in england and wales , said : " the people who earn these salaries are responsible for multi-million pound budgets in highly complex organisations , and to attract the best and brightest people to deliver value for money you have to pay a suitable wage .
" when senior salaries in the private sector are compared to senior salaries in the public sector , the taxpayer gets very good value for money . "
' independently vetted ' mr woolas said : " local authorities are responsible for managing their own pay arrangements , not central government .
" we expect them to ensure - like any public body - that these arrangements are affordable and deliver good value for money . "
he added that the government had provided 10 successive years of above-inflation grant increases to local authorities .
eric pickles , the conservatives ' local government spokesman said : " soaring local government salaries , combined with the cost of local government pensions , is one of the many drivers of soaring council taxes under gordon brown . "
renfrewshire council said mr scholes ' salary of £ 123,264 was " in line with national agreements and comparable to similar-sized authorities " .
kent county council its senior staff were paid " appropriate " salaries for their role in managing a local authority with a budget of more than £ 1.5 billion .
wandsworth council said mr jones 's salary was independently vetted by industry specialists .
during his 21 years in post he had helped to ensure that its bills had been the lowest in the country , said a spokesman .

the taxpayers ' alliance has produced a " rich list " of staff from councils including kent , wandsworth and surrey .
the local government association said council salaries were " very good value for money " .
local government minister phil woolas warned that councils must ensure that their salaries were affordable .
the number of staff whose pay packets topped the £ 100,000 mark increased by 35 % last year , according to data obtained by the taxpayers alliance under the freedom of information act .
an ' insult ' the taxpayers ' alliance reported that the highest earner in 2005-6 was tom scholes , chief executive of renfrewshire council in scotland , who received £ 233,029 - although this included a £ 113,015 redundancy payment .
but the council issued a " categoric " denial that mr scholes had been the highest paid official .
" the truth is that mr scholes was paid £ 123,264 in 2005-6 - a salary set in line with national agreements and comparable to similar-sized authorities , " a spokesman said .
it was also revealed that kent chief executive peter gilroy - who earned £ 229,999 - followed by wandsworth 's chief executive and director of administration gerald jones on £ 227,424 .
the top 10 were paid more than prime minister tony blair 's salary of £ 186,429 .
the list , based on responses from 230 councils , gives details of the 578 employees who were paid more than £ 100,000 in 2005-6 .
figures disclosed for the previous year show that only 429 people fell into that category .
the total wage bill for those on the list was £ 72 million - compared to £ 53 million for those in the same earning bracket in 2004-5 .
' gold-plated salaries ' taxpayers ' alliance chairman andrew allum said : " thousands of pensioners are having to choose between heating their homes and paying their council tax bills .
" it 's a complete insult to their dignity that so much of their money goes down the drain on top salaries for council staff .
" town halls need to get a grip and cut back on gold-plated salaries , or they will find that council tax quickly becomes the new poll tax . "
in 2006-7 the average increase in council tax in england and wales was 4.5 % , and critics claim council tax levels have nearly doubled since labour came to power in 1997 .
a spokesman for the local government association , which represents more than 400 councils in england and wales , said : " the people who earn these salaries are responsible for multi-million pound budgets in highly complex organisations , and to attract the best and brightest people to deliver value for money you have to pay a suitable wage .
" when senior salaries in the private sector are compared to senior salaries in the public sector , the taxpayer gets very good value for money . "
' independently vetted ' mr woolas said : " local authorities are responsible for managing their own pay arrangements , not central government .
" we expect them to ensure - like any public body - that these arrangements are affordable and deliver good value for money . "
he added that the government had provided 10 successive years of above-inflation grant increases to local authorities .
eric pickles , the conservatives ' local government spokesman said : " soaring local government salaries , combined with the cost of local government pensions , is one of the many drivers of soaring council taxes under gordon brown . "
renfrewshire council said mr scholes ' salary of £ 123,264 was " in line with national agreements and comparable to similar-sized authorities " .
kent county council its senior staff were paid " appropriate " salaries for their role in managing a local authority with a budget of more than £ 1.5 billion .
wandsworth council said mr jones 's salary was independently vetted by industry specialists .
during his 21 years in post he had helped to ensure that its bills had been the lowest in the country , said a spokesman .

they called him names and left him feeling alone , hurt and angry , just because he was a gypsy traveller .
now tommy , 14 , is one a group of young scots gypsy travellers who have decided to speak out against the discrimination and exclusion they so often face .
working with charity save the children they have compiled a website , packed with information about their culture , which they hope will help break down the hurtful stereotypes .
called time travellers , the site was part funded by heritage lottery money and was launched at edinburgh 's dynamic earth by the princess royal , save the children 's president .
the young people have worked so hard putting this resource together to promote the history and cultural traditions of an ethnic group who have been discriminated against for centuries donna lawrie save the children donna lawrie , youth development worker for the charity , explained : " we 're hopeful that this initiative will go some way to promoting a positive self-image for young gypsy travellers .
" the young people have worked so hard putting this resource together to promote the history and cultural traditions of an ethnic group who have been discriminated against for centuries . "
their long history dates back the to the 12th century .
some believe they can trace their roots to pre-celtic populations , others to the roman slaves brought to britain as armourers .
today the scottish executive estimates there are between 1,628 and 2,077 people but this excludes the thousands who live in houses for all or part of the year .
others do not want to identity their ethnic origin because they fear discrimination .
culture and history consequently gypsy travellers themselves estimate their community to include about 15,000 people .
the site - developed as part of an ongoing youth project - explores gypsy traveller life both past and present .
one section looks at gypsy traveller homes , from the bow tents and ornate wagons of the 19th century to the modern caravans and permanent trailers in council-run sites where some travellers live today .
traditional culture is also explored , from the origins of fortune telling and traditional fairs to gypsy traveller superstitions , such as the belief that it 's unlucky to cut your hair or your nails on a sunday .
otherwise " there will be blood shed on monday , " goes the saying .
some of the boys in the group have investigated traveller boxing traditions , and have uploaded footage of recent matches .
there is an explanation of the cant language , which many travellers use mixed with english , and a look at traditional occupations through the centuries including berry and daffodil picking , hawking , pearl fishing and collecting scrap metal and tin .
some of the young people admire their work the young people have also confronted racism , still a reality of all too many of them .
tommy , who lives in a trailer in the summer and a house in winter , was inspired to " make a difference " to his own community by rachel hilton , a scottish campaigner for gypsy traveller rights who died last may .
" there 's a lot of misunderstanding about gypsy travellers , " he said .
" in iraq there might be some people who want to bomb the country , but that does n't mean they are all bad .
" that 's how it is with the gypsies too .
one does a bad thing and then it seems like all of us get blamed for it . "
it was not just in playground basketball games that tommy felt discriminated against .
" the minute you tell people you 're a gypsy their attitude completely changes , " he said .
" they start being really cheeky and do n't want to touch you or even go near you . "
as a result tommy left secondary school , attends a gypsy traveller education project three days a week and goes out hawking with his dad on the other days .
my culture is important to me and it makes me different in some ways .
but in others i 'm just like everyone else justine gypsy traveller chantelle , 20 , also faced racism at school .
" that 's why the site is important , " she explained .
" we do n't want people to judge us .
" there 's some bad travellers out there , and when people hear about things that they 've done , they blame every other traveller .
we get accused of stealing .
they just think , well , you 're a traveller so you must steal . "
she left secondary school after just six months , and though she too went to a gypsy traveller education project she does feel she was disadvantaged .
" i did miss out on a lot of things the kids at the high school do , " she admits .
" i did n't get my standard grades so i 'm hoping to go back to college and get qualifications . "
brother and sister george , 14 , and justine , 16 , who live on a council site in the highlands , are happy with their schooling arrangements - one-to-one tuition at the local secondary school to help them catch up on what they missed when they were travelling .
but they would still like people to see past the differences and accept them more readily .
lack of knowledge " my culture is important to me and it makes me different in some ways , " says justine , who wants to be a journalist when she is older .
" but in others i 'm just like everyone else . "
george , who speaks cant and has a theory that it used to be widely spoken across scotland , agrees .
" most bad opinions of travellers are based on fears or a lack of knowledge .
but if people know more than maybe they will change their opinion . "
the site is also an attempt to give other young scots the information about gypsy traveller culture that will help them make up their own minds .
there are some aspects of gypsy traveller life that all the young people find hard - the lack of decent site facilities and chilly winter caravans feature amongst complaints .
but most feel lucky to have been born into such a rich tradition which is still passed down the generations .
as tommy says : " living in a trailer is good because you get to travel about a lot , you 're not tied down .
" in fact , i think if people knew more about the gypsy traveller lifestyle they might even be a little bit jealous . "

kenny macaskill hit the headlines in 1999 when he was held by police before the england-scotland match at wembley .
he was held for the duration of the match but was not charged or cautioned .
the snp justice spokesman said action against excessive alcohol required action on a range of fronts , including legislation and a cultural change .
drinks promotions he said : " alcohol misuse is something that transcends all ages and all classes and is not restricted to the young and those in marginalised areas .
" it is something that government needs to act upon , but each and every scot needs to look at his ways .
" and i myself as somebody who has offended in the past , recognise the error of the ways and the requirement i have to address my own consumption . "
the debate was on an snp motion which called for a ban on " irresponsible " drink promotions in off-sales and deep-discounting by supermarkets .

it is easy to say that more legislative action is needed , that somehow this will be the magic bullet that solves scots ' love affair with the booze george lyon scottish executive minister new licensing laws are due to come into effect next year .
they will see action taken against shopkeepers who sell alcohol to under-18s and a 14-point partnership agreement with the drinks industry to stamp out irresponsible promotions .
deputy public service minister george lyon said : " we need to be careful we do n't go for the headline-grabbing gimmick approach which does n't deliver real results . "
he warned : " it is easy to say that more legislative action is needed , that somehow this will be the magic bullet that solves scots ' love affair with the booze .
" but that type of blinkered approach will achieve nothing when it is our focused and comprehensive approach to achieving the long-term culture change that is needed . "
excessive drinking tory health spokeswoman dr nanette milne also warned there was no quick fix to the problem .
the conservative claimed that drinking to excess had become increasingly common .
liberal democrat health spokesman euan robson complained about the number of alcopops on the market .
and green msp patrick harvie claimed youngsters said they drank because there were few cheap alternatives for them on a night out .
following the debate msps voted 89-25 in favour of a motion , amended by mr lyon .
it noted the damage excessive drinking can cause to physical and mental health , to communities and to the economy .
it also noted the success of the fife test purchasing pilot and welcomed its proposed roll-out to all police forces .

kenny macaskill hit the headlines in 1999 when he was held by police before the england-scotland match at wembley .
he was held for the duration of the match but was not charged or cautioned .
the snp justice spokesman said action against excessive alcohol required action on a range of fronts , including legislation and a cultural change .
drinks promotions he said : " alcohol misuse is something that transcends all ages and all classes and is not restricted to the young and those in marginalised areas .
" it is something that government needs to act upon , but each and every scot needs to look at his ways .
" and i myself as somebody who has offended in the past , recognise the error of the ways and the requirement i have to address my own consumption . "
the debate was on an snp motion which called for a ban on " irresponsible " drink promotions in off-sales and deep-discounting by supermarkets .
the executive is hoping its next five-year plan will see more success in stamping out binge-drinking culture and the violence and ill-health it fuels . "
it is easy to say that more legislative action is needed , that somehow this will be the magic bullet that solves scots ' love affair with the booze " george lyon scottish executive minister new licensing laws are due to come into effect next year .
they will see action taken against shopkeepers who sell alcohol to under-18s and a 14-point partnership agreement with the drinks industry to stamp out irresponsible promotions .
deputy public service minister george lyon said : " we need to be careful we do n't go for the headline-grabbing gimmick approach which does n't deliver real results . "
he warned : " it is easy to say that more legislative action is needed , that somehow this will be the magic bullet that solves scots ' love affair with the booze .
" but that type of blinkered approach will achieve nothing when it is our focused and comprehensive approach to achieving the long-term culture change that is needed . "
excessive drinking tory health spokeswoman dr nanette milne also warned there was no quick fix to the problem .
the conservative claimed that drinking to excess had become increasingly common .
liberal democrat health spokesman euan robson complained about the number of alcopops on the market .
and green msp patrick harvie claimed youngsters said they drank because there were few cheap alternatives for them on a night out .
following the debate msps voted 89-25 in favour of a motion , amended by mr lyon .
it noted the damage excessive drinking can cause to physical and mental health , to communities and to the economy .
it also noted the success of the fife test purchasing pilot and welcomed its proposed roll-out to all police forces .

boeing chief financial officer james bell said work on the plane would start in the next three months , with a first test flight due at the end of august .
the firm has been investing heavily in development of the medium-sized jet , which boasts greater fuel efficiency as one its main selling points .
boeing has so far secured 464 orders for the 787 dreamliner .
' risky business ' mr bell said work on the advanced composite materials used to build the 787 was progressing well .
he added that boeing was keen to avoid technical problems at the full production stage , highlighted by problems experienced at european rival airbus with its giant a380 superjumbo .
" launching a new aircraft is a risky business , particularly when it comes to actually producing the product on time and on budget , " mr bell said .
" as we have seen with the airbus a380 , failing to meet the plan can be very damaging for both company finances and the stock price . "
uk carrier first choice airways , the airline subsidiary of first choice holidays , said on wednesday it was buying an additional four dreamliners , bringing its total order for the plane to 12 .
boeing plans to produce 112 dreamliners in the two years after the first delivery of the plane in may 2008 .

thirty of them were subsequently released , but warned not to mark the day with protests .
those detained include many of the big names of iran 's women 's movement , who are calling for an end to discriminatory laws against women .
it is not hard to find women who have been caused great suffering by the law as it stands .
" this is my son just after he was born , " say forugh , looking through old photo albums in the tiny apartment where she lives alone .
ali reza is now seven and forugh has not been able to see him for many months .
when she separated from her husband the judge gave him custody of their child .
" from the moment he came home my husband used to start shouting until he left again , " she remembers .
" so many times it ended in a physical beating " .
she says ali reza would come to her defence : " ' do n't do anything to my mum , ' he 'd say .
but he would beat the child and throw him aside " .
painful separation the judge said forugh could see ali reza for up to 12 hours a week , but they had to meet in a police station .
it frightened the child so much she gave up .
now forugh 's ex-husband does not let them meet and even prevents them talking on the phone .
forugh is worried about the damage it has done to ali reza .
" one time he came to see me after some months and i asked him : ' do you feel bad that i separated from your father and you are far away from me ? '
he said : ' no .
i could see how much daddy was bothering you " ' .
forugh breaks down in tears .
her story illustrates how the laws in iran are weighted against women : the father automatically gets custody of a boy over two years of age or a girl over seven .
forugh lost her child and got no financial support from her ex husband .
fighting for justice there are those trying to change things .
parisa is approaching total strangers on the street and talking to them about the legal status of women .
she is collecting signatures for a petition asking for the repeal of iranian religious laws that discriminate against women .
the campaign has struck a chord with many iranian women like mahnoush who are fed up with being second class citizens . "
the judges do not consider the value and dignity of women .
it 's disgusting . "
shima mahnoush has just signed the petition and explains why : " i am protesting that in any instance i am considered only half a man ... maybe i am more effective than a man so why should my rights be half his " .
her friend shima has also signed because she says she has seen lots of women suffer , even her own mother when she divorced .
" the right to divorce is really ridiculous .
i have seen women go and say their spouse is a drug addict and the judge says stay with him , at least he can support you .
the judges do not consider the value and dignity of women .
it 's disgusting . "
surrounded by fear parisa is nervous being filmed collecting signatures .
she thinks plain clothes police are filming us from a parked car nearby even though she only arranged the meeting point at the last minute .
some of her colleagues have been arrested while campaigning .
parisa believes the authorities see them as a threat .
" officials do n't want to listen to the women 's movement because they think it 's something that 's come from the west , " she explains .
she says the interesting thing is the rich , westernised women are less supportive of the campaign to change discriminatory laws than the poor and more conservative women .
parisa thinks it is because less well off women can not afford good lawyers when they run into trouble .
1,000,000 signatures the one million signature campaign to change the law began with a peaceful protest last june in one of iran 's biggest squares .
women activists sat on the grass and sang feminist songs .
within minutes the police beat them and started firing tear gas and mace spray .
more than 70 people were arrested .
among them 20-two-year old student delaram ali who is now on trial .
" i am charged with acting against national security , disturbing public order and doing propaganda against the system , and having connections to illegal opposition groups , " explains delaram . "
officials do n't want to listen to the women 's movement " parisa she says she spent three days in solitary confinement in evin jail after the police injured her hand in the protest last june .
delaram is being defended by iran 's best known woman lawyer , shireen ebadi who won the nobel peace prize for her human rights work .
mrs ebadi says iranian law allows peaceful protests , that it is the police not the demonstrators who should be prosecuted for their violent action .
" we filed a complaint against the police .
unfortunately although 10 months has passed no representative of the police has come to reply to the complaint in spite of being asked to attend many times , " she explains .

thirty of them were subsequently released , but warned not to mark the day with protests .
those detained include many of the big names of iran 's women 's movement , who are calling for an end to discriminatory laws against women .
it is not hard to find women who have been caused great suffering by the law as it stands .
" this is my son just after he was born , " say forugh , looking through old photo albums in the tiny apartment where she lives alone .
ali reza is now seven and forugh has not been able to see him for many months .
when she separated from her husband the judge gave him custody of their child .
" from the moment he came home my husband used to start shouting until he left again , " she remembers .
" so many times it ended in a physical beating " .
she says ali reza would come to her defence : " ' do n't do anything to my mum , ' he 'd say .
but he would beat the child and throw him aside " .
painful separation the judge said forugh could see ali reza for up to 12 hours a week , but they had to meet in a police station .
it frightened the child so much she gave up .
forugh lost her son , ali reza , and gets no support from the father now forugh 's ex-husband does not let them meet and even prevents them talking on the phone .
forugh is worried about the damage it has done to ali reza .
" one time he came to see me after some months and i asked him : ' do you feel bad that i separated from your father and you are far away from me ? '
he said : ' no .
i could see how much daddy was bothering you " ' .
forugh breaks down in tears .
her story illustrates how the laws in iran are weighted against women : the father automatically gets custody of a boy over two years of age or a girl over seven .
forugh lost her child and got no financial support from her ex husband .
fighting for justice there are those trying to change things .
parisa is approaching total strangers on the street and talking to them about the legal status of women .
she is collecting signatures for a petition asking for the repeal of iranian religious laws that discriminate against women .
the campaign has struck a chord with many iranian women like mahnoush who are fed up with being second class citizens .
the judges do not consider the value and dignity of women .
it 's disgusting .
shima mahnoush has just signed the petition and explains why : " i am protesting that in any instance i am considered only half a man ... maybe i am more effective than a man so why should my rights be half his " .
her friend shima has also signed because she says she has seen lots of women suffer , even her own mother when she divorced .
" the right to divorce is really ridiculous .
i have seen women go and say their spouse is a drug addict and the judge says stay with him , at least he can support you .
the judges do not consider the value and dignity of women .
it 's disgusting . "
surrounded by fear parisa is nervous being filmed collecting signatures .
she thinks plain clothes police are filming us from a parked car nearby even though she only arranged the meeting point at the last minute .
some of her colleagues have been arrested while campaigning .
parisa believes the authorities see them as a threat .
collecting signatures continues despite fears of police harassment " officials do n't want to listen to the women 's movement because they think it 's something that 's come from the west , " she explains .
she says the interesting thing is the rich , westernised women are less supportive of the campaign to change discriminatory laws than the poor and more conservative women .
parisa thinks it is because less well off women can not afford good lawyers when they run into trouble .
1,000,000 signatures the one million signature campaign to change the law began with a peaceful protest last june in one of iran 's biggest squares .
women activists sat on the grass and sang feminist songs .
within minutes the police beat them and started firing tear gas and mace spray .
more than 70 people were arrested .
among them 20-two-year old student delaram ali who is now on trial .
" i am charged with acting against national security , disturbing public order and doing propaganda against the system , and having connections to illegal opposition groups , " explains delaram .
officials do n't want to listen to the women 's movement parisa she says she spent three days in solitary confinement in evin jail after the police injured her hand in the protest last june .
delaram is being defended by iran 's best known woman lawyer , shireen ebadi who won the nobel peace prize for her human rights work .
mrs ebadi says iranian law allows peaceful protests , that it is the police not the demonstrators who should be prosecuted for their violent action .
" we filed a complaint against the police .

the 113 majority for all members of a reformed lords being elected rather than appointed , surprised many .
the vote was " indicative " , not binding on ministers , whose favoured option had been 50 % elected and 50 % appointed .
but mr straw said : " there is a momentum behind change - we can not put the genie back in the bottle . "
lords reform voting all appointed house - rejected by 179 votes 20 % elected - rejected , no vote 40 % elected - rejected , no vote half elected / half appointed - rejected by 263 votes 60 % elected - rejected by 214 votes 80 % elected - backed by 38 votes all elected - backed by 113 votes analysis : will it happen ?
mr straw told bbc radio 4 's today he would now consult colleagues and opposition parties on " how we can take forward " the 100 % elected or 80 % elected options , which had also had a majority - of 38 - in favour .
he called the mps ' decisions a " pretty seismic shift " in favour of reform : " this is the first time there 's been a clear view on this for 98 years , so it 's progress .
" i mean business , so does the government and so , i think , do the other parties . "
he said that now there had been a decision in principle backing lords reform they would be looking at taking " practical steps towards a draft bill " .
a previous attempt to reform the lords in 2003 failed when mps failed to agree on how much of the second chamber should be elected and how much appointed .
in an attempt to build a consensus mps had a series of votes on wednesday - ranging from an all-appointed to all-elected house , and various proportions in-between .
reform plans will be debated and voted on in the house of lords next week .
the idea of a fully elected lords is widely expected to face opposition from peers .
even if it was backed by the lords the chances of reforms happening depends on what priority chancellor gordon brown gives the issue if he becomes prime minister as expected this summer .
mr brown voted for an 80 % elected and 20 % appointed upper house have your say an accident of birth should never entitle someone to pass the laws of this land neil small , east kilbride send us your comments there have been suggestions that the majority in favour of a wholly elected lords was swollen by opponents of reforms who wanted to scupper the plans by ensuring an option unacceptable to the government and / or lords was chosen .
shadow commons leader theresa may said : " the house of commons has clearly expressed a preference for a substantially or wholly elected house of lords .
" but this is only a first step and indeed it raises further questions .
given the tactical voting tonight we now need to establish what the house of commons ' settled view is . "
' momentous step ' liberal democrat leader sir menzies campbell said it marked " a famous victory for progressive opinion " .
the reform plans outlined by jack straw last month are for a new , smaller , second chamber of parliament , no longer called the lords , whose members would be elected or appointed for 15 year terms .
they would not have to be peers .
its powers would remain largely the same as at present - as a revising chamber which can " improve " or delay plans passed by the government on the day in the commons , but which can not actually block legislation .
reform proposals a ' hybrid ' of elected and appointed peers reduce size of house from 746 to 540 members end hereditary and life peerages over time elected peers to be voted in at same time as euro elections maximum time in office of 15 years for elected and appointed peers appointees a mixture of party politicians and non-party figures lords may be renamed - possibly ' the reformed chamber ' anglican bishops and archbishops to keep seats plans at-a-glance full text of white paper one of the fears of those who oppose having a substantially elected second chamber - especially if as proposed it uses a form of proportional representation - is that its members will feel that being elected gives it the authority to challenge the will of the commons .
conservative peer baroness fookes said : " the house -lrb- of lords -rrb- will not be content with limited powers .
they will push and push for more if they are wholly elected .
if we have these ping pong matches head to head why should they give way ? "
at the moment all peers are appointed , apart from the 92 hereditary peers who survived the first phase of lords reform during tony blair 's first term in office , and church of england archbishops and bishops and the law lords .
in another vote , mps decided by a majority of 280 to remove the remaining hereditaries .

the 113 majority for all members of a reformed lords being elected rather than appointed , surprised many .
the vote was " indicative " , not binding on ministers , whose favoured option had been 50 % elected and 50 % appointed .
but mr straw said : " there is a momentum behind change - we can not put the genie back in the bottle . "
lords reform voting all appointed house - rejected by 179 votes 20 % elected - rejected , no vote 40 % elected - rejected , no vote half elected / half appointed - rejected by 263 votes 60 % elected - rejected by 214 votes 80 % elected - backed by 38 votes all elected - backed by 113 votes analysis : will it happen ?
mr straw told bbc radio 4 's today he would now consult colleagues and opposition parties on " how we can take forward " the 100 % elected or 80 % elected options , which had also had a majority - of 38 - in favour .
he called the mps ' decisions a " pretty seismic shift " in favour of reform : " this is the first time there 's been a clear view on this for 98 years , so it 's progress .
" i mean business , so does the government and so , i think , do the other parties . "
he said that now there had been a decision in principle backing lords reform they would be looking at taking " practical steps towards a draft bill " .
a previous attempt to reform the lords in 2003 failed when mps failed to agree on how much of the second chamber should be elected and how much appointed .
in an attempt to build a consensus mps had a series of votes on wednesday - ranging from an all-appointed to all-elected house , and various proportions in-between .
reform plans will be debated and voted on in the house of lords next week .
the idea of a fully elected lords is widely expected to face opposition from peers .
even if it was backed by the lords the chances of reforms happening depends on what priority chancellor gordon brown gives the issue if he becomes prime minister as expected this summer .

shadow commons leader theresa may said : " the house of commons has clearly expressed a preference for a substantially or wholly elected house of lords .
" but this is only a first step and indeed it raises further questions .
given the tactical voting tonight we now need to establish what the house of commons ' settled view is . "
' momentous step ' liberal democrat leader sir menzies campbell said it marked " a famous victory for progressive opinion " .
the reform plans outlined by jack straw last month are for a new , smaller , second chamber of parliament , no longer called the lords , whose members would be elected or appointed for 15 year terms .
they would not have to be peers .
its powers would remain largely the same as at present - as a revising chamber which can " improve " or delay plans passed by the government on the day in the commons , but which can not actually block legislation .
reform proposals a ' hybrid ' of elected and appointed peers reduce size of house from 746 to 540 members end hereditary and life peerages over time elected peers to be voted in at same time as euro elections maximum time in office of 15 years for elected and appointed peers appointees a mixture of party politicians and non-party figures lords may be renamed - possibly ' the reformed chamber ' anglican bishops and archbishops to keep seats plans at-a-glance full text of white paper one of the fears of those who oppose having a substantially elected second chamber - especially if as proposed it uses a form of proportional representation - is that its members will feel that being elected gives it the authority to challenge the will of the commons .
conservative peer baroness fookes said : " the house -lrb- of lords -rrb- will not be content with limited powers .
they will push and push for more if they are wholly elected .
if we have these ping pong matches head to head why should they give way ? "
at the moment all peers are appointed , apart from the 92 hereditary peers who survived the first phase of lords reform during tony blair 's first term in office , and church of england archbishops and bishops and the law lords .

analysis by nick assinder political correspondent , bbc news website if anyone believed the clear vote by mps for a fully elected house of lords would mark the end of this historic battle , they should think again .
the very fact that the commons gave such overwhelming support for an entirely elected chamber may ensure the battle is more intense than it might have been had they accepted the 50-50 option favoured by tony blair and commons leader jack straw .
indeed it is believed many mps who were against the reforms voted for the most extreme option in an attempt to maximise opposition to the package when lords have their vote on it next week and , in effect , kill the whole thing off .
that may , however , have backfired as the size of the majority for the 100 % elected option was so large it makes it hugely difficult for opponents to claim the will of the commons was unclear .
that is particularly true as the only other option backed by mps was for an 80 % elected chamber - none of the other options suggesting a smaller elected element , or none at all , were passed .
and that itself suggests the will of the commons is clear .
mr straw has accepted there has been a " shift in the landscape " on the issue and insisted that , even without tactical voting , the result would have been the same .
final outcome " judging by the pretty substantial 38 majority for 80 % elected , i 'm clear 100 % elected would have passed in any event , " he told the bbc radio 4 today programme .
" the words mean what they say ; people knew exactly what they were doing and they voted for a fully-elected house , " he said .
in any case , mr straw now has to map out the way forward on this century-old battle .
clearly the debate is far from over and it would still be premature to confidently predict the final outcome .
for a start , the lords themselves will next week have to vote on the options already debated by mps and hardly anyone believes they will come to the same conclusion .
following that , mr straw will have to consider legislation taking into account the votes in both houses - which are only advisory , not binding .
but supporters of a fully-elected chamber will undoubtedly insist he has no option by accept the will of the commons .
manifesto pledge assuming he can map a way through that maze , there will be plenty of other issues related to the actual working of the new upper chamber - whatever it ends up being called - that could prove hugely controversial .
what precise powers the members should have , what level of salary they should be paid , how they should be elected or appointed and for how long are just some of the issues still to be decided and bound to be controversial .
finally , of course , there is the issue of government will .
to push legislation through will require a great deal of parliamentary time and serious commitment from the prime minister and cabinet .
the labour manifesto certainly promised to give mps the chance to come to a decision on the issue .
but there is no pledge to follow through .
so it is not beyond the bounds of possibility that the prime minister and commons leader jack straw simply decide after debates in both houses that there is still not a clear enough consensus and abandon the project or attempt to offer voters a say by making it an manifesto pledge at the next election .
in the wake of the overwhelming commons vote , that would prove hugely controversial .
the upshot of all this is likely to be another protracted constitutional battle , the conclusion of which remains entirely unpredictable .

analysis by nick assinder political correspondent , bbc news website if anyone believed the clear vote by mps for a fully elected house of lords would mark the end of this historic battle , they should think again .
much can still go wrong with plans to reform lords the very fact that the commons gave such overwhelming support for an entirely elected chamber may ensure the battle is more intense than it might have been had they accepted the 50-50 option favoured by tony blair and commons leader jack straw .
indeed it is believed many mps who were against the reforms voted for the most extreme option in an attempt to maximise opposition to the package when lords have their vote on it next week and , in effect , kill the whole thing off .
that may , however , have backfired as the size of the majority for the 100 % elected option was so large it makes it hugely difficult for opponents to claim the will of the commons was unclear .
that is particularly true as the only other option backed by mps was for an 80 % elected chamber - none of the other options suggesting a smaller elected element , or none at all , were passed .
and that itself suggests the will of the commons is clear .
mr straw has accepted there has been a " shift in the landscape " on the issue and insisted that , even without tactical voting , the result would have been the same .
final outcome " judging by the pretty substantial 38 majority for 80 % elected , i 'm clear 100 % elected would have passed in any event , " he told the bbc radio 4 today programme .
" the words mean what they say ; people knew exactly what they were doing and they voted for a fully-elected house , " he said .
mr straw 's option was roundly defeated in any case , mr straw now has to map out the way forward on this century-old battle .
clearly the debate is far from over and it would still be premature to confidently predict the final outcome .
for a start , the lords themselves will next week have to vote on the options already debated by mps and hardly anyone believes they will come to the same conclusion .
following that , mr straw will have to consider legislation taking into account the votes in both houses - which are only advisory , not binding .
but supporters of a fully-elected chamber will undoubtedly insist he has no option by accept the will of the commons .
manifesto pledge assuming he can map a way through that maze , there will be plenty of other issues related to the actual working of the new upper chamber - whatever it ends up being called - that could prove hugely controversial .
what precise powers the members should have , what level of salary they should be paid , how they should be elected or appointed and for how long are just some of the issues still to be decided and bound to be controversial .
finally , of course , there is the issue of government will .
to push legislation through will require a great deal of parliamentary time and serious commitment from the prime minister and cabinet .

so it is not beyond the bounds of possibility that the prime minister and commons leader jack straw simply decide after debates in both houses that there is still not a clear enough consensus and abandon the project or attempt to offer voters a say by making it an manifesto pledge at the next election .
in the wake of the overwhelming commons vote , that would prove hugely controversial .
the upshot of all this is likely to be another protracted constitutional battle , the conclusion of which remains entirely unpredictable .

lord wilson of dinton said people were worried about " decisions being taken without formal processes " .
another former cabinet secretary , lord butler , said ministers had asked civil servants to perform " impossible tasks " .
but commons leader jack straw called it a " good thing " that central government was driving changes in whitehall .
lord wilson , interviewed for the bbc radio 4 series shape up , sir humphrey , said : " one of the characteristics of new labour when it came to power was the way it asserted political control over the machinery of government .
" it staged a coup , first of all against the labour party and then against the processes of government . "
the centre has played a part in trying to drive reform and trying to challenge ministers to perform and i think that 's a good thing jack straw leader of the commons he added : " politicisation is about political control of the government machine being much more tightly gripped within relatively few hands and i think that is what has happened .

lord wilson also said that policy advisers who were not civil servants had " very great influence and weight " , and this meant decision-making had become too centralised .

he urged politicians and the civil service to re-establish a partnership with more focus on " doing what is right for the nation -lsb- and -rsb- less attention catching initiatives " .
he admitted that civil servants may have been reluctant to say no to ministers who wanted to implement changes immediately .

lord turnbull , who took over from lord wilson in 2002 , said there was potentially a downside when no 10 and no 11 downing st took over policies that could be handled by departments .
" it 's often a short-sighted view because if you are constantly taking something over you will not develop the capability and also poeple wo n't develop the sense of pride , they will actually feel belittled . "

lord wilson of dinton said people were worried about " decisions being taken without formal processes " .
another former cabinet secretary , lord butler , said ministers had asked civil servants to perform " impossible tasks " .
but commons leader jack straw called it a " good thing " that central government was driving changes in whitehall .
lord wilson , interviewed for the bbc radio 4 series shape up , sir humphrey , said : " one of the characteristics of new labour when it came to power was the way it asserted political control over the machinery of government .
" it staged a coup , first of all against the labour party and then against the processes of government . "
the centre has played a part in trying to drive reform and trying to challenge ministers to perform and i think that 's a good thing jack straw leader of the commons he added : " politicisation is about political control of the government machine being much more tightly gripped within relatively few hands and i think that is what has happened . "
lord wilson also said that policy advisers who were not civil servants had " very great influence and weight " , and this meant decision-making had become too centralised .
home office problems lord butler , cabinet secretary from 1988 to 1998 , said : " the home office has had huge problems to wrestle with and the initiatives that have been loaded on it have been more than it has been able to bear .
" so in one sense it is true that the civil servants have let the politicians down , but i think -lsb- that is -rsb- because the politicians have asked them to do impossible tasks . "
he urged politicians and the civil service to re-establish a partnership with more focus on " doing what is right for the nation -lsb- and -rsb- less attention catching initiatives " .

neighbourhoodfixit.com has been in test form for a few weeks and several hundred problems have already been reported , including broken paving slabs and graffiti .
the site was set up by mysociety , the organisation behind the number 10 downing street e-petitions website .
the site aims to make the reporting of local issues a more democratic affair .
currently there are few mechanisms for the public to see what problems have been reported to councils and how much has been done to fix them .

as well as seeing what reports have been filed locally , people will also be able to leave feedback and comments on the problems .
the website builds on schemes such as fillthathole.org.uk , which allows cyclists to report potholes , and clearthattrail.org.uk that lets them report obstructions to cycle paths .
both sites were set up by the uk 's national cyclists ' organisation , the ctc .
the neighbourhoodfixit project has been funded by the department of constitutional affairs in partnership with the young foundation 's transforming neighbourhoods programme .

the organisation hit the headlines when it created a new section of downing street 's website to allow anyone to address and deliver a e-petition directly to the prime minister .

the main focus of the scheme is a game on the kennel club website , where the child is awarded stars or bite-marks according to how well they do .

" you are given the options of -lrb- a -rrb- pulling the dog onto the floor , -lrb- b -rrb- going and getting mum , or -lrb- c -rrb- sitting on the floor , " she added .
" the correct response is to go and get mum , so you would get stars for that . "
crufts runs until sunday .
