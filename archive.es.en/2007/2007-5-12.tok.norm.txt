" it is in our interest and it is our responsibility to allow europe to act in the face of the challenges that confront us , " merkel said at an informal meeting of a handful of european union leaders in sintra , west of lisbon .
" germany alone can not bring all these issues to their successful conclusion , " merkel , whose country holds the eu 's rotating six-month presidency , told journalists .

" it 's not about a mini-treaty or a maxi-treaty , but a treaty that makes europe capable of acting to shape globalization in function of its values , " barroso said .

" germany alone can not bring all these issues to their successful conclusion , " merkel , whose country holds the eu 's rotating six-month presidency , told journalists .
" but i trust that i have the support of my colleagues here , who will continue to show commitment to our course , to setting europe on the right track and the right foundation . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de globalization -pipe- 12.05.2007 " every single person on earth is a global citizen " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel altman : we are all a part of the global marketplace a journalist with a phd in economics , daniel altman blogs about globalization and its effects on everyday people from plant closures to nuclear energy to international development . from the growing interconnectedness of global industry to the growth of the internet , globalization is the concept which has been adopted to describe our modern society .
depending on whom you read , globalization is either praised for increasing global wealth or blamed for aggravating poverty .
it is a concept that is evolving almost on a daily basis , effecting global commerce and culture .
as a globe-trotting journalist with a phd in economics , daniel altman is very much caught between these two worlds .
in his blog “ managing globalization ” published by the international herald tribune , altman attempts to track , document and report on this ever-changing phenomenon all the while trying to enlighten his readers on how globalization affects them on a daily basis .
his new book " connected : 24 hours in the global economy " has just been published .
dw-world.de : since blogs started out as diaries , can someone really write a diary about our globalized world ?
where does one start ?
daniel altman : i think every single person on earth is a global citizen . we can hardly get out of bed without participating in world markets .
every time you use a car , bus , plane or anything made of plastic , you 're using oil . every time you use a credit card , you 're dipping into the world 's lending market . the prices of the things you buy and sell are determined by competition from around the globe . so yes , you can write a diary about our globalized world ; you need only write about your own life .
i am sure the looser format of a blog makes this task a little easier – or not ?
blogs have the flexibility needed to take on a wide variety of issues . the idea is often to get a discussion going without starting off at a very in-depth level . this way , we can find out which topics are most important to our readers .
is the fact that you are " blogging " about globalization actually a product of globalization itself ?
well , our audience is very international .
we 've received comments from english speakers on every continent except antarctica .
i do n't think blogging is a product of globalization , but the success of my blog definitely is .
is there a direct connection between the greater interconnectivity of cultures / people and the rise of globalization in industry ?
i 'm not sure how direct it is .
my book certainly makes the point that connectedness can create new opportunities for collaboration and productivity , though it can also create new risks .
cultural exchange is nothing new , though .

depending on whom you read , globalization is either praised for increasing global wealth or blamed for aggravating poverty .
it is a concept that is evolving almost on a daily basis , effecting global commerce and culture .
as a globe-trotting journalist with a phd in economics , daniel altman is very much caught between these two worlds .
in his blog “ managing globalization ” published by the international herald tribune , altman attempts to track , document and report on this ever-changing phenomenon all the while trying to enlighten his readers on how globalization affects them on a daily basis .
his new book " connected : 24 hours in the global economy " has just been published .
dw-world.de : since blogs started out as diaries , can someone really write a diary about our globalized world ?
where does one start ?
daniel altman : i think every single person on earth is a global citizen . we can hardly get out of bed without participating in world markets .
every time you use a car , bus , plane or anything made of plastic , you 're using oil . every time you use a credit card , you 're dipping into the world 's lending market . the prices of the things you buy and sell are determined by competition from around the globe . so yes , you can write a diary about our globalized world ; you need only write about your own life .
i am sure the looser format of a blog makes this task a little easier – or not ?
blogs have the flexibility needed to take on a wide variety of issues . the idea is often to get a discussion going without starting off at a very in-depth level . this way , we can find out which topics are most important to our readers .
is the fact that you are " blogging " about globalization actually a product of globalization itself ?
well , our audience is very international .
we 've received comments from english speakers on every continent except antarctica .
i do n't think blogging is a product of globalization , but the success of my blog definitely is .
is there a direct connection between the greater interconnectivity of cultures / people and the rise of globalization in industry ?
i 'm not sure how direct it is .
my book certainly makes the point that connectedness can create new opportunities for collaboration and productivity , though it can also create new risks .
cultural exchange is nothing new , though .

as a globe-trotting journalist with a phd in economics , daniel altman is very much caught between these two worlds .
in his blog “ managing globalization ” published by the international herald tribune , altman attempts to track , document and report on this ever-changing phenomenon all the while trying to enlighten his readers on how globalization affects them on a daily basis .
his new book " connected : 24 hours in the global economy " has just been published .
dw-world.de : since blogs started out as diaries , can someone really write a diary about our globalized world ?
where does one start ?
daniel altman : i think every single person on earth is a global citizen . we can hardly get out of bed without participating in world markets .
every time you use a car , bus , plane or anything made of plastic , you 're using oil . every time you use a credit card , you 're dipping into the world 's lending market . the prices of the things you buy and sell are determined by competition from around the globe . so yes , you can write a diary about our globalized world ; you need only write about your own life .
i am sure the looser format of a blog makes this task a little easier – or not ?
blogs have the flexibility needed to take on a wide variety of issues . the idea is often to get a discussion going without starting off at a very in-depth level . this way , we can find out which topics are most important to our readers .
is the fact that you are " blogging " about globalization actually a product of globalization itself ?
well , our audience is very international .
we 've received comments from english speakers on every continent except antarctica .
i do n't think blogging is a product of globalization , but the success of my blog definitely is .
is there a direct connection between the greater interconnectivity of cultures / people and the rise of globalization in industry ?
i 'm not sure how direct it is .
my book certainly makes the point that connectedness can create new opportunities for collaboration and productivity , though it can also create new risks .
cultural exchange is nothing new , though .
for a much earlier example , you only have to think about the traders on the old silk road .
if yes , which leads the other ?
where are the two heading ?
i think the two processes are inevitably intertwined . but if you want to know what is driving globalization so rapidly now , i would point to innovation and technology .
can we get even more connected ? we certainly can . we - and especially americans - are fairly unaware of things happening around the world that affect us . the message of my book is that by paying more attention to our connections to people , businesses and markets in other countries , we can take more control of our own economic future . ole tangen jr. interviewed daniel altman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de from africa to germany , blogs reflect a globalized world as the number of blogs around the world continues to climb , many blogs focusing on local issues are gaining a global audience in this hyper-connected media landscape .

bremen , the smallest of germany 's 16 federal states with 490,000 eligible voters , has been governed for 12 years by an alliance of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , reflecting the make-up of chancellor angela merkel 's grand coalition in berlin .
but the two parties were at each other 's throats last week when it emerged that albrecht had been teaching german to migrant children at a bremen school for more than 10 years .
convicted murderer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : susanne albrecht , right , in a photo dated 1991 albrecht was sentenced to 12 years in prison in 1991 for her role in the july 1977 slaying of dresdner bank chief jürgen ponto in a botched kidnapping attempt by red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- terrorists .
paroled in 1996 after serving half her sentence , the now 56-year-old settled in bremen where she has been living under an assumed name and working as a language teacher .
" parents do n't want their children to be taught by raf terrorists , " said thomas röwekamp , the cdu leader who is vying with spd incumbent jens böhrnsen for the state 's top post of governing mayor .
former spd leader henning scherf dismissed röwekamp 's call for albrecht 's removal , saying she had turned her back on terrorism a long time ago and no longer posed a threat .
" such outrage is nothing but electioneering , " scherf said .
" shortly before the vote , an old issue is being dredged up again .
anyone surfing the internet can read that susanne albrecht is working as a teacher today . "
parents at the school where albrecht works recently issued a statement , saying they were outraged that albrecht 's past was being used as a campaign issue in the bremen elections .
albrecht " should continue her very successful work with the children of our school , " the statement said .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen ponto was murdered on 30 july 1977 latest opinion polls show the cdu trailing the spd by 28 percent to 40 per cent ahead of sunday 's vote for the 83-member bremen senate .
the spd , with its party color of red , has not made a pre-election commitment about which party it will govern with in future , leading to speculation it might favor an alliance with the greens , who are tipped to win 14 per cent of the vote .
" if there are enough votes for a red-green majority , they 'll go with that , " said lothar probst , a political researcher at the university of bremen .
" otherwise it 'll be a reluctant renewal of the previous coalition . "
the latter would suit merkel 's advisors , who are anxious to ensure that a result favoring the spd is not seen as a litmus test for the popularity of her 18-month-old coalition at national level .
a popularity contest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spd national chairman kurt beck spd national chairman kurt beck is hoping that a good showing by his party will shore up his own position in the light of a recent survey that put him well behind the chancellor in voter popularity .
beck , who marks one year in office the day after the bremen election , enjoys the support of only 38 percent of the electorate compared to 70 per cent for merkel , according to a poll conducted for the main ard television network last week .
at national level , the spd has seen its support drop to 27 per cent , compared to 34 per cent for merkel 's party , which has seized the initiative on a range of issues usually considered social democrat territory .

the northern state , with an unemployment rate of 13.1 percent , one of the highest in germany , is also plagued by a high rate of youth crime and child poverty .

the federal government 's predicted fiscal surplus , or excess of tax revenue over expenditure , is expected to amount to 87 billion euros by that date .
the rest of the stated figure is made up of the expected surpluses of the country 's 16 regional states and social security services .
the projected figure for 2011 represents the biggest tax revenue surplus since the federal republic of germany was founded in 1949 .
germany economy revs up it also provides the latest proof that germany is reaping the benefits of limited but unpopular labor market reforms that began to take effect under the former government of chancellor gerhard schröder .

economy minister michael glos , a member of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats , favors tax cuts but finance minister peer steinbrück , a social democrat , is opposed to such a step .
steinbrück would prefer to use the surplus to balance the german budget and reduce the national debt .
" this is a historic development , we can at last begin to reduce the mountain of debt that has accumulated and which stands at more than 1,500 billion euros , " steinbrück said .
in the meanwhile , several other ministers are calling for the surplus to be used to fund projects in their portfolios .
steinbrück gave assurances that the government planned to invest two billion euros a year in key areas such as " education and research , the family , environmental protection , infrastructure , development aid and internal security . "

economy minister michael glos , a member of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats , favors tax cuts but finance minister peer steinbrück , a social democrat , is opposed to such a step .
steinbrück would prefer to use the surplus to balance the german budget and reduce the national debt .
" this is a historic development , we can at last begin to reduce the mountain of debt that has accumulated and which stands at more than 1,500 billion euros , " steinbrück said .
in the meanwhile , several other ministers are calling for the surplus to be used to fund projects in their portfolios .
steinbrück gave assurances that the government planned to invest two billion euros a year in key areas such as " education and research , the family , environmental protection , infrastructure , development aid and internal security . "
in a breakdown given by the ministry , the total fiscal surplus is forecast at 20.3 billion in 2007 euros and at 47.9 billion euros next year . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu says german deficit sinking fast the european commission said germany 's efforts to clean up its financial house are paying off , with the country expected to pare its budget deficit down to three percent of gross domestic product in 2008 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 12.05.2007 ex-terrorist becomes an issue in german state poll großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- was responsible for numerous terrorist attacks in germany a former terrorist convicted in the murder of one of west germany 's top bankers 30 years ago has become a campaign issue ahead of elections in the german city-state of bremen on may 13 . the case of susanne albrecht has added a new element to the political mudslinging dominated by disputes over family issues , calls for a minimum wage and education policies .
bremen , the smallest of germany 's 16 federal states with 490,000 eligible voters , has been governed for 12 years by an alliance of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , reflecting the make-up of chancellor angela merkel 's grand coalition in berlin .
but the two parties were at each other 's throats last week when it emerged that albrecht had been teaching german to migrant children at a bremen school for more than 10 years .
convicted murderer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : susanne albrecht , right , in a photo dated 1991 albrecht was sentenced to 12 years in prison in 1991 for her role in the july 1977 slaying of dresdner bank chief jürgen ponto in a botched kidnapping attempt by red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- terrorists .
paroled in 1996 after serving half her sentence , the now 56-year-old settled in bremen where she has been living under an assumed name and working as a language teacher .
" parents do n't want their children to be taught by raf terrorists , " said thomas röwekamp , the cdu leader who is vying with spd incumbent jens böhrnsen for the state 's top post of governing mayor .
former spd leader henning scherf dismissed röwekamp 's call for albrecht 's removal , saying she had turned her back on terrorism a long time ago and no longer posed a threat .
" such outrage is nothing but electioneering , " scherf said .
" shortly before the vote , an old issue is being dredged up again .
anyone surfing the internet can read that susanne albrecht is working as a teacher today . "
parents at the school where albrecht works recently issued a statement , saying they were outraged that albrecht 's past was being used as a campaign issue in the bremen elections .
albrecht " should continue her very successful work with the children of our school , " the statement said .
chasing the votes ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen ponto was murdered on 30 july 1977 latest opinion polls show the cdu trailing the spd by 28 percent to 40 per cent ahead of sunday 's vote for the 83-member bremen senate .
the spd , with its party color of red , has not made a pre-election commitment about which party it will govern with in future , leading to speculation it might favor an alliance with the greens , who are tipped to win 14 per cent of the vote .
" if there are enough votes for a red-green majority , they 'll go with that , " said lothar probst , a political researcher at the university of bremen .
" otherwise it 'll be a reluctant renewal of the previous coalition . "
the latter would suit merkel 's advisors , who are anxious to ensure that a result favoring the spd is not seen as a litmus test for the popularity of her 18-month-old coalition at national level .
a popularity contest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spd national chairman kurt beck spd national chairman kurt beck is hoping that a good showing by his party will shore up his own position in the light of a recent survey that put him well behind the chancellor in voter popularity .
beck , who marks one year in office the day after the bremen election , enjoys the support of only 38 percent of the electorate compared to 70 per cent for merkel , according to a poll conducted for the main ard television network last week .
at national level , the spd has seen its support drop to 27 per cent , compared to 34 per cent for merkel 's party , which has seized the initiative on a range of issues usually considered social democrat territory .
sensitive issues in the last elections four years ago voters in bremen 's adjacent port of bremerhaven elected a member of the extreme right-wing german people 's union -lrb- dvu -rrb- to the state parliament .
surveys expect a slight increase in the dvu 's share of the vote this time around .
the northern state , with an unemployment rate of 13.1 percent , one of the highest in germany , is also plagued by a high rate of youth crime and child poverty .
the state 's justice affairs senator resigned last october after the body of a two-year-old boy in the care of her department was found stuffed in the refrigerator of his drug-addict father .
the case , which infuriated germans , led to calls for an early warning system to assist children suffering neglect or abuse . dw staff / dpa -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel intervenes in raf clemency row chancellor angela merkel intervened in the escalating row over german president horst köhler 's meeting with former raf terrorist christian klar .

bremen , the smallest of germany 's 16 federal states with 490,000 eligible voters , has been governed for 12 years by an alliance of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , reflecting the make-up of chancellor angela merkel 's grand coalition in berlin .
but the two parties were at each other 's throats last week when it emerged that albrecht had been teaching german to migrant children at a bremen school for more than 10 years .
convicted murderer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : susanne albrecht , right , in a photo dated 1991 albrecht was sentenced to 12 years in prison in 1991 for her role in the july 1977 slaying of dresdner bank chief jürgen ponto in a botched kidnapping attempt by red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- terrorists .
paroled in 1996 after serving half her sentence , the now 56-year-old settled in bremen where she has been living under an assumed name and working as a language teacher .
" parents do n't want their children to be taught by raf terrorists , " said thomas röwekamp , the cdu leader who is vying with spd incumbent jens böhrnsen for the state 's top post of governing mayor .
former spd leader henning scherf dismissed röwekamp 's call for albrecht 's removal , saying she had turned her back on terrorism a long time ago and no longer posed a threat .
" such outrage is nothing but electioneering , " scherf said .
" shortly before the vote , an old issue is being dredged up again .
anyone surfing the internet can read that susanne albrecht is working as a teacher today . "
parents at the school where albrecht works recently issued a statement , saying they were outraged that albrecht 's past was being used as a campaign issue in the bremen elections .
albrecht " should continue her very successful work with the children of our school , " the statement said .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen ponto was murdered on 30 july 1977 latest opinion polls show the cdu trailing the spd by 28 percent to 40 per cent ahead of sunday 's vote for the 83-member bremen senate .
the spd , with its party color of red , has not made a pre-election commitment about which party it will govern with in future , leading to speculation it might favor an alliance with the greens , who are tipped to win 14 per cent of the vote .
" if there are enough votes for a red-green majority , they 'll go with that , " said lothar probst , a political researcher at the university of bremen .
" otherwise it 'll be a reluctant renewal of the previous coalition . "
the latter would suit merkel 's advisors , who are anxious to ensure that a result favoring the spd is not seen as a litmus test for the popularity of her 18-month-old coalition at national level .

the federal government 's predicted fiscal surplus , or excess of tax revenue over expenditure , is expected to amount to 87 billion euros by that date .
the rest of the stated figure is made up of the expected surpluses of the country 's 16 regional states and social security services .
the projected figure for 2011 represents the biggest tax revenue surplus since the federal republic of germany was founded in 1949 .
germany economy revs up it also provides the latest proof that germany is reaping the benefits of limited but unpopular labor market reforms that began to take effect under the former government of chancellor gerhard schröder .
the projection confirms that the german economy , the biggest in the eurozone , is recovering fast and regaining its position as the driver of european union growth .
from 2002 to 2005 , germany exceeded european union rules that it helped to draw up and which obliged governments to keep their budget shortfalls below 3.0 percent of gross domestic product .
but after years of lethargic progress , germany 's economic momentum increased sharply and its deficit shrank to 1.7 percent of gdp last year .
and the government is hoping to cut the ratio further to 1.2 percent in 2007 .
differences over how best to use surplus the left-right coalition government in berlin appears divided on how best to use the tax surplus .
economy minister michael glos , a member of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats , favors tax cuts but finance minister peer steinbrück , a social democrat , is opposed to such a step .
steinbrück would prefer to use the surplus to balance the german budget and reduce the national debt .
" this is a historic development , we can at last begin to reduce the mountain of debt that has accumulated and which stands at more than 1,500 billion euros , " steinbrück said .
in the meanwhile , several other ministers are calling for the surplus to be used to fund projects in their portfolios .
steinbrück gave assurances that the government planned to invest two billion euros a year in key areas such as " education and research , the family , environmental protection , infrastructure , development aid and internal security . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de globalization -pipe- 12.05.2007 " every single person on earth is a global citizen " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel altman : we are all a part of the global marketplace a journalist with a phd in economics , daniel altman blogs about globalization and its effects on everyday people from plant closures to nuclear energy to international development . from the growing interconnectedness of global industry to the growth of the internet , globalization is the concept which has been adopted to describe our modern society .
depending on whom you read , globalization is either praised for increasing global wealth or blamed for aggravating poverty .
it is a concept that is evolving almost on a daily basis , effecting global commerce and culture .
as a globe-trotting journalist with a phd in economics , daniel altman is very much caught between these two worlds .
in his blog “ managing globalization ” published by the international herald tribune , altman attempts to track , document and report on this ever-changing phenomenon all the while trying to enlighten his readers on how globalization affects them on a daily basis .
his new book " connected : 24 hours in the global economy " has just been published .
dw-world.de : since blogs started out as diaries , can someone really write a diary about our globalized world ?
where does one start ?
daniel altman : i think every single person on earth is a global citizen . we can hardly get out of bed without participating in world markets .
every time you use a car , bus , plane or anything made of plastic , you 're using oil . every time you use a credit card , you 're dipping into the world 's lending market . the prices of the things you buy and sell are determined by competition from around the globe . so yes , you can write a diary about our globalized world ; you need only write about your own life .
i am sure the looser format of a blog makes this task a little easier – or not ?
blogs have the flexibility needed to take on a wide variety of issues . the idea is often to get a discussion going without starting off at a very in-depth level . this way , we can find out which topics are most important to our readers .
is the fact that you are " blogging " about globalization actually a product of globalization itself ?
well , our audience is very international .
we 've received comments from english speakers on every continent except antarctica .
i do n't think blogging is a product of globalization , but the success of my blog definitely is .
is there a direct connection between the greater interconnectivity of cultures / people and the rise of globalization in industry ?
i 'm not sure how direct it is .
my book certainly makes the point that connectedness can create new opportunities for collaboration and productivity , though it can also create new risks .
cultural exchange is nothing new , though .
for a much earlier example , you only have to think about the traders on the old silk road .
if yes , which leads the other ?
where are the two heading ?
i think the two processes are inevitably intertwined . but if you want to know what is driving globalization so rapidly now , i would point to innovation and technology .
can we get even more connected ? we certainly can . we - and especially americans - are fairly unaware of things happening around the world that affect us . the message of my book is that by paying more attention to our connections to people , businesses and markets in other countries , we can take more control of our own economic future . ole tangen jr. interviewed daniel altman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de from africa to germany , blogs reflect a globalized world as the number of blogs around the world continues to climb , many blogs focusing on local issues are gaining a global audience in this hyper-connected media landscape .

depending on whom you read , globalization is either praised for increasing global wealth or blamed for aggravating poverty .
it is a concept that is evolving almost on a daily basis , effecting global commerce and culture .
as a globe-trotting journalist with a phd in economics , daniel altman is very much caught between these two worlds .
in his blog “ managing globalization ” published by the international herald tribune , altman attempts to track , document and report on this ever-changing phenomenon all the while trying to enlighten his readers on how globalization affects them on a daily basis .
his new book " connected : 24 hours in the global economy " has just been published .
dw-world.de : since blogs started out as diaries , can someone really write a diary about our globalized world ?
where does one start ?
daniel altman : i think every single person on earth is a global citizen . we can hardly get out of bed without participating in world markets .
every time you use a car , bus , plane or anything made of plastic , you 're using oil . every time you use a credit card , you 're dipping into the world 's lending market . the prices of the things you buy and sell are determined by competition from around the globe . so yes , you can write a diary about our globalized world ; you need only write about your own life .
i am sure the looser format of a blog makes this task a little easier – or not ?
blogs have the flexibility needed to take on a wide variety of issues . the idea is often to get a discussion going without starting off at a very in-depth level . this way , we can find out which topics are most important to our readers .
is the fact that you are " blogging " about globalization actually a product of globalization itself ?
well , our audience is very international .
we 've received comments from english speakers on every continent except antarctica .
i do n't think blogging is a product of globalization , but the success of my blog definitely is .
is there a direct connection between the greater interconnectivity of cultures / people and the rise of globalization in industry ?
i 'm not sure how direct it is .
my book certainly makes the point that connectedness can create new opportunities for collaboration and productivity , though it can also create new risks .
cultural exchange is nothing new , though .
for a much earlier example , you only have to think about the traders on the old silk road .
if yes , which leads the other ?
where are the two heading ?
i think the two processes are inevitably intertwined . but if you want to know what is driving globalization so rapidly now , i would point to innovation and technology .
can we get even more connected ? we certainly can . we - and especially americans - are fairly unaware of things happening around the world that affect us . the message of my book is that by paying more attention to our connections to people , businesses and markets in other countries , we can take more control of our own economic future . ole tangen jr. interviewed daniel altman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de from africa to germany , blogs reflect a globalized world as the number of blogs around the world continues to climb , many blogs focusing on local issues are gaining a global audience in this hyper-connected media landscape .

bremen , the smallest of germany 's 16 federal states with 490,000 eligible voters , has been governed for 12 years by an alliance of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , reflecting the make-up of chancellor angela merkel 's grand coalition in berlin .
but the two parties were at each other 's throats last week when it emerged that albrecht had been teaching german to migrant children at a bremen school for more than 10 years .
convicted murderer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : susanne albrecht , right , in a photo dated 1991 albrecht was sentenced to 12 years in prison in 1991 for her role in the july 1977 slaying of dresdner bank chief jürgen ponto in a botched kidnapping attempt by red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- terrorists .
paroled in 1996 after serving half her sentence , the now 56-year-old settled in bremen where she has been living under an assumed name and working as a language teacher .
" parents do n't want their children to be taught by raf terrorists , " said thomas röwekamp , the cdu leader who is vying with spd incumbent jens böhrnsen for the state 's top post of governing mayor .
former spd leader henning scherf dismissed röwekamp 's call for albrecht 's removal , saying she had turned her back on terrorism a long time ago and no longer posed a threat .
" such outrage is nothing but electioneering , " scherf said .
" shortly before the vote , an old issue is being dredged up again .
anyone surfing the internet can read that susanne albrecht is working as a teacher today . "
parents at the school where albrecht works recently issued a statement , saying they were outraged that albrecht 's past was being used as a campaign issue in the bremen elections .
albrecht " should continue her very successful work with the children of our school , " the statement said .
chasing the votes ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen ponto was murdered on 30 july 1977 latest opinion polls show the cdu trailing the spd by 28 percent to 40 per cent ahead of sunday 's vote for the 83-member bremen senate .
the spd , with its party color of red , has not made a pre-election commitment about which party it will govern with in future , leading to speculation it might favor an alliance with the greens , who are tipped to win 14 per cent of the vote .
" if there are enough votes for a red-green majority , they 'll go with that , " said lothar probst , a political researcher at the university of bremen .
" otherwise it 'll be a reluctant renewal of the previous coalition . "
the latter would suit merkel 's advisors , who are anxious to ensure that a result favoring the spd is not seen as a litmus test for the popularity of her 18-month-old coalition at national level .
a popularity contest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spd national chairman kurt beck spd national chairman kurt beck is hoping that a good showing by his party will shore up his own position in the light of a recent survey that put him well behind the chancellor in voter popularity .
beck , who marks one year in office the day after the bremen election , enjoys the support of only 38 percent of the electorate compared to 70 per cent for merkel , according to a poll conducted for the main ard television network last week .
at national level , the spd has seen its support drop to 27 per cent , compared to 34 per cent for merkel 's party , which has seized the initiative on a range of issues usually considered social democrat territory .
sensitive issues in the last elections four years ago voters in bremen 's adjacent port of bremerhaven elected a member of the extreme right-wing german people 's union -lrb- dvu -rrb- to the state parliament .
surveys expect a slight increase in the dvu 's share of the vote this time around .
the northern state , with an unemployment rate of 13.1 percent , one of the highest in germany , is also plagued by a high rate of youth crime and child poverty .
the state 's justice affairs senator resigned last october after the body of a two-year-old boy in the care of her department was found stuffed in the refrigerator of his drug-addict father .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 12.05.2007 germany reports biggest tax surplus in modern history großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is reaping the benefits of labor reforms and a buoyant economy germany says it expects its biggest tax surplus for half a century as the economy once derided as the " sick man of europe " reaps the benefits from buoyant growth and moderate reforms . the finance ministry said the tax surplus would come to 179.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 241.6 billion -rrb- by 2011 , according to new figures .
the federal government 's predicted fiscal surplus , or excess of tax revenue over expenditure , is expected to amount to 87 billion euros by that date .
the rest of the stated figure is made up of the expected surpluses of the country 's 16 regional states and social security services .
the projected figure for 2011 represents the biggest tax revenue surplus since the federal republic of germany was founded in 1949 .
germany economy revs up it also provides the latest proof that germany is reaping the benefits of limited but unpopular labor market reforms that began to take effect under the former government of chancellor gerhard schröder .
the projection confirms that the german economy , the biggest in the eurozone , is recovering fast and regaining its position as the driver of european union growth .
from 2002 to 2005 , germany exceeded european union rules that it helped to draw up and which obliged governments to keep their budget shortfalls below 3.0 percent of gross domestic product .
but after years of lethargic progress , germany 's economic momentum increased sharply and its deficit shrank to 1.7 percent of gdp last year .
and the government is hoping to cut the ratio further to 1.2 percent in 2007 .
differences over how best to use surplus the left-right coalition government in berlin appears divided on how best to use the tax surplus .
economy minister michael glos , a member of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats , favors tax cuts but finance minister peer steinbrück , a social democrat , is opposed to such a step .
steinbrück would prefer to use the surplus to balance the german budget and reduce the national debt .
" this is a historic development , we can at last begin to reduce the mountain of debt that has accumulated and which stands at more than 1,500 billion euros , " steinbrück said .
in the meanwhile , several other ministers are calling for the surplus to be used to fund projects in their portfolios .

" it is in our interest and it is our responsibility to allow europe to act in the face of the challenges that confront us , " merkel said at an informal meeting of a handful of european union leaders in sintra , west of lisbon .
" germany alone can not bring all these issues to their successful conclusion , " merkel , whose country holds the eu 's rotating six-month presidency , told journalists .
" but i trust that i have the support of my colleagues here , who will continue to show commitment to our course , to setting europe on the right track and the right foundation . "
mulling the bloc 's future the meeting also included european commission president jose manuel barroso and the leaders of portugal and slovenia , which will each respectively assume the six-month presidency role after germany .
european parliament president hans gert pöttering attended as well .
the session was called to mull the 27-member bloc 's future but had no formal agenda or conclusions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are there any solutions in there ?
merkel with barroso earlier this year barroso also pushed for an agreement on the constitution , which has been in limbo since french and dutch voters said no to a draft treaty in 2005 referenda .
18 other countries have ratified the text .
advocates of the treaty say it is essential to streamline decision-making in the 27-nation bloc .
a new , slimmed-down charter is expected to cover only key reforms such as a long-term president , a foreign minister , and a simpler voting system based more on population size .
portugal in favor of referendum " naturally , what we want is that at the june meeting a consensus is reached so that it is clear what the roadmap is so that europe can adopt a institutional treaty as soon as possible , " portuguese prime minister jose socrates said .
portugal never ratified the treaty and socrates has said he wants to hold a referendum on any new constitution , which would make portugal one of only a few states considering such a move .
barroso said the leaders had discussed in " great detail the way forward for the treaty settlement and we hope that by the end of june , under the chairmanship of mrs. merkel , we will have progress on that matter . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president elect sarkozy wants a mini-treaty for the eu french president-elect nicolas sarkozy has proposed a so-called mini-treaty for the eu .
after meeting with sarkozy on friday , outgoing british prime minister tony blair said he agreed with the idea of developing a simplified constitution .
" it 's not about a mini-treaty or a maxi-treaty , but a treaty that makes europe capable of acting to shape globalization in function of its values , " barroso said .
" we need these presidencies to work together in a real team spirit , to assure the continuity of the direction of the european union , " barroso said .
merkel aware of pitfalls merkel said she was " perfectly aware " of the difficulty in reaching agreements in the past , but added that " my role , as president , is to find the right equilibrium between all those interests . "
she has made reviving the constitutional project a priority of germany 's eu presidency .
merkel hopes to broker agreement at a june 21-22 summit on a roadmap for a new treaty to be in place by 2009 . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany quizzes eu members on constitution germany , which holds the eu 's rotating presidency , has sent the 27 eu member states a questionnaire on what to do about the bloc 's stalled constitutional treaty to kick-start an intensive series of talks .

depending on whom you read , globalization is either praised for increasing global wealth or blamed for aggravating poverty .
it is a concept that is evolving almost on a daily basis , effecting global commerce and culture .
as a globe-trotting journalist with a phd in economics , daniel altman is very much caught between these two worlds .
in his blog “ managing globalization ” published by the international herald tribune , altman attempts to track , document and report on this ever-changing phenomenon all the while trying to enlighten his readers on how globalization affects them on a daily basis .
his new book " connected : 24 hours in the global economy " has just been published .
dw-world.de : since blogs started out as diaries , can someone really write a diary about our globalized world ?
where does one start ?
daniel altman : i think every single person on earth is a global citizen . we can hardly get out of bed without participating in world markets .
every time you use a car , bus , plane or anything made of plastic , you 're using oil . every time you use a credit card , you 're dipping into the world 's lending market . the prices of the things you buy and sell are determined by competition from around the globe . so yes , you can write a diary about our globalized world ; you need only write about your own life .
i am sure the looser format of a blog makes this task a little easier – or not ?
blogs have the flexibility needed to take on a wide variety of issues . the idea is often to get a discussion going without starting off at a very in-depth level . this way , we can find out which topics are most important to our readers .
is the fact that you are " blogging " about globalization actually a product of globalization itself ?
well , our audience is very international .
we 've received comments from english speakers on every continent except antarctica .
i do n't think blogging is a product of globalization , but the success of my blog definitely is .
is there a direct connection between the greater interconnectivity of cultures / people and the rise of globalization in industry ?
i 'm not sure how direct it is .
my book certainly makes the point that connectedness can create new opportunities for collaboration and productivity , though it can also create new risks .
cultural exchange is nothing new , though .
for a much earlier example , you only have to think about the traders on the old silk road .
if yes , which leads the other ?
where are the two heading ?
i think the two processes are inevitably intertwined . but if you want to know what is driving globalization so rapidly now , i would point to innovation and technology .
can we get even more connected ? we certainly can . we - and especially americans - are fairly unaware of things happening around the world that affect us . the message of my book is that by paying more attention to our connections to people , businesses and markets in other countries , we can take more control of our own economic future . ole tangen jr. interviewed daniel altman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de from africa to germany , blogs reflect a globalized world as the number of blogs around the world continues to climb , many blogs focusing on local issues are gaining a global audience in this hyper-connected media landscape .

the federal government 's predicted fiscal surplus , or excess of tax revenue over expenditure , is expected to amount to 87 billion euros by that date .
the rest of the stated figure is made up of the expected surpluses of the country 's 16 regional states and social security services .
the projected figure for 2011 represents the biggest tax revenue surplus since the federal republic of germany was founded in 1949 .
germany economy revs up it also provides the latest proof that germany is reaping the benefits of limited but unpopular labor market reforms that began to take effect under the former government of chancellor gerhard schröder .
the projection confirms that the german economy , the biggest in the eurozone , is recovering fast and regaining its position as the driver of european union growth .
from 2002 to 2005 , germany exceeded european union rules that it helped to draw up and which obliged governments to keep their budget shortfalls below 3.0 percent of gross domestic product .
but after years of lethargic progress , germany 's economic momentum increased sharply and its deficit shrank to 1.7 percent of gdp last year .
and the government is hoping to cut the ratio further to 1.2 percent in 2007 .
differences over how best to use surplus the left-right coalition government in berlin appears divided on how best to use the tax surplus .
economy minister michael glos , a member of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats , favors tax cuts but finance minister peer steinbrück , a social democrat , is opposed to such a step .
steinbrück would prefer to use the surplus to balance the german budget and reduce the national debt .
" this is a historic development , we can at last begin to reduce the mountain of debt that has accumulated and which stands at more than 1,500 billion euros , " steinbrück said .
in the meanwhile , several other ministers are calling for the surplus to be used to fund projects in their portfolios .
steinbrück gave assurances that the government planned to invest two billion euros a year in key areas such as " education and research , the family , environmental protection , infrastructure , development aid and internal security . "

the federal government 's predicted fiscal surplus , or excess of tax revenue over expenditure , is expected to amount to 87 billion euros by that date .
the rest of the stated figure is made up of the expected surpluses of the country 's 16 regional states and social security services .
the projected figure for 2011 represents the biggest tax revenue surplus since the federal republic of germany was founded in 1949 .
germany economy revs up it also provides the latest proof that germany is reaping the benefits of limited but unpopular labor market reforms that began to take effect under the former government of chancellor gerhard schröder .
the projection confirms that the german economy , the biggest in the eurozone , is recovering fast and regaining its position as the driver of european union growth .
from 2002 to 2005 , germany exceeded european union rules that it helped to draw up and which obliged governments to keep their budget shortfalls below 3.0 percent of gross domestic product .
but after years of lethargic progress , germany 's economic momentum increased sharply and its deficit shrank to 1.7 percent of gdp last year .
and the government is hoping to cut the ratio further to 1.2 percent in 2007 .
differences over how best to use surplus the left-right coalition government in berlin appears divided on how best to use the tax surplus .
economy minister michael glos , a member of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats , favors tax cuts but finance minister peer steinbrück , a social democrat , is opposed to such a step .
steinbrück would prefer to use the surplus to balance the german budget and reduce the national debt .
" this is a historic development , we can at last begin to reduce the mountain of debt that has accumulated and which stands at more than 1,500 billion euros , " steinbrück said .
in the meanwhile , several other ministers are calling for the surplus to be used to fund projects in their portfolios .
steinbrück gave assurances that the government planned to invest two billion euros a year in key areas such as " education and research , the family , environmental protection , infrastructure , development aid and internal security . "
in a breakdown given by the ministry , the total fiscal surplus is forecast at 20.3 billion in 2007 euros and at 47.9 billion euros next year . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu says german deficit sinking fast the european commission said germany 's efforts to clean up its financial house are paying off , with the country expected to pare its budget deficit down to three percent of gross domestic product in 2008 .
-lrb- 08.05.2007 -rrb- german unemployment mark sinks below four million the number of unemployed people in germany , the eurozone 's biggest economy , dipped below the politically and psychologically key mark of 4 million in april , with a positive trend among the jobless under the age of 25 .

" it is in our interest and it is our responsibility to allow europe to act in the face of the challenges that confront us , " merkel said at an informal meeting of a handful of european union leaders in sintra , west of lisbon .
" germany alone can not bring all these issues to their successful conclusion , " merkel , whose country holds the eu 's rotating six-month presidency , told journalists .
" but i trust that i have the support of my colleagues here , who will continue to show commitment to our course , to setting europe on the right track and the right foundation . "
mulling the bloc 's future the meeting also included european commission president jose manuel barroso and the leaders of portugal and slovenia , which will each respectively assume the six-month presidency role after germany .
european parliament president hans gert pöttering attended as well .
the session was called to mull the 27-member bloc 's future but had no formal agenda or conclusions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are there any solutions in there ?
merkel with barroso earlier this year barroso also pushed for an agreement on the constitution , which has been in limbo since french and dutch voters said no to a draft treaty in 2005 referenda .
18 other countries have ratified the text .
advocates of the treaty say it is essential to streamline decision-making in the 27-nation bloc .
a new , slimmed-down charter is expected to cover only key reforms such as a long-term president , a foreign minister , and a simpler voting system based more on population size .
portugal in favor of referendum " naturally , what we want is that at the june meeting a consensus is reached so that it is clear what the roadmap is so that europe can adopt a institutional treaty as soon as possible , " portuguese prime minister jose socrates said .
portugal never ratified the treaty and socrates has said he wants to hold a referendum on any new constitution , which would make portugal one of only a few states considering such a move .
barroso said the leaders had discussed in " great detail the way forward for the treaty settlement and we hope that by the end of june , under the chairmanship of mrs. merkel , we will have progress on that matter . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president elect sarkozy wants a mini-treaty for the eu french president-elect nicolas sarkozy has proposed a so-called mini-treaty for the eu .
after meeting with sarkozy on friday , outgoing british prime minister tony blair said he agreed with the idea of developing a simplified constitution .
" it 's not about a mini-treaty or a maxi-treaty , but a treaty that makes europe capable of acting to shape globalization in function of its values , " barroso said .
" we need these presidencies to work together in a real team spirit , to assure the continuity of the direction of the european union , " barroso said .
merkel aware of pitfalls merkel said she was " perfectly aware " of the difficulty in reaching agreements in the past , but added that " my role , as president , is to find the right equilibrium between all those interests . "
she has made reviving the constitutional project a priority of germany 's eu presidency .

the post is read , discussed and linked to by other bloggers and internet users throughout the turkish-speaking world . a graduate student in the us reads the blog , translates it into english and posts it onto another website . bloggers from bahrain to australia then link to the translated post adding their own links and comments along the way . through the reach of the global blogosphere , one person ’ s casual musings have become an international topic for a virtual conversation about democracy , religion and politics . " through a blog , a local issue can become a global one , " said sokari ekine , a nigerian who blogs about african women issues at blacklooks.org. one of the central ideas of globalization is that there is a growing interconnectedness between different societies as well as a greater desire to participate in a " world culture . " brought together by little more than an internet connection and a desire to converse , blogs -lrb- short for weblogs -rrb- have changed how local and global issues are discussed .
and along the way they have become a reflection of this interconnectedness and an increasingly globalized world . " today blogs can impact governments and mainstream media , " said ekine , " and the more people who start blogging will hopefully lead to greater change . " blogging by number just by sheer numbers , blogging is still a virtual phenomenon .
technorati , an online blog tracking site , just released a report stating that there are more than 71 million blogs being written all around the world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blogs started out as personal online diaries according to the report entitled " the state of the blogosphere " released this month , there are about 120,000 new weblogs created worldwide each day .
that works out to about 1.4 blogs every second with about 1.5 million postings per day . contrary to popular opinion , blogging is not an exclusively english endeavor .
of all the blogs tracked , japanese -lrb- 37 percent -rrb- just overtook english -lrb- 33 percent -rrb- as the most-blogged language .
at third place , chinese bloggers represent about three percent of the blogosphere while farsi edged into the top ten with about one percent . a tempered excitement among bloggers about the report was on display in comments on the technorati site .
commenting on the report , the center for citizen media blog summed up the feeling ; " there ’ s no question that blogs and other participatory sites have seen tremendous growth . " a global village ? a lot has changed in the more than 45 years since herbert marshall mcluhan first used the term " global village " to describe how electronic media has led to greater interconnectedness on a global scale . today " globalization " is the buzz word used to describe this phenomenon .
and while the term remains a divisive one , even the people who campaign against corporate globalization benefit from its processes .
" one of the most optimistic aspects of globalization is that anyone can go online and make a friend from anywhere around the world , " said ethan zuckerman who co-founded the site globalvoicesonline.org with rebecca mackinnon in 2004 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : who is reading your blog ?
from where ?
today the site calls itself a guide to the global blogosphere .
through a number of editors , the site posts summaries and excerpts of whatever topics are floating around the internet in regions of the world that are often ignored by the media . according to zuckerman , most bloggers write about and discuss local issues , especially in places like the middle east and africa . " when we feature a story on global voices , we are trying to open a local conversation to a global audience , " said zuckerman .
while he calls himself a " globalization junkie , " zuckerman also considers himself a realist . " there is this cyber-utopian illusion that we are all taking part of the same conversation .
we may all want to talk to each other and get a glimpse into other cultures but we are still all very different , " he said . no global language one of the greatest hurdles to a truly global conversation through blogs is language .
global voices and blacklooks both post mainly in english . markus beckedahl originally thought about writing a blog in english but decided against it because there were no german blogs at the time covering the political aspect of the information society . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what will the blogosphere look like in 10 or 20 years ?
" plus it is much easier to blog in your own language , " he said . so in 2004 he started the blog netzpolitik.org to enlighten germans on topics like open-source software and digital rights through education and activism . beckedahl believes that in 10 or 20 years translation software will allow bloggers from all over the world to communicate , no matter what language they blog in . using the german word " kulturtechnik " -lrb- loosely translates as " culture technique " -rrb- , beckedahl described blogs as a tool that can connect users , or peers to others all around the world often bridging both language and culture .

that may be but with so many permutations of results contributing to either glory or shame this year , some are rapidly doing the math . with the club 's first german title in 49 years in sight , schalke 04 fans are taking every opportunity to watch a potential new chapter of their team 's history being written .
the league leaders take on bitter local rivals borussia dortmund on saturday with two matches to go in one of the tightest championship races in years , and have decided to open up their 75,000-seater veltins arena for those supporters unable to get to dortmund for the match .
schalke lead the table by one point from vfb stuttgart and two from werder bremen , and the difficult away game against bvb could be a deciding factor in the destination of the championship shield .
the club announced earlier this week that it would be showing saturday 's game live in its home stadium to give their fans a chance to see the game .
fans would have to pay a six-euro entry fee , but would receive a four-euro food or drink voucher .
one of the reasons why the stadium will be opened is to prevent tens of thousands of fans of traveling to dortmund for a match that is already considered a security risk with 18,000 schalke fans expected to be at the game at signal iduna park .
schalke officials are thus attempting to downplay expectations ahead of the match .
" we are expecting the championship to only be decided on the final day , " gerd voss said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there will be no love lost between schalke and bvb however , with rivals bremen and stuttgart also facing tricky games at the weekend , a win at dortmund for schalke and defeats at frankfurt for werder and bochum for vfb could hand the title to the royal blues on saturday .
but if all three teams win and the league goes to the wire , schalke still have a great chance with a final game at home against bielefeld .
dortmund , who have scrambled to safety from relegation under coach thomas doll , have only a mathematical chance of getting into the uefa cup places but will be playing for regional pride on saturday in one of the league 's fiercely contested derby games .
winning against schalke and throwing a massive spanner into the works of their title challenge will be all the incentive doll 's players need .
frings , klose boost resurgent bremen one former dortmund star will also be urging his old team to win will be bremen 's torsten frings .
the diminutive midfielder will be hoping bvb trip schalke up and pave the way for a recovering werder to snatch the title on the last day .
frings , who was a bundesliga runner-up with dortmund in 2003 , hopes to add a league winners ' medal with bremen to the one he secured with bayern munich in 2005 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frings will strut his stuff for bremen until at least 2011 werder will face eintracht frankfurt at the weserstadion buoyed by a recent return to form after crashing out of the uefa cup semi-finals and the news that frings has committed himself to the club until 2011 .
the midfielder announced wednesday that he would not be leaving for juventus turin in the summer as previously expected .
his contract renewal came a week after striker miroslav klose said he will not the leave the club either and will fulfill his contract until 2008 .
frankfurt , dumped out of the semi-finals of the dfb cup by nuremberg last month , are four points above the drop-zone and a victory against bremen would guarantee their top league status for another season .
however , bremen slammed six past them in the commerzbank arena in december and with werder beginning to find their feet again , the frankfurters could be in for a torrid time .
stuttgart wary of battling bochum second-place stuttgart will be wary of resurgent bochum who flirted with relegation for most of the season only to come alive at the end to claim the scalps of schalke , bayer leverkusen and hamburg .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bochum have already proved a problem for schalke the 2-1 defeat of schalke two weeks ago and last week ’ s 3-0 mauling of hsv should provide armin veh 's championship hopefuls with plenty of food for thought .
bochum could still mount a late challenge for a european place but will have to add stuttgart to their list of conquests and hope everyone else above them lose their last two games .
fourth-placed bayern munich , out of the champions league places but safely in the uefa cup next season , travel to energie cottbus .
the eastern german side are safe from the drop and have had a mixed bag of results of late with wins against leverkusen , wolfsburg and frankfurt offset by losses to hanover and schalke .
cottbus will want more breathing space from the basement despite being secure and robbing the deposed champions of bayern in the process would definitely be an added bonus .
leverkusen , hanover tussle for uefa cup place dfb cup finalists nuremberg will be hoping to put the skids under hamburg 's revival with bayer leverkusen breathing down their necks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leverkusen could have a uefa cup place to celebrate nuremberg already have a uefa cup slot as fellow finalists stuttgart will finish in the champions league places but with hanover close behind , leverkusen will want to snatch fifth place from nuremberg to make sure of european soccer next season .
bayer have 45 points while hanover are on 44 and the fight for europe could go to the last game of the season .
leverkusen play hertha berlin saturday while hanover are away to arminia bielefeld .
coaches tackle relegation arithmetic while opponents borussia mönchengladbach are already down , mainz are still in the relegation dogfight .
with six points going begging in the next fortnight , a win over bottom club gladbach on saturday and a final day victory over bayern munich could see jürgen klopp 's team survive .
klopp will have one eye on the aachen – wolfsburg game on saturday , knowing that a draw between the two clubs above his would set up a dramatic finale .
if wolfsburg win , it could be curtains for mainz as the wolves would drag themselves to near safety on 39 points .
if aachen win , and mainz are victorious , it will all hinge on the final game with only one point separating the three teams on the last day of the season .
if that scenario transpires , the impetus could be with aachen .
with mainz away in munich and wolfsburg playing host to title chasers bremen , aachen could save themselves by the skin of their teeth by beating hamburg . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schalke hold lead as stuttgart , bremen keep pressure on nothing changed at the top of the bundesliga table as schalke maintained their one-point lead over stuttgart and two-point advantage over bremen as all three teams came away with wins with two weeks left in the season .

that may be but with so many permutations of results contributing to either glory or shame this year , some are rapidly doing the math . with the club 's first german title in 49 years in sight , schalke 04 fans are taking every opportunity to watch a potential new chapter of their team 's history being written .
the league leaders take on bitter local rivals borussia dortmund on saturday with two matches to go in one of the tightest championship races in years , and have decided to open up their 75,000-seater veltins arena for those supporters unable to get to dortmund for the match .
schalke lead the table by one point from vfb stuttgart and two from werder bremen , and the difficult away game against bvb could be a deciding factor in the destination of the championship shield .
the club announced earlier this week that it would be showing saturday 's game live in its home stadium to give their fans a chance to see the game .
fans would have to pay a six-euro entry fee , but would receive a four-euro food or drink voucher .
one of the reasons why the stadium will be opened is to prevent tens of thousands of fans of traveling to dortmund for a match that is already considered a security risk with 18,000 schalke fans expected to be at the game at signal iduna park .
schalke officials are thus attempting to downplay expectations ahead of the match .
" we are expecting the championship to only be decided on the final day , " gerd voss said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there will be no love lost between schalke and bvb however , with rivals bremen and stuttgart also facing tricky games at the weekend , a win at dortmund for schalke and defeats at frankfurt for werder and bochum for vfb could hand the title to the royal blues on saturday .
but if all three teams win and the league goes to the wire , schalke still have a great chance with a final game at home against bielefeld .
dortmund , who have scrambled to safety from relegation under coach thomas doll , have only a mathematical chance of getting into the uefa cup places but will be playing for regional pride on saturday in one of the league 's fiercely contested derby games .
winning against schalke and throwing a massive spanner into the works of their title challenge will be all the incentive doll 's players need .
frings , klose boost resurgent bremen one former dortmund star will also be urging his old team to win will be bremen 's torsten frings .
the diminutive midfielder will be hoping bvb trip schalke up and pave the way for a recovering werder to snatch the title on the last day .
frings , who was a bundesliga runner-up with dortmund in 2003 , hopes to add a league winners ' medal with bremen to the one he secured with bayern munich in 2005 .

the midfielder announced wednesday that he would not be leaving for juventus turin in the summer as previously expected .
his contract renewal came a week after striker miroslav klose said he will not the leave the club either and will fulfill his contract until 2008 .
frankfurt , dumped out of the semi-finals of the dfb cup by nuremberg last month , are four points above the drop-zone and a victory against bremen would guarantee their top league status for another season .
however , bremen slammed six past them in the commerzbank arena in december and with werder beginning to find their feet again , the frankfurters could be in for a torrid time .
stuttgart wary of battling bochum second-place stuttgart will be wary of resurgent bochum who flirted with relegation for most of the season only to come alive at the end to claim the scalps of schalke , bayer leverkusen and hamburg .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bochum have already proved a problem for schalke the 2-1 defeat of schalke two weeks ago and last week ’ s 3-0 mauling of hsv should provide armin veh 's championship hopefuls with plenty of food for thought .
bochum could still mount a late challenge for a european place but will have to add stuttgart to their list of conquests and hope everyone else above them lose their last two games .
fourth-placed bayern munich , out of the champions league places but safely in the uefa cup next season , travel to energie cottbus .
the eastern german side are safe from the drop and have had a mixed bag of results of late with wins against leverkusen , wolfsburg and frankfurt offset by losses to hanover and schalke .
cottbus will want more breathing space from the basement despite being secure and robbing the deposed champions of bayern in the process would definitely be an added bonus .
leverkusen , hanover tussle for uefa cup place dfb cup finalists nuremberg will be hoping to put the skids under hamburg 's revival with bayer leverkusen breathing down their necks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leverkusen could have a uefa cup place to celebrate nuremberg already have a uefa cup slot as fellow finalists stuttgart will finish in the champions league places but with hanover close behind , leverkusen will want to snatch fifth place from nuremberg to make sure of european soccer next season .

klopp will have one eye on the aachen – wolfsburg game on saturday , knowing that a draw between the two clubs above his would set up a dramatic finale .
if wolfsburg win , it could be curtains for mainz as the wolves would drag themselves to near safety on 39 points .
if aachen win , and mainz are victorious , it will all hinge on the final game with only one point separating the three teams on the last day of the season .

the post is read , discussed and linked to by other bloggers and internet users throughout the turkish-speaking world . a graduate student in the us reads the blog , translates it into english and posts it onto another website . bloggers from bahrain to australia then link to the translated post adding their own links and comments along the way . through the reach of the global blogosphere , one person ’ s casual musings have become an international topic for a virtual conversation about democracy , religion and politics . " through a blog , a local issue can become a global one , " said sokari ekine , a nigerian who blogs about african women issues at blacklooks.org. one of the central ideas of globalization is that there is a growing interconnectedness between different societies as well as a greater desire to participate in a " world culture . " brought together by little more than an internet connection and a desire to converse , blogs -lrb- short for weblogs -rrb- have changed how local and global issues are discussed .
and along the way they have become a reflection of this interconnectedness and an increasingly globalized world . " today blogs can impact governments and mainstream media , " said ekine , " and the more people who start blogging will hopefully lead to greater change . " blogging by number just by sheer numbers , blogging is still a virtual phenomenon .
technorati , an online blog tracking site , just released a report stating that there are more than 71 million blogs being written all around the world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blogs started out as personal online diaries according to the report entitled " the state of the blogosphere " released this month , there are about 120,000 new weblogs created worldwide each day .
that works out to about 1.4 blogs every second with about 1.5 million postings per day . contrary to popular opinion , blogging is not an exclusively english endeavor .
of all the blogs tracked , japanese -lrb- 37 percent -rrb- just overtook english -lrb- 33 percent -rrb- as the most-blogged language .
at third place , chinese bloggers represent about three percent of the blogosphere while farsi edged into the top ten with about one percent . a tempered excitement among bloggers about the report was on display in comments on the technorati site .
commenting on the report , the center for citizen media blog summed up the feeling ; " there ’ s no question that blogs and other participatory sites have seen tremendous growth . " a global village ? a lot has changed in the more than 45 years since herbert marshall mcluhan first used the term " global village " to describe how electronic media has led to greater interconnectedness on a global scale . today " globalization " is the buzz word used to describe this phenomenon .
and while the term remains a divisive one , even the people who campaign against corporate globalization benefit from its processes .
" one of the most optimistic aspects of globalization is that anyone can go online and make a friend from anywhere around the world , " said ethan zuckerman who co-founded the site globalvoicesonline.org with rebecca mackinnon in 2004 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : who is reading your blog ?
from where ?
today the site calls itself a guide to the global blogosphere .
through a number of editors , the site posts summaries and excerpts of whatever topics are floating around the internet in regions of the world that are often ignored by the media . according to zuckerman , most bloggers write about and discuss local issues , especially in places like the middle east and africa . " when we feature a story on global voices , we are trying to open a local conversation to a global audience , " said zuckerman .
while he calls himself a " globalization junkie , " zuckerman also considers himself a realist . " there is this cyber-utopian illusion that we are all taking part of the same conversation .
we may all want to talk to each other and get a glimpse into other cultures but we are still all very different , " he said . no global language one of the greatest hurdles to a truly global conversation through blogs is language .
global voices and blacklooks both post mainly in english . markus beckedahl originally thought about writing a blog in english but decided against it because there were no german blogs at the time covering the political aspect of the information society . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what will the blogosphere look like in 10 or 20 years ?
" plus it is much easier to blog in your own language , " he said . so in 2004 he started the blog netzpolitik.org to enlighten germans on topics like open-source software and digital rights through education and activism . beckedahl believes that in 10 or 20 years translation software will allow bloggers from all over the world to communicate , no matter what language they blog in . using the german word " kulturtechnik " -lrb- loosely translates as " culture technique " -rrb- , beckedahl described blogs as a tool that can connect users , or peers to others all around the world often bridging both language and culture . " every person sitting in front of a computer is a peer and together they are creating the global digital society , " he said . ole tangen jr . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " every single person on earth is a global citizen " a journalist with a phd in economics , daniel altman blogs about globalization and its effects on everyday people from plant closures to nuclear energy to international development .

the league leaders take on bitter local rivals borussia dortmund on saturday with two matches to go in one of the tightest championship races in years , and have decided to open up their 75,000-seater veltins arena for those supporters unable to get to dortmund for the match .
schalke lead the table by one point from vfb stuttgart and two from werder bremen , and the difficult away game against bvb could be a deciding factor in the destination of the championship shield .
the club announced earlier this week that it would be showing saturday 's game live in its home stadium to give their fans a chance to see the game .
fans would have to pay a six-euro entry fee , but would receive a four-euro food or drink voucher .
one of the reasons why the stadium will be opened is to prevent tens of thousands of fans of traveling to dortmund for a match that is already considered a security risk with 18,000 schalke fans expected to be at the game at signal iduna park .
schalke officials are thus attempting to downplay expectations ahead of the match .
" we are expecting the championship to only be decided on the final day , " gerd voss said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there will be no love lost between schalke and bvb however , with rivals bremen and stuttgart also facing tricky games at the weekend , a win at dortmund for schalke and defeats at frankfurt for werder and bochum for vfb could hand the title to the royal blues on saturday .
but if all three teams win and the league goes to the wire , schalke still have a great chance with a final game at home against bielefeld .
dortmund , who have scrambled to safety from relegation under coach thomas doll , have only a mathematical chance of getting into the uefa cup places but will be playing for regional pride on saturday in one of the league 's fiercely contested derby games .
winning against schalke and throwing a massive spanner into the works of their title challenge will be all the incentive doll 's players need .
frings , klose boost resurgent bremen one former dortmund star will also be urging his old team to win will be bremen 's torsten frings .
the diminutive midfielder will be hoping bvb trip schalke up and pave the way for a recovering werder to snatch the title on the last day .
frings , who was a bundesliga runner-up with dortmund in 2003 , hopes to add a league winners ' medal with bremen to the one he secured with bayern munich in 2005 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frings will strut his stuff for bremen until at least 2011 werder will face eintracht frankfurt at the weserstadion buoyed by a recent return to form after crashing out of the uefa cup semi-finals and the news that frings has committed himself to the club until 2011 .
the midfielder announced wednesday that he would not be leaving for juventus turin in the summer as previously expected .
his contract renewal came a week after striker miroslav klose said he will not the leave the club either and will fulfill his contract until 2008 .
frankfurt , dumped out of the semi-finals of the dfb cup by nuremberg last month , are four points above the drop-zone and a victory against bremen would guarantee their top league status for another season .
however , bremen slammed six past them in the commerzbank arena in december and with werder beginning to find their feet again , the frankfurters could be in for a torrid time .
stuttgart wary of battling bochum second-place stuttgart will be wary of resurgent bochum who flirted with relegation for most of the season only to come alive at the end to claim the scalps of schalke , bayer leverkusen and hamburg .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bochum have already proved a problem for schalke the 2-1 defeat of schalke two weeks ago and last week ’ s 3-0 mauling of hsv should provide armin veh 's championship hopefuls with plenty of food for thought .
bochum could still mount a late challenge for a european place but will have to add stuttgart to their list of conquests and hope everyone else above them lose their last two games .
fourth-placed bayern munich , out of the champions league places but safely in the uefa cup next season , travel to energie cottbus .
the eastern german side are safe from the drop and have had a mixed bag of results of late with wins against leverkusen , wolfsburg and frankfurt offset by losses to hanover and schalke .
cottbus will want more breathing space from the basement despite being secure and robbing the deposed champions of bayern in the process would definitely be an added bonus .
leverkusen , hanover tussle for uefa cup place dfb cup finalists nuremberg will be hoping to put the skids under hamburg 's revival with bayer leverkusen breathing down their necks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leverkusen could have a uefa cup place to celebrate nuremberg already have a uefa cup slot as fellow finalists stuttgart will finish in the champions league places but with hanover close behind , leverkusen will want to snatch fifth place from nuremberg to make sure of european soccer next season .
bayer have 45 points while hanover are on 44 and the fight for europe could go to the last game of the season .
leverkusen play hertha berlin saturday while hanover are away to arminia bielefeld .
coaches tackle relegation arithmetic while opponents borussia mönchengladbach are already down , mainz are still in the relegation dogfight .
with six points going begging in the next fortnight , a win over bottom club gladbach on saturday and a final day victory over bayern munich could see jürgen klopp 's team survive .
klopp will have one eye on the aachen – wolfsburg game on saturday , knowing that a draw between the two clubs above his would set up a dramatic finale .
if wolfsburg win , it could be curtains for mainz as the wolves would drag themselves to near safety on 39 points .
if aachen win , and mainz are victorious , it will all hinge on the final game with only one point separating the three teams on the last day of the season .
if that scenario transpires , the impetus could be with aachen .
with mainz away in munich and wolfsburg playing host to title chasers bremen , aachen could save themselves by the skin of their teeth by beating hamburg . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schalke hold lead as stuttgart , bremen keep pressure on nothing changed at the top of the bundesliga table as schalke maintained their one-point lead over stuttgart and two-point advantage over bremen as all three teams came away with wins with two weeks left in the season .

" through a blog , a local issue can become a global one , " said sokari ekine , a nigerian who blogs about african women issues at blacklooks.org. one of the central ideas of globalization is that there is a growing interconnectedness between different societies as well as a greater desire to participate in a " world culture .

technorati , an online blog tracking site , just released a report stating that there are more than 71 million blogs being written all around the world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blogs started out as personal online diaries according to the report entitled " the state of the blogosphere " released this month , there are about 120,000 new weblogs created worldwide each day .
that works out to about 1.4 blogs every second with about 1.5 million postings per day . contrary to popular opinion , blogging is not an exclusively english endeavor .
of all the blogs tracked , japanese -lrb- 37 percent -rrb- just overtook english -lrb- 33 percent -rrb- as the most-blogged language .
at third place , chinese bloggers represent about three percent of the blogosphere while farsi edged into the top ten with about one percent . a tempered excitement among bloggers about the report was on display in comments on the technorati site .

while he calls himself a " globalization junkie , " zuckerman also considers himself a realist . " there is this cyber-utopian illusion that we are all taking part of the same conversation .
we may all want to talk to each other and get a glimpse into other cultures but we are still all very different , " he said . no global language one of the greatest hurdles to a truly global conversation through blogs is language .

depending on whom you read , globalization is either praised for increasing global wealth or blamed for aggravating poverty .
it is a concept that is evolving almost on a daily basis , effecting global commerce and culture .
as a globe-trotting journalist with a phd in economics , daniel altman is very much caught between these two worlds .
in his blog “ managing globalization ” published by the international herald tribune , altman attempts to track , document and report on this ever-changing phenomenon all the while trying to enlighten his readers on how globalization affects them on a daily basis .
his new book " connected : 24 hours in the global economy " has just been published .
dw-world.de : since blogs started out as diaries , can someone really write a diary about our globalized world ?
where does one start ?
daniel altman : i think every single person on earth is a global citizen . we can hardly get out of bed without participating in world markets .
every time you use a car , bus , plane or anything made of plastic , you 're using oil . every time you use a credit card , you 're dipping into the world 's lending market . the prices of the things you buy and sell are determined by competition from around the globe . so yes , you can write a diary about our globalized world ; you need only write about your own life .
i am sure the looser format of a blog makes this task a little easier – or not ?
blogs have the flexibility needed to take on a wide variety of issues . the idea is often to get a discussion going without starting off at a very in-depth level . this way , we can find out which topics are most important to our readers .
is the fact that you are " blogging " about globalization actually a product of globalization itself ?
well , our audience is very international .
we 've received comments from english speakers on every continent except antarctica .
i do n't think blogging is a product of globalization , but the success of my blog definitely is .
is there a direct connection between the greater interconnectivity of cultures / people and the rise of globalization in industry ?
i 'm not sure how direct it is .
my book certainly makes the point that connectedness can create new opportunities for collaboration and productivity , though it can also create new risks .
cultural exchange is nothing new , though .
for a much earlier example , you only have to think about the traders on the old silk road .
if yes , which leads the other ?
where are the two heading ?
i think the two processes are inevitably intertwined . but if you want to know what is driving globalization so rapidly now , i would point to innovation and technology .
can we get even more connected ? we certainly can . we - and especially americans - are fairly unaware of things happening around the world that affect us . the message of my book is that by paying more attention to our connections to people , businesses and markets in other countries , we can take more control of our own economic future . ole tangen jr. interviewed daniel altman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de from africa to germany , blogs reflect a globalized world as the number of blogs around the world continues to climb , many blogs focusing on local issues are gaining a global audience in this hyper-connected media landscape .

" it is in our interest and it is our responsibility to allow europe to act in the face of the challenges that confront us , " merkel said at an informal meeting of a handful of european union leaders in sintra , west of lisbon .
" germany alone can not bring all these issues to their successful conclusion , " merkel , whose country holds the eu 's rotating six-month presidency , told journalists .

portugal in favor of referendum " naturally , what we want is that at the june meeting a consensus is reached so that it is clear what the roadmap is so that europe can adopt a institutional treaty as soon as possible , " portuguese prime minister jose socrates said .

" it 's not about a mini-treaty or a maxi-treaty , but a treaty that makes europe capable of acting to shape globalization in function of its values , " barroso said .
" we need these presidencies to work together in a real team spirit , to assure the continuity of the direction of the european union , " barroso said .
merkel aware of pitfalls merkel said she was " perfectly aware " of the difficulty in reaching agreements in the past , but added that " my role , as president , is to find the right equilibrium between all those interests . "

the federal government 's predicted fiscal surplus , or excess of tax revenue over expenditure , is expected to amount to 87 billion euros by that date .

economy minister michael glos , a member of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats , favors tax cuts but finance minister peer steinbrück , a social democrat , is opposed to such a step .
steinbrück would prefer to use the surplus to balance the german budget and reduce the national debt .
" this is a historic development , we can at last begin to reduce the mountain of debt that has accumulated and which stands at more than 1,500 billion euros , " steinbrück said .
in the meanwhile , several other ministers are calling for the surplus to be used to fund projects in their portfolios .
steinbrück gave assurances that the government planned to invest two billion euros a year in key areas such as " education and research , the family , environmental protection , infrastructure , development aid and internal security . "

bremen , the smallest of germany 's 16 federal states with 490,000 eligible voters , has been governed for 12 years by an alliance of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , reflecting the make-up of chancellor angela merkel 's grand coalition in berlin .
but the two parties were at each other 's throats last week when it emerged that albrecht had been teaching german to migrant children at a bremen school for more than 10 years .
convicted murderer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : susanne albrecht , right , in a photo dated 1991 albrecht was sentenced to 12 years in prison in 1991 for her role in the july 1977 slaying of dresdner bank chief jürgen ponto in a botched kidnapping attempt by red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- terrorists .
paroled in 1996 after serving half her sentence , the now 56-year-old settled in bremen where she has been living under an assumed name and working as a language teacher .
" parents do n't want their children to be taught by raf terrorists , " said thomas röwekamp , the cdu leader who is vying with spd incumbent jens böhrnsen for the state 's top post of governing mayor .
former spd leader henning scherf dismissed röwekamp 's call for albrecht 's removal , saying she had turned her back on terrorism a long time ago and no longer posed a threat .
" such outrage is nothing but electioneering , " scherf said .
" shortly before the vote , an old issue is being dredged up again .
anyone surfing the internet can read that susanne albrecht is working as a teacher today . "
parents at the school where albrecht works recently issued a statement , saying they were outraged that albrecht 's past was being used as a campaign issue in the bremen elections .
albrecht " should continue her very successful work with the children of our school , " the statement said .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen ponto was murdered on 30 july 1977 latest opinion polls show the cdu trailing the spd by 28 percent to 40 per cent ahead of sunday 's vote for the 83-member bremen senate .
the spd , with its party color of red , has not made a pre-election commitment about which party it will govern with in future , leading to speculation it might favor an alliance with the greens , who are tipped to win 14 per cent of the vote .
" if there are enough votes for a red-green majority , they 'll go with that , " said lothar probst , a political researcher at the university of bremen .
" otherwise it 'll be a reluctant renewal of the previous coalition . "
the latter would suit merkel 's advisors , who are anxious to ensure that a result favoring the spd is not seen as a litmus test for the popularity of her 18-month-old coalition at national level .

beck , who marks one year in office the day after the bremen election , enjoys the support of only 38 percent of the electorate compared to 70 per cent for merkel , according to a poll conducted for the main ard television network last week .
at national level , the spd has seen its support drop to 27 per cent , compared to 34 per cent for merkel 's party , which has seized the initiative on a range of issues usually considered social democrat territory .

the northern state , with an unemployment rate of 13.1 percent , one of the highest in germany , is also plagued by a high rate of youth crime and child poverty .
the state 's justice affairs senator resigned last october after the body of a two-year-old boy in the care of her department was found stuffed in the refrigerator of his drug-addict father .

depending on whom you read , globalization is either praised for increasing global wealth or blamed for aggravating poverty .
it is a concept that is evolving almost on a daily basis , effecting global commerce and culture .
as a globe-trotting journalist with a phd in economics , daniel altman is very much caught between these two worlds .
in his blog “ managing globalization ” published by the international herald tribune , altman attempts to track , document and report on this ever-changing phenomenon all the while trying to enlighten his readers on how globalization affects them on a daily basis .
his new book " connected : 24 hours in the global economy " has just been published .
dw-world.de : since blogs started out as diaries , can someone really write a diary about our globalized world ?
where does one start ?
daniel altman : i think every single person on earth is a global citizen . we can hardly get out of bed without participating in world markets .
every time you use a car , bus , plane or anything made of plastic , you 're using oil . every time you use a credit card , you 're dipping into the world 's lending market . the prices of the things you buy and sell are determined by competition from around the globe . so yes , you can write a diary about our globalized world ; you need only write about your own life .
i am sure the looser format of a blog makes this task a little easier – or not ?
blogs have the flexibility needed to take on a wide variety of issues . the idea is often to get a discussion going without starting off at a very in-depth level . this way , we can find out which topics are most important to our readers .
is the fact that you are " blogging " about globalization actually a product of globalization itself ?
well , our audience is very international .
we 've received comments from english speakers on every continent except antarctica .
i do n't think blogging is a product of globalization , but the success of my blog definitely is .
is there a direct connection between the greater interconnectivity of cultures / people and the rise of globalization in industry ?
i 'm not sure how direct it is .
my book certainly makes the point that connectedness can create new opportunities for collaboration and productivity , though it can also create new risks .
cultural exchange is nothing new , though .
for a much earlier example , you only have to think about the traders on the old silk road .
if yes , which leads the other ?
where are the two heading ?
i think the two processes are inevitably intertwined . but if you want to know what is driving globalization so rapidly now , i would point to innovation and technology .
can we get even more connected ? we certainly can . we - and especially americans - are fairly unaware of things happening around the world that affect us . the message of my book is that by paying more attention to our connections to people , businesses and markets in other countries , we can take more control of our own economic future . ole tangen jr. interviewed daniel altman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de from africa to germany , blogs reflect a globalized world as the number of blogs around the world continues to climb , many blogs focusing on local issues are gaining a global audience in this hyper-connected media landscape .

i am sure the looser format of a blog makes this task a little easier – or not ?
blogs have the flexibility needed to take on a wide variety of issues . the idea is often to get a discussion going without starting off at a very in-depth level . this way , we can find out which topics are most important to our readers .
is the fact that you are " blogging " about globalization actually a product of globalization itself ?
well , our audience is very international .
we 've received comments from english speakers on every continent except antarctica .
i do n't think blogging is a product of globalization , but the success of my blog definitely is .
is there a direct connection between the greater interconnectivity of cultures / people and the rise of globalization in industry ?
i 'm not sure how direct it is .
my book certainly makes the point that connectedness can create new opportunities for collaboration and productivity , though it can also create new risks .
cultural exchange is nothing new , though .
for a much earlier example , you only have to think about the traders on the old silk road .
if yes , which leads the other ?
where are the two heading ?
i think the two processes are inevitably intertwined . but if you want to know what is driving globalization so rapidly now , i would point to innovation and technology .
can we get even more connected ? we certainly can . we - and especially americans - are fairly unaware of things happening around the world that affect us . the message of my book is that by paying more attention to our connections to people , businesses and markets in other countries , we can take more control of our own economic future . ole tangen jr. interviewed daniel altman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de from africa to germany , blogs reflect a globalized world as the number of blogs around the world continues to climb , many blogs focusing on local issues are gaining a global audience in this hyper-connected media landscape .

bremen , the smallest of germany 's 16 federal states with 490,000 eligible voters , has been governed for 12 years by an alliance of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , reflecting the make-up of chancellor angela merkel 's grand coalition in berlin .
but the two parties were at each other 's throats last week when it emerged that albrecht had been teaching german to migrant children at a bremen school for more than 10 years .
convicted murderer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : susanne albrecht , right , in a photo dated 1991 albrecht was sentenced to 12 years in prison in 1991 for her role in the july 1977 slaying of dresdner bank chief jürgen ponto in a botched kidnapping attempt by red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- terrorists .
paroled in 1996 after serving half her sentence , the now 56-year-old settled in bremen where she has been living under an assumed name and working as a language teacher .
" parents do n't want their children to be taught by raf terrorists , " said thomas röwekamp , the cdu leader who is vying with spd incumbent jens böhrnsen for the state 's top post of governing mayor .
former spd leader henning scherf dismissed röwekamp 's call for albrecht 's removal , saying she had turned her back on terrorism a long time ago and no longer posed a threat .
" such outrage is nothing but electioneering , " scherf said .
" shortly before the vote , an old issue is being dredged up again .
anyone surfing the internet can read that susanne albrecht is working as a teacher today . "
parents at the school where albrecht works recently issued a statement , saying they were outraged that albrecht 's past was being used as a campaign issue in the bremen elections .
albrecht " should continue her very successful work with the children of our school , " the statement said .
chasing the votes ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen ponto was murdered on 30 july 1977 latest opinion polls show the cdu trailing the spd by 28 percent to 40 per cent ahead of sunday 's vote for the 83-member bremen senate .
the spd , with its party color of red , has not made a pre-election commitment about which party it will govern with in future , leading to speculation it might favor an alliance with the greens , who are tipped to win 14 per cent of the vote .
" if there are enough votes for a red-green majority , they 'll go with that , " said lothar probst , a political researcher at the university of bremen .
" otherwise it 'll be a reluctant renewal of the previous coalition . "
the latter would suit merkel 's advisors , who are anxious to ensure that a result favoring the spd is not seen as a litmus test for the popularity of her 18-month-old coalition at national level .
a popularity contest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spd national chairman kurt beck spd national chairman kurt beck is hoping that a good showing by his party will shore up his own position in the light of a recent survey that put him well behind the chancellor in voter popularity .
beck , who marks one year in office the day after the bremen election , enjoys the support of only 38 percent of the electorate compared to 70 per cent for merkel , according to a poll conducted for the main ard television network last week .
at national level , the spd has seen its support drop to 27 per cent , compared to 34 per cent for merkel 's party , which has seized the initiative on a range of issues usually considered social democrat territory .
sensitive issues in the last elections four years ago voters in bremen 's adjacent port of bremerhaven elected a member of the extreme right-wing german people 's union -lrb- dvu -rrb- to the state parliament .
surveys expect a slight increase in the dvu 's share of the vote this time around .
the northern state , with an unemployment rate of 13.1 percent , one of the highest in germany , is also plagued by a high rate of youth crime and child poverty .
the state 's justice affairs senator resigned last october after the body of a two-year-old boy in the care of her department was found stuffed in the refrigerator of his drug-addict father .
the case , which infuriated germans , led to calls for an early warning system to assist children suffering neglect or abuse . dw staff / dpa -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel intervenes in raf clemency row chancellor angela merkel intervened in the escalating row over german president horst köhler 's meeting with former raf terrorist christian klar .

that may be but with so many permutations of results contributing to either glory or shame this year , some are rapidly doing the math . with the club 's first german title in 49 years in sight , schalke 04 fans are taking every opportunity to watch a potential new chapter of their team 's history being written .
the league leaders take on bitter local rivals borussia dortmund on saturday with two matches to go in one of the tightest championship races in years , and have decided to open up their 75,000-seater veltins arena for those supporters unable to get to dortmund for the match .
schalke lead the table by one point from vfb stuttgart and two from werder bremen , and the difficult away game against bvb could be a deciding factor in the destination of the championship shield .
the club announced earlier this week that it would be showing saturday 's game live in its home stadium to give their fans a chance to see the game .
fans would have to pay a six-euro entry fee , but would receive a four-euro food or drink voucher .
one of the reasons why the stadium will be opened is to prevent tens of thousands of fans of traveling to dortmund for a match that is already considered a security risk with 18,000 schalke fans expected to be at the game at signal iduna park .
schalke officials are thus attempting to downplay expectations ahead of the match .
" we are expecting the championship to only be decided on the final day , " gerd voss said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there will be no love lost between schalke and bvb however , with rivals bremen and stuttgart also facing tricky games at the weekend , a win at dortmund for schalke and defeats at frankfurt for werder and bochum for vfb could hand the title to the royal blues on saturday .
but if all three teams win and the league goes to the wire , schalke still have a great chance with a final game at home against bielefeld .
dortmund , who have scrambled to safety from relegation under coach thomas doll , have only a mathematical chance of getting into the uefa cup places but will be playing for regional pride on saturday in one of the league 's fiercely contested derby games .

the midfielder announced wednesday that he would not be leaving for juventus turin in the summer as previously expected .
his contract renewal came a week after striker miroslav klose said he will not the leave the club either and will fulfill his contract until 2008 .
frankfurt , dumped out of the semi-finals of the dfb cup by nuremberg last month , are four points above the drop-zone and a victory against bremen would guarantee their top league status for another season .
however , bremen slammed six past them in the commerzbank arena in december and with werder beginning to find their feet again , the frankfurters could be in for a torrid time .

that may be but with so many permutations of results contributing to either glory or shame this year , some are rapidly doing the math . with the club 's first german title in 49 years in sight , schalke 04 fans are taking every opportunity to watch a potential new chapter of their team 's history being written .
the league leaders take on bitter local rivals borussia dortmund on saturday with two matches to go in one of the tightest championship races in years , and have decided to open up their 75,000-seater veltins arena for those supporters unable to get to dortmund for the match .
schalke lead the table by one point from vfb stuttgart and two from werder bremen , and the difficult away game against bvb could be a deciding factor in the destination of the championship shield .
the club announced earlier this week that it would be showing saturday 's game live in its home stadium to give their fans a chance to see the game .
fans would have to pay a six-euro entry fee , but would receive a four-euro food or drink voucher .
one of the reasons why the stadium will be opened is to prevent tens of thousands of fans of traveling to dortmund for a match that is already considered a security risk with 18,000 schalke fans expected to be at the game at signal iduna park .
schalke officials are thus attempting to downplay expectations ahead of the match .
" we are expecting the championship to only be decided on the final day , " gerd voss said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there will be no love lost between schalke and bvb however , with rivals bremen and stuttgart also facing tricky games at the weekend , a win at dortmund for schalke and defeats at frankfurt for werder and bochum for vfb could hand the title to the royal blues on saturday .
but if all three teams win and the league goes to the wire , schalke still have a great chance with a final game at home against bielefeld .
dortmund , who have scrambled to safety from relegation under coach thomas doll , have only a mathematical chance of getting into the uefa cup places but will be playing for regional pride on saturday in one of the league 's fiercely contested derby games .
winning against schalke and throwing a massive spanner into the works of their title challenge will be all the incentive doll 's players need .
frings , klose boost resurgent bremen one former dortmund star will also be urging his old team to win will be bremen 's torsten frings .
the diminutive midfielder will be hoping bvb trip schalke up and pave the way for a recovering werder to snatch the title on the last day .
frings , who was a bundesliga runner-up with dortmund in 2003 , hopes to add a league winners ' medal with bremen to the one he secured with bayern munich in 2005 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frings will strut his stuff for bremen until at least 2011 werder will face eintracht frankfurt at the weserstadion buoyed by a recent return to form after crashing out of the uefa cup semi-finals and the news that frings has committed himself to the club until 2011 .
the midfielder announced wednesday that he would not be leaving for juventus turin in the summer as previously expected .
his contract renewal came a week after striker miroslav klose said he will not the leave the club either and will fulfill his contract until 2008 .
frankfurt , dumped out of the semi-finals of the dfb cup by nuremberg last month , are four points above the drop-zone and a victory against bremen would guarantee their top league status for another season .
however , bremen slammed six past them in the commerzbank arena in december and with werder beginning to find their feet again , the frankfurters could be in for a torrid time .
stuttgart wary of battling bochum second-place stuttgart will be wary of resurgent bochum who flirted with relegation for most of the season only to come alive at the end to claim the scalps of schalke , bayer leverkusen and hamburg .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bochum have already proved a problem for schalke the 2-1 defeat of schalke two weeks ago and last week ’ s 3-0 mauling of hsv should provide armin veh 's championship hopefuls with plenty of food for thought .
bochum could still mount a late challenge for a european place but will have to add stuttgart to their list of conquests and hope everyone else above them lose their last two games .
fourth-placed bayern munich , out of the champions league places but safely in the uefa cup next season , travel to energie cottbus .
the eastern german side are safe from the drop and have had a mixed bag of results of late with wins against leverkusen , wolfsburg and frankfurt offset by losses to hanover and schalke .
cottbus will want more breathing space from the basement despite being secure and robbing the deposed champions of bayern in the process would definitely be an added bonus .
leverkusen , hanover tussle for uefa cup place dfb cup finalists nuremberg will be hoping to put the skids under hamburg 's revival with bayer leverkusen breathing down their necks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leverkusen could have a uefa cup place to celebrate nuremberg already have a uefa cup slot as fellow finalists stuttgart will finish in the champions league places but with hanover close behind , leverkusen will want to snatch fifth place from nuremberg to make sure of european soccer next season .
bayer have 45 points while hanover are on 44 and the fight for europe could go to the last game of the season .
leverkusen play hertha berlin saturday while hanover are away to arminia bielefeld .

klopp will have one eye on the aachen – wolfsburg game on saturday , knowing that a draw between the two clubs above his would set up a dramatic finale .
if wolfsburg win , it could be curtains for mainz as the wolves would drag themselves to near safety on 39 points .

frings , klose boost resurgent bremen one former dortmund star will also be urging his old team to win will be bremen 's torsten frings .
the diminutive midfielder will be hoping bvb trip schalke up and pave the way for a recovering werder to snatch the title on the last day .
frings , who was a bundesliga runner-up with dortmund in 2003 , hopes to add a league winners ' medal with bremen to the one he secured with bayern munich in 2005 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frings will strut his stuff for bremen until at least 2011 werder will face eintracht frankfurt at the weserstadion buoyed by a recent return to form after crashing out of the uefa cup semi-finals and the news that frings has committed himself to the club until 2011 .
the midfielder announced wednesday that he would not be leaving for juventus turin in the summer as previously expected .
his contract renewal came a week after striker miroslav klose said he will not the leave the club either and will fulfill his contract until 2008 .
frankfurt , dumped out of the semi-finals of the dfb cup by nuremberg last month , are four points above the drop-zone and a victory against bremen would guarantee their top league status for another season .
however , bremen slammed six past them in the commerzbank arena in december and with werder beginning to find their feet again , the frankfurters could be in for a torrid time .
stuttgart wary of battling bochum second-place stuttgart will be wary of resurgent bochum who flirted with relegation for most of the season only to come alive at the end to claim the scalps of schalke , bayer leverkusen and hamburg .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bochum have already proved a problem for schalke the 2-1 defeat of schalke two weeks ago and last week ’ s 3-0 mauling of hsv should provide armin veh 's championship hopefuls with plenty of food for thought .
bochum could still mount a late challenge for a european place but will have to add stuttgart to their list of conquests and hope everyone else above them lose their last two games .
fourth-placed bayern munich , out of the champions league places but safely in the uefa cup next season , travel to energie cottbus .
the eastern german side are safe from the drop and have had a mixed bag of results of late with wins against leverkusen , wolfsburg and frankfurt offset by losses to hanover and schalke .
cottbus will want more breathing space from the basement despite being secure and robbing the deposed champions of bayern in the process would definitely be an added bonus .
leverkusen , hanover tussle for uefa cup place dfb cup finalists nuremberg will be hoping to put the skids under hamburg 's revival with bayer leverkusen breathing down their necks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leverkusen could have a uefa cup place to celebrate nuremberg already have a uefa cup slot as fellow finalists stuttgart will finish in the champions league places but with hanover close behind , leverkusen will want to snatch fifth place from nuremberg to make sure of european soccer next season .
bayer have 45 points while hanover are on 44 and the fight for europe could go to the last game of the season .
leverkusen play hertha berlin saturday while hanover are away to arminia bielefeld .
coaches tackle relegation arithmetic while opponents borussia mönchengladbach are already down , mainz are still in the relegation dogfight .
with six points going begging in the next fortnight , a win over bottom club gladbach on saturday and a final day victory over bayern munich could see jürgen klopp 's team survive .
klopp will have one eye on the aachen – wolfsburg game on saturday , knowing that a draw between the two clubs above his would set up a dramatic finale .
if wolfsburg win , it could be curtains for mainz as the wolves would drag themselves to near safety on 39 points .
if aachen win , and mainz are victorious , it will all hinge on the final game with only one point separating the three teams on the last day of the season .
if that scenario transpires , the impetus could be with aachen .
with mainz away in munich and wolfsburg playing host to title chasers bremen , aachen could save themselves by the skin of their teeth by beating hamburg . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schalke hold lead as stuttgart , bremen keep pressure on nothing changed at the top of the bundesliga table as schalke maintained their one-point lead over stuttgart and two-point advantage over bremen as all three teams came away with wins with two weeks left in the season .

bremen , the smallest of germany 's 16 federal states with 490,000 eligible voters , has been governed for 12 years by an alliance of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , reflecting the make-up of chancellor angela merkel 's grand coalition in berlin .
but the two parties were at each other 's throats last week when it emerged that albrecht had been teaching german to migrant children at a bremen school for more than 10 years .
convicted murderer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : susanne albrecht , right , in a photo dated 1991 albrecht was sentenced to 12 years in prison in 1991 for her role in the july 1977 slaying of dresdner bank chief jürgen ponto in a botched kidnapping attempt by red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- terrorists .
paroled in 1996 after serving half her sentence , the now 56-year-old settled in bremen where she has been living under an assumed name and working as a language teacher .
" parents do n't want their children to be taught by raf terrorists , " said thomas röwekamp , the cdu leader who is vying with spd incumbent jens böhrnsen for the state 's top post of governing mayor .
former spd leader henning scherf dismissed röwekamp 's call for albrecht 's removal , saying she had turned her back on terrorism a long time ago and no longer posed a threat .
" such outrage is nothing but electioneering , " scherf said .
" shortly before the vote , an old issue is being dredged up again .
anyone surfing the internet can read that susanne albrecht is working as a teacher today . "
parents at the school where albrecht works recently issued a statement , saying they were outraged that albrecht 's past was being used as a campaign issue in the bremen elections .
albrecht " should continue her very successful work with the children of our school , " the statement said .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen ponto was murdered on 30 july 1977 latest opinion polls show the cdu trailing the spd by 28 percent to 40 per cent ahead of sunday 's vote for the 83-member bremen senate .
the spd , with its party color of red , has not made a pre-election commitment about which party it will govern with in future , leading to speculation it might favor an alliance with the greens , who are tipped to win 14 per cent of the vote .
" if there are enough votes for a red-green majority , they 'll go with that , " said lothar probst , a political researcher at the university of bremen .
" otherwise it 'll be a reluctant renewal of the previous coalition . "
the latter would suit merkel 's advisors , who are anxious to ensure that a result favoring the spd is not seen as a litmus test for the popularity of her 18-month-old coalition at national level .

beck , who marks one year in office the day after the bremen election , enjoys the support of only 38 percent of the electorate compared to 70 per cent for merkel , according to a poll conducted for the main ard television network last week .
at national level , the spd has seen its support drop to 27 per cent , compared to 34 per cent for merkel 's party , which has seized the initiative on a range of issues usually considered social democrat territory .

the northern state , with an unemployment rate of 13.1 percent , one of the highest in germany , is also plagued by a high rate of youth crime and child poverty .
the state 's justice affairs senator resigned last october after the body of a two-year-old boy in the care of her department was found stuffed in the refrigerator of his drug-addict father .

bremen , the smallest of germany 's 16 federal states with 490,000 eligible voters , has been governed for 12 years by an alliance of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , reflecting the make-up of chancellor angela merkel 's grand coalition in berlin .
but the two parties were at each other 's throats last week when it emerged that albrecht had been teaching german to migrant children at a bremen school for more than 10 years .
convicted murderer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : susanne albrecht , right , in a photo dated 1991 albrecht was sentenced to 12 years in prison in 1991 for her role in the july 1977 slaying of dresdner bank chief jürgen ponto in a botched kidnapping attempt by red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- terrorists .
paroled in 1996 after serving half her sentence , the now 56-year-old settled in bremen where she has been living under an assumed name and working as a language teacher .
" parents do n't want their children to be taught by raf terrorists , " said thomas röwekamp , the cdu leader who is vying with spd incumbent jens böhrnsen for the state 's top post of governing mayor .
former spd leader henning scherf dismissed röwekamp 's call for albrecht 's removal , saying she had turned her back on terrorism a long time ago and no longer posed a threat .
" such outrage is nothing but electioneering , " scherf said .
" shortly before the vote , an old issue is being dredged up again .
anyone surfing the internet can read that susanne albrecht is working as a teacher today . "
parents at the school where albrecht works recently issued a statement , saying they were outraged that albrecht 's past was being used as a campaign issue in the bremen elections .
albrecht " should continue her very successful work with the children of our school , " the statement said .
chasing the votes ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen ponto was murdered on 30 july 1977 latest opinion polls show the cdu trailing the spd by 28 percent to 40 per cent ahead of sunday 's vote for the 83-member bremen senate .
the spd , with its party color of red , has not made a pre-election commitment about which party it will govern with in future , leading to speculation it might favor an alliance with the greens , who are tipped to win 14 per cent of the vote .
" if there are enough votes for a red-green majority , they 'll go with that , " said lothar probst , a political researcher at the university of bremen .
" otherwise it 'll be a reluctant renewal of the previous coalition . "
the latter would suit merkel 's advisors , who are anxious to ensure that a result favoring the spd is not seen as a litmus test for the popularity of her 18-month-old coalition at national level .
a popularity contest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spd national chairman kurt beck spd national chairman kurt beck is hoping that a good showing by his party will shore up his own position in the light of a recent survey that put him well behind the chancellor in voter popularity .
beck , who marks one year in office the day after the bremen election , enjoys the support of only 38 percent of the electorate compared to 70 per cent for merkel , according to a poll conducted for the main ard television network last week .
at national level , the spd has seen its support drop to 27 per cent , compared to 34 per cent for merkel 's party , which has seized the initiative on a range of issues usually considered social democrat territory .
sensitive issues in the last elections four years ago voters in bremen 's adjacent port of bremerhaven elected a member of the extreme right-wing german people 's union -lrb- dvu -rrb- to the state parliament .
surveys expect a slight increase in the dvu 's share of the vote this time around .
the northern state , with an unemployment rate of 13.1 percent , one of the highest in germany , is also plagued by a high rate of youth crime and child poverty .

" it is in our interest and it is our responsibility to allow europe to act in the face of the challenges that confront us , " merkel said at an informal meeting of a handful of european union leaders in sintra , west of lisbon .
" germany alone can not bring all these issues to their successful conclusion , " merkel , whose country holds the eu 's rotating six-month presidency , told journalists .
" but i trust that i have the support of my colleagues here , who will continue to show commitment to our course , to setting europe on the right track and the right foundation . "
mulling the bloc 's future the meeting also included european commission president jose manuel barroso and the leaders of portugal and slovenia , which will each respectively assume the six-month presidency role after germany .
european parliament president hans gert pöttering attended as well .
the session was called to mull the 27-member bloc 's future but had no formal agenda or conclusions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are there any solutions in there ?
merkel with barroso earlier this year barroso also pushed for an agreement on the constitution , which has been in limbo since french and dutch voters said no to a draft treaty in 2005 referenda .
18 other countries have ratified the text .
advocates of the treaty say it is essential to streamline decision-making in the 27-nation bloc .
a new , slimmed-down charter is expected to cover only key reforms such as a long-term president , a foreign minister , and a simpler voting system based more on population size .
portugal in favor of referendum " naturally , what we want is that at the june meeting a consensus is reached so that it is clear what the roadmap is so that europe can adopt a institutional treaty as soon as possible , " portuguese prime minister jose socrates said .
portugal never ratified the treaty and socrates has said he wants to hold a referendum on any new constitution , which would make portugal one of only a few states considering such a move .
barroso said the leaders had discussed in " great detail the way forward for the treaty settlement and we hope that by the end of june , under the chairmanship of mrs. merkel , we will have progress on that matter . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president elect sarkozy wants a mini-treaty for the eu french president-elect nicolas sarkozy has proposed a so-called mini-treaty for the eu .
after meeting with sarkozy on friday , outgoing british prime minister tony blair said he agreed with the idea of developing a simplified constitution .
" it 's not about a mini-treaty or a maxi-treaty , but a treaty that makes europe capable of acting to shape globalization in function of its values , " barroso said .
" we need these presidencies to work together in a real team spirit , to assure the continuity of the direction of the european union , " barroso said .
merkel aware of pitfalls merkel said she was " perfectly aware " of the difficulty in reaching agreements in the past , but added that " my role , as president , is to find the right equilibrium between all those interests . "
she has made reviving the constitutional project a priority of germany 's eu presidency .

the federal government 's predicted fiscal surplus , or excess of tax revenue over expenditure , is expected to amount to 87 billion euros by that date .
the rest of the stated figure is made up of the expected surpluses of the country 's 16 regional states and social security services .
the projected figure for 2011 represents the biggest tax revenue surplus since the federal republic of germany was founded in 1949 .
germany economy revs up it also provides the latest proof that germany is reaping the benefits of limited but unpopular labor market reforms that began to take effect under the former government of chancellor gerhard schröder .
the projection confirms that the german economy , the biggest in the eurozone , is recovering fast and regaining its position as the driver of european union growth .
from 2002 to 2005 , germany exceeded european union rules that it helped to draw up and which obliged governments to keep their budget shortfalls below 3.0 percent of gross domestic product .
but after years of lethargic progress , germany 's economic momentum increased sharply and its deficit shrank to 1.7 percent of gdp last year .
and the government is hoping to cut the ratio further to 1.2 percent in 2007 .
differences over how best to use surplus the left-right coalition government in berlin appears divided on how best to use the tax surplus .
economy minister michael glos , a member of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats , favors tax cuts but finance minister peer steinbrück , a social democrat , is opposed to such a step .
steinbrück would prefer to use the surplus to balance the german budget and reduce the national debt .
" this is a historic development , we can at last begin to reduce the mountain of debt that has accumulated and which stands at more than 1,500 billion euros , " steinbrück said .
in the meanwhile , several other ministers are calling for the surplus to be used to fund projects in their portfolios .
steinbrück gave assurances that the government planned to invest two billion euros a year in key areas such as " education and research , the family , environmental protection , infrastructure , development aid and internal security . "
in a breakdown given by the ministry , the total fiscal surplus is forecast at 20.3 billion in 2007 euros and at 47.9 billion euros next year . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu says german deficit sinking fast the european commission said germany 's efforts to clean up its financial house are paying off , with the country expected to pare its budget deficit down to three percent of gross domestic product in 2008 .

depending on whom you read , globalization is either praised for increasing global wealth or blamed for aggravating poverty .
it is a concept that is evolving almost on a daily basis , effecting global commerce and culture .
as a globe-trotting journalist with a phd in economics , daniel altman is very much caught between these two worlds .
in his blog “ managing globalization ” published by the international herald tribune , altman attempts to track , document and report on this ever-changing phenomenon all the while trying to enlighten his readers on how globalization affects them on a daily basis .
his new book " connected : 24 hours in the global economy " has just been published .
dw-world.de : since blogs started out as diaries , can someone really write a diary about our globalized world ?
where does one start ?
daniel altman : i think every single person on earth is a global citizen . we can hardly get out of bed without participating in world markets .
every time you use a car , bus , plane or anything made of plastic , you 're using oil . every time you use a credit card , you 're dipping into the world 's lending market . the prices of the things you buy and sell are determined by competition from around the globe . so yes , you can write a diary about our globalized world ; you need only write about your own life .
i am sure the looser format of a blog makes this task a little easier – or not ?
blogs have the flexibility needed to take on a wide variety of issues . the idea is often to get a discussion going without starting off at a very in-depth level . this way , we can find out which topics are most important to our readers .
is the fact that you are " blogging " about globalization actually a product of globalization itself ?
well , our audience is very international .
we 've received comments from english speakers on every continent except antarctica .
i do n't think blogging is a product of globalization , but the success of my blog definitely is .
is there a direct connection between the greater interconnectivity of cultures / people and the rise of globalization in industry ?
i 'm not sure how direct it is .
my book certainly makes the point that connectedness can create new opportunities for collaboration and productivity , though it can also create new risks .
cultural exchange is nothing new , though .
for a much earlier example , you only have to think about the traders on the old silk road .
if yes , which leads the other ?
where are the two heading ?
i think the two processes are inevitably intertwined . but if you want to know what is driving globalization so rapidly now , i would point to innovation and technology .
can we get even more connected ? we certainly can . we - and especially americans - are fairly unaware of things happening around the world that affect us . the message of my book is that by paying more attention to our connections to people , businesses and markets in other countries , we can take more control of our own economic future . ole tangen jr. interviewed daniel altman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de from africa to germany , blogs reflect a globalized world as the number of blogs around the world continues to climb , many blogs focusing on local issues are gaining a global audience in this hyper-connected media landscape .

depending on whom you read , globalization is either praised for increasing global wealth or blamed for aggravating poverty .

in his blog “ managing globalization ” published by the international herald tribune , altman attempts to track , document and report on this ever-changing phenomenon all the while trying to enlighten his readers on how globalization affects them on a daily basis .
his new book " connected : 24 hours in the global economy " has just been published .
dw-world.de : since blogs started out as diaries , can someone really write a diary about our globalized world ?
where does one start ?
daniel altman : i think every single person on earth is a global citizen . we can hardly get out of bed without participating in world markets .
every time you use a car , bus , plane or anything made of plastic , you 're using oil . every time you use a credit card , you 're dipping into the world 's lending market . the prices of the things you buy and sell are determined by competition from around the globe . so yes , you can write a diary about our globalized world ; you need only write about your own life .
i am sure the looser format of a blog makes this task a little easier – or not ?
blogs have the flexibility needed to take on a wide variety of issues . the idea is often to get a discussion going without starting off at a very in-depth level . this way , we can find out which topics are most important to our readers .
is the fact that you are " blogging " about globalization actually a product of globalization itself ?
well , our audience is very international .
we 've received comments from english speakers on every continent except antarctica .
i do n't think blogging is a product of globalization , but the success of my blog definitely is .
is there a direct connection between the greater interconnectivity of cultures / people and the rise of globalization in industry ?
i 'm not sure how direct it is .
my book certainly makes the point that connectedness can create new opportunities for collaboration and productivity , though it can also create new risks .
cultural exchange is nothing new , though .
for a much earlier example , you only have to think about the traders on the old silk road .
if yes , which leads the other ?
where are the two heading ?
i think the two processes are inevitably intertwined . but if you want to know what is driving globalization so rapidly now , i would point to innovation and technology .
can we get even more connected ? we certainly can . we - and especially americans - are fairly unaware of things happening around the world that affect us . the message of my book is that by paying more attention to our connections to people , businesses and markets in other countries , we can take more control of our own economic future . ole tangen jr. interviewed daniel altman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de from africa to germany , blogs reflect a globalized world as the number of blogs around the world continues to climb , many blogs focusing on local issues are gaining a global audience in this hyper-connected media landscape .

" it is in our interest and it is our responsibility to allow europe to act in the face of the challenges that confront us , " merkel said at an informal meeting of a handful of european union leaders in sintra , west of lisbon .
" germany alone can not bring all these issues to their successful conclusion , " merkel , whose country holds the eu 's rotating six-month presidency , told journalists .
" but i trust that i have the support of my colleagues here , who will continue to show commitment to our course , to setting europe on the right track and the right foundation . "
mulling the bloc 's future the meeting also included european commission president jose manuel barroso and the leaders of portugal and slovenia , which will each respectively assume the six-month presidency role after germany .
european parliament president hans gert pöttering attended as well .
the session was called to mull the 27-member bloc 's future but had no formal agenda or conclusions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are there any solutions in there ?
merkel with barroso earlier this year barroso also pushed for an agreement on the constitution , which has been in limbo since french and dutch voters said no to a draft treaty in 2005 referenda .
18 other countries have ratified the text .
advocates of the treaty say it is essential to streamline decision-making in the 27-nation bloc .
a new , slimmed-down charter is expected to cover only key reforms such as a long-term president , a foreign minister , and a simpler voting system based more on population size .
portugal in favor of referendum " naturally , what we want is that at the june meeting a consensus is reached so that it is clear what the roadmap is so that europe can adopt a institutional treaty as soon as possible , " portuguese prime minister jose socrates said .
portugal never ratified the treaty and socrates has said he wants to hold a referendum on any new constitution , which would make portugal one of only a few states considering such a move .
barroso said the leaders had discussed in " great detail the way forward for the treaty settlement and we hope that by the end of june , under the chairmanship of mrs. merkel , we will have progress on that matter . "

" it is in our interest and it is our responsibility to allow europe to act in the face of the challenges that confront us , " merkel said at an informal meeting of a handful of european union leaders in sintra , west of lisbon .
" germany alone can not bring all these issues to their successful conclusion , " merkel , whose country holds the eu 's rotating six-month presidency , told journalists .
" but i trust that i have the support of my colleagues here , who will continue to show commitment to our course , to setting europe on the right track and the right foundation . "
mulling the bloc 's future the meeting also included european commission president jose manuel barroso and the leaders of portugal and slovenia , which will each respectively assume the six-month presidency role after germany .
european parliament president hans gert pöttering attended as well .
the session was called to mull the 27-member bloc 's future but had no formal agenda or conclusions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are there any solutions in there ?
merkel with barroso earlier this year barroso also pushed for an agreement on the constitution , which has been in limbo since french and dutch voters said no to a draft treaty in 2005 referenda .
18 other countries have ratified the text .
advocates of the treaty say it is essential to streamline decision-making in the 27-nation bloc .
a new , slimmed-down charter is expected to cover only key reforms such as a long-term president , a foreign minister , and a simpler voting system based more on population size .
portugal in favor of referendum " naturally , what we want is that at the june meeting a consensus is reached so that it is clear what the roadmap is so that europe can adopt a institutional treaty as soon as possible , " portuguese prime minister jose socrates said .
portugal never ratified the treaty and socrates has said he wants to hold a referendum on any new constitution , which would make portugal one of only a few states considering such a move .
barroso said the leaders had discussed in " great detail the way forward for the treaty settlement and we hope that by the end of june , under the chairmanship of mrs. merkel , we will have progress on that matter . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president elect sarkozy wants a mini-treaty for the eu french president-elect nicolas sarkozy has proposed a so-called mini-treaty for the eu .

" it 's not about a mini-treaty or a maxi-treaty , but a treaty that makes europe capable of acting to shape globalization in function of its values , " barroso said .
" we need these presidencies to work together in a real team spirit , to assure the continuity of the direction of the european union , " barroso said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de globalization -pipe- 12.05.2007 " every single person on earth is a global citizen " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel altman : we are all a part of the global marketplace a journalist with a phd in economics , daniel altman blogs about globalization and its effects on everyday people from plant closures to nuclear energy to international development . from the growing interconnectedness of global industry to the growth of the internet , globalization is the concept which has been adopted to describe our modern society .
depending on whom you read , globalization is either praised for increasing global wealth or blamed for aggravating poverty .
it is a concept that is evolving almost on a daily basis , effecting global commerce and culture .
as a globe-trotting journalist with a phd in economics , daniel altman is very much caught between these two worlds .
in his blog “ managing globalization ” published by the international herald tribune , altman attempts to track , document and report on this ever-changing phenomenon all the while trying to enlighten his readers on how globalization affects them on a daily basis .
his new book " connected : 24 hours in the global economy " has just been published .
dw-world.de : since blogs started out as diaries , can someone really write a diary about our globalized world ?
where does one start ?
daniel altman : i think every single person on earth is a global citizen . we can hardly get out of bed without participating in world markets .
every time you use a car , bus , plane or anything made of plastic , you 're using oil . every time you use a credit card , you 're dipping into the world 's lending market . the prices of the things you buy and sell are determined by competition from around the globe . so yes , you can write a diary about our globalized world ; you need only write about your own life .
i am sure the looser format of a blog makes this task a little easier – or not ?
blogs have the flexibility needed to take on a wide variety of issues . the idea is often to get a discussion going without starting off at a very in-depth level . this way , we can find out which topics are most important to our readers .
is the fact that you are " blogging " about globalization actually a product of globalization itself ?
well , our audience is very international .
we 've received comments from english speakers on every continent except antarctica .
i do n't think blogging is a product of globalization , but the success of my blog definitely is .
is there a direct connection between the greater interconnectivity of cultures / people and the rise of globalization in industry ?
i 'm not sure how direct it is .
my book certainly makes the point that connectedness can create new opportunities for collaboration and productivity , though it can also create new risks .
cultural exchange is nothing new , though .
for a much earlier example , you only have to think about the traders on the old silk road .
if yes , which leads the other ?
where are the two heading ?
i think the two processes are inevitably intertwined . but if you want to know what is driving globalization so rapidly now , i would point to innovation and technology .
can we get even more connected ? we certainly can . we - and especially americans - are fairly unaware of things happening around the world that affect us . the message of my book is that by paying more attention to our connections to people , businesses and markets in other countries , we can take more control of our own economic future . ole tangen jr. interviewed daniel altman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de from africa to germany , blogs reflect a globalized world as the number of blogs around the world continues to climb , many blogs focusing on local issues are gaining a global audience in this hyper-connected media landscape .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de globalization -pipe- 12.05.2007 " every single person on earth is a global citizen " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel altman : we are all a part of the global marketplace a journalist with a phd in economics , daniel altman blogs about globalization and its effects on everyday people from plant closures to nuclear energy to international development . from the growing interconnectedness of global industry to the growth of the internet , globalization is the concept which has been adopted to describe our modern society .
depending on whom you read , globalization is either praised for increasing global wealth or blamed for aggravating poverty .
it is a concept that is evolving almost on a daily basis , effecting global commerce and culture .
as a globe-trotting journalist with a phd in economics , daniel altman is very much caught between these two worlds .
in his blog “ managing globalization ” published by the international herald tribune , altman attempts to track , document and report on this ever-changing phenomenon all the while trying to enlighten his readers on how globalization affects them on a daily basis .
his new book " connected : 24 hours in the global economy " has just been published .
dw-world.de : since blogs started out as diaries , can someone really write a diary about our globalized world ?
where does one start ?
daniel altman : i think every single person on earth is a global citizen . we can hardly get out of bed without participating in world markets .
every time you use a car , bus , plane or anything made of plastic , you 're using oil . every time you use a credit card , you 're dipping into the world 's lending market . the prices of the things you buy and sell are determined by competition from around the globe . so yes , you can write a diary about our globalized world ; you need only write about your own life .
i am sure the looser format of a blog makes this task a little easier – or not ?
blogs have the flexibility needed to take on a wide variety of issues . the idea is often to get a discussion going without starting off at a very in-depth level . this way , we can find out which topics are most important to our readers .
is the fact that you are " blogging " about globalization actually a product of globalization itself ?
well , our audience is very international .
we 've received comments from english speakers on every continent except antarctica .
i do n't think blogging is a product of globalization , but the success of my blog definitely is .
is there a direct connection between the greater interconnectivity of cultures / people and the rise of globalization in industry ?
i 'm not sure how direct it is .
my book certainly makes the point that connectedness can create new opportunities for collaboration and productivity , though it can also create new risks .
cultural exchange is nothing new , though .
for a much earlier example , you only have to think about the traders on the old silk road .
if yes , which leads the other ?
where are the two heading ?
i think the two processes are inevitably intertwined . but if you want to know what is driving globalization so rapidly now , i would point to innovation and technology .
can we get even more connected ? we certainly can . we - and especially americans - are fairly unaware of things happening around the world that affect us . the message of my book is that by paying more attention to our connections to people , businesses and markets in other countries , we can take more control of our own economic future . ole tangen jr. interviewed daniel altman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de from africa to germany , blogs reflect a globalized world as the number of blogs around the world continues to climb , many blogs focusing on local issues are gaining a global audience in this hyper-connected media landscape .

the projection confirms that the german economy , the biggest in the eurozone , is recovering fast and regaining its position as the driver of european union growth .
from 2002 to 2005 , germany exceeded european union rules that it helped to draw up and which obliged governments to keep their budget shortfalls below 3.0 percent of gross domestic product .
but after years of lethargic progress , germany 's economic momentum increased sharply and its deficit shrank to 1.7 percent of gdp last year .
and the government is hoping to cut the ratio further to 1.2 percent in 2007 .
differences over how best to use surplus the left-right coalition government in berlin appears divided on how best to use the tax surplus .
economy minister michael glos , a member of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats , favors tax cuts but finance minister peer steinbrück , a social democrat , is opposed to such a step .
steinbrück would prefer to use the surplus to balance the german budget and reduce the national debt .
" this is a historic development , we can at last begin to reduce the mountain of debt that has accumulated and which stands at more than 1,500 billion euros , " steinbrück said .
in the meanwhile , several other ministers are calling for the surplus to be used to fund projects in their portfolios .
steinbrück gave assurances that the government planned to invest two billion euros a year in key areas such as " education and research , the family , environmental protection , infrastructure , development aid and internal security . "
in a breakdown given by the ministry , the total fiscal surplus is forecast at 20.3 billion in 2007 euros and at 47.9 billion euros next year . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu says german deficit sinking fast the european commission said germany 's efforts to clean up its financial house are paying off , with the country expected to pare its budget deficit down to three percent of gross domestic product in 2008 .

" it is in our interest and it is our responsibility to allow europe to act in the face of the challenges that confront us , " merkel said at an informal meeting of a handful of european union leaders in sintra , west of lisbon .
" germany alone can not bring all these issues to their successful conclusion , " merkel , whose country holds the eu 's rotating six-month presidency , told journalists .
" but i trust that i have the support of my colleagues here , who will continue to show commitment to our course , to setting europe on the right track and the right foundation . "
mulling the bloc 's future the meeting also included european commission president jose manuel barroso and the leaders of portugal and slovenia , which will each respectively assume the six-month presidency role after germany .
european parliament president hans gert pöttering attended as well .
the session was called to mull the 27-member bloc 's future but had no formal agenda or conclusions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are there any solutions in there ?
merkel with barroso earlier this year barroso also pushed for an agreement on the constitution , which has been in limbo since french and dutch voters said no to a draft treaty in 2005 referenda .
18 other countries have ratified the text .
advocates of the treaty say it is essential to streamline decision-making in the 27-nation bloc .
a new , slimmed-down charter is expected to cover only key reforms such as a long-term president , a foreign minister , and a simpler voting system based more on population size .
portugal in favor of referendum " naturally , what we want is that at the june meeting a consensus is reached so that it is clear what the roadmap is so that europe can adopt a institutional treaty as soon as possible , " portuguese prime minister jose socrates said .
portugal never ratified the treaty and socrates has said he wants to hold a referendum on any new constitution , which would make portugal one of only a few states considering such a move .
barroso said the leaders had discussed in " great detail the way forward for the treaty settlement and we hope that by the end of june , under the chairmanship of mrs. merkel , we will have progress on that matter . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president elect sarkozy wants a mini-treaty for the eu french president-elect nicolas sarkozy has proposed a so-called mini-treaty for the eu .
after meeting with sarkozy on friday , outgoing british prime minister tony blair said he agreed with the idea of developing a simplified constitution .
" it 's not about a mini-treaty or a maxi-treaty , but a treaty that makes europe capable of acting to shape globalization in function of its values , " barroso said .
" we need these presidencies to work together in a real team spirit , to assure the continuity of the direction of the european union , " barroso said .
merkel aware of pitfalls merkel said she was " perfectly aware " of the difficulty in reaching agreements in the past , but added that " my role , as president , is to find the right equilibrium between all those interests . "
she has made reviving the constitutional project a priority of germany 's eu presidency .
merkel hopes to broker agreement at a june 21-22 summit on a roadmap for a new treaty to be in place by 2009 . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany quizzes eu members on constitution germany , which holds the eu 's rotating presidency , has sent the 27 eu member states a questionnaire on what to do about the bloc 's stalled constitutional treaty to kick-start an intensive series of talks .

depending on whom you read , globalization is either praised for increasing global wealth or blamed for aggravating poverty .
it is a concept that is evolving almost on a daily basis , effecting global commerce and culture .
as a globe-trotting journalist with a phd in economics , daniel altman is very much caught between these two worlds .
in his blog “ managing globalization ” published by the international herald tribune , altman attempts to track , document and report on this ever-changing phenomenon all the while trying to enlighten his readers on how globalization affects them on a daily basis .
his new book " connected : 24 hours in the global economy " has just been published .
dw-world.de : since blogs started out as diaries , can someone really write a diary about our globalized world ?
where does one start ?
daniel altman : i think every single person on earth is a global citizen . we can hardly get out of bed without participating in world markets .
every time you use a car , bus , plane or anything made of plastic , you 're using oil . every time you use a credit card , you 're dipping into the world 's lending market . the prices of the things you buy and sell are determined by competition from around the globe . so yes , you can write a diary about our globalized world ; you need only write about your own life .
i am sure the looser format of a blog makes this task a little easier – or not ?
blogs have the flexibility needed to take on a wide variety of issues . the idea is often to get a discussion going without starting off at a very in-depth level . this way , we can find out which topics are most important to our readers .
is the fact that you are " blogging " about globalization actually a product of globalization itself ?
well , our audience is very international .
we 've received comments from english speakers on every continent except antarctica .
i do n't think blogging is a product of globalization , but the success of my blog definitely is .
is there a direct connection between the greater interconnectivity of cultures / people and the rise of globalization in industry ?
i 'm not sure how direct it is .
my book certainly makes the point that connectedness can create new opportunities for collaboration and productivity , though it can also create new risks .
cultural exchange is nothing new , though .
for a much earlier example , you only have to think about the traders on the old silk road .
if yes , which leads the other ?
where are the two heading ?
i think the two processes are inevitably intertwined . but if you want to know what is driving globalization so rapidly now , i would point to innovation and technology .
can we get even more connected ? we certainly can . we - and especially americans - are fairly unaware of things happening around the world that affect us . the message of my book is that by paying more attention to our connections to people , businesses and markets in other countries , we can take more control of our own economic future . ole tangen jr. interviewed daniel altman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de from africa to germany , blogs reflect a globalized world as the number of blogs around the world continues to climb , many blogs focusing on local issues are gaining a global audience in this hyper-connected media landscape .

the federal government 's predicted fiscal surplus , or excess of tax revenue over expenditure , is expected to amount to 87 billion euros by that date .

the post is read , discussed and linked to by other bloggers and internet users throughout the turkish-speaking world . a graduate student in the us reads the blog , translates it into english and posts it onto another website . bloggers from bahrain to australia then link to the translated post adding their own links and comments along the way . through the reach of the global blogosphere , one person ’ s casual musings have become an international topic for a virtual conversation about democracy , religion and politics . " through a blog , a local issue can become a global one , " said sokari ekine , a nigerian who blogs about african women issues at blacklooks.org. one of the central ideas of globalization is that there is a growing interconnectedness between different societies as well as a greater desire to participate in a " world culture . " brought together by little more than an internet connection and a desire to converse , blogs -lrb- short for weblogs -rrb- have changed how local and global issues are discussed .
and along the way they have become a reflection of this interconnectedness and an increasingly globalized world . " today blogs can impact governments and mainstream media , " said ekine , " and the more people who start blogging will hopefully lead to greater change . " blogging by number just by sheer numbers , blogging is still a virtual phenomenon .
technorati , an online blog tracking site , just released a report stating that there are more than 71 million blogs being written all around the world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blogs started out as personal online diaries according to the report entitled " the state of the blogosphere " released this month , there are about 120,000 new weblogs created worldwide each day .
that works out to about 1.4 blogs every second with about 1.5 million postings per day . contrary to popular opinion , blogging is not an exclusively english endeavor .
of all the blogs tracked , japanese -lrb- 37 percent -rrb- just overtook english -lrb- 33 percent -rrb- as the most-blogged language .
at third place , chinese bloggers represent about three percent of the blogosphere while farsi edged into the top ten with about one percent . a tempered excitement among bloggers about the report was on display in comments on the technorati site .
commenting on the report , the center for citizen media blog summed up the feeling ; " there ’ s no question that blogs and other participatory sites have seen tremendous growth . " a global village ? a lot has changed in the more than 45 years since herbert marshall mcluhan first used the term " global village " to describe how electronic media has led to greater interconnectedness on a global scale . today " globalization " is the buzz word used to describe this phenomenon .
and while the term remains a divisive one , even the people who campaign against corporate globalization benefit from its processes .
" one of the most optimistic aspects of globalization is that anyone can go online and make a friend from anywhere around the world , " said ethan zuckerman who co-founded the site globalvoicesonline.org with rebecca mackinnon in 2004 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : who is reading your blog ?
from where ?
today the site calls itself a guide to the global blogosphere .
through a number of editors , the site posts summaries and excerpts of whatever topics are floating around the internet in regions of the world that are often ignored by the media . according to zuckerman , most bloggers write about and discuss local issues , especially in places like the middle east and africa . " when we feature a story on global voices , we are trying to open a local conversation to a global audience , " said zuckerman .
while he calls himself a " globalization junkie , " zuckerman also considers himself a realist . " there is this cyber-utopian illusion that we are all taking part of the same conversation .
we may all want to talk to each other and get a glimpse into other cultures but we are still all very different , " he said . no global language one of the greatest hurdles to a truly global conversation through blogs is language .
global voices and blacklooks both post mainly in english . markus beckedahl originally thought about writing a blog in english but decided against it because there were no german blogs at the time covering the political aspect of the information society . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what will the blogosphere look like in 10 or 20 years ?
" plus it is much easier to blog in your own language , " he said . so in 2004 he started the blog netzpolitik.org to enlighten germans on topics like open-source software and digital rights through education and activism . beckedahl believes that in 10 or 20 years translation software will allow bloggers from all over the world to communicate , no matter what language they blog in . using the german word " kulturtechnik " -lrb- loosely translates as " culture technique " -rrb- , beckedahl described blogs as a tool that can connect users , or peers to others all around the world often bridging both language and culture .

the post is read , discussed and linked to by other bloggers and internet users throughout the turkish-speaking world . a graduate student in the us reads the blog , translates it into english and posts it onto another website . bloggers from bahrain to australia then link to the translated post adding their own links and comments along the way . through the reach of the global blogosphere , one person ’ s casual musings have become an international topic for a virtual conversation about democracy , religion and politics . " through a blog , a local issue can become a global one , " said sokari ekine , a nigerian who blogs about african women issues at blacklooks.org. one of the central ideas of globalization is that there is a growing interconnectedness between different societies as well as a greater desire to participate in a " world culture . " brought together by little more than an internet connection and a desire to converse , blogs -lrb- short for weblogs -rrb- have changed how local and global issues are discussed .
and along the way they have become a reflection of this interconnectedness and an increasingly globalized world . " today blogs can impact governments and mainstream media , " said ekine , " and the more people who start blogging will hopefully lead to greater change . " blogging by number just by sheer numbers , blogging is still a virtual phenomenon .
technorati , an online blog tracking site , just released a report stating that there are more than 71 million blogs being written all around the world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blogs started out as personal online diaries according to the report entitled " the state of the blogosphere " released this month , there are about 120,000 new weblogs created worldwide each day .
that works out to about 1.4 blogs every second with about 1.5 million postings per day . contrary to popular opinion , blogging is not an exclusively english endeavor .
of all the blogs tracked , japanese -lrb- 37 percent -rrb- just overtook english -lrb- 33 percent -rrb- as the most-blogged language .
at third place , chinese bloggers represent about three percent of the blogosphere while farsi edged into the top ten with about one percent . a tempered excitement among bloggers about the report was on display in comments on the technorati site .
commenting on the report , the center for citizen media blog summed up the feeling ; " there ’ s no question that blogs and other participatory sites have seen tremendous growth . " a global village ? a lot has changed in the more than 45 years since herbert marshall mcluhan first used the term " global village " to describe how electronic media has led to greater interconnectedness on a global scale . today " globalization " is the buzz word used to describe this phenomenon .
and while the term remains a divisive one , even the people who campaign against corporate globalization benefit from its processes .
" one of the most optimistic aspects of globalization is that anyone can go online and make a friend from anywhere around the world , " said ethan zuckerman who co-founded the site globalvoicesonline.org with rebecca mackinnon in 2004 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : who is reading your blog ?
from where ?
today the site calls itself a guide to the global blogosphere .
through a number of editors , the site posts summaries and excerpts of whatever topics are floating around the internet in regions of the world that are often ignored by the media . according to zuckerman , most bloggers write about and discuss local issues , especially in places like the middle east and africa . " when we feature a story on global voices , we are trying to open a local conversation to a global audience , " said zuckerman .
while he calls himself a " globalization junkie , " zuckerman also considers himself a realist . " there is this cyber-utopian illusion that we are all taking part of the same conversation .
we may all want to talk to each other and get a glimpse into other cultures but we are still all very different , " he said . no global language one of the greatest hurdles to a truly global conversation through blogs is language .
global voices and blacklooks both post mainly in english . markus beckedahl originally thought about writing a blog in english but decided against it because there were no german blogs at the time covering the political aspect of the information society . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what will the blogosphere look like in 10 or 20 years ?
" plus it is much easier to blog in your own language , " he said . so in 2004 he started the blog netzpolitik.org to enlighten germans on topics like open-source software and digital rights through education and activism . beckedahl believes that in 10 or 20 years translation software will allow bloggers from all over the world to communicate , no matter what language they blog in . using the german word " kulturtechnik " -lrb- loosely translates as " culture technique " -rrb- , beckedahl described blogs as a tool that can connect users , or peers to others all around the world often bridging both language and culture . " every person sitting in front of a computer is a peer and together they are creating the global digital society , " he said . ole tangen jr . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " every single person on earth is a global citizen " a journalist with a phd in economics , daniel altman blogs about globalization and its effects on everyday people from plant closures to nuclear energy to international development .

depending on whom you read , globalization is either praised for increasing global wealth or blamed for aggravating poverty .
it is a concept that is evolving almost on a daily basis , effecting global commerce and culture .
as a globe-trotting journalist with a phd in economics , daniel altman is very much caught between these two worlds .
in his blog “ managing globalization ” published by the international herald tribune , altman attempts to track , document and report on this ever-changing phenomenon all the while trying to enlighten his readers on how globalization affects them on a daily basis .
his new book " connected : 24 hours in the global economy " has just been published .
dw-world.de : since blogs started out as diaries , can someone really write a diary about our globalized world ?
where does one start ?
daniel altman : i think every single person on earth is a global citizen . we can hardly get out of bed without participating in world markets .
every time you use a car , bus , plane or anything made of plastic , you 're using oil . every time you use a credit card , you 're dipping into the world 's lending market . the prices of the things you buy and sell are determined by competition from around the globe . so yes , you can write a diary about our globalized world ; you need only write about your own life .
i am sure the looser format of a blog makes this task a little easier – or not ?
blogs have the flexibility needed to take on a wide variety of issues . the idea is often to get a discussion going without starting off at a very in-depth level . this way , we can find out which topics are most important to our readers .
is the fact that you are " blogging " about globalization actually a product of globalization itself ?
well , our audience is very international .
we 've received comments from english speakers on every continent except antarctica .
i do n't think blogging is a product of globalization , but the success of my blog definitely is .
is there a direct connection between the greater interconnectivity of cultures / people and the rise of globalization in industry ?
i 'm not sure how direct it is .
my book certainly makes the point that connectedness can create new opportunities for collaboration and productivity , though it can also create new risks .
cultural exchange is nothing new , though .
for a much earlier example , you only have to think about the traders on the old silk road .
if yes , which leads the other ?
where are the two heading ?
i think the two processes are inevitably intertwined . but if you want to know what is driving globalization so rapidly now , i would point to innovation and technology .
can we get even more connected ? we certainly can . we - and especially americans - are fairly unaware of things happening around the world that affect us . the message of my book is that by paying more attention to our connections to people , businesses and markets in other countries , we can take more control of our own economic future . ole tangen jr. interviewed daniel altman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de from africa to germany , blogs reflect a globalized world as the number of blogs around the world continues to climb , many blogs focusing on local issues are gaining a global audience in this hyper-connected media landscape .

the federal government 's predicted fiscal surplus , or excess of tax revenue over expenditure , is expected to amount to 87 billion euros by that date .
the rest of the stated figure is made up of the expected surpluses of the country 's 16 regional states and social security services .
the projected figure for 2011 represents the biggest tax revenue surplus since the federal republic of germany was founded in 1949 .
germany economy revs up it also provides the latest proof that germany is reaping the benefits of limited but unpopular labor market reforms that began to take effect under the former government of chancellor gerhard schröder .
the projection confirms that the german economy , the biggest in the eurozone , is recovering fast and regaining its position as the driver of european union growth .
from 2002 to 2005 , germany exceeded european union rules that it helped to draw up and which obliged governments to keep their budget shortfalls below 3.0 percent of gross domestic product .
but after years of lethargic progress , germany 's economic momentum increased sharply and its deficit shrank to 1.7 percent of gdp last year .
and the government is hoping to cut the ratio further to 1.2 percent in 2007 .
differences over how best to use surplus the left-right coalition government in berlin appears divided on how best to use the tax surplus .
economy minister michael glos , a member of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats , favors tax cuts but finance minister peer steinbrück , a social democrat , is opposed to such a step .
steinbrück would prefer to use the surplus to balance the german budget and reduce the national debt .
" this is a historic development , we can at last begin to reduce the mountain of debt that has accumulated and which stands at more than 1,500 billion euros , " steinbrück said .
in the meanwhile , several other ministers are calling for the surplus to be used to fund projects in their portfolios .
steinbrück gave assurances that the government planned to invest two billion euros a year in key areas such as " education and research , the family , environmental protection , infrastructure , development aid and internal security . "
in a breakdown given by the ministry , the total fiscal surplus is forecast at 20.3 billion in 2007 euros and at 47.9 billion euros next year . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu says german deficit sinking fast the european commission said germany 's efforts to clean up its financial house are paying off , with the country expected to pare its budget deficit down to three percent of gross domestic product in 2008 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 12.05.2007 ex-terrorist becomes an issue in german state poll großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- was responsible for numerous terrorist attacks in germany a former terrorist convicted in the murder of one of west germany 's top bankers 30 years ago has become a campaign issue ahead of elections in the german city-state of bremen on may 13 . the case of susanne albrecht has added a new element to the political mudslinging dominated by disputes over family issues , calls for a minimum wage and education policies .
bremen , the smallest of germany 's 16 federal states with 490,000 eligible voters , has been governed for 12 years by an alliance of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , reflecting the make-up of chancellor angela merkel 's grand coalition in berlin .
but the two parties were at each other 's throats last week when it emerged that albrecht had been teaching german to migrant children at a bremen school for more than 10 years .
convicted murderer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : susanne albrecht , right , in a photo dated 1991 albrecht was sentenced to 12 years in prison in 1991 for her role in the july 1977 slaying of dresdner bank chief jürgen ponto in a botched kidnapping attempt by red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- terrorists .
paroled in 1996 after serving half her sentence , the now 56-year-old settled in bremen where she has been living under an assumed name and working as a language teacher .
" parents do n't want their children to be taught by raf terrorists , " said thomas röwekamp , the cdu leader who is vying with spd incumbent jens böhrnsen for the state 's top post of governing mayor .
former spd leader henning scherf dismissed röwekamp 's call for albrecht 's removal , saying she had turned her back on terrorism a long time ago and no longer posed a threat .
" such outrage is nothing but electioneering , " scherf said .
" shortly before the vote , an old issue is being dredged up again .
anyone surfing the internet can read that susanne albrecht is working as a teacher today . "
parents at the school where albrecht works recently issued a statement , saying they were outraged that albrecht 's past was being used as a campaign issue in the bremen elections .
albrecht " should continue her very successful work with the children of our school , " the statement said .
chasing the votes ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen ponto was murdered on 30 july 1977 latest opinion polls show the cdu trailing the spd by 28 percent to 40 per cent ahead of sunday 's vote for the 83-member bremen senate .
the spd , with its party color of red , has not made a pre-election commitment about which party it will govern with in future , leading to speculation it might favor an alliance with the greens , who are tipped to win 14 per cent of the vote .
" if there are enough votes for a red-green majority , they 'll go with that , " said lothar probst , a political researcher at the university of bremen .
" otherwise it 'll be a reluctant renewal of the previous coalition . "
the latter would suit merkel 's advisors , who are anxious to ensure that a result favoring the spd is not seen as a litmus test for the popularity of her 18-month-old coalition at national level .
a popularity contest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spd national chairman kurt beck spd national chairman kurt beck is hoping that a good showing by his party will shore up his own position in the light of a recent survey that put him well behind the chancellor in voter popularity .
beck , who marks one year in office the day after the bremen election , enjoys the support of only 38 percent of the electorate compared to 70 per cent for merkel , according to a poll conducted for the main ard television network last week .
at national level , the spd has seen its support drop to 27 per cent , compared to 34 per cent for merkel 's party , which has seized the initiative on a range of issues usually considered social democrat territory .
sensitive issues in the last elections four years ago voters in bremen 's adjacent port of bremerhaven elected a member of the extreme right-wing german people 's union -lrb- dvu -rrb- to the state parliament .
surveys expect a slight increase in the dvu 's share of the vote this time around .

the post is read , discussed and linked to by other bloggers and internet users throughout the turkish-speaking world . a graduate student in the us reads the blog , translates it into english and posts it onto another website . bloggers from bahrain to australia then link to the translated post adding their own links and comments along the way . through the reach of the global blogosphere , one person ’ s casual musings have become an international topic for a virtual conversation about democracy , religion and politics . " through a blog , a local issue can become a global one , " said sokari ekine , a nigerian who blogs about african women issues at blacklooks.org. one of the central ideas of globalization is that there is a growing interconnectedness between different societies as well as a greater desire to participate in a " world culture . " brought together by little more than an internet connection and a desire to converse , blogs -lrb- short for weblogs -rrb- have changed how local and global issues are discussed .
and along the way they have become a reflection of this interconnectedness and an increasingly globalized world . " today blogs can impact governments and mainstream media , " said ekine , " and the more people who start blogging will hopefully lead to greater change . " blogging by number just by sheer numbers , blogging is still a virtual phenomenon .
technorati , an online blog tracking site , just released a report stating that there are more than 71 million blogs being written all around the world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blogs started out as personal online diaries according to the report entitled " the state of the blogosphere " released this month , there are about 120,000 new weblogs created worldwide each day .
that works out to about 1.4 blogs every second with about 1.5 million postings per day . contrary to popular opinion , blogging is not an exclusively english endeavor .
of all the blogs tracked , japanese -lrb- 37 percent -rrb- just overtook english -lrb- 33 percent -rrb- as the most-blogged language .
at third place , chinese bloggers represent about three percent of the blogosphere while farsi edged into the top ten with about one percent . a tempered excitement among bloggers about the report was on display in comments on the technorati site .
commenting on the report , the center for citizen media blog summed up the feeling ; " there ’ s no question that blogs and other participatory sites have seen tremendous growth . " a global village ? a lot has changed in the more than 45 years since herbert marshall mcluhan first used the term " global village " to describe how electronic media has led to greater interconnectedness on a global scale . today " globalization " is the buzz word used to describe this phenomenon .
and while the term remains a divisive one , even the people who campaign against corporate globalization benefit from its processes .
" one of the most optimistic aspects of globalization is that anyone can go online and make a friend from anywhere around the world , " said ethan zuckerman who co-founded the site globalvoicesonline.org with rebecca mackinnon in 2004 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : who is reading your blog ?
from where ?
today the site calls itself a guide to the global blogosphere .
through a number of editors , the site posts summaries and excerpts of whatever topics are floating around the internet in regions of the world that are often ignored by the media . according to zuckerman , most bloggers write about and discuss local issues , especially in places like the middle east and africa . " when we feature a story on global voices , we are trying to open a local conversation to a global audience , " said zuckerman .
while he calls himself a " globalization junkie , " zuckerman also considers himself a realist . " there is this cyber-utopian illusion that we are all taking part of the same conversation .
we may all want to talk to each other and get a glimpse into other cultures but we are still all very different , " he said . no global language one of the greatest hurdles to a truly global conversation through blogs is language .
global voices and blacklooks both post mainly in english . markus beckedahl originally thought about writing a blog in english but decided against it because there were no german blogs at the time covering the political aspect of the information society . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what will the blogosphere look like in 10 or 20 years ?
" plus it is much easier to blog in your own language , " he said . so in 2004 he started the blog netzpolitik.org to enlighten germans on topics like open-source software and digital rights through education and activism . beckedahl believes that in 10 or 20 years translation software will allow bloggers from all over the world to communicate , no matter what language they blog in . using the german word " kulturtechnik " -lrb- loosely translates as " culture technique " -rrb- , beckedahl described blogs as a tool that can connect users , or peers to others all around the world often bridging both language and culture . " every person sitting in front of a computer is a peer and together they are creating the global digital society , " he said . ole tangen jr . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " every single person on earth is a global citizen " a journalist with a phd in economics , daniel altman blogs about globalization and its effects on everyday people from plant closures to nuclear energy to international development .

depending on whom you read , globalization is either praised for increasing global wealth or blamed for aggravating poverty .
it is a concept that is evolving almost on a daily basis , effecting global commerce and culture .
as a globe-trotting journalist with a phd in economics , daniel altman is very much caught between these two worlds .
in his blog “ managing globalization ” published by the international herald tribune , altman attempts to track , document and report on this ever-changing phenomenon all the while trying to enlighten his readers on how globalization affects them on a daily basis .
his new book " connected : 24 hours in the global economy " has just been published .
dw-world.de : since blogs started out as diaries , can someone really write a diary about our globalized world ?
where does one start ?
daniel altman : i think every single person on earth is a global citizen . we can hardly get out of bed without participating in world markets .
every time you use a car , bus , plane or anything made of plastic , you 're using oil . every time you use a credit card , you 're dipping into the world 's lending market . the prices of the things you buy and sell are determined by competition from around the globe . so yes , you can write a diary about our globalized world ; you need only write about your own life .
i am sure the looser format of a blog makes this task a little easier – or not ?
blogs have the flexibility needed to take on a wide variety of issues . the idea is often to get a discussion going without starting off at a very in-depth level . this way , we can find out which topics are most important to our readers .
is the fact that you are " blogging " about globalization actually a product of globalization itself ?
well , our audience is very international .
we 've received comments from english speakers on every continent except antarctica .
i do n't think blogging is a product of globalization , but the success of my blog definitely is .
is there a direct connection between the greater interconnectivity of cultures / people and the rise of globalization in industry ?
i 'm not sure how direct it is .
my book certainly makes the point that connectedness can create new opportunities for collaboration and productivity , though it can also create new risks .
cultural exchange is nothing new , though .
for a much earlier example , you only have to think about the traders on the old silk road .
if yes , which leads the other ?
where are the two heading ?
i think the two processes are inevitably intertwined . but if you want to know what is driving globalization so rapidly now , i would point to innovation and technology .
can we get even more connected ? we certainly can . we - and especially americans - are fairly unaware of things happening around the world that affect us . the message of my book is that by paying more attention to our connections to people , businesses and markets in other countries , we can take more control of our own economic future . ole tangen jr. interviewed daniel altman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de from africa to germany , blogs reflect a globalized world as the number of blogs around the world continues to climb , many blogs focusing on local issues are gaining a global audience in this hyper-connected media landscape .

bremen , the smallest of germany 's 16 federal states with 490,000 eligible voters , has been governed for 12 years by an alliance of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , reflecting the make-up of chancellor angela merkel 's grand coalition in berlin .
but the two parties were at each other 's throats last week when it emerged that albrecht had been teaching german to migrant children at a bremen school for more than 10 years .
convicted murderer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : susanne albrecht , right , in a photo dated 1991 albrecht was sentenced to 12 years in prison in 1991 for her role in the july 1977 slaying of dresdner bank chief jürgen ponto in a botched kidnapping attempt by red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- terrorists .

" parents do n't want their children to be taught by raf terrorists , " said thomas röwekamp , the cdu leader who is vying with spd incumbent jens böhrnsen for the state 's top post of governing mayor .
former spd leader henning scherf dismissed röwekamp 's call for albrecht 's removal , saying she had turned her back on terrorism a long time ago and no longer posed a threat .
" such outrage is nothing but electioneering , " scherf said .
" shortly before the vote , an old issue is being dredged up again .
anyone surfing the internet can read that susanne albrecht is working as a teacher today . "
parents at the school where albrecht works recently issued a statement , saying they were outraged that albrecht 's past was being used as a campaign issue in the bremen elections .
albrecht " should continue her very successful work with the children of our school , " the statement said .

the spd , with its party color of red , has not made a pre-election commitment about which party it will govern with in future , leading to speculation it might favor an alliance with the greens , who are tipped to win 14 per cent of the vote .
" if there are enough votes for a red-green majority , they 'll go with that , " said lothar probst , a political researcher at the university of bremen .
" otherwise it 'll be a reluctant renewal of the previous coalition . "
the latter would suit merkel 's advisors , who are anxious to ensure that a result favoring the spd is not seen as a litmus test for the popularity of her 18-month-old coalition at national level .

beck , who marks one year in office the day after the bremen election , enjoys the support of only 38 percent of the electorate compared to 70 per cent for merkel , according to a poll conducted for the main ard television network last week .

that may be but with so many permutations of results contributing to either glory or shame this year , some are rapidly doing the math . with the club 's first german title in 49 years in sight , schalke 04 fans are taking every opportunity to watch a potential new chapter of their team 's history being written .
the league leaders take on bitter local rivals borussia dortmund on saturday with two matches to go in one of the tightest championship races in years , and have decided to open up their 75,000-seater veltins arena for those supporters unable to get to dortmund for the match .
schalke lead the table by one point from vfb stuttgart and two from werder bremen , and the difficult away game against bvb could be a deciding factor in the destination of the championship shield .
the club announced earlier this week that it would be showing saturday 's game live in its home stadium to give their fans a chance to see the game .
fans would have to pay a six-euro entry fee , but would receive a four-euro food or drink voucher .
one of the reasons why the stadium will be opened is to prevent tens of thousands of fans of traveling to dortmund for a match that is already considered a security risk with 18,000 schalke fans expected to be at the game at signal iduna park .
schalke officials are thus attempting to downplay expectations ahead of the match .

" it is in our interest and it is our responsibility to allow europe to act in the face of the challenges that confront us , " merkel said at an informal meeting of a handful of european union leaders in sintra , west of lisbon .
" germany alone can not bring all these issues to their successful conclusion , " merkel , whose country holds the eu 's rotating six-month presidency , told journalists .
" but i trust that i have the support of my colleagues here , who will continue to show commitment to our course , to setting europe on the right track and the right foundation . "
mulling the bloc 's future the meeting also included european commission president jose manuel barroso and the leaders of portugal and slovenia , which will each respectively assume the six-month presidency role after germany .
european parliament president hans gert pöttering attended as well .
the session was called to mull the 27-member bloc 's future but had no formal agenda or conclusions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are there any solutions in there ?
merkel with barroso earlier this year barroso also pushed for an agreement on the constitution , which has been in limbo since french and dutch voters said no to a draft treaty in 2005 referenda .
18 other countries have ratified the text .
advocates of the treaty say it is essential to streamline decision-making in the 27-nation bloc .
a new , slimmed-down charter is expected to cover only key reforms such as a long-term president , a foreign minister , and a simpler voting system based more on population size .
portugal in favor of referendum " naturally , what we want is that at the june meeting a consensus is reached so that it is clear what the roadmap is so that europe can adopt a institutional treaty as soon as possible , " portuguese prime minister jose socrates said .
portugal never ratified the treaty and socrates has said he wants to hold a referendum on any new constitution , which would make portugal one of only a few states considering such a move .
barroso said the leaders had discussed in " great detail the way forward for the treaty settlement and we hope that by the end of june , under the chairmanship of mrs. merkel , we will have progress on that matter . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president elect sarkozy wants a mini-treaty for the eu french president-elect nicolas sarkozy has proposed a so-called mini-treaty for the eu .
after meeting with sarkozy on friday , outgoing british prime minister tony blair said he agreed with the idea of developing a simplified constitution .
" it 's not about a mini-treaty or a maxi-treaty , but a treaty that makes europe capable of acting to shape globalization in function of its values , " barroso said .
" we need these presidencies to work together in a real team spirit , to assure the continuity of the direction of the european union , " barroso said .
merkel aware of pitfalls merkel said she was " perfectly aware " of the difficulty in reaching agreements in the past , but added that " my role , as president , is to find the right equilibrium between all those interests . "
she has made reviving the constitutional project a priority of germany 's eu presidency .

that may be but with so many permutations of results contributing to either glory or shame this year , some are rapidly doing the math . with the club 's first german title in 49 years in sight , schalke 04 fans are taking every opportunity to watch a potential new chapter of their team 's history being written .
the league leaders take on bitter local rivals borussia dortmund on saturday with two matches to go in one of the tightest championship races in years , and have decided to open up their 75,000-seater veltins arena for those supporters unable to get to dortmund for the match .
schalke lead the table by one point from vfb stuttgart and two from werder bremen , and the difficult away game against bvb could be a deciding factor in the destination of the championship shield .
the club announced earlier this week that it would be showing saturday 's game live in its home stadium to give their fans a chance to see the game .
fans would have to pay a six-euro entry fee , but would receive a four-euro food or drink voucher .
one of the reasons why the stadium will be opened is to prevent tens of thousands of fans of traveling to dortmund for a match that is already considered a security risk with 18,000 schalke fans expected to be at the game at signal iduna park .
schalke officials are thus attempting to downplay expectations ahead of the match .
" we are expecting the championship to only be decided on the final day , " gerd voss said .

but if all three teams win and the league goes to the wire , schalke still have a great chance with a final game at home against bielefeld .
dortmund , who have scrambled to safety from relegation under coach thomas doll , have only a mathematical chance of getting into the uefa cup places but will be playing for regional pride on saturday in one of the league 's fiercely contested derby games .
winning against schalke and throwing a massive spanner into the works of their title challenge will be all the incentive doll 's players need .

" it is in our interest and it is our responsibility to allow europe to act in the face of the challenges that confront us , " merkel said at an informal meeting of a handful of european union leaders in sintra , west of lisbon .
" germany alone can not bring all these issues to their successful conclusion , " merkel , whose country holds the eu 's rotating six-month presidency , told journalists .
" but i trust that i have the support of my colleagues here , who will continue to show commitment to our course , to setting europe on the right track and the right foundation . "
mulling the bloc 's future the meeting also included european commission president jose manuel barroso and the leaders of portugal and slovenia , which will each respectively assume the six-month presidency role after germany .
european parliament president hans gert pöttering attended as well .
the session was called to mull the 27-member bloc 's future but had no formal agenda or conclusions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are there any solutions in there ?
merkel with barroso earlier this year barroso also pushed for an agreement on the constitution , which has been in limbo since french and dutch voters said no to a draft treaty in 2005 referenda .
18 other countries have ratified the text .
advocates of the treaty say it is essential to streamline decision-making in the 27-nation bloc .
a new , slimmed-down charter is expected to cover only key reforms such as a long-term president , a foreign minister , and a simpler voting system based more on population size .
portugal in favor of referendum " naturally , what we want is that at the june meeting a consensus is reached so that it is clear what the roadmap is so that europe can adopt a institutional treaty as soon as possible , " portuguese prime minister jose socrates said .
portugal never ratified the treaty and socrates has said he wants to hold a referendum on any new constitution , which would make portugal one of only a few states considering such a move .
barroso said the leaders had discussed in " great detail the way forward for the treaty settlement and we hope that by the end of june , under the chairmanship of mrs. merkel , we will have progress on that matter . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president elect sarkozy wants a mini-treaty for the eu french president-elect nicolas sarkozy has proposed a so-called mini-treaty for the eu .
after meeting with sarkozy on friday , outgoing british prime minister tony blair said he agreed with the idea of developing a simplified constitution .
" it 's not about a mini-treaty or a maxi-treaty , but a treaty that makes europe capable of acting to shape globalization in function of its values , " barroso said .
" we need these presidencies to work together in a real team spirit , to assure the continuity of the direction of the european union , " barroso said .
merkel aware of pitfalls merkel said she was " perfectly aware " of the difficulty in reaching agreements in the past , but added that " my role , as president , is to find the right equilibrium between all those interests . "
she has made reviving the constitutional project a priority of germany 's eu presidency .

" it is in our interest and it is our responsibility to allow europe to act in the face of the challenges that confront us , " merkel said at an informal meeting of a handful of european union leaders in sintra , west of lisbon .
" germany alone can not bring all these issues to their successful conclusion , " merkel , whose country holds the eu 's rotating six-month presidency , told journalists .
" but i trust that i have the support of my colleagues here , who will continue to show commitment to our course , to setting europe on the right track and the right foundation . "
mulling the bloc 's future the meeting also included european commission president jose manuel barroso and the leaders of portugal and slovenia , which will each respectively assume the six-month presidency role after germany .
european parliament president hans gert pöttering attended as well .
the session was called to mull the 27-member bloc 's future but had no formal agenda or conclusions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are there any solutions in there ?
merkel with barroso earlier this year barroso also pushed for an agreement on the constitution , which has been in limbo since french and dutch voters said no to a draft treaty in 2005 referenda .
18 other countries have ratified the text .
advocates of the treaty say it is essential to streamline decision-making in the 27-nation bloc .
a new , slimmed-down charter is expected to cover only key reforms such as a long-term president , a foreign minister , and a simpler voting system based more on population size .
portugal in favor of referendum " naturally , what we want is that at the june meeting a consensus is reached so that it is clear what the roadmap is so that europe can adopt a institutional treaty as soon as possible , " portuguese prime minister jose socrates said .
portugal never ratified the treaty and socrates has said he wants to hold a referendum on any new constitution , which would make portugal one of only a few states considering such a move .
barroso said the leaders had discussed in " great detail the way forward for the treaty settlement and we hope that by the end of june , under the chairmanship of mrs. merkel , we will have progress on that matter . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president elect sarkozy wants a mini-treaty for the eu french president-elect nicolas sarkozy has proposed a so-called mini-treaty for the eu .
after meeting with sarkozy on friday , outgoing british prime minister tony blair said he agreed with the idea of developing a simplified constitution .
" it 's not about a mini-treaty or a maxi-treaty , but a treaty that makes europe capable of acting to shape globalization in function of its values , " barroso said .
" we need these presidencies to work together in a real team spirit , to assure the continuity of the direction of the european union , " barroso said .
merkel aware of pitfalls merkel said she was " perfectly aware " of the difficulty in reaching agreements in the past , but added that " my role , as president , is to find the right equilibrium between all those interests . "
she has made reviving the constitutional project a priority of germany 's eu presidency .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 12.05.2007 ex-terrorist becomes an issue in german state poll großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- was responsible for numerous terrorist attacks in germany a former terrorist convicted in the murder of one of west germany 's top bankers 30 years ago has become a campaign issue ahead of elections in the german city-state of bremen on may 13 . the case of susanne albrecht has added a new element to the political mudslinging dominated by disputes over family issues , calls for a minimum wage and education policies .
bremen , the smallest of germany 's 16 federal states with 490,000 eligible voters , has been governed for 12 years by an alliance of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , reflecting the make-up of chancellor angela merkel 's grand coalition in berlin .
but the two parties were at each other 's throats last week when it emerged that albrecht had been teaching german to migrant children at a bremen school for more than 10 years .
convicted murderer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : susanne albrecht , right , in a photo dated 1991 albrecht was sentenced to 12 years in prison in 1991 for her role in the july 1977 slaying of dresdner bank chief jürgen ponto in a botched kidnapping attempt by red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- terrorists .
paroled in 1996 after serving half her sentence , the now 56-year-old settled in bremen where she has been living under an assumed name and working as a language teacher .
" parents do n't want their children to be taught by raf terrorists , " said thomas röwekamp , the cdu leader who is vying with spd incumbent jens böhrnsen for the state 's top post of governing mayor .
former spd leader henning scherf dismissed röwekamp 's call for albrecht 's removal , saying she had turned her back on terrorism a long time ago and no longer posed a threat .
" such outrage is nothing but electioneering , " scherf said .
" shortly before the vote , an old issue is being dredged up again .
anyone surfing the internet can read that susanne albrecht is working as a teacher today . "
parents at the school where albrecht works recently issued a statement , saying they were outraged that albrecht 's past was being used as a campaign issue in the bremen elections .
albrecht " should continue her very successful work with the children of our school , " the statement said .
chasing the votes ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen ponto was murdered on 30 july 1977 latest opinion polls show the cdu trailing the spd by 28 percent to 40 per cent ahead of sunday 's vote for the 83-member bremen senate .
the spd , with its party color of red , has not made a pre-election commitment about which party it will govern with in future , leading to speculation it might favor an alliance with the greens , who are tipped to win 14 per cent of the vote .
" if there are enough votes for a red-green majority , they 'll go with that , " said lothar probst , a political researcher at the university of bremen .
" otherwise it 'll be a reluctant renewal of the previous coalition . "
the latter would suit merkel 's advisors , who are anxious to ensure that a result favoring the spd is not seen as a litmus test for the popularity of her 18-month-old coalition at national level .
a popularity contest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spd national chairman kurt beck spd national chairman kurt beck is hoping that a good showing by his party will shore up his own position in the light of a recent survey that put him well behind the chancellor in voter popularity .
beck , who marks one year in office the day after the bremen election , enjoys the support of only 38 percent of the electorate compared to 70 per cent for merkel , according to a poll conducted for the main ard television network last week .
at national level , the spd has seen its support drop to 27 per cent , compared to 34 per cent for merkel 's party , which has seized the initiative on a range of issues usually considered social democrat territory .
sensitive issues in the last elections four years ago voters in bremen 's adjacent port of bremerhaven elected a member of the extreme right-wing german people 's union -lrb- dvu -rrb- to the state parliament .
surveys expect a slight increase in the dvu 's share of the vote this time around .
the northern state , with an unemployment rate of 13.1 percent , one of the highest in germany , is also plagued by a high rate of youth crime and child poverty .
the state 's justice affairs senator resigned last october after the body of a two-year-old boy in the care of her department was found stuffed in the refrigerator of his drug-addict father .
the case , which infuriated germans , led to calls for an early warning system to assist children suffering neglect or abuse . dw staff / dpa -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel intervenes in raf clemency row chancellor angela merkel intervened in the escalating row over german president horst köhler 's meeting with former raf terrorist christian klar .

dw-world.de : since blogs started out as diaries , can someone really write a diary about our globalized world ?
where does one start ?
daniel altman : i think every single person on earth is a global citizen . we can hardly get out of bed without participating in world markets .
every time you use a car , bus , plane or anything made of plastic , you 're using oil . every time you use a credit card , you 're dipping into the world 's lending market . the prices of the things you buy and sell are determined by competition from around the globe . so yes , you can write a diary about our globalized world ; you need only write about your own life .
i am sure the looser format of a blog makes this task a little easier – or not ?
blogs have the flexibility needed to take on a wide variety of issues . the idea is often to get a discussion going without starting off at a very in-depth level . this way , we can find out which topics are most important to our readers .

well , our audience is very international .
we 've received comments from english speakers on every continent except antarctica .
i do n't think blogging is a product of globalization , but the success of my blog definitely is .
is there a direct connection between the greater interconnectivity of cultures / people and the rise of globalization in industry ?
i 'm not sure how direct it is .
my book certainly makes the point that connectedness can create new opportunities for collaboration and productivity , though it can also create new risks .
cultural exchange is nothing new , though .

if yes , which leads the other ?
where are the two heading ?
i think the two processes are inevitably intertwined . but if you want to know what is driving globalization so rapidly now , i would point to innovation and technology .
can we get even more connected ? we certainly can . we - and especially americans - are fairly unaware of things happening around the world that affect us . the message of my book is that by paying more attention to our connections to people , businesses and markets in other countries , we can take more control of our own economic future . ole tangen jr. interviewed daniel altman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de from africa to germany , blogs reflect a globalized world as the number of blogs around the world continues to climb , many blogs focusing on local issues are gaining a global audience in this hyper-connected media landscape .

bremen , the smallest of germany 's 16 federal states with 490,000 eligible voters , has been governed for 12 years by an alliance of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , reflecting the make-up of chancellor angela merkel 's grand coalition in berlin .
but the two parties were at each other 's throats last week when it emerged that albrecht had been teaching german to migrant children at a bremen school for more than 10 years .
convicted murderer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : susanne albrecht , right , in a photo dated 1991 albrecht was sentenced to 12 years in prison in 1991 for her role in the july 1977 slaying of dresdner bank chief jürgen ponto in a botched kidnapping attempt by red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- terrorists .
paroled in 1996 after serving half her sentence , the now 56-year-old settled in bremen where she has been living under an assumed name and working as a language teacher .
" parents do n't want their children to be taught by raf terrorists , " said thomas röwekamp , the cdu leader who is vying with spd incumbent jens böhrnsen for the state 's top post of governing mayor .
former spd leader henning scherf dismissed röwekamp 's call for albrecht 's removal , saying she had turned her back on terrorism a long time ago and no longer posed a threat .
" such outrage is nothing but electioneering , " scherf said .
" shortly before the vote , an old issue is being dredged up again .
anyone surfing the internet can read that susanne albrecht is working as a teacher today . "
parents at the school where albrecht works recently issued a statement , saying they were outraged that albrecht 's past was being used as a campaign issue in the bremen elections .
albrecht " should continue her very successful work with the children of our school , " the statement said .
chasing the votes ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen ponto was murdered on 30 july 1977 latest opinion polls show the cdu trailing the spd by 28 percent to 40 per cent ahead of sunday 's vote for the 83-member bremen senate .
the spd , with its party color of red , has not made a pre-election commitment about which party it will govern with in future , leading to speculation it might favor an alliance with the greens , who are tipped to win 14 per cent of the vote .
" if there are enough votes for a red-green majority , they 'll go with that , " said lothar probst , a political researcher at the university of bremen .
" otherwise it 'll be a reluctant renewal of the previous coalition . "
the latter would suit merkel 's advisors , who are anxious to ensure that a result favoring the spd is not seen as a litmus test for the popularity of her 18-month-old coalition at national level .
a popularity contest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spd national chairman kurt beck spd national chairman kurt beck is hoping that a good showing by his party will shore up his own position in the light of a recent survey that put him well behind the chancellor in voter popularity .
beck , who marks one year in office the day after the bremen election , enjoys the support of only 38 percent of the electorate compared to 70 per cent for merkel , according to a poll conducted for the main ard television network last week .
at national level , the spd has seen its support drop to 27 per cent , compared to 34 per cent for merkel 's party , which has seized the initiative on a range of issues usually considered social democrat territory .
sensitive issues in the last elections four years ago voters in bremen 's adjacent port of bremerhaven elected a member of the extreme right-wing german people 's union -lrb- dvu -rrb- to the state parliament .
surveys expect a slight increase in the dvu 's share of the vote this time around .
the northern state , with an unemployment rate of 13.1 percent , one of the highest in germany , is also plagued by a high rate of youth crime and child poverty .
the state 's justice affairs senator resigned last october after the body of a two-year-old boy in the care of her department was found stuffed in the refrigerator of his drug-addict father .
the case , which infuriated germans , led to calls for an early warning system to assist children suffering neglect or abuse . dw staff / dpa -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel intervenes in raf clemency row chancellor angela merkel intervened in the escalating row over german president horst köhler 's meeting with former raf terrorist christian klar .

" it is in our interest and it is our responsibility to allow europe to act in the face of the challenges that confront us , " merkel said at an informal meeting of a handful of european union leaders in sintra , west of lisbon .
" germany alone can not bring all these issues to their successful conclusion , " merkel , whose country holds the eu 's rotating six-month presidency , told journalists .
" but i trust that i have the support of my colleagues here , who will continue to show commitment to our course , to setting europe on the right track and the right foundation . "

portugal in favor of referendum " naturally , what we want is that at the june meeting a consensus is reached so that it is clear what the roadmap is so that europe can adopt a institutional treaty as soon as possible , " portuguese prime minister jose socrates said .

the federal government 's predicted fiscal surplus , or excess of tax revenue over expenditure , is expected to amount to 87 billion euros by that date .
the rest of the stated figure is made up of the expected surpluses of the country 's 16 regional states and social security services .
the projected figure for 2011 represents the biggest tax revenue surplus since the federal republic of germany was founded in 1949 .
germany economy revs up it also provides the latest proof that germany is reaping the benefits of limited but unpopular labor market reforms that began to take effect under the former government of chancellor gerhard schröder .
the projection confirms that the german economy , the biggest in the eurozone , is recovering fast and regaining its position as the driver of european union growth .
from 2002 to 2005 , germany exceeded european union rules that it helped to draw up and which obliged governments to keep their budget shortfalls below 3.0 percent of gross domestic product .
but after years of lethargic progress , germany 's economic momentum increased sharply and its deficit shrank to 1.7 percent of gdp last year .
and the government is hoping to cut the ratio further to 1.2 percent in 2007 .
differences over how best to use surplus the left-right coalition government in berlin appears divided on how best to use the tax surplus .
economy minister michael glos , a member of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats , favors tax cuts but finance minister peer steinbrück , a social democrat , is opposed to such a step .
steinbrück would prefer to use the surplus to balance the german budget and reduce the national debt .
" this is a historic development , we can at last begin to reduce the mountain of debt that has accumulated and which stands at more than 1,500 billion euros , " steinbrück said .
in the meanwhile , several other ministers are calling for the surplus to be used to fund projects in their portfolios .
steinbrück gave assurances that the government planned to invest two billion euros a year in key areas such as " education and research , the family , environmental protection , infrastructure , development aid and internal security . "
in a breakdown given by the ministry , the total fiscal surplus is forecast at 20.3 billion in 2007 euros and at 47.9 billion euros next year . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu says german deficit sinking fast the european commission said germany 's efforts to clean up its financial house are paying off , with the country expected to pare its budget deficit down to three percent of gross domestic product in 2008 .

the post is read , discussed and linked to by other bloggers and internet users throughout the turkish-speaking world . a graduate student in the us reads the blog , translates it into english and posts it onto another website . bloggers from bahrain to australia then link to the translated post adding their own links and comments along the way . through the reach of the global blogosphere , one person ’ s casual musings have become an international topic for a virtual conversation about democracy , religion and politics . " through a blog , a local issue can become a global one , " said sokari ekine , a nigerian who blogs about african women issues at blacklooks.org. one of the central ideas of globalization is that there is a growing interconnectedness between different societies as well as a greater desire to participate in a " world culture . " brought together by little more than an internet connection and a desire to converse , blogs -lrb- short for weblogs -rrb- have changed how local and global issues are discussed .
and along the way they have become a reflection of this interconnectedness and an increasingly globalized world . " today blogs can impact governments and mainstream media , " said ekine , " and the more people who start blogging will hopefully lead to greater change . " blogging by number just by sheer numbers , blogging is still a virtual phenomenon .
technorati , an online blog tracking site , just released a report stating that there are more than 71 million blogs being written all around the world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blogs started out as personal online diaries according to the report entitled " the state of the blogosphere " released this month , there are about 120,000 new weblogs created worldwide each day .
that works out to about 1.4 blogs every second with about 1.5 million postings per day . contrary to popular opinion , blogging is not an exclusively english endeavor .
of all the blogs tracked , japanese -lrb- 37 percent -rrb- just overtook english -lrb- 33 percent -rrb- as the most-blogged language .
at third place , chinese bloggers represent about three percent of the blogosphere while farsi edged into the top ten with about one percent . a tempered excitement among bloggers about the report was on display in comments on the technorati site .
commenting on the report , the center for citizen media blog summed up the feeling ; " there ’ s no question that blogs and other participatory sites have seen tremendous growth . " a global village ? a lot has changed in the more than 45 years since herbert marshall mcluhan first used the term " global village " to describe how electronic media has led to greater interconnectedness on a global scale . today " globalization " is the buzz word used to describe this phenomenon .
and while the term remains a divisive one , even the people who campaign against corporate globalization benefit from its processes .
" one of the most optimistic aspects of globalization is that anyone can go online and make a friend from anywhere around the world , " said ethan zuckerman who co-founded the site globalvoicesonline.org with rebecca mackinnon in 2004 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : who is reading your blog ?
from where ?
today the site calls itself a guide to the global blogosphere .
through a number of editors , the site posts summaries and excerpts of whatever topics are floating around the internet in regions of the world that are often ignored by the media . according to zuckerman , most bloggers write about and discuss local issues , especially in places like the middle east and africa . " when we feature a story on global voices , we are trying to open a local conversation to a global audience , " said zuckerman .
while he calls himself a " globalization junkie , " zuckerman also considers himself a realist . " there is this cyber-utopian illusion that we are all taking part of the same conversation .
we may all want to talk to each other and get a glimpse into other cultures but we are still all very different , " he said . no global language one of the greatest hurdles to a truly global conversation through blogs is language .
global voices and blacklooks both post mainly in english . markus beckedahl originally thought about writing a blog in english but decided against it because there were no german blogs at the time covering the political aspect of the information society . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what will the blogosphere look like in 10 or 20 years ?
" plus it is much easier to blog in your own language , " he said . so in 2004 he started the blog netzpolitik.org to enlighten germans on topics like open-source software and digital rights through education and activism . beckedahl believes that in 10 or 20 years translation software will allow bloggers from all over the world to communicate , no matter what language they blog in . using the german word " kulturtechnik " -lrb- loosely translates as " culture technique " -rrb- , beckedahl described blogs as a tool that can connect users , or peers to others all around the world often bridging both language and culture . " every person sitting in front of a computer is a peer and together they are creating the global digital society , " he said . ole tangen jr . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " every single person on earth is a global citizen " a journalist with a phd in economics , daniel altman blogs about globalization and its effects on everyday people from plant closures to nuclear energy to international development .

that may be but with so many permutations of results contributing to either glory or shame this year , some are rapidly doing the math . with the club 's first german title in 49 years in sight , schalke 04 fans are taking every opportunity to watch a potential new chapter of their team 's history being written .
the league leaders take on bitter local rivals borussia dortmund on saturday with two matches to go in one of the tightest championship races in years , and have decided to open up their 75,000-seater veltins arena for those supporters unable to get to dortmund for the match .
schalke lead the table by one point from vfb stuttgart and two from werder bremen , and the difficult away game against bvb could be a deciding factor in the destination of the championship shield .
the club announced earlier this week that it would be showing saturday 's game live in its home stadium to give their fans a chance to see the game .
fans would have to pay a six-euro entry fee , but would receive a four-euro food or drink voucher .
one of the reasons why the stadium will be opened is to prevent tens of thousands of fans of traveling to dortmund for a match that is already considered a security risk with 18,000 schalke fans expected to be at the game at signal iduna park .
schalke officials are thus attempting to downplay expectations ahead of the match .
" we are expecting the championship to only be decided on the final day , " gerd voss said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there will be no love lost between schalke and bvb however , with rivals bremen and stuttgart also facing tricky games at the weekend , a win at dortmund for schalke and defeats at frankfurt for werder and bochum for vfb could hand the title to the royal blues on saturday .
but if all three teams win and the league goes to the wire , schalke still have a great chance with a final game at home against bielefeld .
dortmund , who have scrambled to safety from relegation under coach thomas doll , have only a mathematical chance of getting into the uefa cup places but will be playing for regional pride on saturday in one of the league 's fiercely contested derby games .
winning against schalke and throwing a massive spanner into the works of their title challenge will be all the incentive doll 's players need .
frings , klose boost resurgent bremen one former dortmund star will also be urging his old team to win will be bremen 's torsten frings .
the diminutive midfielder will be hoping bvb trip schalke up and pave the way for a recovering werder to snatch the title on the last day .
frings , who was a bundesliga runner-up with dortmund in 2003 , hopes to add a league winners ' medal with bremen to the one he secured with bayern munich in 2005 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frings will strut his stuff for bremen until at least 2011 werder will face eintracht frankfurt at the weserstadion buoyed by a recent return to form after crashing out of the uefa cup semi-finals and the news that frings has committed himself to the club until 2011 .
the midfielder announced wednesday that he would not be leaving for juventus turin in the summer as previously expected .
his contract renewal came a week after striker miroslav klose said he will not the leave the club either and will fulfill his contract until 2008 .
frankfurt , dumped out of the semi-finals of the dfb cup by nuremberg last month , are four points above the drop-zone and a victory against bremen would guarantee their top league status for another season .
however , bremen slammed six past them in the commerzbank arena in december and with werder beginning to find their feet again , the frankfurters could be in for a torrid time .
stuttgart wary of battling bochum second-place stuttgart will be wary of resurgent bochum who flirted with relegation for most of the season only to come alive at the end to claim the scalps of schalke , bayer leverkusen and hamburg .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bochum have already proved a problem for schalke the 2-1 defeat of schalke two weeks ago and last week ’ s 3-0 mauling of hsv should provide armin veh 's championship hopefuls with plenty of food for thought .
bochum could still mount a late challenge for a european place but will have to add stuttgart to their list of conquests and hope everyone else above them lose their last two games .
fourth-placed bayern munich , out of the champions league places but safely in the uefa cup next season , travel to energie cottbus .
the eastern german side are safe from the drop and have had a mixed bag of results of late with wins against leverkusen , wolfsburg and frankfurt offset by losses to hanover and schalke .
cottbus will want more breathing space from the basement despite being secure and robbing the deposed champions of bayern in the process would definitely be an added bonus .
leverkusen , hanover tussle for uefa cup place dfb cup finalists nuremberg will be hoping to put the skids under hamburg 's revival with bayer leverkusen breathing down their necks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leverkusen could have a uefa cup place to celebrate nuremberg already have a uefa cup slot as fellow finalists stuttgart will finish in the champions league places but with hanover close behind , leverkusen will want to snatch fifth place from nuremberg to make sure of european soccer next season .
bayer have 45 points while hanover are on 44 and the fight for europe could go to the last game of the season .
leverkusen play hertha berlin saturday while hanover are away to arminia bielefeld .
coaches tackle relegation arithmetic while opponents borussia mönchengladbach are already down , mainz are still in the relegation dogfight .
with six points going begging in the next fortnight , a win over bottom club gladbach on saturday and a final day victory over bayern munich could see jürgen klopp 's team survive .
klopp will have one eye on the aachen – wolfsburg game on saturday , knowing that a draw between the two clubs above his would set up a dramatic finale .
if wolfsburg win , it could be curtains for mainz as the wolves would drag themselves to near safety on 39 points .

that may be but with so many permutations of results contributing to either glory or shame this year , some are rapidly doing the math . with the club 's first german title in 49 years in sight , schalke 04 fans are taking every opportunity to watch a potential new chapter of their team 's history being written .
the league leaders take on bitter local rivals borussia dortmund on saturday with two matches to go in one of the tightest championship races in years , and have decided to open up their 75,000-seater veltins arena for those supporters unable to get to dortmund for the match .
schalke lead the table by one point from vfb stuttgart and two from werder bremen , and the difficult away game against bvb could be a deciding factor in the destination of the championship shield .
the club announced earlier this week that it would be showing saturday 's game live in its home stadium to give their fans a chance to see the game .
fans would have to pay a six-euro entry fee , but would receive a four-euro food or drink voucher .
one of the reasons why the stadium will be opened is to prevent tens of thousands of fans of traveling to dortmund for a match that is already considered a security risk with 18,000 schalke fans expected to be at the game at signal iduna park .
schalke officials are thus attempting to downplay expectations ahead of the match .
" we are expecting the championship to only be decided on the final day , " gerd voss said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there will be no love lost between schalke and bvb however , with rivals bremen and stuttgart also facing tricky games at the weekend , a win at dortmund for schalke and defeats at frankfurt for werder and bochum for vfb could hand the title to the royal blues on saturday .
but if all three teams win and the league goes to the wire , schalke still have a great chance with a final game at home against bielefeld .
dortmund , who have scrambled to safety from relegation under coach thomas doll , have only a mathematical chance of getting into the uefa cup places but will be playing for regional pride on saturday in one of the league 's fiercely contested derby games .
winning against schalke and throwing a massive spanner into the works of their title challenge will be all the incentive doll 's players need .
frings , klose boost resurgent bremen one former dortmund star will also be urging his old team to win will be bremen 's torsten frings .
the diminutive midfielder will be hoping bvb trip schalke up and pave the way for a recovering werder to snatch the title on the last day .
frings , who was a bundesliga runner-up with dortmund in 2003 , hopes to add a league winners ' medal with bremen to the one he secured with bayern munich in 2005 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frings will strut his stuff for bremen until at least 2011 werder will face eintracht frankfurt at the weserstadion buoyed by a recent return to form after crashing out of the uefa cup semi-finals and the news that frings has committed himself to the club until 2011 .
the midfielder announced wednesday that he would not be leaving for juventus turin in the summer as previously expected .
his contract renewal came a week after striker miroslav klose said he will not the leave the club either and will fulfill his contract until 2008 .
frankfurt , dumped out of the semi-finals of the dfb cup by nuremberg last month , are four points above the drop-zone and a victory against bremen would guarantee their top league status for another season .
however , bremen slammed six past them in the commerzbank arena in december and with werder beginning to find their feet again , the frankfurters could be in for a torrid time .
stuttgart wary of battling bochum second-place stuttgart will be wary of resurgent bochum who flirted with relegation for most of the season only to come alive at the end to claim the scalps of schalke , bayer leverkusen and hamburg .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bochum have already proved a problem for schalke the 2-1 defeat of schalke two weeks ago and last week ’ s 3-0 mauling of hsv should provide armin veh 's championship hopefuls with plenty of food for thought .
bochum could still mount a late challenge for a european place but will have to add stuttgart to their list of conquests and hope everyone else above them lose their last two games .
fourth-placed bayern munich , out of the champions league places but safely in the uefa cup next season , travel to energie cottbus .
the eastern german side are safe from the drop and have had a mixed bag of results of late with wins against leverkusen , wolfsburg and frankfurt offset by losses to hanover and schalke .
cottbus will want more breathing space from the basement despite being secure and robbing the deposed champions of bayern in the process would definitely be an added bonus .
leverkusen , hanover tussle for uefa cup place dfb cup finalists nuremberg will be hoping to put the skids under hamburg 's revival with bayer leverkusen breathing down their necks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leverkusen could have a uefa cup place to celebrate nuremberg already have a uefa cup slot as fellow finalists stuttgart will finish in the champions league places but with hanover close behind , leverkusen will want to snatch fifth place from nuremberg to make sure of european soccer next season .
bayer have 45 points while hanover are on 44 and the fight for europe could go to the last game of the season .
leverkusen play hertha berlin saturday while hanover are away to arminia bielefeld .
coaches tackle relegation arithmetic while opponents borussia mönchengladbach are already down , mainz are still in the relegation dogfight .
with six points going begging in the next fortnight , a win over bottom club gladbach on saturday and a final day victory over bayern munich could see jürgen klopp 's team survive .
klopp will have one eye on the aachen – wolfsburg game on saturday , knowing that a draw between the two clubs above his would set up a dramatic finale .
if wolfsburg win , it could be curtains for mainz as the wolves would drag themselves to near safety on 39 points .

that may be but with so many permutations of results contributing to either glory or shame this year , some are rapidly doing the math . with the club 's first german title in 49 years in sight , schalke 04 fans are taking every opportunity to watch a potential new chapter of their team 's history being written .
the league leaders take on bitter local rivals borussia dortmund on saturday with two matches to go in one of the tightest championship races in years , and have decided to open up their 75,000-seater veltins arena for those supporters unable to get to dortmund for the match .
schalke lead the table by one point from vfb stuttgart and two from werder bremen , and the difficult away game against bvb could be a deciding factor in the destination of the championship shield .
the club announced earlier this week that it would be showing saturday 's game live in its home stadium to give their fans a chance to see the game .
fans would have to pay a six-euro entry fee , but would receive a four-euro food or drink voucher .
one of the reasons why the stadium will be opened is to prevent tens of thousands of fans of traveling to dortmund for a match that is already considered a security risk with 18,000 schalke fans expected to be at the game at signal iduna park .
schalke officials are thus attempting to downplay expectations ahead of the match .
" we are expecting the championship to only be decided on the final day , " gerd voss said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there will be no love lost between schalke and bvb however , with rivals bremen and stuttgart also facing tricky games at the weekend , a win at dortmund for schalke and defeats at frankfurt for werder and bochum for vfb could hand the title to the royal blues on saturday .
but if all three teams win and the league goes to the wire , schalke still have a great chance with a final game at home against bielefeld .
dortmund , who have scrambled to safety from relegation under coach thomas doll , have only a mathematical chance of getting into the uefa cup places but will be playing for regional pride on saturday in one of the league 's fiercely contested derby games .
winning against schalke and throwing a massive spanner into the works of their title challenge will be all the incentive doll 's players need .
frings , klose boost resurgent bremen one former dortmund star will also be urging his old team to win will be bremen 's torsten frings .
the diminutive midfielder will be hoping bvb trip schalke up and pave the way for a recovering werder to snatch the title on the last day .
frings , who was a bundesliga runner-up with dortmund in 2003 , hopes to add a league winners ' medal with bremen to the one he secured with bayern munich in 2005 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frings will strut his stuff for bremen until at least 2011 werder will face eintracht frankfurt at the weserstadion buoyed by a recent return to form after crashing out of the uefa cup semi-finals and the news that frings has committed himself to the club until 2011 .
the midfielder announced wednesday that he would not be leaving for juventus turin in the summer as previously expected .
his contract renewal came a week after striker miroslav klose said he will not the leave the club either and will fulfill his contract until 2008 .
frankfurt , dumped out of the semi-finals of the dfb cup by nuremberg last month , are four points above the drop-zone and a victory against bremen would guarantee their top league status for another season .
however , bremen slammed six past them in the commerzbank arena in december and with werder beginning to find their feet again , the frankfurters could be in for a torrid time .
stuttgart wary of battling bochum second-place stuttgart will be wary of resurgent bochum who flirted with relegation for most of the season only to come alive at the end to claim the scalps of schalke , bayer leverkusen and hamburg .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bochum have already proved a problem for schalke the 2-1 defeat of schalke two weeks ago and last week ’ s 3-0 mauling of hsv should provide armin veh 's championship hopefuls with plenty of food for thought .
bochum could still mount a late challenge for a european place but will have to add stuttgart to their list of conquests and hope everyone else above them lose their last two games .
fourth-placed bayern munich , out of the champions league places but safely in the uefa cup next season , travel to energie cottbus .
the eastern german side are safe from the drop and have had a mixed bag of results of late with wins against leverkusen , wolfsburg and frankfurt offset by losses to hanover and schalke .
cottbus will want more breathing space from the basement despite being secure and robbing the deposed champions of bayern in the process would definitely be an added bonus .
leverkusen , hanover tussle for uefa cup place dfb cup finalists nuremberg will be hoping to put the skids under hamburg 's revival with bayer leverkusen breathing down their necks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leverkusen could have a uefa cup place to celebrate nuremberg already have a uefa cup slot as fellow finalists stuttgart will finish in the champions league places but with hanover close behind , leverkusen will want to snatch fifth place from nuremberg to make sure of european soccer next season .
bayer have 45 points while hanover are on 44 and the fight for europe could go to the last game of the season .
leverkusen play hertha berlin saturday while hanover are away to arminia bielefeld .
coaches tackle relegation arithmetic while opponents borussia mönchengladbach are already down , mainz are still in the relegation dogfight .

klopp will have one eye on the aachen – wolfsburg game on saturday , knowing that a draw between the two clubs above his would set up a dramatic finale .
if wolfsburg win , it could be curtains for mainz as the wolves would drag themselves to near safety on 39 points .
if aachen win , and mainz are victorious , it will all hinge on the final game with only one point separating the three teams on the last day of the season .

bremen , the smallest of germany 's 16 federal states with 490,000 eligible voters , has been governed for 12 years by an alliance of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , reflecting the make-up of chancellor angela merkel 's grand coalition in berlin .
but the two parties were at each other 's throats last week when it emerged that albrecht had been teaching german to migrant children at a bremen school for more than 10 years .
convicted murderer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : susanne albrecht , right , in a photo dated 1991 albrecht was sentenced to 12 years in prison in 1991 for her role in the july 1977 slaying of dresdner bank chief jürgen ponto in a botched kidnapping attempt by red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- terrorists .
paroled in 1996 after serving half her sentence , the now 56-year-old settled in bremen where she has been living under an assumed name and working as a language teacher .
" parents do n't want their children to be taught by raf terrorists , " said thomas röwekamp , the cdu leader who is vying with spd incumbent jens böhrnsen for the state 's top post of governing mayor .
former spd leader henning scherf dismissed röwekamp 's call for albrecht 's removal , saying she had turned her back on terrorism a long time ago and no longer posed a threat .
" such outrage is nothing but electioneering , " scherf said .

depending on whom you read , globalization is either praised for increasing global wealth or blamed for aggravating poverty .
it is a concept that is evolving almost on a daily basis , effecting global commerce and culture .
as a globe-trotting journalist with a phd in economics , daniel altman is very much caught between these two worlds .
in his blog “ managing globalization ” published by the international herald tribune , altman attempts to track , document and report on this ever-changing phenomenon all the while trying to enlighten his readers on how globalization affects them on a daily basis .
his new book " connected : 24 hours in the global economy " has just been published .
dw-world.de : since blogs started out as diaries , can someone really write a diary about our globalized world ?
where does one start ?
daniel altman : i think every single person on earth is a global citizen . we can hardly get out of bed without participating in world markets .
every time you use a car , bus , plane or anything made of plastic , you 're using oil . every time you use a credit card , you 're dipping into the world 's lending market . the prices of the things you buy and sell are determined by competition from around the globe . so yes , you can write a diary about our globalized world ; you need only write about your own life .
i am sure the looser format of a blog makes this task a little easier – or not ?
blogs have the flexibility needed to take on a wide variety of issues . the idea is often to get a discussion going without starting off at a very in-depth level . this way , we can find out which topics are most important to our readers .
is the fact that you are " blogging " about globalization actually a product of globalization itself ?
well , our audience is very international .
we 've received comments from english speakers on every continent except antarctica .
i do n't think blogging is a product of globalization , but the success of my blog definitely is .
is there a direct connection between the greater interconnectivity of cultures / people and the rise of globalization in industry ?
i 'm not sure how direct it is .
my book certainly makes the point that connectedness can create new opportunities for collaboration and productivity , though it can also create new risks .
cultural exchange is nothing new , though .
for a much earlier example , you only have to think about the traders on the old silk road .
if yes , which leads the other ?
where are the two heading ?
i think the two processes are inevitably intertwined . but if you want to know what is driving globalization so rapidly now , i would point to innovation and technology .
can we get even more connected ? we certainly can . we - and especially americans - are fairly unaware of things happening around the world that affect us . the message of my book is that by paying more attention to our connections to people , businesses and markets in other countries , we can take more control of our own economic future . ole tangen jr. interviewed daniel altman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de from africa to germany , blogs reflect a globalized world as the number of blogs around the world continues to climb , many blogs focusing on local issues are gaining a global audience in this hyper-connected media landscape .

depending on whom you read , globalization is either praised for increasing global wealth or blamed for aggravating poverty .
it is a concept that is evolving almost on a daily basis , effecting global commerce and culture .
as a globe-trotting journalist with a phd in economics , daniel altman is very much caught between these two worlds .
in his blog “ managing globalization ” published by the international herald tribune , altman attempts to track , document and report on this ever-changing phenomenon all the while trying to enlighten his readers on how globalization affects them on a daily basis .

dw-world.de : since blogs started out as diaries , can someone really write a diary about our globalized world ?
where does one start ?
daniel altman : i think every single person on earth is a global citizen . we can hardly get out of bed without participating in world markets .
every time you use a car , bus , plane or anything made of plastic , you 're using oil . every time you use a credit card , you 're dipping into the world 's lending market . the prices of the things you buy and sell are determined by competition from around the globe . so yes , you can write a diary about our globalized world ; you need only write about your own life .
i am sure the looser format of a blog makes this task a little easier – or not ?
blogs have the flexibility needed to take on a wide variety of issues . the idea is often to get a discussion going without starting off at a very in-depth level . this way , we can find out which topics are most important to our readers .
is the fact that you are " blogging " about globalization actually a product of globalization itself ?
well , our audience is very international .
we 've received comments from english speakers on every continent except antarctica .
i do n't think blogging is a product of globalization , but the success of my blog definitely is .
is there a direct connection between the greater interconnectivity of cultures / people and the rise of globalization in industry ?
i 'm not sure how direct it is .
my book certainly makes the point that connectedness can create new opportunities for collaboration and productivity , though it can also create new risks .
cultural exchange is nothing new , though .
for a much earlier example , you only have to think about the traders on the old silk road .
if yes , which leads the other ?
where are the two heading ?
i think the two processes are inevitably intertwined . but if you want to know what is driving globalization so rapidly now , i would point to innovation and technology .
can we get even more connected ? we certainly can . we - and especially americans - are fairly unaware of things happening around the world that affect us . the message of my book is that by paying more attention to our connections to people , businesses and markets in other countries , we can take more control of our own economic future . ole tangen jr. interviewed daniel altman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de from africa to germany , blogs reflect a globalized world as the number of blogs around the world continues to climb , many blogs focusing on local issues are gaining a global audience in this hyper-connected media landscape .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 12.05.2007 germany reports biggest tax surplus in modern history großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is reaping the benefits of labor reforms and a buoyant economy germany says it expects its biggest tax surplus for half a century as the economy once derided as the " sick man of europe " reaps the benefits from buoyant growth and moderate reforms . the finance ministry said the tax surplus would come to 179.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 241.6 billion -rrb- by 2011 , according to new figures .
the federal government 's predicted fiscal surplus , or excess of tax revenue over expenditure , is expected to amount to 87 billion euros by that date .
the rest of the stated figure is made up of the expected surpluses of the country 's 16 regional states and social security services .
the projected figure for 2011 represents the biggest tax revenue surplus since the federal republic of germany was founded in 1949 .
germany economy revs up it also provides the latest proof that germany is reaping the benefits of limited but unpopular labor market reforms that began to take effect under the former government of chancellor gerhard schröder .
the projection confirms that the german economy , the biggest in the eurozone , is recovering fast and regaining its position as the driver of european union growth .
from 2002 to 2005 , germany exceeded european union rules that it helped to draw up and which obliged governments to keep their budget shortfalls below 3.0 percent of gross domestic product .
but after years of lethargic progress , germany 's economic momentum increased sharply and its deficit shrank to 1.7 percent of gdp last year .
and the government is hoping to cut the ratio further to 1.2 percent in 2007 .
differences over how best to use surplus the left-right coalition government in berlin appears divided on how best to use the tax surplus .
economy minister michael glos , a member of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats , favors tax cuts but finance minister peer steinbrück , a social democrat , is opposed to such a step .
steinbrück would prefer to use the surplus to balance the german budget and reduce the national debt .

the federal government 's predicted fiscal surplus , or excess of tax revenue over expenditure , is expected to amount to 87 billion euros by that date .

the federal government 's predicted fiscal surplus , or excess of tax revenue over expenditure , is expected to amount to 87 billion euros by that date .
the rest of the stated figure is made up of the expected surpluses of the country 's 16 regional states and social security services .
the projected figure for 2011 represents the biggest tax revenue surplus since the federal republic of germany was founded in 1949 .
germany economy revs up it also provides the latest proof that germany is reaping the benefits of limited but unpopular labor market reforms that began to take effect under the former government of chancellor gerhard schröder .
the projection confirms that the german economy , the biggest in the eurozone , is recovering fast and regaining its position as the driver of european union growth .
from 2002 to 2005 , germany exceeded european union rules that it helped to draw up and which obliged governments to keep their budget shortfalls below 3.0 percent of gross domestic product .
but after years of lethargic progress , germany 's economic momentum increased sharply and its deficit shrank to 1.7 percent of gdp last year .
and the government is hoping to cut the ratio further to 1.2 percent in 2007 .
differences over how best to use surplus the left-right coalition government in berlin appears divided on how best to use the tax surplus .
economy minister michael glos , a member of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats , favors tax cuts but finance minister peer steinbrück , a social democrat , is opposed to such a step .
steinbrück would prefer to use the surplus to balance the german budget and reduce the national debt .
" this is a historic development , we can at last begin to reduce the mountain of debt that has accumulated and which stands at more than 1,500 billion euros , " steinbrück said .
in the meanwhile , several other ministers are calling for the surplus to be used to fund projects in their portfolios .
steinbrück gave assurances that the government planned to invest two billion euros a year in key areas such as " education and research , the family , environmental protection , infrastructure , development aid and internal security . "
in a breakdown given by the ministry , the total fiscal surplus is forecast at 20.3 billion in 2007 euros and at 47.9 billion euros next year . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu says german deficit sinking fast the european commission said germany 's efforts to clean up its financial house are paying off , with the country expected to pare its budget deficit down to three percent of gross domestic product in 2008 .

" it is in our interest and it is our responsibility to allow europe to act in the face of the challenges that confront us , " merkel said at an informal meeting of a handful of european union leaders in sintra , west of lisbon .
" germany alone can not bring all these issues to their successful conclusion , " merkel , whose country holds the eu 's rotating six-month presidency , told journalists .
" but i trust that i have the support of my colleagues here , who will continue to show commitment to our course , to setting europe on the right track and the right foundation . "
mulling the bloc 's future the meeting also included european commission president jose manuel barroso and the leaders of portugal and slovenia , which will each respectively assume the six-month presidency role after germany .
european parliament president hans gert pöttering attended as well .
the session was called to mull the 27-member bloc 's future but had no formal agenda or conclusions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are there any solutions in there ?
merkel with barroso earlier this year barroso also pushed for an agreement on the constitution , which has been in limbo since french and dutch voters said no to a draft treaty in 2005 referenda .
18 other countries have ratified the text .
advocates of the treaty say it is essential to streamline decision-making in the 27-nation bloc .
a new , slimmed-down charter is expected to cover only key reforms such as a long-term president , a foreign minister , and a simpler voting system based more on population size .
portugal in favor of referendum " naturally , what we want is that at the june meeting a consensus is reached so that it is clear what the roadmap is so that europe can adopt a institutional treaty as soon as possible , " portuguese prime minister jose socrates said .
portugal never ratified the treaty and socrates has said he wants to hold a referendum on any new constitution , which would make portugal one of only a few states considering such a move .
barroso said the leaders had discussed in " great detail the way forward for the treaty settlement and we hope that by the end of june , under the chairmanship of mrs. merkel , we will have progress on that matter . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president elect sarkozy wants a mini-treaty for the eu french president-elect nicolas sarkozy has proposed a so-called mini-treaty for the eu .
after meeting with sarkozy on friday , outgoing british prime minister tony blair said he agreed with the idea of developing a simplified constitution .
" it 's not about a mini-treaty or a maxi-treaty , but a treaty that makes europe capable of acting to shape globalization in function of its values , " barroso said .
" we need these presidencies to work together in a real team spirit , to assure the continuity of the direction of the european union , " barroso said .
merkel aware of pitfalls merkel said she was " perfectly aware " of the difficulty in reaching agreements in the past , but added that " my role , as president , is to find the right equilibrium between all those interests . "
she has made reviving the constitutional project a priority of germany 's eu presidency .

" it is in our interest and it is our responsibility to allow europe to act in the face of the challenges that confront us , " merkel said at an informal meeting of a handful of european union leaders in sintra , west of lisbon .
" germany alone can not bring all these issues to their successful conclusion , " merkel , whose country holds the eu 's rotating six-month presidency , told journalists .
" but i trust that i have the support of my colleagues here , who will continue to show commitment to our course , to setting europe on the right track and the right foundation . "
mulling the bloc 's future the meeting also included european commission president jose manuel barroso and the leaders of portugal and slovenia , which will each respectively assume the six-month presidency role after germany .
european parliament president hans gert pöttering attended as well .
the session was called to mull the 27-member bloc 's future but had no formal agenda or conclusions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are there any solutions in there ?
merkel with barroso earlier this year barroso also pushed for an agreement on the constitution , which has been in limbo since french and dutch voters said no to a draft treaty in 2005 referenda .
18 other countries have ratified the text .
advocates of the treaty say it is essential to streamline decision-making in the 27-nation bloc .
a new , slimmed-down charter is expected to cover only key reforms such as a long-term president , a foreign minister , and a simpler voting system based more on population size .
portugal in favor of referendum " naturally , what we want is that at the june meeting a consensus is reached so that it is clear what the roadmap is so that europe can adopt a institutional treaty as soon as possible , " portuguese prime minister jose socrates said .
portugal never ratified the treaty and socrates has said he wants to hold a referendum on any new constitution , which would make portugal one of only a few states considering such a move .
barroso said the leaders had discussed in " great detail the way forward for the treaty settlement and we hope that by the end of june , under the chairmanship of mrs. merkel , we will have progress on that matter . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president elect sarkozy wants a mini-treaty for the eu french president-elect nicolas sarkozy has proposed a so-called mini-treaty for the eu .
after meeting with sarkozy on friday , outgoing british prime minister tony blair said he agreed with the idea of developing a simplified constitution .
" it 's not about a mini-treaty or a maxi-treaty , but a treaty that makes europe capable of acting to shape globalization in function of its values , " barroso said .
" we need these presidencies to work together in a real team spirit , to assure the continuity of the direction of the european union , " barroso said .
merkel aware of pitfalls merkel said she was " perfectly aware " of the difficulty in reaching agreements in the past , but added that " my role , as president , is to find the right equilibrium between all those interests . "
she has made reviving the constitutional project a priority of germany 's eu presidency .

that may be but with so many permutations of results contributing to either glory or shame this year , some are rapidly doing the math . with the club 's first german title in 49 years in sight , schalke 04 fans are taking every opportunity to watch a potential new chapter of their team 's history being written .
the league leaders take on bitter local rivals borussia dortmund on saturday with two matches to go in one of the tightest championship races in years , and have decided to open up their 75,000-seater veltins arena for those supporters unable to get to dortmund for the match .
schalke lead the table by one point from vfb stuttgart and two from werder bremen , and the difficult away game against bvb could be a deciding factor in the destination of the championship shield .
the club announced earlier this week that it would be showing saturday 's game live in its home stadium to give their fans a chance to see the game .
fans would have to pay a six-euro entry fee , but would receive a four-euro food or drink voucher .
one of the reasons why the stadium will be opened is to prevent tens of thousands of fans of traveling to dortmund for a match that is already considered a security risk with 18,000 schalke fans expected to be at the game at signal iduna park .
schalke officials are thus attempting to downplay expectations ahead of the match .
" we are expecting the championship to only be decided on the final day , " gerd voss said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there will be no love lost between schalke and bvb however , with rivals bremen and stuttgart also facing tricky games at the weekend , a win at dortmund for schalke and defeats at frankfurt for werder and bochum for vfb could hand the title to the royal blues on saturday .
but if all three teams win and the league goes to the wire , schalke still have a great chance with a final game at home against bielefeld .
dortmund , who have scrambled to safety from relegation under coach thomas doll , have only a mathematical chance of getting into the uefa cup places but will be playing for regional pride on saturday in one of the league 's fiercely contested derby games .

the midfielder announced wednesday that he would not be leaving for juventus turin in the summer as previously expected .
his contract renewal came a week after striker miroslav klose said he will not the leave the club either and will fulfill his contract until 2008 .
frankfurt , dumped out of the semi-finals of the dfb cup by nuremberg last month , are four points above the drop-zone and a victory against bremen would guarantee their top league status for another season .

the post is read , discussed and linked to by other bloggers and internet users throughout the turkish-speaking world . a graduate student in the us reads the blog , translates it into english and posts it onto another website . bloggers from bahrain to australia then link to the translated post adding their own links and comments along the way . through the reach of the global blogosphere , one person ’ s casual musings have become an international topic for a virtual conversation about democracy , religion and politics . " through a blog , a local issue can become a global one , " said sokari ekine , a nigerian who blogs about african women issues at blacklooks.org. one of the central ideas of globalization is that there is a growing interconnectedness between different societies as well as a greater desire to participate in a " world culture . " brought together by little more than an internet connection and a desire to converse , blogs -lrb- short for weblogs -rrb- have changed how local and global issues are discussed .
and along the way they have become a reflection of this interconnectedness and an increasingly globalized world . " today blogs can impact governments and mainstream media , " said ekine , " and the more people who start blogging will hopefully lead to greater change . " blogging by number just by sheer numbers , blogging is still a virtual phenomenon .
technorati , an online blog tracking site , just released a report stating that there are more than 71 million blogs being written all around the world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blogs started out as personal online diaries according to the report entitled " the state of the blogosphere " released this month , there are about 120,000 new weblogs created worldwide each day .
that works out to about 1.4 blogs every second with about 1.5 million postings per day . contrary to popular opinion , blogging is not an exclusively english endeavor .
of all the blogs tracked , japanese -lrb- 37 percent -rrb- just overtook english -lrb- 33 percent -rrb- as the most-blogged language .
at third place , chinese bloggers represent about three percent of the blogosphere while farsi edged into the top ten with about one percent . a tempered excitement among bloggers about the report was on display in comments on the technorati site .
commenting on the report , the center for citizen media blog summed up the feeling ; " there ’ s no question that blogs and other participatory sites have seen tremendous growth . " a global village ? a lot has changed in the more than 45 years since herbert marshall mcluhan first used the term " global village " to describe how electronic media has led to greater interconnectedness on a global scale . today " globalization " is the buzz word used to describe this phenomenon .
and while the term remains a divisive one , even the people who campaign against corporate globalization benefit from its processes .
" one of the most optimistic aspects of globalization is that anyone can go online and make a friend from anywhere around the world , " said ethan zuckerman who co-founded the site globalvoicesonline.org with rebecca mackinnon in 2004 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : who is reading your blog ?
from where ?
today the site calls itself a guide to the global blogosphere .
through a number of editors , the site posts summaries and excerpts of whatever topics are floating around the internet in regions of the world that are often ignored by the media . according to zuckerman , most bloggers write about and discuss local issues , especially in places like the middle east and africa . " when we feature a story on global voices , we are trying to open a local conversation to a global audience , " said zuckerman .
while he calls himself a " globalization junkie , " zuckerman also considers himself a realist . " there is this cyber-utopian illusion that we are all taking part of the same conversation .
we may all want to talk to each other and get a glimpse into other cultures but we are still all very different , " he said . no global language one of the greatest hurdles to a truly global conversation through blogs is language .
global voices and blacklooks both post mainly in english . markus beckedahl originally thought about writing a blog in english but decided against it because there were no german blogs at the time covering the political aspect of the information society . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what will the blogosphere look like in 10 or 20 years ?
" plus it is much easier to blog in your own language , " he said . so in 2004 he started the blog netzpolitik.org to enlighten germans on topics like open-source software and digital rights through education and activism . beckedahl believes that in 10 or 20 years translation software will allow bloggers from all over the world to communicate , no matter what language they blog in . using the german word " kulturtechnik " -lrb- loosely translates as " culture technique " -rrb- , beckedahl described blogs as a tool that can connect users , or peers to others all around the world often bridging both language and culture .

that may be but with so many permutations of results contributing to either glory or shame this year , some are rapidly doing the math . with the club 's first german title in 49 years in sight , schalke 04 fans are taking every opportunity to watch a potential new chapter of their team 's history being written .
the league leaders take on bitter local rivals borussia dortmund on saturday with two matches to go in one of the tightest championship races in years , and have decided to open up their 75,000-seater veltins arena for those supporters unable to get to dortmund for the match .
schalke lead the table by one point from vfb stuttgart and two from werder bremen , and the difficult away game against bvb could be a deciding factor in the destination of the championship shield .
the club announced earlier this week that it would be showing saturday 's game live in its home stadium to give their fans a chance to see the game .
fans would have to pay a six-euro entry fee , but would receive a four-euro food or drink voucher .
one of the reasons why the stadium will be opened is to prevent tens of thousands of fans of traveling to dortmund for a match that is already considered a security risk with 18,000 schalke fans expected to be at the game at signal iduna park .
schalke officials are thus attempting to downplay expectations ahead of the match .
" we are expecting the championship to only be decided on the final day , " gerd voss said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there will be no love lost between schalke and bvb however , with rivals bremen and stuttgart also facing tricky games at the weekend , a win at dortmund for schalke and defeats at frankfurt for werder and bochum for vfb could hand the title to the royal blues on saturday .
but if all three teams win and the league goes to the wire , schalke still have a great chance with a final game at home against bielefeld .
dortmund , who have scrambled to safety from relegation under coach thomas doll , have only a mathematical chance of getting into the uefa cup places but will be playing for regional pride on saturday in one of the league 's fiercely contested derby games .
winning against schalke and throwing a massive spanner into the works of their title challenge will be all the incentive doll 's players need .
frings , klose boost resurgent bremen one former dortmund star will also be urging his old team to win will be bremen 's torsten frings .
the diminutive midfielder will be hoping bvb trip schalke up and pave the way for a recovering werder to snatch the title on the last day .
frings , who was a bundesliga runner-up with dortmund in 2003 , hopes to add a league winners ' medal with bremen to the one he secured with bayern munich in 2005 .

the midfielder announced wednesday that he would not be leaving for juventus turin in the summer as previously expected .
his contract renewal came a week after striker miroslav klose said he will not the leave the club either and will fulfill his contract until 2008 .
frankfurt , dumped out of the semi-finals of the dfb cup by nuremberg last month , are four points above the drop-zone and a victory against bremen would guarantee their top league status for another season .
however , bremen slammed six past them in the commerzbank arena in december and with werder beginning to find their feet again , the frankfurters could be in for a torrid time .
stuttgart wary of battling bochum second-place stuttgart will be wary of resurgent bochum who flirted with relegation for most of the season only to come alive at the end to claim the scalps of schalke , bayer leverkusen and hamburg .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bochum have already proved a problem for schalke the 2-1 defeat of schalke two weeks ago and last week ’ s 3-0 mauling of hsv should provide armin veh 's championship hopefuls with plenty of food for thought .
bochum could still mount a late challenge for a european place but will have to add stuttgart to their list of conquests and hope everyone else above them lose their last two games .
fourth-placed bayern munich , out of the champions league places but safely in the uefa cup next season , travel to energie cottbus .
the eastern german side are safe from the drop and have had a mixed bag of results of late with wins against leverkusen , wolfsburg and frankfurt offset by losses to hanover and schalke .

the post is read , discussed and linked to by other bloggers and internet users throughout the turkish-speaking world . a graduate student in the us reads the blog , translates it into english and posts it onto another website . bloggers from bahrain to australia then link to the translated post adding their own links and comments along the way . through the reach of the global blogosphere , one person ’ s casual musings have become an international topic for a virtual conversation about democracy , religion and politics . " through a blog , a local issue can become a global one , " said sokari ekine , a nigerian who blogs about african women issues at blacklooks.org. one of the central ideas of globalization is that there is a growing interconnectedness between different societies as well as a greater desire to participate in a " world culture . " brought together by little more than an internet connection and a desire to converse , blogs -lrb- short for weblogs -rrb- have changed how local and global issues are discussed .
and along the way they have become a reflection of this interconnectedness and an increasingly globalized world . " today blogs can impact governments and mainstream media , " said ekine , " and the more people who start blogging will hopefully lead to greater change . " blogging by number just by sheer numbers , blogging is still a virtual phenomenon .

the post is read , discussed and linked to by other bloggers and internet users throughout the turkish-speaking world . a graduate student in the us reads the blog , translates it into english and posts it onto another website . bloggers from bahrain to australia then link to the translated post adding their own links and comments along the way . through the reach of the global blogosphere , one person ’ s casual musings have become an international topic for a virtual conversation about democracy , religion and politics . " through a blog , a local issue can become a global one , " said sokari ekine , a nigerian who blogs about african women issues at blacklooks.org. one of the central ideas of globalization is that there is a growing interconnectedness between different societies as well as a greater desire to participate in a " world culture . " brought together by little more than an internet connection and a desire to converse , blogs -lrb- short for weblogs -rrb- have changed how local and global issues are discussed .
and along the way they have become a reflection of this interconnectedness and an increasingly globalized world . " today blogs can impact governments and mainstream media , " said ekine , " and the more people who start blogging will hopefully lead to greater change . " blogging by number just by sheer numbers , blogging is still a virtual phenomenon .
technorati , an online blog tracking site , just released a report stating that there are more than 71 million blogs being written all around the world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blogs started out as personal online diaries according to the report entitled " the state of the blogosphere " released this month , there are about 120,000 new weblogs created worldwide each day .
that works out to about 1.4 blogs every second with about 1.5 million postings per day . contrary to popular opinion , blogging is not an exclusively english endeavor .
of all the blogs tracked , japanese -lrb- 37 percent -rrb- just overtook english -lrb- 33 percent -rrb- as the most-blogged language .
at third place , chinese bloggers represent about three percent of the blogosphere while farsi edged into the top ten with about one percent . a tempered excitement among bloggers about the report was on display in comments on the technorati site .
commenting on the report , the center for citizen media blog summed up the feeling ; " there ’ s no question that blogs and other participatory sites have seen tremendous growth . " a global village ? a lot has changed in the more than 45 years since herbert marshall mcluhan first used the term " global village " to describe how electronic media has led to greater interconnectedness on a global scale . today " globalization " is the buzz word used to describe this phenomenon .
and while the term remains a divisive one , even the people who campaign against corporate globalization benefit from its processes .
" one of the most optimistic aspects of globalization is that anyone can go online and make a friend from anywhere around the world , " said ethan zuckerman who co-founded the site globalvoicesonline.org with rebecca mackinnon in 2004 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : who is reading your blog ?
from where ?
today the site calls itself a guide to the global blogosphere .
through a number of editors , the site posts summaries and excerpts of whatever topics are floating around the internet in regions of the world that are often ignored by the media . according to zuckerman , most bloggers write about and discuss local issues , especially in places like the middle east and africa . " when we feature a story on global voices , we are trying to open a local conversation to a global audience , " said zuckerman .
while he calls himself a " globalization junkie , " zuckerman also considers himself a realist . " there is this cyber-utopian illusion that we are all taking part of the same conversation .
we may all want to talk to each other and get a glimpse into other cultures but we are still all very different , " he said . no global language one of the greatest hurdles to a truly global conversation through blogs is language .
global voices and blacklooks both post mainly in english . markus beckedahl originally thought about writing a blog in english but decided against it because there were no german blogs at the time covering the political aspect of the information society . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what will the blogosphere look like in 10 or 20 years ?
" plus it is much easier to blog in your own language , " he said . so in 2004 he started the blog netzpolitik.org to enlighten germans on topics like open-source software and digital rights through education and activism . beckedahl believes that in 10 or 20 years translation software will allow bloggers from all over the world to communicate , no matter what language they blog in . using the german word " kulturtechnik " -lrb- loosely translates as " culture technique " -rrb- , beckedahl described blogs as a tool that can connect users , or peers to others all around the world often bridging both language and culture .

that may be but with so many permutations of results contributing to either glory or shame this year , some are rapidly doing the math . with the club 's first german title in 49 years in sight , schalke 04 fans are taking every opportunity to watch a potential new chapter of their team 's history being written .
the league leaders take on bitter local rivals borussia dortmund on saturday with two matches to go in one of the tightest championship races in years , and have decided to open up their 75,000-seater veltins arena for those supporters unable to get to dortmund for the match .
schalke lead the table by one point from vfb stuttgart and two from werder bremen , and the difficult away game against bvb could be a deciding factor in the destination of the championship shield .
the club announced earlier this week that it would be showing saturday 's game live in its home stadium to give their fans a chance to see the game .
fans would have to pay a six-euro entry fee , but would receive a four-euro food or drink voucher .
one of the reasons why the stadium will be opened is to prevent tens of thousands of fans of traveling to dortmund for a match that is already considered a security risk with 18,000 schalke fans expected to be at the game at signal iduna park .
schalke officials are thus attempting to downplay expectations ahead of the match .
" we are expecting the championship to only be decided on the final day , " gerd voss said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there will be no love lost between schalke and bvb however , with rivals bremen and stuttgart also facing tricky games at the weekend , a win at dortmund for schalke and defeats at frankfurt for werder and bochum for vfb could hand the title to the royal blues on saturday .
but if all three teams win and the league goes to the wire , schalke still have a great chance with a final game at home against bielefeld .
dortmund , who have scrambled to safety from relegation under coach thomas doll , have only a mathematical chance of getting into the uefa cup places but will be playing for regional pride on saturday in one of the league 's fiercely contested derby games .
winning against schalke and throwing a massive spanner into the works of their title challenge will be all the incentive doll 's players need .
frings , klose boost resurgent bremen one former dortmund star will also be urging his old team to win will be bremen 's torsten frings .
the diminutive midfielder will be hoping bvb trip schalke up and pave the way for a recovering werder to snatch the title on the last day .
frings , who was a bundesliga runner-up with dortmund in 2003 , hopes to add a league winners ' medal with bremen to the one he secured with bayern munich in 2005 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frings will strut his stuff for bremen until at least 2011 werder will face eintracht frankfurt at the weserstadion buoyed by a recent return to form after crashing out of the uefa cup semi-finals and the news that frings has committed himself to the club until 2011 .
the midfielder announced wednesday that he would not be leaving for juventus turin in the summer as previously expected .
his contract renewal came a week after striker miroslav klose said he will not the leave the club either and will fulfill his contract until 2008 .
frankfurt , dumped out of the semi-finals of the dfb cup by nuremberg last month , are four points above the drop-zone and a victory against bremen would guarantee their top league status for another season .
however , bremen slammed six past them in the commerzbank arena in december and with werder beginning to find their feet again , the frankfurters could be in for a torrid time .
stuttgart wary of battling bochum second-place stuttgart will be wary of resurgent bochum who flirted with relegation for most of the season only to come alive at the end to claim the scalps of schalke , bayer leverkusen and hamburg .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bochum have already proved a problem for schalke the 2-1 defeat of schalke two weeks ago and last week ’ s 3-0 mauling of hsv should provide armin veh 's championship hopefuls with plenty of food for thought .
bochum could still mount a late challenge for a european place but will have to add stuttgart to their list of conquests and hope everyone else above them lose their last two games .
fourth-placed bayern munich , out of the champions league places but safely in the uefa cup next season , travel to energie cottbus .
the eastern german side are safe from the drop and have had a mixed bag of results of late with wins against leverkusen , wolfsburg and frankfurt offset by losses to hanover and schalke .
cottbus will want more breathing space from the basement despite being secure and robbing the deposed champions of bayern in the process would definitely be an added bonus .
leverkusen , hanover tussle for uefa cup place dfb cup finalists nuremberg will be hoping to put the skids under hamburg 's revival with bayer leverkusen breathing down their necks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leverkusen could have a uefa cup place to celebrate nuremberg already have a uefa cup slot as fellow finalists stuttgart will finish in the champions league places but with hanover close behind , leverkusen will want to snatch fifth place from nuremberg to make sure of european soccer next season .
bayer have 45 points while hanover are on 44 and the fight for europe could go to the last game of the season .
leverkusen play hertha berlin saturday while hanover are away to arminia bielefeld .
coaches tackle relegation arithmetic while opponents borussia mönchengladbach are already down , mainz are still in the relegation dogfight .
with six points going begging in the next fortnight , a win over bottom club gladbach on saturday and a final day victory over bayern munich could see jürgen klopp 's team survive .
klopp will have one eye on the aachen – wolfsburg game on saturday , knowing that a draw between the two clubs above his would set up a dramatic finale .
if wolfsburg win , it could be curtains for mainz as the wolves would drag themselves to near safety on 39 points .
if aachen win , and mainz are victorious , it will all hinge on the final game with only one point separating the three teams on the last day of the season .
if that scenario transpires , the impetus could be with aachen .
with mainz away in munich and wolfsburg playing host to title chasers bremen , aachen could save themselves by the skin of their teeth by beating hamburg . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schalke hold lead as stuttgart , bremen keep pressure on nothing changed at the top of the bundesliga table as schalke maintained their one-point lead over stuttgart and two-point advantage over bremen as all three teams came away with wins with two weeks left in the season .

schalke lead the table by one point from vfb stuttgart and two from werder bremen , and the difficult away game against bvb could be a deciding factor in the destination of the championship shield .
the club announced earlier this week that it would be showing saturday 's game live in its home stadium to give their fans a chance to see the game .
fans would have to pay a six-euro entry fee , but would receive a four-euro food or drink voucher .
one of the reasons why the stadium will be opened is to prevent tens of thousands of fans of traveling to dortmund for a match that is already considered a security risk with 18,000 schalke fans expected to be at the game at signal iduna park .
schalke officials are thus attempting to downplay expectations ahead of the match .
" we are expecting the championship to only be decided on the final day , " gerd voss said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there will be no love lost between schalke and bvb however , with rivals bremen and stuttgart also facing tricky games at the weekend , a win at dortmund for schalke and defeats at frankfurt for werder and bochum for vfb could hand the title to the royal blues on saturday .
but if all three teams win and the league goes to the wire , schalke still have a great chance with a final game at home against bielefeld .
dortmund , who have scrambled to safety from relegation under coach thomas doll , have only a mathematical chance of getting into the uefa cup places but will be playing for regional pride on saturday in one of the league 's fiercely contested derby games .
winning against schalke and throwing a massive spanner into the works of their title challenge will be all the incentive doll 's players need .
frings , klose boost resurgent bremen one former dortmund star will also be urging his old team to win will be bremen 's torsten frings .
the diminutive midfielder will be hoping bvb trip schalke up and pave the way for a recovering werder to snatch the title on the last day .
frings , who was a bundesliga runner-up with dortmund in 2003 , hopes to add a league winners ' medal with bremen to the one he secured with bayern munich in 2005 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frings will strut his stuff for bremen until at least 2011 werder will face eintracht frankfurt at the weserstadion buoyed by a recent return to form after crashing out of the uefa cup semi-finals and the news that frings has committed himself to the club until 2011 .
the midfielder announced wednesday that he would not be leaving for juventus turin in the summer as previously expected .
his contract renewal came a week after striker miroslav klose said he will not the leave the club either and will fulfill his contract until 2008 .
frankfurt , dumped out of the semi-finals of the dfb cup by nuremberg last month , are four points above the drop-zone and a victory against bremen would guarantee their top league status for another season .
however , bremen slammed six past them in the commerzbank arena in december and with werder beginning to find their feet again , the frankfurters could be in for a torrid time .
stuttgart wary of battling bochum second-place stuttgart will be wary of resurgent bochum who flirted with relegation for most of the season only to come alive at the end to claim the scalps of schalke , bayer leverkusen and hamburg .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bochum have already proved a problem for schalke the 2-1 defeat of schalke two weeks ago and last week ’ s 3-0 mauling of hsv should provide armin veh 's championship hopefuls with plenty of food for thought .
bochum could still mount a late challenge for a european place but will have to add stuttgart to their list of conquests and hope everyone else above them lose their last two games .
fourth-placed bayern munich , out of the champions league places but safely in the uefa cup next season , travel to energie cottbus .
the eastern german side are safe from the drop and have had a mixed bag of results of late with wins against leverkusen , wolfsburg and frankfurt offset by losses to hanover and schalke .
cottbus will want more breathing space from the basement despite being secure and robbing the deposed champions of bayern in the process would definitely be an added bonus .
leverkusen , hanover tussle for uefa cup place dfb cup finalists nuremberg will be hoping to put the skids under hamburg 's revival with bayer leverkusen breathing down their necks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leverkusen could have a uefa cup place to celebrate nuremberg already have a uefa cup slot as fellow finalists stuttgart will finish in the champions league places but with hanover close behind , leverkusen will want to snatch fifth place from nuremberg to make sure of european soccer next season .
bayer have 45 points while hanover are on 44 and the fight for europe could go to the last game of the season .
leverkusen play hertha berlin saturday while hanover are away to arminia bielefeld .
coaches tackle relegation arithmetic while opponents borussia mönchengladbach are already down , mainz are still in the relegation dogfight .
with six points going begging in the next fortnight , a win over bottom club gladbach on saturday and a final day victory over bayern munich could see jürgen klopp 's team survive .
klopp will have one eye on the aachen – wolfsburg game on saturday , knowing that a draw between the two clubs above his would set up a dramatic finale .
if wolfsburg win , it could be curtains for mainz as the wolves would drag themselves to near safety on 39 points .
if aachen win , and mainz are victorious , it will all hinge on the final game with only one point separating the three teams on the last day of the season .

the post is read , discussed and linked to by other bloggers and internet users throughout the turkish-speaking world . a graduate student in the us reads the blog , translates it into english and posts it onto another website . bloggers from bahrain to australia then link to the translated post adding their own links and comments along the way . through the reach of the global blogosphere , one person ’ s casual musings have become an international topic for a virtual conversation about democracy , religion and politics . " through a blog , a local issue can become a global one , " said sokari ekine , a nigerian who blogs about african women issues at blacklooks.org. one of the central ideas of globalization is that there is a growing interconnectedness between different societies as well as a greater desire to participate in a " world culture . " brought together by little more than an internet connection and a desire to converse , blogs -lrb- short for weblogs -rrb- have changed how local and global issues are discussed .
and along the way they have become a reflection of this interconnectedness and an increasingly globalized world . " today blogs can impact governments and mainstream media , " said ekine , " and the more people who start blogging will hopefully lead to greater change . " blogging by number just by sheer numbers , blogging is still a virtual phenomenon .
technorati , an online blog tracking site , just released a report stating that there are more than 71 million blogs being written all around the world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blogs started out as personal online diaries according to the report entitled " the state of the blogosphere " released this month , there are about 120,000 new weblogs created worldwide each day .
that works out to about 1.4 blogs every second with about 1.5 million postings per day . contrary to popular opinion , blogging is not an exclusively english endeavor .
of all the blogs tracked , japanese -lrb- 37 percent -rrb- just overtook english -lrb- 33 percent -rrb- as the most-blogged language .
at third place , chinese bloggers represent about three percent of the blogosphere while farsi edged into the top ten with about one percent . a tempered excitement among bloggers about the report was on display in comments on the technorati site .
commenting on the report , the center for citizen media blog summed up the feeling ; " there ’ s no question that blogs and other participatory sites have seen tremendous growth . " a global village ? a lot has changed in the more than 45 years since herbert marshall mcluhan first used the term " global village " to describe how electronic media has led to greater interconnectedness on a global scale . today " globalization " is the buzz word used to describe this phenomenon .
and while the term remains a divisive one , even the people who campaign against corporate globalization benefit from its processes .
" one of the most optimistic aspects of globalization is that anyone can go online and make a friend from anywhere around the world , " said ethan zuckerman who co-founded the site globalvoicesonline.org with rebecca mackinnon in 2004 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : who is reading your blog ?
from where ?
today the site calls itself a guide to the global blogosphere .
through a number of editors , the site posts summaries and excerpts of whatever topics are floating around the internet in regions of the world that are often ignored by the media . according to zuckerman , most bloggers write about and discuss local issues , especially in places like the middle east and africa . " when we feature a story on global voices , we are trying to open a local conversation to a global audience , " said zuckerman .
while he calls himself a " globalization junkie , " zuckerman also considers himself a realist . " there is this cyber-utopian illusion that we are all taking part of the same conversation .
we may all want to talk to each other and get a glimpse into other cultures but we are still all very different , " he said . no global language one of the greatest hurdles to a truly global conversation through blogs is language .

that may be but with so many permutations of results contributing to either glory or shame this year , some are rapidly doing the math . with the club 's first german title in 49 years in sight , schalke 04 fans are taking every opportunity to watch a potential new chapter of their team 's history being written .
the league leaders take on bitter local rivals borussia dortmund on saturday with two matches to go in one of the tightest championship races in years , and have decided to open up their 75,000-seater veltins arena for those supporters unable to get to dortmund for the match .
schalke lead the table by one point from vfb stuttgart and two from werder bremen , and the difficult away game against bvb could be a deciding factor in the destination of the championship shield .
the club announced earlier this week that it would be showing saturday 's game live in its home stadium to give their fans a chance to see the game .
fans would have to pay a six-euro entry fee , but would receive a four-euro food or drink voucher .
one of the reasons why the stadium will be opened is to prevent tens of thousands of fans of traveling to dortmund for a match that is already considered a security risk with 18,000 schalke fans expected to be at the game at signal iduna park .
schalke officials are thus attempting to downplay expectations ahead of the match .
" we are expecting the championship to only be decided on the final day , " gerd voss said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there will be no love lost between schalke and bvb however , with rivals bremen and stuttgart also facing tricky games at the weekend , a win at dortmund for schalke and defeats at frankfurt for werder and bochum for vfb could hand the title to the royal blues on saturday .
but if all three teams win and the league goes to the wire , schalke still have a great chance with a final game at home against bielefeld .
dortmund , who have scrambled to safety from relegation under coach thomas doll , have only a mathematical chance of getting into the uefa cup places but will be playing for regional pride on saturday in one of the league 's fiercely contested derby games .
winning against schalke and throwing a massive spanner into the works of their title challenge will be all the incentive doll 's players need .

the diminutive midfielder will be hoping bvb trip schalke up and pave the way for a recovering werder to snatch the title on the last day .
frings , who was a bundesliga runner-up with dortmund in 2003 , hopes to add a league winners ' medal with bremen to the one he secured with bayern munich in 2005 .

the midfielder announced wednesday that he would not be leaving for juventus turin in the summer as previously expected .
his contract renewal came a week after striker miroslav klose said he will not the leave the club either and will fulfill his contract until 2008 .
frankfurt , dumped out of the semi-finals of the dfb cup by nuremberg last month , are four points above the drop-zone and a victory against bremen would guarantee their top league status for another season .
however , bremen slammed six past them in the commerzbank arena in december and with werder beginning to find their feet again , the frankfurters could be in for a torrid time .

that may be but with so many permutations of results contributing to either glory or shame this year , some are rapidly doing the math . with the club 's first german title in 49 years in sight , schalke 04 fans are taking every opportunity to watch a potential new chapter of their team 's history being written .
the league leaders take on bitter local rivals borussia dortmund on saturday with two matches to go in one of the tightest championship races in years , and have decided to open up their 75,000-seater veltins arena for those supporters unable to get to dortmund for the match .
schalke lead the table by one point from vfb stuttgart and two from werder bremen , and the difficult away game against bvb could be a deciding factor in the destination of the championship shield .
the club announced earlier this week that it would be showing saturday 's game live in its home stadium to give their fans a chance to see the game .
fans would have to pay a six-euro entry fee , but would receive a four-euro food or drink voucher .
one of the reasons why the stadium will be opened is to prevent tens of thousands of fans of traveling to dortmund for a match that is already considered a security risk with 18,000 schalke fans expected to be at the game at signal iduna park .
schalke officials are thus attempting to downplay expectations ahead of the match .
" we are expecting the championship to only be decided on the final day , " gerd voss said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there will be no love lost between schalke and bvb however , with rivals bremen and stuttgart also facing tricky games at the weekend , a win at dortmund for schalke and defeats at frankfurt for werder and bochum for vfb could hand the title to the royal blues on saturday .
but if all three teams win and the league goes to the wire , schalke still have a great chance with a final game at home against bielefeld .
dortmund , who have scrambled to safety from relegation under coach thomas doll , have only a mathematical chance of getting into the uefa cup places but will be playing for regional pride on saturday in one of the league 's fiercely contested derby games .
winning against schalke and throwing a massive spanner into the works of their title challenge will be all the incentive doll 's players need .

the diminutive midfielder will be hoping bvb trip schalke up and pave the way for a recovering werder to snatch the title on the last day .
frings , who was a bundesliga runner-up with dortmund in 2003 , hopes to add a league winners ' medal with bremen to the one he secured with bayern munich in 2005 .

the midfielder announced wednesday that he would not be leaving for juventus turin in the summer as previously expected .
his contract renewal came a week after striker miroslav klose said he will not the leave the club either and will fulfill his contract until 2008 .
frankfurt , dumped out of the semi-finals of the dfb cup by nuremberg last month , are four points above the drop-zone and a victory against bremen would guarantee their top league status for another season .
however , bremen slammed six past them in the commerzbank arena in december and with werder beginning to find their feet again , the frankfurters could be in for a torrid time .
stuttgart wary of battling bochum second-place stuttgart will be wary of resurgent bochum who flirted with relegation for most of the season only to come alive at the end to claim the scalps of schalke , bayer leverkusen and hamburg .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bochum have already proved a problem for schalke the 2-1 defeat of schalke two weeks ago and last week ’ s 3-0 mauling of hsv should provide armin veh 's championship hopefuls with plenty of food for thought .
bochum could still mount a late challenge for a european place but will have to add stuttgart to their list of conquests and hope everyone else above them lose their last two games .
fourth-placed bayern munich , out of the champions league places but safely in the uefa cup next season , travel to energie cottbus .
the eastern german side are safe from the drop and have had a mixed bag of results of late with wins against leverkusen , wolfsburg and frankfurt offset by losses to hanover and schalke .
cottbus will want more breathing space from the basement despite being secure and robbing the deposed champions of bayern in the process would definitely be an added bonus .
leverkusen , hanover tussle for uefa cup place dfb cup finalists nuremberg will be hoping to put the skids under hamburg 's revival with bayer leverkusen breathing down their necks .

klopp will have one eye on the aachen – wolfsburg game on saturday , knowing that a draw between the two clubs above his would set up a dramatic finale .
if wolfsburg win , it could be curtains for mainz as the wolves would drag themselves to near safety on 39 points .
if aachen win , and mainz are victorious , it will all hinge on the final game with only one point separating the three teams on the last day of the season .

but if all three teams win and the league goes to the wire , schalke still have a great chance with a final game at home against bielefeld .
dortmund , who have scrambled to safety from relegation under coach thomas doll , have only a mathematical chance of getting into the uefa cup places but will be playing for regional pride on saturday in one of the league 's fiercely contested derby games .
winning against schalke and throwing a massive spanner into the works of their title challenge will be all the incentive doll 's players need .
frings , klose boost resurgent bremen one former dortmund star will also be urging his old team to win will be bremen 's torsten frings .
the diminutive midfielder will be hoping bvb trip schalke up and pave the way for a recovering werder to snatch the title on the last day .
frings , who was a bundesliga runner-up with dortmund in 2003 , hopes to add a league winners ' medal with bremen to the one he secured with bayern munich in 2005 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frings will strut his stuff for bremen until at least 2011 werder will face eintracht frankfurt at the weserstadion buoyed by a recent return to form after crashing out of the uefa cup semi-finals and the news that frings has committed himself to the club until 2011 .
the midfielder announced wednesday that he would not be leaving for juventus turin in the summer as previously expected .
his contract renewal came a week after striker miroslav klose said he will not the leave the club either and will fulfill his contract until 2008 .
frankfurt , dumped out of the semi-finals of the dfb cup by nuremberg last month , are four points above the drop-zone and a victory against bremen would guarantee their top league status for another season .
however , bremen slammed six past them in the commerzbank arena in december and with werder beginning to find their feet again , the frankfurters could be in for a torrid time .
stuttgart wary of battling bochum second-place stuttgart will be wary of resurgent bochum who flirted with relegation for most of the season only to come alive at the end to claim the scalps of schalke , bayer leverkusen and hamburg .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bochum have already proved a problem for schalke the 2-1 defeat of schalke two weeks ago and last week ’ s 3-0 mauling of hsv should provide armin veh 's championship hopefuls with plenty of food for thought .
bochum could still mount a late challenge for a european place but will have to add stuttgart to their list of conquests and hope everyone else above them lose their last two games .
fourth-placed bayern munich , out of the champions league places but safely in the uefa cup next season , travel to energie cottbus .
the eastern german side are safe from the drop and have had a mixed bag of results of late with wins against leverkusen , wolfsburg and frankfurt offset by losses to hanover and schalke .
cottbus will want more breathing space from the basement despite being secure and robbing the deposed champions of bayern in the process would definitely be an added bonus .
leverkusen , hanover tussle for uefa cup place dfb cup finalists nuremberg will be hoping to put the skids under hamburg 's revival with bayer leverkusen breathing down their necks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leverkusen could have a uefa cup place to celebrate nuremberg already have a uefa cup slot as fellow finalists stuttgart will finish in the champions league places but with hanover close behind , leverkusen will want to snatch fifth place from nuremberg to make sure of european soccer next season .
bayer have 45 points while hanover are on 44 and the fight for europe could go to the last game of the season .
leverkusen play hertha berlin saturday while hanover are away to arminia bielefeld .
coaches tackle relegation arithmetic while opponents borussia mönchengladbach are already down , mainz are still in the relegation dogfight .
with six points going begging in the next fortnight , a win over bottom club gladbach on saturday and a final day victory over bayern munich could see jürgen klopp 's team survive .
klopp will have one eye on the aachen – wolfsburg game on saturday , knowing that a draw between the two clubs above his would set up a dramatic finale .
if wolfsburg win , it could be curtains for mainz as the wolves would drag themselves to near safety on 39 points .
if aachen win , and mainz are victorious , it will all hinge on the final game with only one point separating the three teams on the last day of the season .
if that scenario transpires , the impetus could be with aachen .
with mainz away in munich and wolfsburg playing host to title chasers bremen , aachen could save themselves by the skin of their teeth by beating hamburg . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schalke hold lead as stuttgart , bremen keep pressure on nothing changed at the top of the bundesliga table as schalke maintained their one-point lead over stuttgart and two-point advantage over bremen as all three teams came away with wins with two weeks left in the season .

mrs pretty fought not only her terminal motor neurone disease but also for the right for her husband to assist her to die , before she died in a hospice in may 2002 .
mr brian pretty told bbc news he will continue " to the end " to fight for assisted suicide to be legalised .
the assisted dying for the terminally ill bill was rejected on 12 may 2006 .
the private members bill , introduced by lord joffe , was defeated on its second reading - the day after the 4th anniversary of mrs pretty 's death .
the bill would give doctors the right to prescribe drugs that a terminally ill patient in severe pain could use to end their own life , but concerns were raised that doctors could administer lethal drugs .
nobody has done more for the campaign to legalise assisted dying than diane pretty deborah annetts , dignity in dying lord joffe pledged to reintroduce the bill at a later date .
mrs pretty took her fight for the right to die to the european court of human rights .
mr pretty said : " after diane died it just seemed the right thing to continue trying to change the law .
" i will never forget the suffering diane went through , or the thousands of messages of support she received from people just like her all over the country who were desperately hoping she would succeed . "
mr pretty described the bill as " diane 's legacy " .
he added : " i 'll carry on fighting for diane .
come what may i 'll see it through to the end . "
neither euthanasia nor assisted suicide is an option in the uk , where deliberate assistance in death can lead to murder charges .

deborah annetts , chief executive of dignity in dying , said : " nobody has done more for the campaign to legalise assisted dying in this country than diane pretty .
" the assisted dying for the terminally ill bill came about as a direct response to diane 's articulation of the suffering that the law brought upon her and so many others like her .
" diane 's legacy will only be fulfilled when terminally ill , mentally competent people like her can have what she was denied : the choice of a dignified death at the time and place of their choosing . "
' deceptive claims ' a study by brunel university last year showed uk doctors remained more cautious about ending lives than their european counterparts , with most only likely to help if a patent was in the last week of life .
the prolife alliance remains opposed to the bill , which it sees as " changing the law for their alleged benefit at the expense of frightening many thousands of vulnerable disabled or ill people . "
julia millington , political director of the prolife alliance , said : " the results of the study fly in the face of deceptive claims made over the last two years by the pro-euthanasia lobby who allege that doctors are killing thousands of terminally ill patients every year in the uk . "

sir igor judge said courts would be better placed to determine appeals if it could see what the jury had seen .
he also raised concern over government plans to prevent convicted criminals winning appeals because of legal problems during the trial process .
ministers have not announced if the proposals will become law .
sir igor was speaking at a conference for the 10th anniversary of the criminal cases review commission , which investigates suspected miscarriages of justice . "
there 's absolutely no reason why rather than just having a transcript we should n't have a complete video " sir igor judge when deciding whether convictions are safe or not , the court of appeal is sometimes accused of paying too much respect to the jury 's finding of guilt , bbc home affairs correspondent danny shaw said .
although transcripts were already available , sir igor said they did not reveal the witnesses ' physical expressions - whether they unexpectedly hesitated or struggled through difficult pieces of evidence .
he told bbc news : " what transcripts do n't show is this .
they do n't show hesitation at times when hesitation is rather surprising .
" the transcripts do n't show gabbling in order to get over a difficult bit of evidence and get past it .
" but if what we want to do is to have a more profound examination of the way in which a jury has returned a verdict , there 's absolutely no reason why rather than just having a transcript we should n't have a complete video . "
tom magner , from the society of expert witnesses , said sir igor 's idea should be taken further , with the whole court including barristers and judges filmed too .
mr magner said : " i can understand the thinking behind it and i can understand very much if you 're in a courtroom in the live situation , a judge is looking at how the witness is behaving , looking at the whole picture . "

sir igor judge said courts would be better placed to determine appeals if it could see what the jury had seen .
he also raised concern over government plans to prevent convicted criminals winning appeals because of legal problems during the trial process .
ministers have not announced if the proposals will become law .
sir igor was speaking at a conference for the 10th anniversary of the criminal cases review commission , which investigates suspected miscarriages of justice .
there 's absolutely no reason why rather than just having a transcript we should n't have a complete video sir igor judge when deciding whether convictions are safe or not , the court of appeal is sometimes accused of paying too much respect to the jury 's finding of guilt , bbc home affairs correspondent danny shaw said .
although transcripts were already available , sir igor said they did not reveal the witnesses ' physical expressions - whether they unexpectedly hesitated or struggled through difficult pieces of evidence .
he told bbc news : " what transcripts do n't show is this .
they do n't show hesitation at times when hesitation is rather surprising .
" the transcripts do n't show gabbling in order to get over a difficult bit of evidence and get past it .
" but if what we want to do is to have a more profound examination of the way in which a jury has returned a verdict , there 's absolutely no reason why rather than just having a transcript we should n't have a complete video . "
tom magner , from the society of expert witnesses , said sir igor 's idea should be taken further , with the whole court including barristers and judges filmed too .
mr magner said : " i can understand the thinking behind it and i can understand very much if you 're in a courtroom in the live situation , a judge is looking at how the witness is behaving , looking at the whole picture . "

mrs blair answers the door the day after labour 's 1997 victory never before had a prime ministerial consort had such a high profile or attracted so much media attention .
her immediate predecessor , norma major , was a wife of the " seen but not heard " variety - more of a home body who concentrated on family and writing innocuous books .
before mrs major there was the late denis thatcher , who once summed up the role of the ideal prime ministerial spouse as " always present , never there " .
the same could not be said for mrs blair .
lifestyle guru during her ten years at number 10 , the 52-year-old has been in the headlines almost as much as her husband - and not always for the reasons she would have liked .
she has dedicated much time and energy to charity work .
she is president of barnardo 's and a trustee of anti-domestic violence charity refuge and has campaigned for the rights of women prisoners .
she also lectures widely on human rights , is a recorder in the county and crown courts and has appeared in the european court of justice .
she was a founder member , in 2000 , of matrix chambers , set up to champion human rights and free speech .
she was chancellor of liverpool john moores university between 1996 and 2006 .
but media attention has , inevitably , focused on her extra-curricular activities .
her verbal gaffes , property deals , lecture tours and book contracts have provided ammunition to mischievous newspaper sketch-writers and filled many a column inch .
her fondness for new age spirituality and friendship with former glamour model and lifestyle guru carole caplin - who made the ill-fated introduction between the blairs and convicted fraudster peter foster - have also brought their fair share of unfavourable attention .
first lady then there is her father , the actor tony booth - best known for his role in tv sitcom till death us do part - an ever willing spokesman on his son-in-law 's plans for state pension and disability reforms .
even mrs blair 's dress sense , big smile , coiffeured locks and travelling hairdressers have suffered close scrutiny .
whatever people think of cherie blair - she has always been entertaining .
if people do not like what they see , " well , tough " seems to be the attitude .
here are some of the highs and lows of her time as the prime minister 's wife .
1 may , 1997 : it 's a brave new world - labour wins the general election and cherie poses proudly with her arms around britain 's new prime minister , tony blair , outside number 10 .
the following day a tousle-haired , nightie-clad mrs blair answers the door of her islington home to receive a bunch of flowers , cheekily sent by a tabloid in the hope of catching her looking a tad dishevelled .
november , 1999 : the blairs shock the world by announcing that cherie , 45 , is pregnant .
the baby is due in may , 2000 , and will be the couple 's fourth child .
january , 2000 : cherie is fined £ 10 after she fails to buy a ticket for her journey from blackfriars to luton , where she sits as a crown recorder at luton crown court .
march , 2000 : cherie slaps an injunction on the mail on sunday to block the publication of the memoirs of the family 's former nanny , rosalind mark .
cherie later drops the legal action against ms mark and her agent , jonathan harris , and settles with the newspaper 's publishers .
may , 2000 : great happiness at downing street with the announcement that cherie has given birth to a boy , called leo .
the mum-of-four says she is " tired but full of joy " and admits : " it is so long since we had our other three children that i had forgotten quite what an ordeal those last few hours of labour can be . "
august , 2000 : a political row erupts over a newspaper article by mrs blair defending government policy on human rights .
downing street insists she has written the piece in her capacity as a qc , not as the prime minister 's wife .
but the tories accuse her of emulating hillary clinton , wife of president bill , who is then running for the us senate .
may , 2002 : cherie is delighted to discover she has a 35-year-old half-sister , lucy thomas , who she never knew about .
june , 2002 : cherie causes controversy when she comments : " as long as young -lsb- palestinian -rsb- people feel they have got no hope but to blow themselves up you are never going to make progress . "
she later apologises for any offence caused by the remarks , which were made during a charity event she attended with queen raina of jordon .
august , 2002 : cherie suffers a miscarriage .
december , 2002 : a tearful cherie apologises for the embarrassment she has caused in buying two flats in bristol with the help of convicted fraudster peter foster .
after several days of press reports about her links with the australian conman , she makes a 10-minute statement admitting she made mistakes in the controversial property deal .
she says she had not known that mr foster had ever been to prison and would never want to do anything to harm her husband , the prime minister , her children or the labour government .
acknowledging that she has a " special position " as the wife of the prime minister , with an interesting job and wonderful family , she says : " i also know i 'm not superwoman " .
the blairs are thought to have lost money on the ill-fated flats .
july , 2003 : cherie breaks into song with the beatles hit " when i 'm 64 " during a visit to the chinese capital beijing .
september , 2004 : cherie defends her decision to celebrate her 50th birthday at chequers on the anniversary of the 9/11 terror attacks , saying it is the only time all her guests could get together .
september , 2004 : cherie publishes her book , the goldfish bowl , co-written with cate haste , about life as a prime minister 's spouse .
autumn , 2004 : the blairs buy a £ 3.65m house in connaught square , london , but initially have difficulty finding a tenant .
february , 2005 : cherie phones richard and judy to complain that her husband never buys her flowers .
she said her mother had been watching and had urged her to phone in to " show up her son-in-law " .
june , 2005 : cherie nets £ 30,000 for a speech in washington billed as the inside account of the " first lady of downing street " , which coincides with her husband 's pre-g8 meeting with george bush .
tories say she should donate her fee to charity , arguing the " commercial nature " of her trip was " inappropriate " .
october , 2005 : cherie is under fire after it emerges that a charity fundraising dinner she spoke at is being investigated in australia .
although 60 % of proceeds from the dinner should have gone to a children 's charity , it receives less than 10 % .
her speaking tour of australia also prompts a host of negative publicity after it is reported she received £ 100,000 for her engagements .
november , 2005 : cherie tells barrister 's magazine counsel that she would have ended up working in a shop if she had not had a free university education .
she speaks out as the government prepares to increase university tuition fees in england .
december , 2005 : cypriot president tassos papadopolous criticises cherie 's decision to represent a british couple in a land dispute in divided cyprus .
the president says it is " provocative " for the wife of the prime minister to be involved in such a case , but downing street says she is acting in a purely professional capacity .
december , 2005 : cherie rules out launching a political career when tony finally leaves downing street - despite the offer of support from bill clinton who said " if she ever campaigned for office and wanted me to go ringing doorbells for her " .
she stood unsuccessfully as a labour candidate in 1983 .
may , 2006 : cherie hits out at criticism of the £ 7,700 labour spent on her hairdressing during the previous year 's general election .
the prime minister 's wife comes under fierce attacks in the media , with one newspaper branding her the " marie-antoinette of british politics " .
but mrs blair retorts : " honestly - what a load of fuss about trivia !
it 's something about women , is n't it ?
who noticed , or who made a big fuss , that the tory party paid £ 3,500 for the leader of the opposition 's make-up ?
but women and their hair , women and their appearance - it 's part of the thing that we seem to suffer . "
september , 2006 : cherie is accused of raining on chancellor gordon brown 's parade when she is reported to have called him a liar during his keynote speech to the labour party conference .
bloomberg news agency reports that she said " well , that 's a lie " when she heard the chancellor saying it had been a privilege to work with tony blair .
his wife later tells reporters : " honestly , guys , i hate to spoil your story , but i did n't say it and i do n't believe it either . "
but bloomberg insists it stands by the story and refuses to retract it .
however , despite mrs blair 's denials - backed up by downing street - the story manages to divert attention away from the speech that mr brown had hoped would boost his chances of being the next prime minister .

her immediate predecessor , norma major , was a wife of the " seen but not heard " variety - more of a home body who concentrated on family and writing innocuous books .
before mrs major there was the late denis thatcher , who once summed up the role of the ideal prime ministerial spouse as " always present , never there " .
the same could not be said for mrs blair .
lifestyle guru during her ten years at number 10 , the 52-year-old has been in the headlines almost as much as her husband - and not always for the reasons she would have liked .
she has dedicated much time and energy to charity work .
she is president of barnardo 's and a trustee of anti-domestic violence charity refuge and has campaigned for the rights of women prisoners .
cherie and geri halliwell launch breast cancer awareness month she also lectures widely on human rights , is a recorder in the county and crown courts and has appeared in the european court of justice .
she was a founder member , in 2000 , of matrix chambers , set up to champion human rights and free speech .
she was chancellor of liverpool john moores university between 1996 and 2006 .
but media attention has , inevitably , focused on her extra-curricular activities .
her verbal gaffes , property deals , lecture tours and book contracts have provided ammunition to mischievous newspaper sketch-writers and filled many a column inch .
her fondness for new age spirituality and friendship with former glamour model and lifestyle guru carole caplin - who made the ill-fated introduction between the blairs and convicted fraudster peter foster - have also brought their fair share of unfavourable attention .
first lady then there is her father , the actor tony booth - best known for his role in tv sitcom till death us do part - an ever willing spokesman on his son-in-law 's plans for state pension and disability reforms .
even mrs blair 's dress sense , big smile , coiffeured locks and travelling hairdressers have suffered close scrutiny .
whatever people think of cherie blair - she has always been entertaining .
if people do not like what they see , " well , tough " seems to be the attitude .
here are some of the highs and lows of her time as the prime minister 's wife .
1 may , 1997 : it 's a brave new world - labour wins the general election and cherie poses proudly with her arms around britain 's new prime minister , tony blair , outside number 10 .
the following day a tousle-haired , nightie-clad mrs blair answers the door of her islington home to receive a bunch of flowers , cheekily sent by a tabloid in the hope of catching her looking a tad dishevelled .
november , 1999 : the blairs shock the world by announcing that cherie , 45 , is pregnant .
the baby is due in may , 2000 , and will be the couple 's fourth child .
january , 2000 : cherie is fined £ 10 after she fails to buy a ticket for her journey from blackfriars to luton , where she sits as a crown recorder at luton crown court .
march , 2000 : cherie slaps an injunction on the mail on sunday to block the publication of the memoirs of the family 's former nanny , rosalind mark .
cherie later drops the legal action against ms mark and her agent , jonathan harris , and settles with the newspaper 's publishers .
leo blair is the first child born to a serving prime minister for 150 years may , 2000 : great happiness at downing street with the announcement that cherie has given birth to a boy , called leo .
the mum-of-four says she is " tired but full of joy " and admits : " it is so long since we had our other three children that i had forgotten quite what an ordeal those last few hours of labour can be . "
august , 2000 : a political row erupts over a newspaper article by mrs blair defending government policy on human rights .
downing street insists she has written the piece in her capacity as a qc , not as the prime minister 's wife .
but the tories accuse her of emulating hillary clinton , wife of president bill , who is then running for the us senate .
may , 2002 : cherie is delighted to discover she has a 35-year-old half-sister , lucy thomas , who she never knew about .
june , 2002 : cherie causes controversy when she comments : " as long as young -lsb- palestinian -rsb- people feel they have got no hope but to blow themselves up you are never going to make progress . "
she later apologises for any offence caused by the remarks , which were made during a charity event she attended with queen raina of jordon .
august , 2002 : cherie suffers a miscarriage .
cherie weeps as she apologises for her involvement with peter foster december , 2002 : a tearful cherie apologises for the embarrassment she has caused in buying two flats in bristol with the help of convicted fraudster peter foster .
after several days of press reports about her links with the australian conman , she makes a 10-minute statement admitting she made mistakes in the controversial property deal .
she says she had not known that mr foster had ever been to prison and would never want to do anything to harm her husband , the prime minister , her children or the labour government .
acknowledging that she has a " special position " as the wife of the prime minister , with an interesting job and wonderful family , she says : " i also know i 'm not superwoman " .
the blairs are thought to have lost money on the ill-fated flats .
july , 2003 : cherie breaks into song with the beatles hit " when i 'm 64 " during a visit to the chinese capital beijing .
september , 2004 : cherie defends her decision to celebrate her 50th birthday at chequers on the anniversary of the 9/11 terror attacks , saying it is the only time all her guests could get together .
september , 2004 : cherie publishes her book , the goldfish bowl , co-written with cate haste , about life as a prime minister 's spouse .
autumn , 2004 : the blairs buy a £ 3.65m house in connaught square , london , but initially have difficulty finding a tenant .
february , 2005 : cherie phones richard and judy to complain that her husband never buys her flowers .
she said her mother had been watching and had urged her to phone in to " show up her son-in-law " .
june , 2005 : cherie nets £ 30,000 for a speech in washington billed as the inside account of the " first lady of downing street " , which coincides with her husband 's pre-g8 meeting with george bush .
tories say she should donate her fee to charity , arguing the " commercial nature " of her trip was " inappropriate " .
october , 2005 : cherie is under fire after it emerges that a charity fundraising dinner she spoke at is being investigated in australia .
although 60 % of proceeds from the dinner should have gone to a children 's charity , it receives less than 10 % .
her speaking tour of australia also prompts a host of negative publicity after it is reported she received £ 100,000 for her engagements .
cherie is a friend of ex-presidential spouse hillary clinton november , 2005 : cherie tells barrister 's magazine counsel that she would have ended up working in a shop if she had not had a free university education .
she speaks out as the government prepares to increase university tuition fees in england .
december , 2005 : cypriot president tassos papadopolous criticises cherie 's decision to represent a british couple in a land dispute in divided cyprus .
the president says it is " provocative " for the wife of the prime minister to be involved in such a case , but downing street says she is acting in a purely professional capacity .
december , 2005 : cherie rules out launching a political career when tony finally leaves downing street - despite the offer of support from bill clinton who said " if she ever campaigned for office and wanted me to go ringing doorbells for her " .
she stood unsuccessfully as a labour candidate in 1983 .
may , 2006 : cherie hits out at criticism of the £ 7,700 labour spent on her hairdressing during the previous year 's general election .
the prime minister 's wife comes under fierce attacks in the media , with one newspaper branding her the " marie-antoinette of british politics " .
but mrs blair retorts : " honestly - what a load of fuss about trivia !
it 's something about women , is n't it ?
who noticed , or who made a big fuss , that the tory party paid £ 3,500 for the leader of the opposition 's make-up ?
but women and their hair , women and their appearance - it 's part of the thing that we seem to suffer . "
september , 2006 : cherie is accused of raining on chancellor gordon brown 's parade when she is reported to have called him a liar during his keynote speech to the labour party conference .
bloomberg news agency reports that she said " well , that 's a lie " when she heard the chancellor saying it had been a privilege to work with tony blair .
his wife later tells reporters : " honestly , guys , i hate to spoil your story , but i did n't say it and i do n't believe it either . "
but bloomberg insists it stands by the story and refuses to retract it .
however , despite mrs blair 's denials - backed up by downing street - the story manages to divert attention away from the speech that mr brown had hoped would boost his chances of being the next prime minister .

australia-based oceanlinx will use its energy converter which it claims can produce enough power for 1,500 homes .
the project aims to create the world 's first large scale wave energy farm by constructing a wave hub , or " socket " , on the seabed .
it is hoped that the entire scheme when operational could generate electricity for 7,500 homes .
oceanlinx joins three other companies - ocean power technologies limited , fred olsen limited and westwave - each of which will be granted a lease of a sea area of 2 sq km .
last month the south west regional development agency announced that it had approved £ 21.5m of funding to construct wave hub , subject to uk government and eu approval .
the department of trade and industry has also committed £ 4.5m to the project .
some surfers are worried the wave devices could take energy from the waves and reduce wave heights by up to 10 % , putting the surfing industry in cornwall at risk .

australia-based oceanlinx will use its energy converter which it claims can produce enough power for 1,500 homes .
the project aims to create the world 's first large scale wave energy farm by constructing a wave hub , or " socket " , on the seabed .
it is hoped that the entire scheme when operational could generate electricity for 7,500 homes .
oceanlinx joins three other companies - ocean power technologies limited , fred olsen limited and westwave - each of which will be granted a lease of a sea area of 2 sq km .
last month the south west regional development agency announced that it had approved £ 21.5m of funding to construct wave hub , subject to uk government and eu approval .
the department of trade and industry has also committed £ 4.5m to the project .
some surfers are worried the wave devices could take energy from the waves and reduce wave heights by up to 10 % , putting the surfing industry in cornwall at risk .

bbc news -pipe- europe -pipe- playing estonia 's political cards bbc news / europe graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- saturday , 12 may 2007 , 10:10 gmt 11:10 uk playing estonia 's political cards in his third and final report from estonia , the bbc news website 's patrick jackson finds two sharply contrasting views of the soviet statue dispute within the main party of the governing coalition .
tallinn 's violent scenes over the relocation of a soviet war memorial last month must have come out of the blue for many in the outside world .
surely estonia , independent of moscow for 16 years and a proud eu and nato member , had become just another stable , settled , picturesque small state in northern europe ?
depending on who you ask , the unrest was stoked either by a resurgent moscow , seeking to reassert its influence through the large ethnic russian minority , or by a section of tallinn 's political elite , using the soviet legacy to win elections .
estonian foreign minister urmas paet points the finger very clearly at russia . "
we are in the eu and nato and it is now not possible to influence estonia by force " sergei ivanov ex-reform party mp " there are many politicians in russia who emotionally do n't accept that estonia , latvia and lithuania and some other countries are outside russian influence , " he told the bbc news website .
while he does not blame russia 's president specifically , he recalls vladimir putin 's statement two years ago that the collapse of the ussr was " the greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the century " .
" -lsb- mr putin -rsb- is not in a position , at least psychologically , to say frankly that estonia was occupied , " he argues .
" unfortunately we have seen that russia tries to use russians in estonia as a propaganda tool , as a tool to make their own politics . "
estonia , he says , has always been ready to have normal relations with russia and it is " 90 % up to moscow " whether they can be achieved .
political ideals mr paet 's political party , reform , soared to the top of estonian politics in the march general election , adding 10 % to its share of the vote to make it the biggest group in parliament .
but for sergei ivanov , an ethnic russian fellow member of the party traditionally viewed as estonia 's liberals , the election proved a personal political execution : his support collapsed to 257 votes from a one-time high of 6,000 .
and it was all because his party had chosen to ignore its russian voters and use the war memorial as a nationalist vote-winner , the former tallinn mp told the bbc news website .
when he took his baltic russian party into reform five years ago , it was on the understanding that " all liberals should work together , regardless of language , ethnicity or religion " , he says .
crucially there was also , he says , an understanding that the war monument would stay in place , having already been politically neutralised by having its soviet-era inscription removed .
there was never any trouble at the 9 may victory day commemorations until 2006 , he insists , when an estonian nationalist turned up with a flag to shout slogans .
police spirited him away from the angry crowd but the next day , mr ivanov recalls , the estonian press was seething with indignation and the talk was of a russian " fifth column " in estonia and " true faces " being shown .
scenting political capital , " young and very cynical " members persuaded reform to make the memorial 's relocation an election promise and " we started to be more radical than the radical nationalist party pro patria " .
under intense pressure from his estonian colleagues on one side and his russian constituents on the other , he stayed away from a parliamentary vote on relocation , to the scorn of estonian russians .
leaving estonia still a member of reform - " i 'm a team-player " - mr ivanov argues that developments in estonia have followed a political pattern in post-soviet eastern europe of being " anti-russian in order to create consolidation " .
" estonia 's conflict with russia is a political game , " he says .
" we are in the eu and nato and it is now not possible to influence estonia by force . "
he says he can understand that the focus of estonian leaders has been on building up their newly independent state , but feels they have ignored russian-speakers simply because they lack the skills to integrate them properly .
" young russians are leaving for other eu states , " he says .
" there are less than a million estonians and we need people to stay but they are leaving .
to be frank , many people feel uncomfortable here and it is hurting estonia . "
' love this country ' estonia 's foreign minister insists that the bronze soldier monument was a symbol of soviet occupation and had latterly been " turned into a tool of provocations and destabilised public order " .
the trouble , says mr paet , began not in 2006 but 1947 , when it was erected , because " people in the same uniform " deported or killed tens of thousands of estonians .
but is he not concerned that the removal of a symbol so revered by russians may exact a high political price eventually , both at home and abroad ?
as regards moscow , he says sanctions can be ruled out because they would be seen as targeting the whole of the eu .
the prospect of russia diverting oil and other exports to bypass estonia also fails to intimidate mr paet , who says russia accounts for about 10 % of estonia 's foreign trade today .
its loss , he says , might exert some " influence temporarily but this 10 % is in this sense not too big " .
estonian business , he adds , learnt from unhappy experience in the mid-1990s that it should seek more stable markets in the west .
thousands of people from every class and age group streamed in dignified silence to the monument at its new location in tallinn 's military cemetery this 9 may to lay mounds of flowers and hold balloons with pictures of the soldier and the words " i remember and i 'm proud ! "
so what is mr paet 's message to estonia 's own russians ?
" our first goal is that our society is not divided , is united , and it is not important if you are russian or ukrainian or estonian , " says the minister .
" the most important thing is that you are loyal to your country , you are a citizen or permanent resident , but that you love this country and would like to continue to live here . "

police spirited him away from the angry crowd but the next day , mr ivanov recalls , the estonian press was seething with indignation and the talk was of a russian " fifth column " in estonia and " true faces " being shown .
scenting political capital , " young and very cynical " members persuaded reform to make the memorial 's relocation an election promise and " we started to be more radical than the radical nationalist party pro patria " .
under intense pressure from his estonian colleagues on one side and his russian constituents on the other , he stayed away from a parliamentary vote on relocation , to the scorn of estonian russians .
leaving estonia still a member of reform - " i 'm a team-player " - mr ivanov argues that developments in estonia have followed a political pattern in post-soviet eastern europe of being " anti-russian in order to create consolidation " .
mr ivanov has tried to create a " russian wing " of the reform party " estonia 's conflict with russia is a political game , " he says .
" we are in the eu and nato and it is now not possible to influence estonia by force . "
he says he can understand that the focus of estonian leaders has been on building up their newly independent state , but feels they have ignored russian-speakers simply because they lack the skills to integrate them properly .
" young russians are leaving for other eu states , " he says .
" there are less than a million estonians and we need people to stay but they are leaving .
to be frank , many people feel uncomfortable here and it is hurting estonia . "
' love this country ' estonia 's foreign minister insists that the bronze soldier monument was a symbol of soviet occupation and had latterly been " turned into a tool of provocations and destabilised public order " .
estonia is an important route for oil and other russian exports the trouble , says mr paet , began not in 2006 but 1947 , when it was erected , because " people in the same uniform " deported or killed tens of thousands of estonians .
but is he not concerned that the removal of a symbol so revered by russians may exact a high political price eventually , both at home and abroad ?
as regards moscow , he says sanctions can be ruled out because they would be seen as targeting the whole of the eu .
the prospect of russia diverting oil and other exports to bypass estonia also fails to intimidate mr paet , who says russia accounts for about 10 % of estonia 's foreign trade today .
its loss , he says , might exert some " influence temporarily but this 10 % is in this sense not too big " .
estonian business , he adds , learnt from unhappy experience in the mid-1990s that it should seek more stable markets in the west .
thousands of people from every class and age group streamed in dignified silence to the monument at its new location in tallinn 's military cemetery this 9 may to lay mounds of flowers and hold balloons with pictures of the soldier and the words " i remember and i 'm proud ! "
so what is mr paet 's message to estonia 's own russians ?
" our first goal is that our society is not divided , is united , and it is not important if you are russian or ukrainian or estonian , " says the minister .
" the most important thing is that you are loyal to your country , you are a citizen or permanent resident , but that you love this country and would like to continue to live here . "

urmas paet says it is up to russia to improve relations tallinn 's violent scenes over the relocation of a soviet war memorial last month must have come out of the blue for many in the outside world .
surely estonia , independent of moscow for 16 years and a proud eu and nato member , had become just another stable , settled , picturesque small state in northern europe ?
depending on who you ask , the unrest was stoked either by a resurgent moscow , seeking to reassert its influence through the large ethnic russian minority , or by a section of tallinn 's political elite , using the soviet legacy to win elections .
estonian foreign minister urmas paet points the finger very clearly at russia .
we are in the eu and nato and it is now not possible to influence estonia by force sergei ivanov ex-reform party mp " there are many politicians in russia who emotionally do n't accept that estonia , latvia and lithuania and some other countries are outside russian influence , " he told the bbc news website .
while he does not blame russia 's president specifically , he recalls vladimir putin 's statement two years ago that the collapse of the ussr was " the greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the century " .
" -lsb- mr putin -rsb- is not in a position , at least psychologically , to say frankly that estonia was occupied , " he argues .
" unfortunately we have seen that russia tries to use russians in estonia as a propaganda tool , as a tool to make their own politics . "
estonia , he says , has always been ready to have normal relations with russia and it is " 90 % up to moscow " whether they can be achieved .
political ideals mr paet 's political party , reform , soared to the top of estonian politics in the march general election , adding 10 % to its share of the vote to make it the biggest group in parliament .
thousands visited the removed monument on wednesday but for sergei ivanov , an ethnic russian fellow member of the party traditionally viewed as estonia 's liberals , the election proved a personal political execution : his support collapsed to 257 votes from a one-time high of 6,000 .
and it was all because his party had chosen to ignore its russian voters and use the war memorial as a nationalist vote-winner , the former tallinn mp told the bbc news website .
when he took his baltic russian party into reform five years ago , it was on the understanding that " all liberals should work together , regardless of language , ethnicity or religion " , he says .
crucially there was also , he says , an understanding that the war monument would stay in place , having already been politically neutralised by having its soviet-era inscription removed .
