" " we envisioned that the 15 sailors would be subjected to pressure by british security and intelligence forces , " he said .
" for that reason , president ahmadinejad asked prime minister tony blair not to put pressure on the sailors for having told the truth , but -lrb- he -rrb- did not hear this humanitarian appeal . " sailors can sell stories as the diplomatic waves from the incident continued to break , britain 's ministry of defense announced that , in a highly unusual step , the captives would be allowed to sell their stories to the media . serving personnel were not normally allowed to sell their stories but the ministry decided to grant the 15 permission due to the huge media interest , said a ministry spokeswoman . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : faye turney , the only woman in the group , with iranian leaders after their release was announced " these are considered to be exceptional circumstances , " she said .
the standoff over the 15 made daily headlines in britain and around the world .
several of the sailors and marines , particularly the only woman among them , faye turney , became well known after they were shown on iranian television . " the iranians will think we 're totally mad " but the move was immediately criticized by colonel bob stewart , a former senior british army commander , who claimed it would play into iran 's hands . " it 's just unprecedented , " the colonel , a former commander of british peacekeeping forces in bosnia , told bbc television .
iran 's seizure of the 15 was " hardly one of the most glorious annals of royal naval history . " asked what he thought tehran would make of it , he said : " i think they 'll think we 're totally mad ... and they will probably think : ' i 'm glad we got rid of them because they 're self-destructing without us having to do anything . " nick harvey , defense spokesman for the opposition liberal democrats , said the decision would " raise eyebrows . " " i sincerely hope this will not backfire into a loss of public sympathy for the service personnel .
the ministry would be well advised to take a fresh look at the rules and consider whether they need revising , " he said in a statement . the sunday times reported that the group could make up to 250,000 pounds -lrb- 370,963 euros , $ 496,312 -rrb- between them and that leading seaman faye turney , the only woman in the group , could net 150,000 pounds . iran wants payback from britain meanwhile , rasoul movahedian , tehran 's ambassador to london - who was repeatedly summoned to talks with british officials during the stand-off - suggested to the financial times saturday that the regime wanted a payback for releasing the group . tehran wants london 's help in getting five iranians held in iraq by united states forces released and easing international fears about its controversial nuclear program , he indicated . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president ahmadinejad called the release of the sailors a " gift " to britain " we played our part and we showed our good will , " he told the business daily .
" now it is up to the british government to proceed in a positive way . " however he denied to the paper that the group 's liberation was linked to the case of the iranians detained in iraq or the release monday in baghdad of an iranian diplomat kidnapped at gunpoint in iraq in february . blair has also insisted there were no side deals done to secure the release but said on thursday that diplomatic negotiations had created new lines of communication between britain and iran . iran wanted to capitalize on this new dialogue to help " defuse tensions in the region , " mohavhedian said . pope had called for release of captives the eight royal navy sailors and seven royal marines were seized as they carried out what they said were routine anti-smuggling operations near the shatt al-arab waterway which divides iraq and iran on march 23 . tehran alleged they had illegally entered iranian waters , claims the britons vehemently denied on friday , despite apparently admitting doing so during their detention in iran . a british naval inquiry has been set up to establish how they came to be detained amid widespread praise in the media for their decision not to fight back against the iranians ' superior firepower several newspapers assessed that had they done so , they could have sparked an accidental conflict . meanwhile , the vatican said pope benedict xvi had written to iran 's spiritual leader but did not confirm a report in the guardian that the letter was sent hours before wednesday 's announcement of the group 's release . according to the newspaper , the pontiff urged ayatollah ali khamenei to do all he could to ensure their return home for easter in what would be taken as a " significant religious gesture of goodwill from the iranian people .

" the question which might be raised is not if , but when we will join the euro , " said polish finance minister zyta gilowska gilowska announcing plans for the referendum , with warsaw insisting it will meet the economic criteria required for euro adoption by 2009 . new eu members eager to get things right more recently , hungary 's new central bank chief , andras simor , has also talked about the possibility of the country successfully slashing its 6 percent plus deficit and joining the euro zone between 2011 and 2013 . " they are trying to establish more credible timetables , " said lars christensen , senior analyst with the copenhagen-based danske bank , with plans for euro membership seen by both financial markets and international rating agencies ' as a key anchor for their assessments of individual nations . until recently , rather than trying to knock their state finances into shape , several governments across central europe have attempted to bring their economies in line with counterparts in western europe by pursuing more expansionary economic policies . but christensen also warned that the central european nations ' plans are still very vulnerable to forces beyond the control of the national governments and could start to unravel , if the global economy suffered a major setback this year undercutting central europe 's fast-paced growth rates . or for that matter , if oil prices suddenly jumped up or if the region 's markets were engulfed by another major shake up . all eyes on slovakia so far , of the 10 new members that joined the eu about three years ago , only the small former yugoslavian state of slovenia has managed to pass the strict set of fiscal tests for euro membership .
it became the euro zone 's 13th member in january . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slovakia hopes to fulfill conditions to be able to join the euro zone but a key test of the eu newcomers prospects for taking another decisive step towards greater european integration is likely to come in the next few months when the next major candidate for euro membership - slovakia - gears up for its ambitious drive to join the common currency by january 2009 . slovakia now has about a year to ensure that its state finances are ready for joining the euro with both the european commission and the european central bank to rule during the first half of 2008 on whether the nation will be able to adopt the common currency . meanwhile , central banks in leading central european states have been moving to converge their monetary policy with the euro zone . helped by rising national currencies , bratislava 's monetary authorities last week lowered borrowing costs in slovakia by 25 basis points to 4.5 percent .

the eu now plans to streamline the process with a plan aimed at reviving negotiations on a pan-european system . talks about establishing a patent valid throughout the eu have been stalled for years .
this week , the bloc 's internal market commissioner issued a consultation paper aimed at making life easier for the continent 's innovators . the new plan aims to improve the current system and make progress towards the " community patent . " " the communication will not perform a magic trick .
i will not be pulling a rabbit out of a hat .
but i will be putting some constructive suggestions forward , " said charlie mccreevy , inernal market and services commissioner . national issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : current rules leave inventors drowning in paperwork at present , as the commission paper points out : " the european patent is not a unitary title ; it is a bundle of national patents . " at the european patent office in munich , the 200,000 or so patent applications filed each year have to list every single country in which protection from piracy is sought .
the patent also has to be translated into german , english and french , as well as the official languages of the countries concerned . all this comes at a considerable price .
the paper says that recent studies have shown that a european patent designating 13 countries is 11 times more expensive than a us patent and 13 times more than a japanese one once translation and processing costs are taken into consideration . language problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commissioner charlie mccreevy is hoping to reform the current system the london agreement , an initiative to streamline the system , is currently on ice .
it would only require the main body of the patent to be written in the applicant 's language and translated into either english , french or german .
but many eu countries have refused to sign up and the agreement itself will not go into force until it has been ratified by france . jürgen thumann , the head of the german industry confederation , thinks it is crucial that progress should be made on this issue . " the language question seems to be completely beyond resolution .
in times of global challenges europe faces becoming embroiled in complex translation rules for patent documents , " thumann said .
" the london agreement could considerably reduce these obligations .
it would sink costs considerably . " a businessman himself , thumann knows only too well how costly it can be to register a patent .
westfalia , a subsidiary of his company , recently developed a flexible and gas impermeable metal pipe that can be used in truck exhausts .
the firm has just patented the idea . costly bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : too often patent disputes end up in court " i can tell you , if you want to have a patent valid for more than 50 countries then it will quickly set you back several hundred thousand euros .
we are really talking about a lot of money here , " said thumann . the commission document also highlights another problem with the existing system .
it states : " there is no present jurisdiction for disputes on european patents which raise issues which go beyond the borders of one state . " litigation can be extremely costly , involving court costs , fees for lawyers , patent attorneys or experts , costs of witnesses , technical investigations and possibly interpreters ' and translators ' charges . specialized body bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's hoped the reforms will fuel new ideas and inventions the commission is proposing creating a specialized patent judiciary that would also have responsibility for community patents if they are introduced . commissioner mccreevy is hoping that he can break the current deadlock . " in today 's increasingly competitive global economy europe can not afford to lose ground in an area as crucial as patent policy , " he said .
" that is why i propose to have a fresh look at the various options and to work with the council and the parliament towards political consensus on real improvement of the patent system , " he said . german justice minister brigitte zypries also backs his plan .

in the speech , televised to millions of viewers in 67 countries at the end of easter sunday mass , he expressed his worries about problems facing the world , particularly in the middle east and africa .
" how many wounds , how much suffering there is in the world . natural calamities and human tragedies that cause innumerable victims and enormous material destruction are not lacking , " pope benedict said . bildunterschrift : st. peter 's square was filled with pilgrims on sunday " i am thinking of the scourge of hunger , of incurable diseases , of terrorism and kidnapping of people , of the thousand faces of violence which some people attempt to justify in the name of religion , of contempt for life , of the violation of human rights and the exploitation of persons . "
apprehension over plight of africans resplendent in his gold vestments and mitre sparkling in the sun , the pope said he was particularly pained by events and conditions in africa . " i look with apprehension at the conditions prevailing in several regions of africa , " in several parts of the world 's poorest continent , notably zimbabwe , darfur and somalia , " the pontiff said . he added that renewed fighting in somalia had " driven away the prospect of peace and worsened a regional crisis . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children in a refugee camp in darfur " in darfur and in the neighboring countries , there is a catastrophic , and , sadly to say , underestimated humanitarian situation , " the pope said . " zimbabwe is in the grip of a grievous crisis , and for this reason the bishops of that country in a recent document indicated prayer and a shared commitment for the common good as the only way forward , " he said . " nothing positive comes from iraq " in a rare mention , the pontiff also spoke out on iraq , lamenting that " nothing positive comes from iraq . " the country is " torn apart by continual slaughter as the civil population flees , " the pope said , appealing " to all those who hold in their hands the fate of iraq , that there will be an end to the brutal violence that has brought so much bloodshed to the country , and that every one of its inhabitants will be safe to lead a normal life . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violence and bloodshed continues to rack iraq easter sunday saw a series of attacks in the baghdad area that killed at least 20 people and wounded dozens , security officials said in the iraqi capital . the pope also lamented the " growing unrest and instability " in afghanistan , which is bracing for a bloody spring offensive after a resurgent taliban staged the most intensive year of fighting since they were ousted in 2001 . " peace is sorely needed " he condemned terrorism and the use of religion to justify a " thousand faces of violence . "
" peace is sorely needed , " the pontiff said . in another part of the speech , the pope said the middle east 's future was " put seriously in jeopardy " by political paralysis in lebanon , where the government is challenged by an opposition that includes hezbollah .
but he noted " some signs of hope in the dialogue between israel and the palestinian authority . "
his comments followed the formation of a palestinian unity government last month .
palestinian president mahmoud abbas also said on friday an israeli soldier , abducted by gaza militants 10 months ago in a cross-border raid , would be released soon .

in the speech , televised to millions of viewers in 67 countries at the end of easter sunday mass , he expressed his worries about problems facing the world , particularly in the middle east and africa .
" how many wounds , how much suffering there is in the world . natural calamities and human tragedies that cause innumerable victims and enormous material destruction are not lacking , " pope benedict said . bildunterschrift : st. peter 's square was filled with pilgrims on sunday " i am thinking of the scourge of hunger , of incurable diseases , of terrorism and kidnapping of people , of the thousand faces of violence which some people attempt to justify in the name of religion , of contempt for life , of the violation of human rights and the exploitation of persons . "
apprehension over plight of africans resplendent in his gold vestments and mitre sparkling in the sun , the pope said he was particularly pained by events and conditions in africa . " i look with apprehension at the conditions prevailing in several regions of africa , " in several parts of the world 's poorest continent , notably zimbabwe , darfur and somalia , " the pontiff said . he added that renewed fighting in somalia had " driven away the prospect of peace and worsened a regional crisis . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children in a refugee camp in darfur " in darfur and in the neighboring countries , there is a catastrophic , and , sadly to say , underestimated humanitarian situation , " the pope said . " zimbabwe is in the grip of a grievous crisis , and for this reason the bishops of that country in a recent document indicated prayer and a shared commitment for the common good as the only way forward , " he said . " nothing positive comes from iraq " in a rare mention , the pontiff also spoke out on iraq , lamenting that " nothing positive comes from iraq . " the country is " torn apart by continual slaughter as the civil population flees , " the pope said , appealing " to all those who hold in their hands the fate of iraq , that there will be an end to the brutal violence that has brought so much bloodshed to the country , and that every one of its inhabitants will be safe to lead a normal life . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violence and bloodshed continues to rack iraq easter sunday saw a series of attacks in the baghdad area that killed at least 20 people and wounded dozens , security officials said in the iraqi capital . the pope also lamented the " growing unrest and instability " in afghanistan , which is bracing for a bloody spring offensive after a resurgent taliban staged the most intensive year of fighting since they were ousted in 2001 . " peace is sorely needed " he condemned terrorism and the use of religion to justify a " thousand faces of violence . "
" peace is sorely needed , " the pontiff said . in another part of the speech , the pope said the middle east 's future was " put seriously in jeopardy " by political paralysis in lebanon , where the government is challenged by an opposition that includes hezbollah .
but he noted " some signs of hope in the dialogue between israel and the palestinian authority . "
his comments followed the formation of a palestinian unity government last month .
palestinian president mahmoud abbas also said on friday an israeli soldier , abducted by gaza militants 10 months ago in a cross-border raid , would be released soon .

the eu now plans to streamline the process with a plan aimed at reviving negotiations on a pan-european system . talks about establishing a patent valid throughout the eu have been stalled for years .
this week , the bloc 's internal market commissioner issued a consultation paper aimed at making life easier for the continent 's innovators . the new plan aims to improve the current system and make progress towards the " community patent . " " the communication will not perform a magic trick .
i will not be pulling a rabbit out of a hat .
but i will be putting some constructive suggestions forward , " said charlie mccreevy , inernal market and services commissioner . national issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : current rules leave inventors drowning in paperwork at present , as the commission paper points out : " the european patent is not a unitary title ; it is a bundle of national patents . " at the european patent office in munich , the 200,000 or so patent applications filed each year have to list every single country in which protection from piracy is sought .
the patent also has to be translated into german , english and french , as well as the official languages of the countries concerned . all this comes at a considerable price .
the paper says that recent studies have shown that a european patent designating 13 countries is 11 times more expensive than a us patent and 13 times more than a japanese one once translation and processing costs are taken into consideration . language problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commissioner charlie mccreevy is hoping to reform the current system the london agreement , an initiative to streamline the system , is currently on ice .
it would only require the main body of the patent to be written in the applicant 's language and translated into either english , french or german .
but many eu countries have refused to sign up and the agreement itself will not go into force until it has been ratified by france . jürgen thumann , the head of the german industry confederation , thinks it is crucial that progress should be made on this issue . " the language question seems to be completely beyond resolution .
in times of global challenges europe faces becoming embroiled in complex translation rules for patent documents , " thumann said .
" the london agreement could considerably reduce these obligations .
it would sink costs considerably . " a businessman himself , thumann knows only too well how costly it can be to register a patent .
westfalia , a subsidiary of his company , recently developed a flexible and gas impermeable metal pipe that can be used in truck exhausts .
the firm has just patented the idea . costly bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : too often patent disputes end up in court " i can tell you , if you want to have a patent valid for more than 50 countries then it will quickly set you back several hundred thousand euros .
we are really talking about a lot of money here , " said thumann . the commission document also highlights another problem with the existing system .
it states : " there is no present jurisdiction for disputes on european patents which raise issues which go beyond the borders of one state . " litigation can be extremely costly , involving court costs , fees for lawyers , patent attorneys or experts , costs of witnesses , technical investigations and possibly interpreters ' and translators ' charges . specialized body bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's hoped the reforms will fuel new ideas and inventions the commission is proposing creating a specialized patent judiciary that would also have responsibility for community patents if they are introduced . commissioner mccreevy is hoping that he can break the current deadlock . " in today 's increasingly competitive global economy europe can not afford to lose ground in an area as crucial as patent policy , " he said .
" that is why i propose to have a fresh look at the various options and to work with the council and the parliament towards political consensus on real improvement of the patent system , " he said . german justice minister brigitte zypries also backs his plan .

" the question which might be raised is not if , but when we will join the euro , " said polish finance minister zyta gilowska gilowska announcing plans for the referendum , with warsaw insisting it will meet the economic criteria required for euro adoption by 2009 . new eu members eager to get things right more recently , hungary 's new central bank chief , andras simor , has also talked about the possibility of the country successfully slashing its 6 percent plus deficit and joining the euro zone between 2011 and 2013 . " they are trying to establish more credible timetables , " said lars christensen , senior analyst with the copenhagen-based danske bank , with plans for euro membership seen by both financial markets and international rating agencies ' as a key anchor for their assessments of individual nations . until recently , rather than trying to knock their state finances into shape , several governments across central europe have attempted to bring their economies in line with counterparts in western europe by pursuing more expansionary economic policies . but christensen also warned that the central european nations ' plans are still very vulnerable to forces beyond the control of the national governments and could start to unravel , if the global economy suffered a major setback this year undercutting central europe 's fast-paced growth rates . or for that matter , if oil prices suddenly jumped up or if the region 's markets were engulfed by another major shake up . all eyes on slovakia so far , of the 10 new members that joined the eu about three years ago , only the small former yugoslavian state of slovenia has managed to pass the strict set of fiscal tests for euro membership .
it became the euro zone 's 13th member in january . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slovakia hopes to fulfill conditions to be able to join the euro zone but a key test of the eu newcomers prospects for taking another decisive step towards greater european integration is likely to come in the next few months when the next major candidate for euro membership - slovakia - gears up for its ambitious drive to join the common currency by january 2009 . slovakia now has about a year to ensure that its state finances are ready for joining the euro with both the european commission and the european central bank to rule during the first half of 2008 on whether the nation will be able to adopt the common currency . meanwhile , central banks in leading central european states have been moving to converge their monetary policy with the euro zone . helped by rising national currencies , bratislava 's monetary authorities last week lowered borrowing costs in slovakia by 25 basis points to 4.5 percent .
however , the national banks in both the czech republic and poland held rates steady at 2.5 percent and 4.0 percent respectively .
the european central bank is expected to raise the cost of money again in june to 4.0 percent . while hungary 's central bank held its prime rate on hold at 8.0 percent for the fifth consecutive month , the nation 's monetary authorities are expected to launch a new rate-cutting cycle during the second half of the year . slovakia 's failure could be setback to euro hopefuls but slovakia 's failure to be flagged through as the euro zone 's 14th member state could be seen as a setback for other nations seeking to join the euro . this is especially the case following the uproar caused last year after lithuania narrowly missed out on its plan to join the euro because its inflation rate came in marginally above the very tight inflation reference rate for euro candidates , which is below 3 percent . apart from possibly sending rating agencies scurrying to lower their ratings for nations in the region , it could trigger a wider debate about euro membership . despite plans for holding the referendum , poland is not expected to abandon the zloty and to formally join the euro in 2013 . the czech government 's aim is to merge its currency with the euro adoption by 2012 , two years later than originally planned . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu finance heads upbeat on inflation despite german risks euro zone finance ministers monday took a positive view of the inflation outlook in the 13 nations sharing the euro , despite risks of upward pressure from germany , europe 's biggest economy .

" peace is sorely needed , " the pontiff said . in another part of the speech , the pope said the middle east 's future was " put seriously in jeopardy " by political paralysis in lebanon , where the government is challenged by an opposition that includes hezbollah .
but he noted " some signs of hope in the dialogue between israel and the palestinian authority . "
his comments followed the formation of a palestinian unity government last month .

earlier teheran denied it had mistreated the navy personnel . the 15 sailors and marines who were freed on wednesday described on their return how they had been stripped , blindfolded and handcuffed during their detention . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the marines and sailors have been detailing their treatment at the hands of the iranians since their return royal marine joe tindell , 21 , said some of them thought they were about to be executed at one point , and how he , blindfolded with hands bound , had believed one of their number had had his throat cut . this version of events belied the images shown on iranian television of some of the group apparently relaxed and joking during their captivity . but ali akbar javanfekr , a spokesman for iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad , said that the suggestion of mistreatment was " a lie . " " we envisioned that the 15 sailors would be subjected to pressure by british security and intelligence forces , " he said .
" for that reason , president ahmadinejad asked prime minister tony blair not to put pressure on the sailors for having told the truth , but -lrb- he -rrb- did not hear this humanitarian appeal . " sailors can sell stories as the diplomatic waves from the incident continued to break , britain 's ministry of defense announced that , in a highly unusual step , the captives would be allowed to sell their stories to the media . serving personnel were not normally allowed to sell their stories but the ministry decided to grant the 15 permission due to the huge media interest , said a ministry spokeswoman . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : faye turney , the only woman in the group , with iranian leaders after their release was announced " these are considered to be exceptional circumstances , " she said .
the standoff over the 15 made daily headlines in britain and around the world .
several of the sailors and marines , particularly the only woman among them , faye turney , became well known after they were shown on iranian television . " the iranians will think we 're totally mad " but the move was immediately criticized by colonel bob stewart , a former senior british army commander , who claimed it would play into iran 's hands . " it 's just unprecedented , " the colonel , a former commander of british peacekeeping forces in bosnia , told bbc television .
iran 's seizure of the 15 was " hardly one of the most glorious annals of royal naval history . " asked what he thought tehran would make of it , he said : " i think they 'll think we 're totally mad ... and they will probably think : ' i 'm glad we got rid of them because they 're self-destructing without us having to do anything . " nick harvey , defense spokesman for the opposition liberal democrats , said the decision would " raise eyebrows .

the eu now plans to streamline the process with a plan aimed at reviving negotiations on a pan-european system . talks about establishing a patent valid throughout the eu have been stalled for years .
this week , the bloc 's internal market commissioner issued a consultation paper aimed at making life easier for the continent 's innovators . the new plan aims to improve the current system and make progress towards the " community patent . " " the communication will not perform a magic trick .
i will not be pulling a rabbit out of a hat .
but i will be putting some constructive suggestions forward , " said charlie mccreevy , inernal market and services commissioner . national issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : current rules leave inventors drowning in paperwork at present , as the commission paper points out : " the european patent is not a unitary title ; it is a bundle of national patents . " at the european patent office in munich , the 200,000 or so patent applications filed each year have to list every single country in which protection from piracy is sought .
the patent also has to be translated into german , english and french , as well as the official languages of the countries concerned . all this comes at a considerable price .
the paper says that recent studies have shown that a european patent designating 13 countries is 11 times more expensive than a us patent and 13 times more than a japanese one once translation and processing costs are taken into consideration . language problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commissioner charlie mccreevy is hoping to reform the current system the london agreement , an initiative to streamline the system , is currently on ice .
it would only require the main body of the patent to be written in the applicant 's language and translated into either english , french or german .
but many eu countries have refused to sign up and the agreement itself will not go into force until it has been ratified by france . jürgen thumann , the head of the german industry confederation , thinks it is crucial that progress should be made on this issue . " the language question seems to be completely beyond resolution .
in times of global challenges europe faces becoming embroiled in complex translation rules for patent documents , " thumann said .
" the london agreement could considerably reduce these obligations .
it would sink costs considerably . " a businessman himself , thumann knows only too well how costly it can be to register a patent .

we are really talking about a lot of money here , " said thumann . the commission document also highlights another problem with the existing system .
it states : " there is no present jurisdiction for disputes on european patents which raise issues which go beyond the borders of one state . " litigation can be extremely costly , involving court costs , fees for lawyers , patent attorneys or experts , costs of witnesses , technical investigations and possibly interpreters ' and translators ' charges . specialized body bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's hoped the reforms will fuel new ideas and inventions the commission is proposing creating a specialized patent judiciary that would also have responsibility for community patents if they are introduced . commissioner mccreevy is hoping that he can break the current deadlock . " in today 's increasingly competitive global economy europe can not afford to lose ground in an area as crucial as patent policy , " he said .
" that is why i propose to have a fresh look at the various options and to work with the council and the parliament towards political consensus on real improvement of the patent system , " he said . german justice minister brigitte zypries also backs his plan .

" the question which might be raised is not if , but when we will join the euro , " said polish finance minister zyta gilowska gilowska announcing plans for the referendum , with warsaw insisting it will meet the economic criteria required for euro adoption by 2009 . new eu members eager to get things right more recently , hungary 's new central bank chief , andras simor , has also talked about the possibility of the country successfully slashing its 6 percent plus deficit and joining the euro zone between 2011 and 2013 . " they are trying to establish more credible timetables , " said lars christensen , senior analyst with the copenhagen-based danske bank , with plans for euro membership seen by both financial markets and international rating agencies ' as a key anchor for their assessments of individual nations . until recently , rather than trying to knock their state finances into shape , several governments across central europe have attempted to bring their economies in line with counterparts in western europe by pursuing more expansionary economic policies . but christensen also warned that the central european nations ' plans are still very vulnerable to forces beyond the control of the national governments and could start to unravel , if the global economy suffered a major setback this year undercutting central europe 's fast-paced growth rates . or for that matter , if oil prices suddenly jumped up or if the region 's markets were engulfed by another major shake up . all eyes on slovakia so far , of the 10 new members that joined the eu about three years ago , only the small former yugoslavian state of slovenia has managed to pass the strict set of fiscal tests for euro membership .
it became the euro zone 's 13th member in january . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slovakia hopes to fulfill conditions to be able to join the euro zone but a key test of the eu newcomers prospects for taking another decisive step towards greater european integration is likely to come in the next few months when the next major candidate for euro membership - slovakia - gears up for its ambitious drive to join the common currency by january 2009 . slovakia now has about a year to ensure that its state finances are ready for joining the euro with both the european commission and the european central bank to rule during the first half of 2008 on whether the nation will be able to adopt the common currency . meanwhile , central banks in leading central european states have been moving to converge their monetary policy with the euro zone . helped by rising national currencies , bratislava 's monetary authorities last week lowered borrowing costs in slovakia by 25 basis points to 4.5 percent .
however , the national banks in both the czech republic and poland held rates steady at 2.5 percent and 4.0 percent respectively .
the european central bank is expected to raise the cost of money again in june to 4.0 percent . while hungary 's central bank held its prime rate on hold at 8.0 percent for the fifth consecutive month , the nation 's monetary authorities are expected to launch a new rate-cutting cycle during the second half of the year . slovakia 's failure could be setback to euro hopefuls but slovakia 's failure to be flagged through as the euro zone 's 14th member state could be seen as a setback for other nations seeking to join the euro . this is especially the case following the uproar caused last year after lithuania narrowly missed out on its plan to join the euro because its inflation rate came in marginally above the very tight inflation reference rate for euro candidates , which is below 3 percent . apart from possibly sending rating agencies scurrying to lower their ratings for nations in the region , it could trigger a wider debate about euro membership . despite plans for holding the referendum , poland is not expected to abandon the zloty and to formally join the euro in 2013 . the czech government 's aim is to merge its currency with the euro adoption by 2012 , two years later than originally planned . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu finance heads upbeat on inflation despite german risks euro zone finance ministers monday took a positive view of the inflation outlook in the 13 nations sharing the euro , despite risks of upward pressure from germany , europe 's biggest economy .

the eu now plans to streamline the process with a plan aimed at reviving negotiations on a pan-european system . talks about establishing a patent valid throughout the eu have been stalled for years .
this week , the bloc 's internal market commissioner issued a consultation paper aimed at making life easier for the continent 's innovators . the new plan aims to improve the current system and make progress towards the " community patent . " " the communication will not perform a magic trick .

" at the european patent office in munich , the 200,000 or so patent applications filed each year have to list every single country in which protection from piracy is sought .
the patent also has to be translated into german , english and french , as well as the official languages of the countries concerned . all this comes at a considerable price .
the paper says that recent studies have shown that a european patent designating 13 countries is 11 times more expensive than a us patent and 13 times more than a japanese one once translation and processing costs are taken into consideration . language problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commissioner charlie mccreevy is hoping to reform the current system the london agreement , an initiative to streamline the system , is currently on ice .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 08.04.2007 british sailors held by iran can sell stories to media großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sailors are in demand since their return to britain the 15 british sailors held by iran will be allowed to sell their stories to the media , in a break with usual rules , britain 's defense ministry said .
earlier teheran denied it had mistreated the navy personnel . the 15 sailors and marines who were freed on wednesday described on their return how they had been stripped , blindfolded and handcuffed during their detention . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the marines and sailors have been detailing their treatment at the hands of the iranians since their return royal marine joe tindell , 21 , said some of them thought they were about to be executed at one point , and how he , blindfolded with hands bound , had believed one of their number had had his throat cut . this version of events belied the images shown on iranian television of some of the group apparently relaxed and joking during their captivity . but ali akbar javanfekr , a spokesman for iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad , said that the suggestion of mistreatment was " a lie . " " we envisioned that the 15 sailors would be subjected to pressure by british security and intelligence forces , " he said .
" for that reason , president ahmadinejad asked prime minister tony blair not to put pressure on the sailors for having told the truth , but -lrb- he -rrb- did not hear this humanitarian appeal . " sailors can sell stories as the diplomatic waves from the incident continued to break , britain 's ministry of defense announced that , in a highly unusual step , the captives would be allowed to sell their stories to the media . serving personnel were not normally allowed to sell their stories but the ministry decided to grant the 15 permission due to the huge media interest , said a ministry spokeswoman . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : faye turney , the only woman in the group , with iranian leaders after their release was announced " these are considered to be exceptional circumstances , " she said .
the standoff over the 15 made daily headlines in britain and around the world .
several of the sailors and marines , particularly the only woman among them , faye turney , became well known after they were shown on iranian television . " the iranians will think we 're totally mad " but the move was immediately criticized by colonel bob stewart , a former senior british army commander , who claimed it would play into iran 's hands . " it 's just unprecedented , " the colonel , a former commander of british peacekeeping forces in bosnia , told bbc television .
iran 's seizure of the 15 was " hardly one of the most glorious annals of royal naval history . " asked what he thought tehran would make of it , he said : " i think they 'll think we 're totally mad ... and they will probably think : ' i 'm glad we got rid of them because they 're self-destructing without us having to do anything . " nick harvey , defense spokesman for the opposition liberal democrats , said the decision would " raise eyebrows . " " i sincerely hope this will not backfire into a loss of public sympathy for the service personnel .

" the question which might be raised is not if , but when we will join the euro , " said polish finance minister zyta gilowska gilowska announcing plans for the referendum , with warsaw insisting it will meet the economic criteria required for euro adoption by 2009 . new eu members eager to get things right more recently , hungary 's new central bank chief , andras simor , has also talked about the possibility of the country successfully slashing its 6 percent plus deficit and joining the euro zone between 2011 and 2013 . " they are trying to establish more credible timetables , " said lars christensen , senior analyst with the copenhagen-based danske bank , with plans for euro membership seen by both financial markets and international rating agencies ' as a key anchor for their assessments of individual nations . until recently , rather than trying to knock their state finances into shape , several governments across central europe have attempted to bring their economies in line with counterparts in western europe by pursuing more expansionary economic policies . but christensen also warned that the central european nations ' plans are still very vulnerable to forces beyond the control of the national governments and could start to unravel , if the global economy suffered a major setback this year undercutting central europe 's fast-paced growth rates . or for that matter , if oil prices suddenly jumped up or if the region 's markets were engulfed by another major shake up . all eyes on slovakia so far , of the 10 new members that joined the eu about three years ago , only the small former yugoslavian state of slovenia has managed to pass the strict set of fiscal tests for euro membership .
it became the euro zone 's 13th member in january . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slovakia hopes to fulfill conditions to be able to join the euro zone but a key test of the eu newcomers prospects for taking another decisive step towards greater european integration is likely to come in the next few months when the next major candidate for euro membership - slovakia - gears up for its ambitious drive to join the common currency by january 2009 . slovakia now has about a year to ensure that its state finances are ready for joining the euro with both the european commission and the european central bank to rule during the first half of 2008 on whether the nation will be able to adopt the common currency . meanwhile , central banks in leading central european states have been moving to converge their monetary policy with the euro zone . helped by rising national currencies , bratislava 's monetary authorities last week lowered borrowing costs in slovakia by 25 basis points to 4.5 percent .
however , the national banks in both the czech republic and poland held rates steady at 2.5 percent and 4.0 percent respectively .
the european central bank is expected to raise the cost of money again in june to 4.0 percent . while hungary 's central bank held its prime rate on hold at 8.0 percent for the fifth consecutive month , the nation 's monetary authorities are expected to launch a new rate-cutting cycle during the second half of the year . slovakia 's failure could be setback to euro hopefuls but slovakia 's failure to be flagged through as the euro zone 's 14th member state could be seen as a setback for other nations seeking to join the euro . this is especially the case following the uproar caused last year after lithuania narrowly missed out on its plan to join the euro because its inflation rate came in marginally above the very tight inflation reference rate for euro candidates , which is below 3 percent . apart from possibly sending rating agencies scurrying to lower their ratings for nations in the region , it could trigger a wider debate about euro membership . despite plans for holding the referendum , poland is not expected to abandon the zloty and to formally join the euro in 2013 . the czech government 's aim is to merge its currency with the euro adoption by 2012 , two years later than originally planned . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu finance heads upbeat on inflation despite german risks euro zone finance ministers monday took a positive view of the inflation outlook in the 13 nations sharing the euro , despite risks of upward pressure from germany , europe 's biggest economy .

in the speech , televised to millions of viewers in 67 countries at the end of easter sunday mass , he expressed his worries about problems facing the world , particularly in the middle east and africa .
" how many wounds , how much suffering there is in the world . natural calamities and human tragedies that cause innumerable victims and enormous material destruction are not lacking , " pope benedict said . bildunterschrift : st. peter 's square was filled with pilgrims on sunday " i am thinking of the scourge of hunger , of incurable diseases , of terrorism and kidnapping of people , of the thousand faces of violence which some people attempt to justify in the name of religion , of contempt for life , of the violation of human rights and the exploitation of persons . "
apprehension over plight of africans resplendent in his gold vestments and mitre sparkling in the sun , the pope said he was particularly pained by events and conditions in africa . " i look with apprehension at the conditions prevailing in several regions of africa , " in several parts of the world 's poorest continent , notably zimbabwe , darfur and somalia , " the pontiff said . he added that renewed fighting in somalia had " driven away the prospect of peace and worsened a regional crisis . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children in a refugee camp in darfur " in darfur and in the neighboring countries , there is a catastrophic , and , sadly to say , underestimated humanitarian situation , " the pope said . " zimbabwe is in the grip of a grievous crisis , and for this reason the bishops of that country in a recent document indicated prayer and a shared commitment for the common good as the only way forward , " he said . " nothing positive comes from iraq " in a rare mention , the pontiff also spoke out on iraq , lamenting that " nothing positive comes from iraq . " the country is " torn apart by continual slaughter as the civil population flees , " the pope said , appealing " to all those who hold in their hands the fate of iraq , that there will be an end to the brutal violence that has brought so much bloodshed to the country , and that every one of its inhabitants will be safe to lead a normal life . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violence and bloodshed continues to rack iraq easter sunday saw a series of attacks in the baghdad area that killed at least 20 people and wounded dozens , security officials said in the iraqi capital . the pope also lamented the " growing unrest and instability " in afghanistan , which is bracing for a bloody spring offensive after a resurgent taliban staged the most intensive year of fighting since they were ousted in 2001 . " peace is sorely needed " he condemned terrorism and the use of religion to justify a " thousand faces of violence . "
" peace is sorely needed , " the pontiff said . in another part of the speech , the pope said the middle east 's future was " put seriously in jeopardy " by political paralysis in lebanon , where the government is challenged by an opposition that includes hezbollah .
but he noted " some signs of hope in the dialogue between israel and the palestinian authority . "
his comments followed the formation of a palestinian unity government last month .
palestinian president mahmoud abbas also said on friday an israeli soldier , abducted by gaza militants 10 months ago in a cross-border raid , would be released soon .

earlier teheran denied it had mistreated the navy personnel . the 15 sailors and marines who were freed on wednesday described on their return how they had been stripped , blindfolded and handcuffed during their detention . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the marines and sailors have been detailing their treatment at the hands of the iranians since their return royal marine joe tindell , 21 , said some of them thought they were about to be executed at one point , and how he , blindfolded with hands bound , had believed one of their number had had his throat cut . this version of events belied the images shown on iranian television of some of the group apparently relaxed and joking during their captivity . but ali akbar javanfekr , a spokesman for iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad , said that the suggestion of mistreatment was " a lie . " " we envisioned that the 15 sailors would be subjected to pressure by british security and intelligence forces , " he said .
" for that reason , president ahmadinejad asked prime minister tony blair not to put pressure on the sailors for having told the truth , but -lrb- he -rrb- did not hear this humanitarian appeal . " sailors can sell stories as the diplomatic waves from the incident continued to break , britain 's ministry of defense announced that , in a highly unusual step , the captives would be allowed to sell their stories to the media . serving personnel were not normally allowed to sell their stories but the ministry decided to grant the 15 permission due to the huge media interest , said a ministry spokeswoman . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : faye turney , the only woman in the group , with iranian leaders after their release was announced " these are considered to be exceptional circumstances , " she said .
the standoff over the 15 made daily headlines in britain and around the world .
several of the sailors and marines , particularly the only woman among them , faye turney , became well known after they were shown on iranian television . " the iranians will think we 're totally mad " but the move was immediately criticized by colonel bob stewart , a former senior british army commander , who claimed it would play into iran 's hands . " it 's just unprecedented , " the colonel , a former commander of british peacekeeping forces in bosnia , told bbc television .
iran 's seizure of the 15 was " hardly one of the most glorious annals of royal naval history . " asked what he thought tehran would make of it , he said : " i think they 'll think we 're totally mad ... and they will probably think : ' i 'm glad we got rid of them because they 're self-destructing without us having to do anything . " nick harvey , defense spokesman for the opposition liberal democrats , said the decision would " raise eyebrows . " " i sincerely hope this will not backfire into a loss of public sympathy for the service personnel .
the ministry would be well advised to take a fresh look at the rules and consider whether they need revising , " he said in a statement . the sunday times reported that the group could make up to 250,000 pounds -lrb- 370,963 euros , $ 496,312 -rrb- between them and that leading seaman faye turney , the only woman in the group , could net 150,000 pounds . iran wants payback from britain meanwhile , rasoul movahedian , tehran 's ambassador to london - who was repeatedly summoned to talks with british officials during the stand-off - suggested to the financial times saturday that the regime wanted a payback for releasing the group . tehran wants london 's help in getting five iranians held in iraq by united states forces released and easing international fears about its controversial nuclear program , he indicated . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president ahmadinejad called the release of the sailors a " gift " to britain " we played our part and we showed our good will , " he told the business daily .

the eu now plans to streamline the process with a plan aimed at reviving negotiations on a pan-european system . talks about establishing a patent valid throughout the eu have been stalled for years .
this week , the bloc 's internal market commissioner issued a consultation paper aimed at making life easier for the continent 's innovators . the new plan aims to improve the current system and make progress towards the " community patent . " " the communication will not perform a magic trick .
i will not be pulling a rabbit out of a hat .
but i will be putting some constructive suggestions forward , " said charlie mccreevy , inernal market and services commissioner . national issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : current rules leave inventors drowning in paperwork at present , as the commission paper points out : " the european patent is not a unitary title ; it is a bundle of national patents . " at the european patent office in munich , the 200,000 or so patent applications filed each year have to list every single country in which protection from piracy is sought .
the patent also has to be translated into german , english and french , as well as the official languages of the countries concerned . all this comes at a considerable price .
the paper says that recent studies have shown that a european patent designating 13 countries is 11 times more expensive than a us patent and 13 times more than a japanese one once translation and processing costs are taken into consideration . language problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commissioner charlie mccreevy is hoping to reform the current system the london agreement , an initiative to streamline the system , is currently on ice .
it would only require the main body of the patent to be written in the applicant 's language and translated into either english , french or german .
but many eu countries have refused to sign up and the agreement itself will not go into force until it has been ratified by france . jürgen thumann , the head of the german industry confederation , thinks it is crucial that progress should be made on this issue . " the language question seems to be completely beyond resolution .
in times of global challenges europe faces becoming embroiled in complex translation rules for patent documents , " thumann said .

in the speech , televised to millions of viewers in 67 countries at the end of easter sunday mass , he expressed his worries about problems facing the world , particularly in the middle east and africa .
" how many wounds , how much suffering there is in the world . natural calamities and human tragedies that cause innumerable victims and enormous material destruction are not lacking , " pope benedict said . bildunterschrift : st. peter 's square was filled with pilgrims on sunday " i am thinking of the scourge of hunger , of incurable diseases , of terrorism and kidnapping of people , of the thousand faces of violence which some people attempt to justify in the name of religion , of contempt for life , of the violation of human rights and the exploitation of persons . "
apprehension over plight of africans resplendent in his gold vestments and mitre sparkling in the sun , the pope said he was particularly pained by events and conditions in africa . " i look with apprehension at the conditions prevailing in several regions of africa , " in several parts of the world 's poorest continent , notably zimbabwe , darfur and somalia , " the pontiff said . he added that renewed fighting in somalia had " driven away the prospect of peace and worsened a regional crisis .

" nothing positive comes from iraq " in a rare mention , the pontiff also spoke out on iraq , lamenting that " nothing positive comes from iraq . " the country is " torn apart by continual slaughter as the civil population flees , " the pope said , appealing " to all those who hold in their hands the fate of iraq , that there will be an end to the brutal violence that has brought so much bloodshed to the country , and that every one of its inhabitants will be safe to lead a normal life . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violence and bloodshed continues to rack iraq easter sunday saw a series of attacks in the baghdad area that killed at least 20 people and wounded dozens , security officials said in the iraqi capital . the pope also lamented the " growing unrest and instability " in afghanistan , which is bracing for a bloody spring offensive after a resurgent taliban staged the most intensive year of fighting since they were ousted in 2001 . " peace is sorely needed " he condemned terrorism and the use of religion to justify a " thousand faces of violence . "
" peace is sorely needed , " the pontiff said . in another part of the speech , the pope said the middle east 's future was " put seriously in jeopardy " by political paralysis in lebanon , where the government is challenged by an opposition that includes hezbollah .
but he noted " some signs of hope in the dialogue between israel and the palestinian authority . "
his comments followed the formation of a palestinian unity government last month .
palestinian president mahmoud abbas also said on friday an israeli soldier , abducted by gaza militants 10 months ago in a cross-border raid , would be released soon .

several of the sailors and marines , particularly the only woman among them , faye turney , became well known after they were shown on iranian television . " the iranians will think we 're totally mad " but the move was immediately criticized by colonel bob stewart , a former senior british army commander , who claimed it would play into iran 's hands . " it 's just unprecedented , " the colonel , a former commander of british peacekeeping forces in bosnia , told bbc television .
iran 's seizure of the 15 was " hardly one of the most glorious annals of royal naval history . " asked what he thought tehran would make of it , he said : " i think they 'll think we 're totally mad ... and they will probably think : ' i 'm glad we got rid of them because they 're self-destructing without us having to do anything . " nick harvey , defense spokesman for the opposition liberal democrats , said the decision would " raise eyebrows . " " i sincerely hope this will not backfire into a loss of public sympathy for the service personnel .
the ministry would be well advised to take a fresh look at the rules and consider whether they need revising , " he said in a statement . the sunday times reported that the group could make up to 250,000 pounds -lrb- 370,963 euros , $ 496,312 -rrb- between them and that leading seaman faye turney , the only woman in the group , could net 150,000 pounds . iran wants payback from britain meanwhile , rasoul movahedian , tehran 's ambassador to london - who was repeatedly summoned to talks with british officials during the stand-off - suggested to the financial times saturday that the regime wanted a payback for releasing the group . tehran wants london 's help in getting five iranians held in iraq by united states forces released and easing international fears about its controversial nuclear program , he indicated . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president ahmadinejad called the release of the sailors a " gift " to britain " we played our part and we showed our good will , " he told the business daily .
" now it is up to the british government to proceed in a positive way . " however he denied to the paper that the group 's liberation was linked to the case of the iranians detained in iraq or the release monday in baghdad of an iranian diplomat kidnapped at gunpoint in iraq in february . blair has also insisted there were no side deals done to secure the release but said on thursday that diplomatic negotiations had created new lines of communication between britain and iran . iran wanted to capitalize on this new dialogue to help " defuse tensions in the region , " mohavhedian said . pope had called for release of captives the eight royal navy sailors and seven royal marines were seized as they carried out what they said were routine anti-smuggling operations near the shatt al-arab waterway which divides iraq and iran on march 23 . tehran alleged they had illegally entered iranian waters , claims the britons vehemently denied on friday , despite apparently admitting doing so during their detention in iran . a british naval inquiry has been set up to establish how they came to be detained amid widespread praise in the media for their decision not to fight back against the iranians ' superior firepower several newspapers assessed that had they done so , they could have sparked an accidental conflict . meanwhile , the vatican said pope benedict xvi had written to iran 's spiritual leader but did not confirm a report in the guardian that the letter was sent hours before wednesday 's announcement of the group 's release . according to the newspaper , the pontiff urged ayatollah ali khamenei to do all he could to ensure their return home for easter in what would be taken as a " significant religious gesture of goodwill from the iranian people .

" the question which might be raised is not if , but when we will join the euro , " said polish finance minister zyta gilowska gilowska announcing plans for the referendum , with warsaw insisting it will meet the economic criteria required for euro adoption by 2009 . new eu members eager to get things right more recently , hungary 's new central bank chief , andras simor , has also talked about the possibility of the country successfully slashing its 6 percent plus deficit and joining the euro zone between 2011 and 2013 . " they are trying to establish more credible timetables , " said lars christensen , senior analyst with the copenhagen-based danske bank , with plans for euro membership seen by both financial markets and international rating agencies ' as a key anchor for their assessments of individual nations . until recently , rather than trying to knock their state finances into shape , several governments across central europe have attempted to bring their economies in line with counterparts in western europe by pursuing more expansionary economic policies . but christensen also warned that the central european nations ' plans are still very vulnerable to forces beyond the control of the national governments and could start to unravel , if the global economy suffered a major setback this year undercutting central europe 's fast-paced growth rates . or for that matter , if oil prices suddenly jumped up or if the region 's markets were engulfed by another major shake up . all eyes on slovakia so far , of the 10 new members that joined the eu about three years ago , only the small former yugoslavian state of slovenia has managed to pass the strict set of fiscal tests for euro membership .
it became the euro zone 's 13th member in january . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slovakia hopes to fulfill conditions to be able to join the euro zone but a key test of the eu newcomers prospects for taking another decisive step towards greater european integration is likely to come in the next few months when the next major candidate for euro membership - slovakia - gears up for its ambitious drive to join the common currency by january 2009 . slovakia now has about a year to ensure that its state finances are ready for joining the euro with both the european commission and the european central bank to rule during the first half of 2008 on whether the nation will be able to adopt the common currency . meanwhile , central banks in leading central european states have been moving to converge their monetary policy with the euro zone . helped by rising national currencies , bratislava 's monetary authorities last week lowered borrowing costs in slovakia by 25 basis points to 4.5 percent .
however , the national banks in both the czech republic and poland held rates steady at 2.5 percent and 4.0 percent respectively .
the european central bank is expected to raise the cost of money again in june to 4.0 percent . while hungary 's central bank held its prime rate on hold at 8.0 percent for the fifth consecutive month , the nation 's monetary authorities are expected to launch a new rate-cutting cycle during the second half of the year . slovakia 's failure could be setback to euro hopefuls but slovakia 's failure to be flagged through as the euro zone 's 14th member state could be seen as a setback for other nations seeking to join the euro . this is especially the case following the uproar caused last year after lithuania narrowly missed out on its plan to join the euro because its inflation rate came in marginally above the very tight inflation reference rate for euro candidates , which is below 3 percent . apart from possibly sending rating agencies scurrying to lower their ratings for nations in the region , it could trigger a wider debate about euro membership . despite plans for holding the referendum , poland is not expected to abandon the zloty and to formally join the euro in 2013 . the czech government 's aim is to merge its currency with the euro adoption by 2012 , two years later than originally planned . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu finance heads upbeat on inflation despite german risks euro zone finance ministers monday took a positive view of the inflation outlook in the 13 nations sharing the euro , despite risks of upward pressure from germany , europe 's biggest economy .

earlier teheran denied it had mistreated the navy personnel . the 15 sailors and marines who were freed on wednesday described on their return how they had been stripped , blindfolded and handcuffed during their detention . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the marines and sailors have been detailing their treatment at the hands of the iranians since their return royal marine joe tindell , 21 , said some of them thought they were about to be executed at one point , and how he , blindfolded with hands bound , had believed one of their number had had his throat cut . this version of events belied the images shown on iranian television of some of the group apparently relaxed and joking during their captivity . but ali akbar javanfekr , a spokesman for iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad , said that the suggestion of mistreatment was " a lie . " " we envisioned that the 15 sailors would be subjected to pressure by british security and intelligence forces , " he said .
" for that reason , president ahmadinejad asked prime minister tony blair not to put pressure on the sailors for having told the truth , but -lrb- he -rrb- did not hear this humanitarian appeal . " sailors can sell stories as the diplomatic waves from the incident continued to break , britain 's ministry of defense announced that , in a highly unusual step , the captives would be allowed to sell their stories to the media . serving personnel were not normally allowed to sell their stories but the ministry decided to grant the 15 permission due to the huge media interest , said a ministry spokeswoman . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : faye turney , the only woman in the group , with iranian leaders after their release was announced " these are considered to be exceptional circumstances , " she said .
the standoff over the 15 made daily headlines in britain and around the world .
several of the sailors and marines , particularly the only woman among them , faye turney , became well known after they were shown on iranian television . " the iranians will think we 're totally mad " but the move was immediately criticized by colonel bob stewart , a former senior british army commander , who claimed it would play into iran 's hands . " it 's just unprecedented , " the colonel , a former commander of british peacekeeping forces in bosnia , told bbc television .
iran 's seizure of the 15 was " hardly one of the most glorious annals of royal naval history . " asked what he thought tehran would make of it , he said : " i think they 'll think we 're totally mad ... and they will probably think : ' i 'm glad we got rid of them because they 're self-destructing without us having to do anything . " nick harvey , defense spokesman for the opposition liberal democrats , said the decision would " raise eyebrows . " " i sincerely hope this will not backfire into a loss of public sympathy for the service personnel .
the ministry would be well advised to take a fresh look at the rules and consider whether they need revising , " he said in a statement . the sunday times reported that the group could make up to 250,000 pounds -lrb- 370,963 euros , $ 496,312 -rrb- between them and that leading seaman faye turney , the only woman in the group , could net 150,000 pounds . iran wants payback from britain meanwhile , rasoul movahedian , tehran 's ambassador to london - who was repeatedly summoned to talks with british officials during the stand-off - suggested to the financial times saturday that the regime wanted a payback for releasing the group . tehran wants london 's help in getting five iranians held in iraq by united states forces released and easing international fears about its controversial nuclear program , he indicated . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president ahmadinejad called the release of the sailors a " gift " to britain " we played our part and we showed our good will , " he told the business daily .
" now it is up to the british government to proceed in a positive way . " however he denied to the paper that the group 's liberation was linked to the case of the iranians detained in iraq or the release monday in baghdad of an iranian diplomat kidnapped at gunpoint in iraq in february . blair has also insisted there were no side deals done to secure the release but said on thursday that diplomatic negotiations had created new lines of communication between britain and iran . iran wanted to capitalize on this new dialogue to help " defuse tensions in the region , " mohavhedian said . pope had called for release of captives the eight royal navy sailors and seven royal marines were seized as they carried out what they said were routine anti-smuggling operations near the shatt al-arab waterway which divides iraq and iran on march 23 . tehran alleged they had illegally entered iranian waters , claims the britons vehemently denied on friday , despite apparently admitting doing so during their detention in iran . a british naval inquiry has been set up to establish how they came to be detained amid widespread praise in the media for their decision not to fight back against the iranians ' superior firepower several newspapers assessed that had they done so , they could have sparked an accidental conflict . meanwhile , the vatican said pope benedict xvi had written to iran 's spiritual leader but did not confirm a report in the guardian that the letter was sent hours before wednesday 's announcement of the group 's release . according to the newspaper , the pontiff urged ayatollah ali khamenei to do all he could to ensure their return home for easter in what would be taken as a " significant religious gesture of goodwill from the iranian people .

" the question which might be raised is not if , but when we will join the euro , " said polish finance minister zyta gilowska gilowska announcing plans for the referendum , with warsaw insisting it will meet the economic criteria required for euro adoption by 2009 . new eu members eager to get things right more recently , hungary 's new central bank chief , andras simor , has also talked about the possibility of the country successfully slashing its 6 percent plus deficit and joining the euro zone between 2011 and 2013 . " they are trying to establish more credible timetables , " said lars christensen , senior analyst with the copenhagen-based danske bank , with plans for euro membership seen by both financial markets and international rating agencies ' as a key anchor for their assessments of individual nations . until recently , rather than trying to knock their state finances into shape , several governments across central europe have attempted to bring their economies in line with counterparts in western europe by pursuing more expansionary economic policies . but christensen also warned that the central european nations ' plans are still very vulnerable to forces beyond the control of the national governments and could start to unravel , if the global economy suffered a major setback this year undercutting central europe 's fast-paced growth rates . or for that matter , if oil prices suddenly jumped up or if the region 's markets were engulfed by another major shake up . all eyes on slovakia so far , of the 10 new members that joined the eu about three years ago , only the small former yugoslavian state of slovenia has managed to pass the strict set of fiscal tests for euro membership .
it became the euro zone 's 13th member in january . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slovakia hopes to fulfill conditions to be able to join the euro zone but a key test of the eu newcomers prospects for taking another decisive step towards greater european integration is likely to come in the next few months when the next major candidate for euro membership - slovakia - gears up for its ambitious drive to join the common currency by january 2009 . slovakia now has about a year to ensure that its state finances are ready for joining the euro with both the european commission and the european central bank to rule during the first half of 2008 on whether the nation will be able to adopt the common currency . meanwhile , central banks in leading central european states have been moving to converge their monetary policy with the euro zone . helped by rising national currencies , bratislava 's monetary authorities last week lowered borrowing costs in slovakia by 25 basis points to 4.5 percent .
however , the national banks in both the czech republic and poland held rates steady at 2.5 percent and 4.0 percent respectively .
the european central bank is expected to raise the cost of money again in june to 4.0 percent . while hungary 's central bank held its prime rate on hold at 8.0 percent for the fifth consecutive month , the nation 's monetary authorities are expected to launch a new rate-cutting cycle during the second half of the year . slovakia 's failure could be setback to euro hopefuls but slovakia 's failure to be flagged through as the euro zone 's 14th member state could be seen as a setback for other nations seeking to join the euro . this is especially the case following the uproar caused last year after lithuania narrowly missed out on its plan to join the euro because its inflation rate came in marginally above the very tight inflation reference rate for euro candidates , which is below 3 percent . apart from possibly sending rating agencies scurrying to lower their ratings for nations in the region , it could trigger a wider debate about euro membership . despite plans for holding the referendum , poland is not expected to abandon the zloty and to formally join the euro in 2013 . the czech government 's aim is to merge its currency with the euro adoption by 2012 , two years later than originally planned . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu finance heads upbeat on inflation despite german risks euro zone finance ministers monday took a positive view of the inflation outlook in the 13 nations sharing the euro , despite risks of upward pressure from germany , europe 's biggest economy .

the eu now plans to streamline the process with a plan aimed at reviving negotiations on a pan-european system . talks about establishing a patent valid throughout the eu have been stalled for years .
this week , the bloc 's internal market commissioner issued a consultation paper aimed at making life easier for the continent 's innovators . the new plan aims to improve the current system and make progress towards the " community patent . " " the communication will not perform a magic trick .

" at the european patent office in munich , the 200,000 or so patent applications filed each year have to list every single country in which protection from piracy is sought .
the patent also has to be translated into german , english and french , as well as the official languages of the countries concerned . all this comes at a considerable price .
the paper says that recent studies have shown that a european patent designating 13 countries is 11 times more expensive than a us patent and 13 times more than a japanese one once translation and processing costs are taken into consideration . language problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commissioner charlie mccreevy is hoping to reform the current system the london agreement , an initiative to streamline the system , is currently on ice .
it would only require the main body of the patent to be written in the applicant 's language and translated into either english , french or german .
but many eu countries have refused to sign up and the agreement itself will not go into force until it has been ratified by france . jürgen thumann , the head of the german industry confederation , thinks it is crucial that progress should be made on this issue . " the language question seems to be completely beyond resolution .

" " we envisioned that the 15 sailors would be subjected to pressure by british security and intelligence forces , " he said .
" for that reason , president ahmadinejad asked prime minister tony blair not to put pressure on the sailors for having told the truth , but -lrb- he -rrb- did not hear this humanitarian appeal . " sailors can sell stories as the diplomatic waves from the incident continued to break , britain 's ministry of defense announced that , in a highly unusual step , the captives would be allowed to sell their stories to the media . serving personnel were not normally allowed to sell their stories but the ministry decided to grant the 15 permission due to the huge media interest , said a ministry spokeswoman . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : faye turney , the only woman in the group , with iranian leaders after their release was announced " these are considered to be exceptional circumstances , " she said .
the standoff over the 15 made daily headlines in britain and around the world .
several of the sailors and marines , particularly the only woman among them , faye turney , became well known after they were shown on iranian television . " the iranians will think we 're totally mad " but the move was immediately criticized by colonel bob stewart , a former senior british army commander , who claimed it would play into iran 's hands . " it 's just unprecedented , " the colonel , a former commander of british peacekeeping forces in bosnia , told bbc television .
iran 's seizure of the 15 was " hardly one of the most glorious annals of royal naval history . " asked what he thought tehran would make of it , he said : " i think they 'll think we 're totally mad ... and they will probably think : ' i 'm glad we got rid of them because they 're self-destructing without us having to do anything . " nick harvey , defense spokesman for the opposition liberal democrats , said the decision would " raise eyebrows . " " i sincerely hope this will not backfire into a loss of public sympathy for the service personnel .
the ministry would be well advised to take a fresh look at the rules and consider whether they need revising , " he said in a statement . the sunday times reported that the group could make up to 250,000 pounds -lrb- 370,963 euros , $ 496,312 -rrb- between them and that leading seaman faye turney , the only woman in the group , could net 150,000 pounds . iran wants payback from britain meanwhile , rasoul movahedian , tehran 's ambassador to london - who was repeatedly summoned to talks with british officials during the stand-off - suggested to the financial times saturday that the regime wanted a payback for releasing the group . tehran wants london 's help in getting five iranians held in iraq by united states forces released and easing international fears about its controversial nuclear program , he indicated . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president ahmadinejad called the release of the sailors a " gift " to britain " we played our part and we showed our good will , " he told the business daily .
" now it is up to the british government to proceed in a positive way . " however he denied to the paper that the group 's liberation was linked to the case of the iranians detained in iraq or the release monday in baghdad of an iranian diplomat kidnapped at gunpoint in iraq in february . blair has also insisted there were no side deals done to secure the release but said on thursday that diplomatic negotiations had created new lines of communication between britain and iran . iran wanted to capitalize on this new dialogue to help " defuse tensions in the region , " mohavhedian said . pope had called for release of captives the eight royal navy sailors and seven royal marines were seized as they carried out what they said were routine anti-smuggling operations near the shatt al-arab waterway which divides iraq and iran on march 23 . tehran alleged they had illegally entered iranian waters , claims the britons vehemently denied on friday , despite apparently admitting doing so during their detention in iran . a british naval inquiry has been set up to establish how they came to be detained amid widespread praise in the media for their decision not to fight back against the iranians ' superior firepower several newspapers assessed that had they done so , they could have sparked an accidental conflict . meanwhile , the vatican said pope benedict xvi had written to iran 's spiritual leader but did not confirm a report in the guardian that the letter was sent hours before wednesday 's announcement of the group 's release . according to the newspaper , the pontiff urged ayatollah ali khamenei to do all he could to ensure their return home for easter in what would be taken as a " significant religious gesture of goodwill from the iranian people .

earlier teheran denied it had mistreated the navy personnel . the 15 sailors and marines who were freed on wednesday described on their return how they had been stripped , blindfolded and handcuffed during their detention . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the marines and sailors have been detailing their treatment at the hands of the iranians since their return royal marine joe tindell , 21 , said some of them thought they were about to be executed at one point , and how he , blindfolded with hands bound , had believed one of their number had had his throat cut . this version of events belied the images shown on iranian television of some of the group apparently relaxed and joking during their captivity . but ali akbar javanfekr , a spokesman for iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad , said that the suggestion of mistreatment was " a lie . " " we envisioned that the 15 sailors would be subjected to pressure by british security and intelligence forces , " he said .
" for that reason , president ahmadinejad asked prime minister tony blair not to put pressure on the sailors for having told the truth , but -lrb- he -rrb- did not hear this humanitarian appeal . " sailors can sell stories as the diplomatic waves from the incident continued to break , britain 's ministry of defense announced that , in a highly unusual step , the captives would be allowed to sell their stories to the media . serving personnel were not normally allowed to sell their stories but the ministry decided to grant the 15 permission due to the huge media interest , said a ministry spokeswoman . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : faye turney , the only woman in the group , with iranian leaders after their release was announced " these are considered to be exceptional circumstances , " she said .
the standoff over the 15 made daily headlines in britain and around the world .
several of the sailors and marines , particularly the only woman among them , faye turney , became well known after they were shown on iranian television . " the iranians will think we 're totally mad " but the move was immediately criticized by colonel bob stewart , a former senior british army commander , who claimed it would play into iran 's hands . " it 's just unprecedented , " the colonel , a former commander of british peacekeeping forces in bosnia , told bbc television .
iran 's seizure of the 15 was " hardly one of the most glorious annals of royal naval history . " asked what he thought tehran would make of it , he said : " i think they 'll think we 're totally mad ... and they will probably think : ' i 'm glad we got rid of them because they 're self-destructing without us having to do anything . " nick harvey , defense spokesman for the opposition liberal democrats , said the decision would " raise eyebrows . " " i sincerely hope this will not backfire into a loss of public sympathy for the service personnel .
the ministry would be well advised to take a fresh look at the rules and consider whether they need revising , " he said in a statement . the sunday times reported that the group could make up to 250,000 pounds -lrb- 370,963 euros , $ 496,312 -rrb- between them and that leading seaman faye turney , the only woman in the group , could net 150,000 pounds . iran wants payback from britain meanwhile , rasoul movahedian , tehran 's ambassador to london - who was repeatedly summoned to talks with british officials during the stand-off - suggested to the financial times saturday that the regime wanted a payback for releasing the group . tehran wants london 's help in getting five iranians held in iraq by united states forces released and easing international fears about its controversial nuclear program , he indicated . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president ahmadinejad called the release of the sailors a " gift " to britain " we played our part and we showed our good will , " he told the business daily .
" now it is up to the british government to proceed in a positive way . " however he denied to the paper that the group 's liberation was linked to the case of the iranians detained in iraq or the release monday in baghdad of an iranian diplomat kidnapped at gunpoint in iraq in february . blair has also insisted there were no side deals done to secure the release but said on thursday that diplomatic negotiations had created new lines of communication between britain and iran . iran wanted to capitalize on this new dialogue to help " defuse tensions in the region , " mohavhedian said . pope had called for release of captives the eight royal navy sailors and seven royal marines were seized as they carried out what they said were routine anti-smuggling operations near the shatt al-arab waterway which divides iraq and iran on march 23 . tehran alleged they had illegally entered iranian waters , claims the britons vehemently denied on friday , despite apparently admitting doing so during their detention in iran . a british naval inquiry has been set up to establish how they came to be detained amid widespread praise in the media for their decision not to fight back against the iranians ' superior firepower several newspapers assessed that had they done so , they could have sparked an accidental conflict . meanwhile , the vatican said pope benedict xvi had written to iran 's spiritual leader but did not confirm a report in the guardian that the letter was sent hours before wednesday 's announcement of the group 's release . according to the newspaper , the pontiff urged ayatollah ali khamenei to do all he could to ensure their return home for easter in what would be taken as a " significant religious gesture of goodwill from the iranian people .

" the question which might be raised is not if , but when we will join the euro , " said polish finance minister zyta gilowska gilowska announcing plans for the referendum , with warsaw insisting it will meet the economic criteria required for euro adoption by 2009 . new eu members eager to get things right more recently , hungary 's new central bank chief , andras simor , has also talked about the possibility of the country successfully slashing its 6 percent plus deficit and joining the euro zone between 2011 and 2013 . " they are trying to establish more credible timetables , " said lars christensen , senior analyst with the copenhagen-based danske bank , with plans for euro membership seen by both financial markets and international rating agencies ' as a key anchor for their assessments of individual nations . until recently , rather than trying to knock their state finances into shape , several governments across central europe have attempted to bring their economies in line with counterparts in western europe by pursuing more expansionary economic policies . but christensen also warned that the central european nations ' plans are still very vulnerable to forces beyond the control of the national governments and could start to unravel , if the global economy suffered a major setback this year undercutting central europe 's fast-paced growth rates . or for that matter , if oil prices suddenly jumped up or if the region 's markets were engulfed by another major shake up . all eyes on slovakia so far , of the 10 new members that joined the eu about three years ago , only the small former yugoslavian state of slovenia has managed to pass the strict set of fiscal tests for euro membership .

in the speech , televised to millions of viewers in 67 countries at the end of easter sunday mass , he expressed his worries about problems facing the world , particularly in the middle east and africa .
" how many wounds , how much suffering there is in the world . natural calamities and human tragedies that cause innumerable victims and enormous material destruction are not lacking , " pope benedict said . bildunterschrift : st. peter 's square was filled with pilgrims on sunday " i am thinking of the scourge of hunger , of incurable diseases , of terrorism and kidnapping of people , of the thousand faces of violence which some people attempt to justify in the name of religion , of contempt for life , of the violation of human rights and the exploitation of persons . "
apprehension over plight of africans resplendent in his gold vestments and mitre sparkling in the sun , the pope said he was particularly pained by events and conditions in africa . " i look with apprehension at the conditions prevailing in several regions of africa , " in several parts of the world 's poorest continent , notably zimbabwe , darfur and somalia , " the pontiff said . he added that renewed fighting in somalia had " driven away the prospect of peace and worsened a regional crisis .

" the country is " torn apart by continual slaughter as the civil population flees , " the pope said , appealing " to all those who hold in their hands the fate of iraq , that there will be an end to the brutal violence that has brought so much bloodshed to the country , and that every one of its inhabitants will be safe to lead a normal life .

" peace is sorely needed " he condemned terrorism and the use of religion to justify a " thousand faces of violence . "
" peace is sorely needed , " the pontiff said . in another part of the speech , the pope said the middle east 's future was " put seriously in jeopardy " by political paralysis in lebanon , where the government is challenged by an opposition that includes hezbollah .
but he noted " some signs of hope in the dialogue between israel and the palestinian authority . "
his comments followed the formation of a palestinian unity government last month .
palestinian president mahmoud abbas also said on friday an israeli soldier , abducted by gaza militants 10 months ago in a cross-border raid , would be released soon .

in the speech , televised to millions of viewers in 67 countries at the end of easter sunday mass , he expressed his worries about problems facing the world , particularly in the middle east and africa .
" how many wounds , how much suffering there is in the world . natural calamities and human tragedies that cause innumerable victims and enormous material destruction are not lacking , " pope benedict said . bildunterschrift : st. peter 's square was filled with pilgrims on sunday " i am thinking of the scourge of hunger , of incurable diseases , of terrorism and kidnapping of people , of the thousand faces of violence which some people attempt to justify in the name of religion , of contempt for life , of the violation of human rights and the exploitation of persons . "
apprehension over plight of africans resplendent in his gold vestments and mitre sparkling in the sun , the pope said he was particularly pained by events and conditions in africa . " i look with apprehension at the conditions prevailing in several regions of africa , " in several parts of the world 's poorest continent , notably zimbabwe , darfur and somalia , " the pontiff said . he added that renewed fighting in somalia had " driven away the prospect of peace and worsened a regional crisis . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children in a refugee camp in darfur " in darfur and in the neighboring countries , there is a catastrophic , and , sadly to say , underestimated humanitarian situation , " the pope said . " zimbabwe is in the grip of a grievous crisis , and for this reason the bishops of that country in a recent document indicated prayer and a shared commitment for the common good as the only way forward , " he said . " nothing positive comes from iraq " in a rare mention , the pontiff also spoke out on iraq , lamenting that " nothing positive comes from iraq . " the country is " torn apart by continual slaughter as the civil population flees , " the pope said , appealing " to all those who hold in their hands the fate of iraq , that there will be an end to the brutal violence that has brought so much bloodshed to the country , and that every one of its inhabitants will be safe to lead a normal life . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violence and bloodshed continues to rack iraq easter sunday saw a series of attacks in the baghdad area that killed at least 20 people and wounded dozens , security officials said in the iraqi capital . the pope also lamented the " growing unrest and instability " in afghanistan , which is bracing for a bloody spring offensive after a resurgent taliban staged the most intensive year of fighting since they were ousted in 2001 . " peace is sorely needed " he condemned terrorism and the use of religion to justify a " thousand faces of violence . "
" peace is sorely needed , " the pontiff said . in another part of the speech , the pope said the middle east 's future was " put seriously in jeopardy " by political paralysis in lebanon , where the government is challenged by an opposition that includes hezbollah .
but he noted " some signs of hope in the dialogue between israel and the palestinian authority . "
his comments followed the formation of a palestinian unity government last month .
palestinian president mahmoud abbas also said on friday an israeli soldier , abducted by gaza militants 10 months ago in a cross-border raid , would be released soon .

the eu now plans to streamline the process with a plan aimed at reviving negotiations on a pan-european system . talks about establishing a patent valid throughout the eu have been stalled for years .
this week , the bloc 's internal market commissioner issued a consultation paper aimed at making life easier for the continent 's innovators . the new plan aims to improve the current system and make progress towards the " community patent . " " the communication will not perform a magic trick .

the patent also has to be translated into german , english and french , as well as the official languages of the countries concerned . all this comes at a considerable price .
the paper says that recent studies have shown that a european patent designating 13 countries is 11 times more expensive than a us patent and 13 times more than a japanese one once translation and processing costs are taken into consideration . language problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commissioner charlie mccreevy is hoping to reform the current system the london agreement , an initiative to streamline the system , is currently on ice .

but many eu countries have refused to sign up and the agreement itself will not go into force until it has been ratified by france . jürgen thumann , the head of the german industry confederation , thinks it is crucial that progress should be made on this issue .

it states : " there is no present jurisdiction for disputes on european patents which raise issues which go beyond the borders of one state . " litigation can be extremely costly , involving court costs , fees for lawyers , patent attorneys or experts , costs of witnesses , technical investigations and possibly interpreters ' and translators ' charges . specialized body bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's hoped the reforms will fuel new ideas and inventions the commission is proposing creating a specialized patent judiciary that would also have responsibility for community patents if they are introduced . commissioner mccreevy is hoping that he can break the current deadlock .

the eu now plans to streamline the process with a plan aimed at reviving negotiations on a pan-european system . talks about establishing a patent valid throughout the eu have been stalled for years .
this week , the bloc 's internal market commissioner issued a consultation paper aimed at making life easier for the continent 's innovators . the new plan aims to improve the current system and make progress towards the " community patent . " " the communication will not perform a magic trick .
i will not be pulling a rabbit out of a hat .
but i will be putting some constructive suggestions forward , " said charlie mccreevy , inernal market and services commissioner . national issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : current rules leave inventors drowning in paperwork at present , as the commission paper points out : " the european patent is not a unitary title ; it is a bundle of national patents . " at the european patent office in munich , the 200,000 or so patent applications filed each year have to list every single country in which protection from piracy is sought .
the patent also has to be translated into german , english and french , as well as the official languages of the countries concerned . all this comes at a considerable price .
the paper says that recent studies have shown that a european patent designating 13 countries is 11 times more expensive than a us patent and 13 times more than a japanese one once translation and processing costs are taken into consideration . language problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commissioner charlie mccreevy is hoping to reform the current system the london agreement , an initiative to streamline the system , is currently on ice .
it would only require the main body of the patent to be written in the applicant 's language and translated into either english , french or german .
but many eu countries have refused to sign up and the agreement itself will not go into force until it has been ratified by france . jürgen thumann , the head of the german industry confederation , thinks it is crucial that progress should be made on this issue . " the language question seems to be completely beyond resolution .
in times of global challenges europe faces becoming embroiled in complex translation rules for patent documents , " thumann said .
" the london agreement could considerably reduce these obligations .
it would sink costs considerably . " a businessman himself , thumann knows only too well how costly it can be to register a patent .

we are really talking about a lot of money here , " said thumann . the commission document also highlights another problem with the existing system .
it states : " there is no present jurisdiction for disputes on european patents which raise issues which go beyond the borders of one state . " litigation can be extremely costly , involving court costs , fees for lawyers , patent attorneys or experts , costs of witnesses , technical investigations and possibly interpreters ' and translators ' charges . specialized body bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's hoped the reforms will fuel new ideas and inventions the commission is proposing creating a specialized patent judiciary that would also have responsibility for community patents if they are introduced . commissioner mccreevy is hoping that he can break the current deadlock . " in today 's increasingly competitive global economy europe can not afford to lose ground in an area as crucial as patent policy , " he said .
" that is why i propose to have a fresh look at the various options and to work with the council and the parliament towards political consensus on real improvement of the patent system , " he said . german justice minister brigitte zypries also backs his plan .

it became the euro zone 's 13th member in january . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slovakia hopes to fulfill conditions to be able to join the euro zone but a key test of the eu newcomers prospects for taking another decisive step towards greater european integration is likely to come in the next few months when the next major candidate for euro membership - slovakia - gears up for its ambitious drive to join the common currency by january 2009 . slovakia now has about a year to ensure that its state finances are ready for joining the euro with both the european commission and the european central bank to rule during the first half of 2008 on whether the nation will be able to adopt the common currency . meanwhile , central banks in leading central european states have been moving to converge their monetary policy with the euro zone . helped by rising national currencies , bratislava 's monetary authorities last week lowered borrowing costs in slovakia by 25 basis points to 4.5 percent .
however , the national banks in both the czech republic and poland held rates steady at 2.5 percent and 4.0 percent respectively .
the european central bank is expected to raise the cost of money again in june to 4.0 percent . while hungary 's central bank held its prime rate on hold at 8.0 percent for the fifth consecutive month , the nation 's monetary authorities are expected to launch a new rate-cutting cycle during the second half of the year . slovakia 's failure could be setback to euro hopefuls but slovakia 's failure to be flagged through as the euro zone 's 14th member state could be seen as a setback for other nations seeking to join the euro . this is especially the case following the uproar caused last year after lithuania narrowly missed out on its plan to join the euro because its inflation rate came in marginally above the very tight inflation reference rate for euro candidates , which is below 3 percent . apart from possibly sending rating agencies scurrying to lower their ratings for nations in the region , it could trigger a wider debate about euro membership . despite plans for holding the referendum , poland is not expected to abandon the zloty and to formally join the euro in 2013 . the czech government 's aim is to merge its currency with the euro adoption by 2012 , two years later than originally planned . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu finance heads upbeat on inflation despite german risks euro zone finance ministers monday took a positive view of the inflation outlook in the 13 nations sharing the euro , despite risks of upward pressure from germany , europe 's biggest economy .

" the question which might be raised is not if , but when we will join the euro , " said polish finance minister zyta gilowska gilowska announcing plans for the referendum , with warsaw insisting it will meet the economic criteria required for euro adoption by 2009 . new eu members eager to get things right more recently , hungary 's new central bank chief , andras simor , has also talked about the possibility of the country successfully slashing its 6 percent plus deficit and joining the euro zone between 2011 and 2013 . " they are trying to establish more credible timetables , " said lars christensen , senior analyst with the copenhagen-based danske bank , with plans for euro membership seen by both financial markets and international rating agencies ' as a key anchor for their assessments of individual nations . until recently , rather than trying to knock their state finances into shape , several governments across central europe have attempted to bring their economies in line with counterparts in western europe by pursuing more expansionary economic policies . but christensen also warned that the central european nations ' plans are still very vulnerable to forces beyond the control of the national governments and could start to unravel , if the global economy suffered a major setback this year undercutting central europe 's fast-paced growth rates . or for that matter , if oil prices suddenly jumped up or if the region 's markets were engulfed by another major shake up . all eyes on slovakia so far , of the 10 new members that joined the eu about three years ago , only the small former yugoslavian state of slovenia has managed to pass the strict set of fiscal tests for euro membership .
it became the euro zone 's 13th member in january . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slovakia hopes to fulfill conditions to be able to join the euro zone but a key test of the eu newcomers prospects for taking another decisive step towards greater european integration is likely to come in the next few months when the next major candidate for euro membership - slovakia - gears up for its ambitious drive to join the common currency by january 2009 . slovakia now has about a year to ensure that its state finances are ready for joining the euro with both the european commission and the european central bank to rule during the first half of 2008 on whether the nation will be able to adopt the common currency . meanwhile , central banks in leading central european states have been moving to converge their monetary policy with the euro zone . helped by rising national currencies , bratislava 's monetary authorities last week lowered borrowing costs in slovakia by 25 basis points to 4.5 percent .
however , the national banks in both the czech republic and poland held rates steady at 2.5 percent and 4.0 percent respectively .
the european central bank is expected to raise the cost of money again in june to 4.0 percent . while hungary 's central bank held its prime rate on hold at 8.0 percent for the fifth consecutive month , the nation 's monetary authorities are expected to launch a new rate-cutting cycle during the second half of the year . slovakia 's failure could be setback to euro hopefuls but slovakia 's failure to be flagged through as the euro zone 's 14th member state could be seen as a setback for other nations seeking to join the euro . this is especially the case following the uproar caused last year after lithuania narrowly missed out on its plan to join the euro because its inflation rate came in marginally above the very tight inflation reference rate for euro candidates , which is below 3 percent . apart from possibly sending rating agencies scurrying to lower their ratings for nations in the region , it could trigger a wider debate about euro membership . despite plans for holding the referendum , poland is not expected to abandon the zloty and to formally join the euro in 2013 . the czech government 's aim is to merge its currency with the euro adoption by 2012 , two years later than originally planned . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu finance heads upbeat on inflation despite german risks euro zone finance ministers monday took a positive view of the inflation outlook in the 13 nations sharing the euro , despite risks of upward pressure from germany , europe 's biggest economy .

earlier teheran denied it had mistreated the navy personnel . the 15 sailors and marines who were freed on wednesday described on their return how they had been stripped , blindfolded and handcuffed during their detention . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the marines and sailors have been detailing their treatment at the hands of the iranians since their return royal marine joe tindell , 21 , said some of them thought they were about to be executed at one point , and how he , blindfolded with hands bound , had believed one of their number had had his throat cut . this version of events belied the images shown on iranian television of some of the group apparently relaxed and joking during their captivity . but ali akbar javanfekr , a spokesman for iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad , said that the suggestion of mistreatment was " a lie . " " we envisioned that the 15 sailors would be subjected to pressure by british security and intelligence forces , " he said .
" for that reason , president ahmadinejad asked prime minister tony blair not to put pressure on the sailors for having told the truth , but -lrb- he -rrb- did not hear this humanitarian appeal . " sailors can sell stories as the diplomatic waves from the incident continued to break , britain 's ministry of defense announced that , in a highly unusual step , the captives would be allowed to sell their stories to the media . serving personnel were not normally allowed to sell their stories but the ministry decided to grant the 15 permission due to the huge media interest , said a ministry spokeswoman . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : faye turney , the only woman in the group , with iranian leaders after their release was announced " these are considered to be exceptional circumstances , " she said .
the standoff over the 15 made daily headlines in britain and around the world .
several of the sailors and marines , particularly the only woman among them , faye turney , became well known after they were shown on iranian television . " the iranians will think we 're totally mad " but the move was immediately criticized by colonel bob stewart , a former senior british army commander , who claimed it would play into iran 's hands . " it 's just unprecedented , " the colonel , a former commander of british peacekeeping forces in bosnia , told bbc television .
iran 's seizure of the 15 was " hardly one of the most glorious annals of royal naval history . " asked what he thought tehran would make of it , he said : " i think they 'll think we 're totally mad ... and they will probably think : ' i 'm glad we got rid of them because they 're self-destructing without us having to do anything . " nick harvey , defense spokesman for the opposition liberal democrats , said the decision would " raise eyebrows . " " i sincerely hope this will not backfire into a loss of public sympathy for the service personnel .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 08.04.2007 new eu members step up drive to join euro zone großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new eu members are angling to join the euro zone leading new european union member states have stepped up efforts to reach the next critical stage of european integration - adopting the euro . despite facing considerable political and financial hurdles to meet the tough criteria for adopting the euro , poland , the czech republic and slovakia have moved to firm up plans for joining europe 's currency union by laying out road maps for euro membership by the early part of the new decade at the latest . while the czech republic last month updated its euro-membership plans , poland , which has been less than enthusiastic about europe 's currency union , has now put in place plans for a public referendum on joining the common currency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will poles say " tak " to joining the euro zone too ?
" the question which might be raised is not if , but when we will join the euro , " said polish finance minister zyta gilowska gilowska announcing plans for the referendum , with warsaw insisting it will meet the economic criteria required for euro adoption by 2009 . new eu members eager to get things right more recently , hungary 's new central bank chief , andras simor , has also talked about the possibility of the country successfully slashing its 6 percent plus deficit and joining the euro zone between 2011 and 2013 . " they are trying to establish more credible timetables , " said lars christensen , senior analyst with the copenhagen-based danske bank , with plans for euro membership seen by both financial markets and international rating agencies ' as a key anchor for their assessments of individual nations . until recently , rather than trying to knock their state finances into shape , several governments across central europe have attempted to bring their economies in line with counterparts in western europe by pursuing more expansionary economic policies . but christensen also warned that the central european nations ' plans are still very vulnerable to forces beyond the control of the national governments and could start to unravel , if the global economy suffered a major setback this year undercutting central europe 's fast-paced growth rates . or for that matter , if oil prices suddenly jumped up or if the region 's markets were engulfed by another major shake up . all eyes on slovakia so far , of the 10 new members that joined the eu about three years ago , only the small former yugoslavian state of slovenia has managed to pass the strict set of fiscal tests for euro membership .
it became the euro zone 's 13th member in january . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slovakia hopes to fulfill conditions to be able to join the euro zone but a key test of the eu newcomers prospects for taking another decisive step towards greater european integration is likely to come in the next few months when the next major candidate for euro membership - slovakia - gears up for its ambitious drive to join the common currency by january 2009 . slovakia now has about a year to ensure that its state finances are ready for joining the euro with both the european commission and the european central bank to rule during the first half of 2008 on whether the nation will be able to adopt the common currency . meanwhile , central banks in leading central european states have been moving to converge their monetary policy with the euro zone . helped by rising national currencies , bratislava 's monetary authorities last week lowered borrowing costs in slovakia by 25 basis points to 4.5 percent .
however , the national banks in both the czech republic and poland held rates steady at 2.5 percent and 4.0 percent respectively .
the european central bank is expected to raise the cost of money again in june to 4.0 percent . while hungary 's central bank held its prime rate on hold at 8.0 percent for the fifth consecutive month , the nation 's monetary authorities are expected to launch a new rate-cutting cycle during the second half of the year . slovakia 's failure could be setback to euro hopefuls but slovakia 's failure to be flagged through as the euro zone 's 14th member state could be seen as a setback for other nations seeking to join the euro . this is especially the case following the uproar caused last year after lithuania narrowly missed out on its plan to join the euro because its inflation rate came in marginally above the very tight inflation reference rate for euro candidates , which is below 3 percent . apart from possibly sending rating agencies scurrying to lower their ratings for nations in the region , it could trigger a wider debate about euro membership . despite plans for holding the referendum , poland is not expected to abandon the zloty and to formally join the euro in 2013 . the czech government 's aim is to merge its currency with the euro adoption by 2012 , two years later than originally planned . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu finance heads upbeat on inflation despite german risks euro zone finance ministers monday took a positive view of the inflation outlook in the 13 nations sharing the euro , despite risks of upward pressure from germany , europe 's biggest economy .

in the speech , televised to millions of viewers in 67 countries at the end of easter sunday mass , he expressed his worries about problems facing the world , particularly in the middle east and africa .
" how many wounds , how much suffering there is in the world . natural calamities and human tragedies that cause innumerable victims and enormous material destruction are not lacking , " pope benedict said . bildunterschrift : st. peter 's square was filled with pilgrims on sunday " i am thinking of the scourge of hunger , of incurable diseases , of terrorism and kidnapping of people , of the thousand faces of violence which some people attempt to justify in the name of religion , of contempt for life , of the violation of human rights and the exploitation of persons . "
apprehension over plight of africans resplendent in his gold vestments and mitre sparkling in the sun , the pope said he was particularly pained by events and conditions in africa . " i look with apprehension at the conditions prevailing in several regions of africa , " in several parts of the world 's poorest continent , notably zimbabwe , darfur and somalia , " the pontiff said . he added that renewed fighting in somalia had " driven away the prospect of peace and worsened a regional crisis . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children in a refugee camp in darfur " in darfur and in the neighboring countries , there is a catastrophic , and , sadly to say , underestimated humanitarian situation , " the pope said .

" nothing positive comes from iraq " in a rare mention , the pontiff also spoke out on iraq , lamenting that " nothing positive comes from iraq . " the country is " torn apart by continual slaughter as the civil population flees , " the pope said , appealing " to all those who hold in their hands the fate of iraq , that there will be an end to the brutal violence that has brought so much bloodshed to the country , and that every one of its inhabitants will be safe to lead a normal life . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violence and bloodshed continues to rack iraq easter sunday saw a series of attacks in the baghdad area that killed at least 20 people and wounded dozens , security officials said in the iraqi capital . the pope also lamented the " growing unrest and instability " in afghanistan , which is bracing for a bloody spring offensive after a resurgent taliban staged the most intensive year of fighting since they were ousted in 2001 . " peace is sorely needed " he condemned terrorism and the use of religion to justify a " thousand faces of violence . "
" peace is sorely needed , " the pontiff said . in another part of the speech , the pope said the middle east 's future was " put seriously in jeopardy " by political paralysis in lebanon , where the government is challenged by an opposition that includes hezbollah .
but he noted " some signs of hope in the dialogue between israel and the palestinian authority . "
his comments followed the formation of a palestinian unity government last month .
palestinian president mahmoud abbas also said on friday an israeli soldier , abducted by gaza militants 10 months ago in a cross-border raid , would be released soon .

in the speech , televised to millions of viewers in 67 countries at the end of easter sunday mass , he expressed his worries about problems facing the world , particularly in the middle east and africa .
" how many wounds , how much suffering there is in the world . natural calamities and human tragedies that cause innumerable victims and enormous material destruction are not lacking , " pope benedict said . bildunterschrift : st. peter 's square was filled with pilgrims on sunday " i am thinking of the scourge of hunger , of incurable diseases , of terrorism and kidnapping of people , of the thousand faces of violence which some people attempt to justify in the name of religion , of contempt for life , of the violation of human rights and the exploitation of persons . "
apprehension over plight of africans resplendent in his gold vestments and mitre sparkling in the sun , the pope said he was particularly pained by events and conditions in africa . " i look with apprehension at the conditions prevailing in several regions of africa , " in several parts of the world 's poorest continent , notably zimbabwe , darfur and somalia , " the pontiff said . he added that renewed fighting in somalia had " driven away the prospect of peace and worsened a regional crisis . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children in a refugee camp in darfur " in darfur and in the neighboring countries , there is a catastrophic , and , sadly to say , underestimated humanitarian situation , " the pope said . " zimbabwe is in the grip of a grievous crisis , and for this reason the bishops of that country in a recent document indicated prayer and a shared commitment for the common good as the only way forward , " he said . " nothing positive comes from iraq " in a rare mention , the pontiff also spoke out on iraq , lamenting that " nothing positive comes from iraq . " the country is " torn apart by continual slaughter as the civil population flees , " the pope said , appealing " to all those who hold in their hands the fate of iraq , that there will be an end to the brutal violence that has brought so much bloodshed to the country , and that every one of its inhabitants will be safe to lead a normal life . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violence and bloodshed continues to rack iraq easter sunday saw a series of attacks in the baghdad area that killed at least 20 people and wounded dozens , security officials said in the iraqi capital . the pope also lamented the " growing unrest and instability " in afghanistan , which is bracing for a bloody spring offensive after a resurgent taliban staged the most intensive year of fighting since they were ousted in 2001 .

" the question which might be raised is not if , but when we will join the euro , " said polish finance minister zyta gilowska gilowska announcing plans for the referendum , with warsaw insisting it will meet the economic criteria required for euro adoption by 2009 . new eu members eager to get things right more recently , hungary 's new central bank chief , andras simor , has also talked about the possibility of the country successfully slashing its 6 percent plus deficit and joining the euro zone between 2011 and 2013 . " they are trying to establish more credible timetables , " said lars christensen , senior analyst with the copenhagen-based danske bank , with plans for euro membership seen by both financial markets and international rating agencies ' as a key anchor for their assessments of individual nations . until recently , rather than trying to knock their state finances into shape , several governments across central europe have attempted to bring their economies in line with counterparts in western europe by pursuing more expansionary economic policies . but christensen also warned that the central european nations ' plans are still very vulnerable to forces beyond the control of the national governments and could start to unravel , if the global economy suffered a major setback this year undercutting central europe 's fast-paced growth rates . or for that matter , if oil prices suddenly jumped up or if the region 's markets were engulfed by another major shake up . all eyes on slovakia so far , of the 10 new members that joined the eu about three years ago , only the small former yugoslavian state of slovenia has managed to pass the strict set of fiscal tests for euro membership .
it became the euro zone 's 13th member in january . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slovakia hopes to fulfill conditions to be able to join the euro zone but a key test of the eu newcomers prospects for taking another decisive step towards greater european integration is likely to come in the next few months when the next major candidate for euro membership - slovakia - gears up for its ambitious drive to join the common currency by january 2009 . slovakia now has about a year to ensure that its state finances are ready for joining the euro with both the european commission and the european central bank to rule during the first half of 2008 on whether the nation will be able to adopt the common currency . meanwhile , central banks in leading central european states have been moving to converge their monetary policy with the euro zone . helped by rising national currencies , bratislava 's monetary authorities last week lowered borrowing costs in slovakia by 25 basis points to 4.5 percent .
however , the national banks in both the czech republic and poland held rates steady at 2.5 percent and 4.0 percent respectively .
the european central bank is expected to raise the cost of money again in june to 4.0 percent . while hungary 's central bank held its prime rate on hold at 8.0 percent for the fifth consecutive month , the nation 's monetary authorities are expected to launch a new rate-cutting cycle during the second half of the year . slovakia 's failure could be setback to euro hopefuls but slovakia 's failure to be flagged through as the euro zone 's 14th member state could be seen as a setback for other nations seeking to join the euro . this is especially the case following the uproar caused last year after lithuania narrowly missed out on its plan to join the euro because its inflation rate came in marginally above the very tight inflation reference rate for euro candidates , which is below 3 percent . apart from possibly sending rating agencies scurrying to lower their ratings for nations in the region , it could trigger a wider debate about euro membership . despite plans for holding the referendum , poland is not expected to abandon the zloty and to formally join the euro in 2013 . the czech government 's aim is to merge its currency with the euro adoption by 2012 , two years later than originally planned . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu finance heads upbeat on inflation despite german risks euro zone finance ministers monday took a positive view of the inflation outlook in the 13 nations sharing the euro , despite risks of upward pressure from germany , europe 's biggest economy .

the eu now plans to streamline the process with a plan aimed at reviving negotiations on a pan-european system . talks about establishing a patent valid throughout the eu have been stalled for years .
this week , the bloc 's internal market commissioner issued a consultation paper aimed at making life easier for the continent 's innovators . the new plan aims to improve the current system and make progress towards the " community patent . " " the communication will not perform a magic trick .

" at the european patent office in munich , the 200,000 or so patent applications filed each year have to list every single country in which protection from piracy is sought .
the patent also has to be translated into german , english and french , as well as the official languages of the countries concerned . all this comes at a considerable price .
the paper says that recent studies have shown that a european patent designating 13 countries is 11 times more expensive than a us patent and 13 times more than a japanese one once translation and processing costs are taken into consideration . language problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commissioner charlie mccreevy is hoping to reform the current system the london agreement , an initiative to streamline the system , is currently on ice .

it states : " there is no present jurisdiction for disputes on european patents which raise issues which go beyond the borders of one state . " litigation can be extremely costly , involving court costs , fees for lawyers , patent attorneys or experts , costs of witnesses , technical investigations and possibly interpreters ' and translators ' charges . specialized body bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's hoped the reforms will fuel new ideas and inventions the commission is proposing creating a specialized patent judiciary that would also have responsibility for community patents if they are introduced . commissioner mccreevy is hoping that he can break the current deadlock .

the patent also has to be translated into german , english and french , as well as the official languages of the countries concerned . all this comes at a considerable price .
the paper says that recent studies have shown that a european patent designating 13 countries is 11 times more expensive than a us patent and 13 times more than a japanese one once translation and processing costs are taken into consideration . language problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commissioner charlie mccreevy is hoping to reform the current system the london agreement , an initiative to streamline the system , is currently on ice .

the eu now plans to streamline the process with a plan aimed at reviving negotiations on a pan-european system . talks about establishing a patent valid throughout the eu have been stalled for years .
this week , the bloc 's internal market commissioner issued a consultation paper aimed at making life easier for the continent 's innovators . the new plan aims to improve the current system and make progress towards the " community patent . " " the communication will not perform a magic trick .
i will not be pulling a rabbit out of a hat .
but i will be putting some constructive suggestions forward , " said charlie mccreevy , inernal market and services commissioner . national issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : current rules leave inventors drowning in paperwork at present , as the commission paper points out : " the european patent is not a unitary title ; it is a bundle of national patents . " at the european patent office in munich , the 200,000 or so patent applications filed each year have to list every single country in which protection from piracy is sought .
the patent also has to be translated into german , english and french , as well as the official languages of the countries concerned . all this comes at a considerable price .
the paper says that recent studies have shown that a european patent designating 13 countries is 11 times more expensive than a us patent and 13 times more than a japanese one once translation and processing costs are taken into consideration . language problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commissioner charlie mccreevy is hoping to reform the current system the london agreement , an initiative to streamline the system , is currently on ice .
it would only require the main body of the patent to be written in the applicant 's language and translated into either english , french or german .
but many eu countries have refused to sign up and the agreement itself will not go into force until it has been ratified by france . jürgen thumann , the head of the german industry confederation , thinks it is crucial that progress should be made on this issue . " the language question seems to be completely beyond resolution .
in times of global challenges europe faces becoming embroiled in complex translation rules for patent documents , " thumann said .
" the london agreement could considerably reduce these obligations .
it would sink costs considerably . " a businessman himself , thumann knows only too well how costly it can be to register a patent .
westfalia , a subsidiary of his company , recently developed a flexible and gas impermeable metal pipe that can be used in truck exhausts .
the firm has just patented the idea . costly bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : too often patent disputes end up in court " i can tell you , if you want to have a patent valid for more than 50 countries then it will quickly set you back several hundred thousand euros .
we are really talking about a lot of money here , " said thumann . the commission document also highlights another problem with the existing system .
it states : " there is no present jurisdiction for disputes on european patents which raise issues which go beyond the borders of one state . " litigation can be extremely costly , involving court costs , fees for lawyers , patent attorneys or experts , costs of witnesses , technical investigations and possibly interpreters ' and translators ' charges . specialized body bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's hoped the reforms will fuel new ideas and inventions the commission is proposing creating a specialized patent judiciary that would also have responsibility for community patents if they are introduced . commissioner mccreevy is hoping that he can break the current deadlock . " in today 's increasingly competitive global economy europe can not afford to lose ground in an area as crucial as patent policy , " he said .
" that is why i propose to have a fresh look at the various options and to work with the council and the parliament towards political consensus on real improvement of the patent system , " he said . german justice minister brigitte zypries also backs his plan .

at present the public only has access to around half the english coastline .
but environment secretary david miliband told the independent on sunday he wanted to create an " access corridor " to open it all up .
the paper says the corridor will take about 10 years to establish at a cost of about £ 50 million , but adds it is likely to be strongly opposed .
the country land and business association has said previously that landowners would have to be compensated , and has warned about safety issues along coastlines .
' national treasure ' scotland already has a legal right of access to its coastline and the creation of a coastal path is under way in wales .
if england had an " access corridor " it would open up the entire 9,040 miles -lrb- 14,548km -rrb- of the mainline british coastline to the public .
mr miliband told the independent on sunday : " england 's coastline is a national treasure .
it should be the birthright of every citizen .
" many parts of the coast are already accessible but some are not .
we want to create an access corridor so that people can walk the entire length of the english coast . "
the department for the environment , food and rural affairs said it was due to launch a public consultation on improving access to the coast within the next few months .
natural england , the new official wildlife and countryside watchdog , advised the government in february that more of england 's coastline should be open to tourists and walkers .
