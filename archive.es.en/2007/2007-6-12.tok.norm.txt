program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de travel -pipe- 12.06.2007 a mix of old and new , kassel prepares for documenta 12 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : documenta 12 attracts visitors for three months the documenta art show begins on saturday in kassel , a city caught between old and new very much to the delight of its many visitors . every five years the world-renowned exhibition of contemporary art brings an air of excitement into this normally reserved german city . for the common visitor , a short walk through kassel reveals that something different is going on in this city .
for example , artist walter de maria 's so-called " kasseler loch , " or kassel whole , a 1,000-meter -lrb- 3,280 feet -rrb- metal pole pounded vertically into the ground and sculptor claes oldenburg 's 12-meter-high pick-ax seemingly stuck into the bank of the fulda river by a passing giant ca n't be missed . and no visitor will forget jonathan borowsky 's " man walking to the sky , " a sculpture of a man walking up a pole 25 meters into the air directly in front of the kassel train station . " old " kassel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kassel 's " man walking to the sky " the city 's art installations make up only part of its charm .
for many visitors , the mix of old and new really gives this quiet city its unique atmosphere . while strolling through one of the kassel 's many parks , visitors may feel like they are being watched .
on top of a castle in the hillside that is wilhelmshohe park stands a towering bronze statue of hercules . built in 1719 , the statue tops an octagonal castle overlooking kassel with a cascading landscaping which is unique to germany .
the panoramic view from the apex of the park makes the walk up to hercules ' perch worthwhile . tourists following the german fairytale route , a trail from hanau to bremen , will land in kassel due to the city 's two most famous sons . wilhelm and jacob grimm moved to the town in 1798 and over the years collected many of their famous tales within the city 's medieval walls , including rapunzel , cinderella and little red riding hood . located in bellevue palace , the brothers grimm museum highlights not just the storytelling prowess of the brothers -lrb- their last collection contained over 200 fairytales -rrb- but also their linguistic and political work . documenta xii since its inaugural event in 1955 , documenta has helped to transform kassel into a worldwide destination for contemporary art .
its three-month-long show is an artistic free-for-all and takes place in the middle of a medieval park . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kassel expects large crowds this year the people of kassel are invited to the party .
instead of the invitation-only cocktail parties of documentas past , the curators will host a celebration to thank the residents of kassel for their support through 12 documentas . the party will feature norwegian rock band kaizers orchestra and the dj formation cluster , and will culminate in an illumination of the park 's renowned water gardens . from the collection of old master paintings in the wilhelmshöhe palace art gallery to the clean modern design of the karl branner bridge , kassel is a city of contradiction . a contradiction that is sure to be deepened through the summer as the artists , curators and documenta visitors descend upon the city .
the brothers grimm would be proud . documenta 12 runs from june 16 to sept .

but the court of first instance upheld the american company 's right to use the names on merchandise .
" the court of first instance dismisses actions in proceedings taken by budejovicky against anheuser-busch concerning the use of community trademarks , " the court of first instance in luxembourg said in a statement .
weakened reputation budvar had said that under french law , an appellation of origin could not be used for any product or service which would weaken its reputation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beer might be nice at the bar , but it 's a business , too st. louis , missouri-based anheuser-busch , the largest us brewer , applied for the trademarks in 1996 at the office for harmonization in the internal market , which is responsible for eu-wide trademarks .
the us company and the czech budvar have taken legal action against each other in national courts across europe .
anheuser-busch won the registration for several words related to budweiser , which it has used for products as stationery , cleaning supplies and clothing .
budvar said that the court ruling would have no impact on its business . " today 's decisions are not substantial from the point of view of budejovicky budvar 's beer sales and do not threaten its current business activities in eu countries , " the company said .
privatization fears in may , a europe-wide grouping of beer lovers called on czechs to lobby their government not to privatize budejovicky budvar - the country 's third largest brewery .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : production line in the budvar brewery in the czech republic " czech citizens should petition their government to ensure that budvar remains a state asset and stays that way for the next century , " the president of the european beer consumers union -lrb- ebcu -rrb- , terry lock , said in prague .
the center-right czech government announced the first step towards privatizing budvar at the beginning of april when the agriculture minister announced that the brewery would be transformed into a shareholder company .
anheuser-busch is tipped to be a frontrunner to buy the last major czech brewery not yet snapped up by a global drinks company .
to the ebcu , brewing multinationals like anheuser-busch and belgium 's inbev represent a threat to traditionally-brewed quality beer .
" there are people who brew beer and people who sell beer .
that is the essential difference , " the head of the swiss beer lovers ' association , abo , laurent mousson , told reuters . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de thirsty yanks prowl cologne for special suds prompted by an article in the new york times , american tourists to germany are getting interested in kölsch beer .

for example , artist walter de maria 's so-called " kasseler loch , " or kassel whole , a 1,000-meter -lrb- 3,280 feet -rrb- metal pole pounded vertically into the ground and sculptor claes oldenburg 's 12-meter-high pick-ax seemingly stuck into the bank of the fulda river by a passing giant ca n't be missed . and no visitor will forget jonathan borowsky 's " man walking to the sky , " a sculpture of a man walking up a pole 25 meters into the air directly in front of the kassel train station .

for many visitors , the mix of old and new really gives this quiet city its unique atmosphere . while strolling through one of the kassel 's many parks , visitors may feel like they are being watched .
on top of a castle in the hillside that is wilhelmshohe park stands a towering bronze statue of hercules . built in 1719 , the statue tops an octagonal castle overlooking kassel with a cascading landscaping which is unique to germany .
the panoramic view from the apex of the park makes the walk up to hercules ' perch worthwhile . tourists following the german fairytale route , a trail from hanau to bremen , will land in kassel due to the city 's two most famous sons . wilhelm and jacob grimm moved to the town in 1798 and over the years collected many of their famous tales within the city 's medieval walls , including rapunzel , cinderella and little red riding hood . located in bellevue palace , the brothers grimm museum highlights not just the storytelling prowess of the brothers -lrb- their last collection contained over 200 fairytales -rrb- but also their linguistic and political work . documenta xii since its inaugural event in 1955 , documenta has helped to transform kassel into a worldwide destination for contemporary art .
its three-month-long show is an artistic free-for-all and takes place in the middle of a medieval park . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kassel expects large crowds this year the people of kassel are invited to the party .
instead of the invitation-only cocktail parties of documentas past , the curators will host a celebration to thank the residents of kassel for their support through 12 documentas . the party will feature norwegian rock band kaizers orchestra and the dj formation cluster , and will culminate in an illumination of the park 's renowned water gardens . from the collection of old master paintings in the wilhelmshöhe palace art gallery to the clean modern design of the karl branner bridge , kassel is a city of contradiction . a contradiction that is sure to be deepened through the summer as the artists , curators and documenta visitors descend upon the city .

" the situation right now is a complete mess , " borg told reporters in luxembourg ahead of a meeting of eu interior ministers on tuesday .
" it 's a free for all . " " each year 600 immigrants are dying - this is a very conservative estimate i must say - on the threshold of europe .
the figure could rise again this year , " he said . several boats with illegal migrants have recently capsized in the waters between the mediterranean island and libya .
eighteen bodies were found in the zone last month by a french ship . borg said he would urge eu countries to help with " burden sharing " by accepting any would-be immigrants who are rescued in international waters . " it is only fair that those immigrants who are saved are distributed on a rotational basis between the 27 eu member states , " he said . " temporarily those immigrants should go to the nearest european state until they are transferred to the designated country of destination , " he said . the country of destination would be chosen based on size and population . a tough task bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sweden hosts the largest number of iraqi refugees in the eu eu diplomats have said that borg faces a tough task in convincing his eu partners to help .
many countries agree on the need to save people but few are keen to take responsibility for illegal migrants once they are safely ashore . some believe it would be better to work closely with the countries that people are fleeing or crossing to reach europe , concerned that " burden sharing " might appear to immigrants as a " free ticket " to move deeper into the eu . " i do n't think that this is a free flight to go to paris , " borg said .
" i think that the desperation of these people is very evident . " " they first cross the desert ... and if they survive that they try to cross the mediterranean and if they survive that then they are accepted or saved by the european authorities . he said that the number of people arriving was small in eu terms but that malta , with a population of around 400,000 , had to bear the heaviest load in dealing with a problem that has significantly grown in recent weeks . " from the beginning of this year our coast guard has saved 350 -lrb- people -rrb- , 250 of whom in the past 10-15 days , " he said . describing himself as a pragmatic politician , borg said he was not expecting miracles from tuesday 's talks . " a commitment , that would be ideal ... but at least that the discussion will start , " he said refuge crises bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european commission hopes to harmonize asylum rules across the union despite a commitment to an eu-wide common asylum system , member states not only take different approaches to asylum claims but also apply very different standards of treatment to asylum seekers . sweden , for instance , has demanded that other eu countries take in more vulnerable people fleeing iraq and has also called for a further harmonization of widely differing asylum procedures in the eu .
some 9,000 iraqis found a new home in sweden last year .
stockholm expects some 20,000 more this year .
sweden grants refugee status or other protection to almost all iraqi asylum seekers .
eu diplomats said the number of iraqis seeking refuge in the bloc was likely to reach 40,000 this year .
around 20,000 iraqis applied for asylum in the eu in 2006 , which is , compared to 2005 , an increase of 77 percent .
regional solutions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu justice commissioner franco frattini eu ministers earlier this year said that there was no need for resettlement of iraqis inside the eu and added that the iraqi refugee crisis must be tackled in the region .
meanwhile , the european commission has slammed member states for a lack of solidarity in hosting asylum seekers and dealing with refugee crisis and wants to use the meeting in luxembourg to drum up support for new plans aimed at harmonizing asylum rules across the eu .
currently , there are some 20 different systems of asylum in the 27-nation bloc .
the commission , the eu 's executive arm , wants to have more harmonized rules in place by 2010 .
unfulfilled pledges bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : about 500,000 illegal immigrants enter the eu each year eu justice commissioner franco frattini is expected to use the luxembourg meeting to rebuke governments for not fulfilling pledges to send technical equipment for the bloc 's border control agency frontex .
boats , helicopters and planes needed to patrol the eu 's southern maritime borders existed only " on paper , " frontex said monday .
about 500,000 illegal immigrants enter the eu each year , mainly from poor african countries .
the bloc has responded by stepping up border controls , with so-called " frontline " states , spain , italy and malta , demanding even tougher measures against illegals .
eu officials have accused maltese authorities of failing to meet their international duties to save lives by refusing to admit migrants rescued by vessels outside its search and rescue area .
officials in malta deny they have ever left migrants at sea in distress .
ai appeal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : illegal immigration is driven mainly by economic forces human rights watchdog amnesty international issued an appeal to the german eu presidency to set up a rescue plan for immigrants in distress at sea .
" the eu must draw consequences and investigate the latest incidents , " said amnesty 's director for europe , dick oostings .
eu ministers are also expected to discuss commission proposals to introduce tough sanctions for employers of illegal migrants , including heavy fines and prison sentences for the worst offenders .
the commission argues that the prospect of finding an illicit job in the eu was the main driving force behind illegal immigration .
but the plan could run into fierce opposition from some member states as the eu does not have the competence to interfere with matters of criminal law . dw staff / afp , dpa -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the situation right now is a complete mess , " borg told reporters in luxembourg ahead of a meeting of eu interior ministers on tuesday .
" it 's a free for all . " " each year 600 immigrants are dying - this is a very conservative estimate i must say - on the threshold of europe .
the figure could rise again this year , " he said . several boats with illegal migrants have recently capsized in the waters between the mediterranean island and libya .
eighteen bodies were found in the zone last month by a french ship . borg said he would urge eu countries to help with " burden sharing " by accepting any would-be immigrants who are rescued in international waters . " it is only fair that those immigrants who are saved are distributed on a rotational basis between the 27 eu member states , " he said . " temporarily those immigrants should go to the nearest european state until they are transferred to the designated country of destination , " he said . the country of destination would be chosen based on size and population . a tough task bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sweden hosts the largest number of iraqi refugees in the eu eu diplomats have said that borg faces a tough task in convincing his eu partners to help .
many countries agree on the need to save people but few are keen to take responsibility for illegal migrants once they are safely ashore . some believe it would be better to work closely with the countries that people are fleeing or crossing to reach europe , concerned that " burden sharing " might appear to immigrants as a " free ticket " to move deeper into the eu . " i do n't think that this is a free flight to go to paris , " borg said .
" i think that the desperation of these people is very evident . " " they first cross the desert ... and if they survive that they try to cross the mediterranean and if they survive that then they are accepted or saved by the european authorities . he said that the number of people arriving was small in eu terms but that malta , with a population of around 400,000 , had to bear the heaviest load in dealing with a problem that has significantly grown in recent weeks .

they warned that , without compromise , efforts to end the crisis over the draft of the constitution that was rejected by voters in france and the netherlands would fail at the summit on june 21 and 22 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso expects a " new dynamic " in talks " if we fail again , then it will have very negative consequences , " barroso said at a joint session of the european parliament with national representatives . strong rhetoric from warsaw " if we want to have success in this issue , then we must all move , " said foreign minister steinmeier .
" i have the impression that the willingness to move is absolutely there , " he added , and said he hoped it would be the case for all sides at the summit .
but steinmeier 's conviction that " a new dynamic has come into the talks " is in stark contrast to recent rhetoric from polish prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski , who has repeatedly threatened to veto the draft treaty because he disagrees with its provisions for how member states would vote on policy issues .
" poland will never accept , under any pretext , the system that has been put on the table to us , " kaczynski told polish public radio tuesday . poland fears losing clout warsaw is concerned that plans to reform the way member states vote on decisions affecting the whole bloc could cost it some of its clout .
it wants the voting system to be based on the square root of the number , in millions , of the population of each member state .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french rejected an eu constitution in 2005 but germany , which holds the eu 's rotating presidency until the end of next month , when it hands over to portugal , has poured cold water on the polish proposal .
german chancellor angela merkel has up to now refused to take a second look at the voting mechanism issue , for fear that reopening the debate would lead to an avalanche of demands on various issues from all member states .
the voting system , which poland had previously accepted , would mean that 55 percent of eu members with at least 65 percent of the eu 's population would be required to pass resolutions .
kaczynski now says the system is unfair to smaller nations , and has called for the eu to prolong the debate for another year . " the current situation makes a lot of people unhappy , " kaczynski told a press conference later on tuesday .
" we are the only ones with enough courage to say so , because we are a large country and also because we are the most affected " by the qualified majority system of voting proposed at present . " we will not allow ourselves to be radically downgraded , " he said . ' delay is not a solution ' barroso rejected kaczynski 's notion that there was still time to change the eu treaties , as a decision would not be made for at least a year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier : ' the willingness is there ' " delay is not a solution .
the problem will not go away .
help us to find a solution , " barroso told members of the european parliament .
the german eu presidency has been trying to steer a course through the different opinions of the eu members on how to draft a new treaty that would replace the draft constitution dealt a death blow in 2005 by the french and the dutch .
germany plans to submit a list of topics that would be discussed by an intergovernmental conference to eu members at the summit meeting .
but poland has threatened to bar the conference from getting down to business if the list of topics for debate does not meet with its approval . merkel on monday began a marathon of diplomatic meetings , during which she will meet , in the space of one week , with seven european heads of state or government , including polish president lech kaczynski , the prime minister 's twin brother . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de french proposal to end eu crisis makes headway french president nicolas sarkozy 's idea of a simplified treaty designed to end the european union 's constitional crisis appears to be gaining support .

they warned that , without compromise , efforts to end the crisis over the draft of the constitution that was rejected by voters in france and the netherlands would fail at the summit on june 21 and 22 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso expects a " new dynamic " in talks " if we fail again , then it will have very negative consequences , " barroso said at a joint session of the european parliament with national representatives . strong rhetoric from warsaw " if we want to have success in this issue , then we must all move , " said foreign minister steinmeier .
" i have the impression that the willingness to move is absolutely there , " he added , and said he hoped it would be the case for all sides at the summit .
but steinmeier 's conviction that " a new dynamic has come into the talks " is in stark contrast to recent rhetoric from polish prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski , who has repeatedly threatened to veto the draft treaty because he disagrees with its provisions for how member states would vote on policy issues .
" poland will never accept , under any pretext , the system that has been put on the table to us , " kaczynski told polish public radio tuesday . poland fears losing clout warsaw is concerned that plans to reform the way member states vote on decisions affecting the whole bloc could cost it some of its clout .
it wants the voting system to be based on the square root of the number , in millions , of the population of each member state .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french rejected an eu constitution in 2005 but germany , which holds the eu 's rotating presidency until the end of next month , when it hands over to portugal , has poured cold water on the polish proposal .
german chancellor angela merkel has up to now refused to take a second look at the voting mechanism issue , for fear that reopening the debate would lead to an avalanche of demands on various issues from all member states .
the voting system , which poland had previously accepted , would mean that 55 percent of eu members with at least 65 percent of the eu 's population would be required to pass resolutions .
kaczynski now says the system is unfair to smaller nations , and has called for the eu to prolong the debate for another year . " the current situation makes a lot of people unhappy , " kaczynski told a press conference later on tuesday .
" we are the only ones with enough courage to say so , because we are a large country and also because we are the most affected " by the qualified majority system of voting proposed at present . " we will not allow ourselves to be radically downgraded , " he said . ' delay is not a solution ' barroso rejected kaczynski 's notion that there was still time to change the eu treaties , as a decision would not be made for at least a year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier : ' the willingness is there ' " delay is not a solution .
the problem will not go away .
help us to find a solution , " barroso told members of the european parliament .
the german eu presidency has been trying to steer a course through the different opinions of the eu members on how to draft a new treaty that would replace the draft constitution dealt a death blow in 2005 by the french and the dutch .
germany plans to submit a list of topics that would be discussed by an intergovernmental conference to eu members at the summit meeting .
but poland has threatened to bar the conference from getting down to business if the list of topics for debate does not meet with its approval . merkel on monday began a marathon of diplomatic meetings , during which she will meet , in the space of one week , with seven european heads of state or government , including polish president lech kaczynski , the prime minister 's twin brother . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de french proposal to end eu crisis makes headway french president nicolas sarkozy 's idea of a simplified treaty designed to end the european union 's constitional crisis appears to be gaining support .

" we should not waste too much time in making decisions , " the secretary general told reporters on monday .
he said it was " absolutely necessary that the security council should take a fair and sound judgment on this by endorsing " un mediator martti ahtisaari 's plan for kosovo 's " supervised independence . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : united nation secretary general ban ki-moon ban was briefing reporters on his recent foreign trip , including stops in panama , spain and germany where he attended the g8 summit last week .
during a visit to albania sunday , us president george w. bush called for speedy moves to give kosovo independence , saying the days of " endless dialogue " were over despite the outright hostility of serbia and its ally russia .
" we need to get moving , and the end result is independence , " he noted .
but serbian prime minister vojislav kostunica said monday that his country was " rightfully outraged over the us policy on kosovo " and insisted washington had no right to give away serbian territory .
no more delays bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president george bush received a hero 's welcome in albania on sunday us state department spokesman tom casey , however , urged the security council on monday to move quickly .
" there is a resolution that is tabled at the un , " casey said .
" i expect those discussions to move forward .
i expect there will be a vote on it . "
department spokesman sean mccormack played down the prospect of a russian veto .
" nobody wants it to get to that point , " mccormack said .
" nobody wants to see a veto . "
russian foreign minister sergei lavrov last month said a veto would be a last resort .
" i hope a veto will not be necessary , " lavrov said after a meeting of foreign ministers of the group of eight industrialized nations in potsdam , germany .
rising tensions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbian prime minister vojislav kostunica -lrb- right -rrb- some political analysts hope moscow would at least abstain from voting on kosovo in the council , although they said it was unlikely given the rising us-russia tensions over a planned us missile defense system in eastern europe .
" if there is a veto , the most likely outcome is a unilateral declaration of independence , " said stephen sestanovich of the council on foreign relations .
" i would expect that washington will recognize kosovo and that at least a majority of eu countries will as well , but i do n't know that you would get the eu as a collective body to do so , and that starts looking awkward , sestanovich said .
" that starts creating some problems . "
facing a basque separatist movement on its own soil , spain is concerned about the implications of europe recognizing kosovo 's independence outside the un framework .
the issue is up for discussion by the contact group for kosovo - the united states , britain , germany , italy and russia - when it meets on tuesday in paris .
no immediate plans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the security council is divided over the issue of kosovo meanwhile , un diplomats said the security council had no immediate plan to take up a revised draft resolution put forward by britain on may 31 that would reaffirm support for the un plan for kosovo .
the new draft , sponsored by the united states , belgium , britain , france , italy , slovakia and germany , calls for " full implementation " of the provisions contained in the ahtisaari plan .
though technically a serbian province , kosovo has been un-run since the end of the nato assault in mid-1999 .
some 10,000 ethnic albanians died and hundreds of thousands fled kosovo during the 1998-1999 conflict between serbian government troops and ethnic albanian separatists . dw staff / afp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bush : it 's time for kosovo 's independence us president george w. bush rejected sunday the idea of an " endless dialogue " on the future status of kosovo , saying the time was ripe to move towards independence for the albanian-majority serbian province .

" we should not waste too much time in making decisions , " the secretary general told reporters on monday .
he said it was " absolutely necessary that the security council should take a fair and sound judgment on this by endorsing " un mediator martti ahtisaari 's plan for kosovo 's " supervised independence . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : united nation secretary general ban ki-moon ban was briefing reporters on his recent foreign trip , including stops in panama , spain and germany where he attended the g8 summit last week .
during a visit to albania sunday , us president george w. bush called for speedy moves to give kosovo independence , saying the days of " endless dialogue " were over despite the outright hostility of serbia and its ally russia .
" we need to get moving , and the end result is independence , " he noted .
but serbian prime minister vojislav kostunica said monday that his country was " rightfully outraged over the us policy on kosovo " and insisted washington had no right to give away serbian territory .
no more delays bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president george bush received a hero 's welcome in albania on sunday us state department spokesman tom casey , however , urged the security council on monday to move quickly .
" there is a resolution that is tabled at the un , " casey said .
" i expect those discussions to move forward .
i expect there will be a vote on it . "
department spokesman sean mccormack played down the prospect of a russian veto .
" nobody wants it to get to that point , " mccormack said .
" nobody wants to see a veto . "
russian foreign minister sergei lavrov last month said a veto would be a last resort .
" i hope a veto will not be necessary , " lavrov said after a meeting of foreign ministers of the group of eight industrialized nations in potsdam , germany .
rising tensions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbian prime minister vojislav kostunica -lrb- right -rrb- some political analysts hope moscow would at least abstain from voting on kosovo in the council , although they said it was unlikely given the rising us-russia tensions over a planned us missile defense system in eastern europe .
" if there is a veto , the most likely outcome is a unilateral declaration of independence , " said stephen sestanovich of the council on foreign relations .
" i would expect that washington will recognize kosovo and that at least a majority of eu countries will as well , but i do n't know that you would get the eu as a collective body to do so , and that starts looking awkward , sestanovich said .
" that starts creating some problems . "
facing a basque separatist movement on its own soil , spain is concerned about the implications of europe recognizing kosovo 's independence outside the un framework .
the issue is up for discussion by the contact group for kosovo - the united states , britain , germany , italy and russia - when it meets on tuesday in paris .
no immediate plans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the security council is divided over the issue of kosovo meanwhile , un diplomats said the security council had no immediate plan to take up a revised draft resolution put forward by britain on may 31 that would reaffirm support for the un plan for kosovo .
the new draft , sponsored by the united states , belgium , britain , france , italy , slovakia and germany , calls for " full implementation " of the provisions contained in the ahtisaari plan .
though technically a serbian province , kosovo has been un-run since the end of the nato assault in mid-1999 .
some 10,000 ethnic albanians died and hundreds of thousands fled kosovo during the 1998-1999 conflict between serbian government troops and ethnic albanian separatists . dw staff / afp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bush : it 's time for kosovo 's independence us president george w. bush rejected sunday the idea of an " endless dialogue " on the future status of kosovo , saying the time was ripe to move towards independence for the albanian-majority serbian province .
-lrb- 10.06.2007 -rrb- kosovo question contributes to eu-russia troubles a us anti-missile defense system , pipeline politics , polish meat , press freedom and iran policy have all been issues in the disputes between the west and russia ahead of the g8 summit .

for example , artist walter de maria 's so-called " kasseler loch , " or kassel whole , a 1,000-meter -lrb- 3,280 feet -rrb- metal pole pounded vertically into the ground and sculptor claes oldenburg 's 12-meter-high pick-ax seemingly stuck into the bank of the fulda river by a passing giant ca n't be missed . and no visitor will forget jonathan borowsky 's " man walking to the sky , " a sculpture of a man walking up a pole 25 meters into the air directly in front of the kassel train station . " old " kassel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kassel 's " man walking to the sky " the city 's art installations make up only part of its charm .
for many visitors , the mix of old and new really gives this quiet city its unique atmosphere . while strolling through one of the kassel 's many parks , visitors may feel like they are being watched .
on top of a castle in the hillside that is wilhelmshohe park stands a towering bronze statue of hercules . built in 1719 , the statue tops an octagonal castle overlooking kassel with a cascading landscaping which is unique to germany .
the panoramic view from the apex of the park makes the walk up to hercules ' perch worthwhile . tourists following the german fairytale route , a trail from hanau to bremen , will land in kassel due to the city 's two most famous sons . wilhelm and jacob grimm moved to the town in 1798 and over the years collected many of their famous tales within the city 's medieval walls , including rapunzel , cinderella and little red riding hood . located in bellevue palace , the brothers grimm museum highlights not just the storytelling prowess of the brothers -lrb- their last collection contained over 200 fairytales -rrb- but also their linguistic and political work . documenta xii since its inaugural event in 1955 , documenta has helped to transform kassel into a worldwide destination for contemporary art .
its three-month-long show is an artistic free-for-all and takes place in the middle of a medieval park . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kassel expects large crowds this year the people of kassel are invited to the party .
instead of the invitation-only cocktail parties of documentas past , the curators will host a celebration to thank the residents of kassel for their support through 12 documentas . the party will feature norwegian rock band kaizers orchestra and the dj formation cluster , and will culminate in an illumination of the park 's renowned water gardens . from the collection of old master paintings in the wilhelmshöhe palace art gallery to the clean modern design of the karl branner bridge , kassel is a city of contradiction . a contradiction that is sure to be deepened through the summer as the artists , curators and documenta visitors descend upon the city .
the brothers grimm would be proud . documenta 12 runs from june 16 to sept .

" the situation right now is a complete mess , " borg told reporters in luxembourg ahead of a meeting of eu interior ministers on tuesday .
" it 's a free for all . " " each year 600 immigrants are dying - this is a very conservative estimate i must say - on the threshold of europe .
the figure could rise again this year , " he said . several boats with illegal migrants have recently capsized in the waters between the mediterranean island and libya .
eighteen bodies were found in the zone last month by a french ship . borg said he would urge eu countries to help with " burden sharing " by accepting any would-be immigrants who are rescued in international waters . " it is only fair that those immigrants who are saved are distributed on a rotational basis between the 27 eu member states , " he said . " temporarily those immigrants should go to the nearest european state until they are transferred to the designated country of destination , " he said . the country of destination would be chosen based on size and population . a tough task bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sweden hosts the largest number of iraqi refugees in the eu eu diplomats have said that borg faces a tough task in convincing his eu partners to help .
many countries agree on the need to save people but few are keen to take responsibility for illegal migrants once they are safely ashore . some believe it would be better to work closely with the countries that people are fleeing or crossing to reach europe , concerned that " burden sharing " might appear to immigrants as a " free ticket " to move deeper into the eu . " i do n't think that this is a free flight to go to paris , " borg said .

" " they first cross the desert ... and if they survive that they try to cross the mediterranean and if they survive that then they are accepted or saved by the european authorities . he said that the number of people arriving was small in eu terms but that malta , with a population of around 400,000 , had to bear the heaviest load in dealing with a problem that has significantly grown in recent weeks . " from the beginning of this year our coast guard has saved 350 -lrb- people -rrb- , 250 of whom in the past 10-15 days , " he said . describing himself as a pragmatic politician , borg said he was not expecting miracles from tuesday 's talks .

some 9,000 iraqis found a new home in sweden last year .
stockholm expects some 20,000 more this year .
sweden grants refugee status or other protection to almost all iraqi asylum seekers .
eu diplomats said the number of iraqis seeking refuge in the bloc was likely to reach 40,000 this year .

regional solutions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu justice commissioner franco frattini eu ministers earlier this year said that there was no need for resettlement of iraqis inside the eu and added that the iraqi refugee crisis must be tackled in the region .

" the situation right now is a complete mess , " borg told reporters in luxembourg ahead of a meeting of eu interior ministers on tuesday .
" it 's a free for all . " " each year 600 immigrants are dying - this is a very conservative estimate i must say - on the threshold of europe .
the figure could rise again this year , " he said . several boats with illegal migrants have recently capsized in the waters between the mediterranean island and libya .
eighteen bodies were found in the zone last month by a french ship . borg said he would urge eu countries to help with " burden sharing " by accepting any would-be immigrants who are rescued in international waters . " it is only fair that those immigrants who are saved are distributed on a rotational basis between the 27 eu member states , " he said . " temporarily those immigrants should go to the nearest european state until they are transferred to the designated country of destination , " he said . the country of destination would be chosen based on size and population . a tough task bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sweden hosts the largest number of iraqi refugees in the eu eu diplomats have said that borg faces a tough task in convincing his eu partners to help .
many countries agree on the need to save people but few are keen to take responsibility for illegal migrants once they are safely ashore . some believe it would be better to work closely with the countries that people are fleeing or crossing to reach europe , concerned that " burden sharing " might appear to immigrants as a " free ticket " to move deeper into the eu . " i do n't think that this is a free flight to go to paris , " borg said .
" i think that the desperation of these people is very evident . " " they first cross the desert ... and if they survive that they try to cross the mediterranean and if they survive that then they are accepted or saved by the european authorities . he said that the number of people arriving was small in eu terms but that malta , with a population of around 400,000 , had to bear the heaviest load in dealing with a problem that has significantly grown in recent weeks . " from the beginning of this year our coast guard has saved 350 -lrb- people -rrb- , 250 of whom in the past 10-15 days , " he said . describing himself as a pragmatic politician , borg said he was not expecting miracles from tuesday 's talks . " a commitment , that would be ideal ... but at least that the discussion will start , " he said refuge crises bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european commission hopes to harmonize asylum rules across the union despite a commitment to an eu-wide common asylum system , member states not only take different approaches to asylum claims but also apply very different standards of treatment to asylum seekers . sweden , for instance , has demanded that other eu countries take in more vulnerable people fleeing iraq and has also called for a further harmonization of widely differing asylum procedures in the eu .
some 9,000 iraqis found a new home in sweden last year .
stockholm expects some 20,000 more this year .
sweden grants refugee status or other protection to almost all iraqi asylum seekers .
eu diplomats said the number of iraqis seeking refuge in the bloc was likely to reach 40,000 this year .
around 20,000 iraqis applied for asylum in the eu in 2006 , which is , compared to 2005 , an increase of 77 percent .
regional solutions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu justice commissioner franco frattini eu ministers earlier this year said that there was no need for resettlement of iraqis inside the eu and added that the iraqi refugee crisis must be tackled in the region .
meanwhile , the european commission has slammed member states for a lack of solidarity in hosting asylum seekers and dealing with refugee crisis and wants to use the meeting in luxembourg to drum up support for new plans aimed at harmonizing asylum rules across the eu .
currently , there are some 20 different systems of asylum in the 27-nation bloc .
the commission , the eu 's executive arm , wants to have more harmonized rules in place by 2010 .
unfulfilled pledges bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : about 500,000 illegal immigrants enter the eu each year eu justice commissioner franco frattini is expected to use the luxembourg meeting to rebuke governments for not fulfilling pledges to send technical equipment for the bloc 's border control agency frontex .
boats , helicopters and planes needed to patrol the eu 's southern maritime borders existed only " on paper , " frontex said monday .
about 500,000 illegal immigrants enter the eu each year , mainly from poor african countries .
the bloc has responded by stepping up border controls , with so-called " frontline " states , spain , italy and malta , demanding even tougher measures against illegals .
eu officials have accused maltese authorities of failing to meet their international duties to save lives by refusing to admit migrants rescued by vessels outside its search and rescue area .
officials in malta deny they have ever left migrants at sea in distress .
ai appeal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : illegal immigration is driven mainly by economic forces human rights watchdog amnesty international issued an appeal to the german eu presidency to set up a rescue plan for immigrants in distress at sea .
" the eu must draw consequences and investigate the latest incidents , " said amnesty 's director for europe , dick oostings .
eu ministers are also expected to discuss commission proposals to introduce tough sanctions for employers of illegal migrants , including heavy fines and prison sentences for the worst offenders .
the commission argues that the prospect of finding an illicit job in the eu was the main driving force behind illegal immigration .
but the plan could run into fierce opposition from some member states as the eu does not have the competence to interfere with matters of criminal law . dw staff / afp , dpa -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" " i am glad that the severely depleted eel and bluefin tuna stocks will shortly receive the protection that they so badly need , " he added .
" indeed , this protection will not come one day too soon . " on tuna , the ministers backed plans to cut member states ' fishing quotas for this year by 10 percent as part of a 15-year package to save the species , which has become a victim of its success with consumers . environmentalists have warned that tuna face eventual extinction if fishing continued at current rates to feed a worldwide fad for japanese food such as sushi . under the measures , the amount of time fishing boats can be at sea will be limited to six months a year , while the minimum size of fish allowed to be taken was raised from 10 kilos -lrb- 22 pounds -rrb- to 30 to help them reproduce . the package , which will hit france , italy and spain particularly hard as they are the eu 's biggest tuna fishing nations , is part of a broader global effort to protect tuna which was agreed in january in japan . eel deal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a british classic : fish and chips the measures aim to boost stocks by ensuring that a minimum 40 percent of eel will not be fished when they leave rivers in western europe to lay their eggs in the sargasso sea between the caribbean and florida . eel stocks have been in a freefall since 1980 , plunging by 95-99 percent , according the convention on international trade in endangered species , or cites . young eel are exported from europe to asia , particularly japan and china , where they are considered a great delicacy .

but the court of first instance upheld the american company 's right to use the names on merchandise .
" the court of first instance dismisses actions in proceedings taken by budejovicky against anheuser-busch concerning the use of community trademarks , " the court of first instance in luxembourg said in a statement .
weakened reputation budvar had said that under french law , an appellation of origin could not be used for any product or service which would weaken its reputation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beer might be nice at the bar , but it 's a business , too st. louis , missouri-based anheuser-busch , the largest us brewer , applied for the trademarks in 1996 at the office for harmonization in the internal market , which is responsible for eu-wide trademarks .
the us company and the czech budvar have taken legal action against each other in national courts across europe .
anheuser-busch won the registration for several words related to budweiser , which it has used for products as stationery , cleaning supplies and clothing .
budvar said that the court ruling would have no impact on its business . " today 's decisions are not substantial from the point of view of budejovicky budvar 's beer sales and do not threaten its current business activities in eu countries , " the company said .
privatization fears in may , a europe-wide grouping of beer lovers called on czechs to lobby their government not to privatize budejovicky budvar - the country 's third largest brewery .

the center-right czech government announced the first step towards privatizing budvar at the beginning of april when the agriculture minister announced that the brewery would be transformed into a shareholder company .
anheuser-busch is tipped to be a frontrunner to buy the last major czech brewery not yet snapped up by a global drinks company .
to the ebcu , brewing multinationals like anheuser-busch and belgium 's inbev represent a threat to traditionally-brewed quality beer .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : once physical , the divide between east and west has become economic the average east-west wage difference is 21 percent , although in certain sectors , westerners earned as much as 41 percent more than their eastern-german counterparts , the online study showed .
" it is a big problem that so many years after reunification , such earnings discrepancies still exist , " reinhard bispinck of the hans böckler foundation told reporters after announcing the results .
" clearly we have n't managed to get the economies of both parts of the country on equal footing . "
gap cuts across sectors the wage gap cuts across trades : a cook in western germany takes home an average 1,311 euros per month -lrb- $ 1,750 -rrb- , compared with 985 euros in the east .
a web designer in the west takes home an average 41 percent more than their eastern counterparts : 2,300 euros compared to 1,360 euros .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the difference was biggest between web designers eastern german auto mechanics , data-entry workers , accountants , secretaries , bookkeepers , machinists and retail buyers all were paid about a third of what they would earn in the western states .
and there was a 20 percent discrepancy between geriatric nurses , civil engineers , teachers , metal workers , and cooks .
how to account for the chasm between eastern and western pay scales ?
the main problem lies in the east 's stagnant economy , bispinck said , noting eastern unemployment is nearly double that in the west .
fewer wage agreements moreover , the number of workers who are paid according to collective-bargaining agreements or union scales is much lower in the east , bispinck pointed out .
" in the ' new ' german states just 50 percent of workers are paid at union wages , compared with two-thirds in the west .
that gives eastern-german employers a much greater chance to pay less , " bispinck said .

" police from the 27 eu countries , attempting to identify a suspect using hair , sperm or fingernail samples , will be able to compare it with dna information gathered for criminal investigations in other eu states . aside from biometric data , police will also be able to share vehicle registration information when conducting such investigations . the agreement also allows police from different eu states to conduct joint , cross-border operations .

" we should not waste too much time in making decisions , " the secretary general told reporters on monday .
he said it was " absolutely necessary that the security council should take a fair and sound judgment on this by endorsing " un mediator martti ahtisaari 's plan for kosovo 's " supervised independence . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : united nation secretary general ban ki-moon ban was briefing reporters on his recent foreign trip , including stops in panama , spain and germany where he attended the g8 summit last week .
during a visit to albania sunday , us president george w. bush called for speedy moves to give kosovo independence , saying the days of " endless dialogue " were over despite the outright hostility of serbia and its ally russia .
" we need to get moving , and the end result is independence , " he noted .
but serbian prime minister vojislav kostunica said monday that his country was " rightfully outraged over the us policy on kosovo " and insisted washington had no right to give away serbian territory .
no more delays bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president george bush received a hero 's welcome in albania on sunday us state department spokesman tom casey , however , urged the security council on monday to move quickly .
" there is a resolution that is tabled at the un , " casey said .
" i expect those discussions to move forward .
i expect there will be a vote on it . "
department spokesman sean mccormack played down the prospect of a russian veto .
" nobody wants it to get to that point , " mccormack said .
" nobody wants to see a veto . "
russian foreign minister sergei lavrov last month said a veto would be a last resort .
" i hope a veto will not be necessary , " lavrov said after a meeting of foreign ministers of the group of eight industrialized nations in potsdam , germany .
rising tensions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbian prime minister vojislav kostunica -lrb- right -rrb- some political analysts hope moscow would at least abstain from voting on kosovo in the council , although they said it was unlikely given the rising us-russia tensions over a planned us missile defense system in eastern europe .
" if there is a veto , the most likely outcome is a unilateral declaration of independence , " said stephen sestanovich of the council on foreign relations .
" i would expect that washington will recognize kosovo and that at least a majority of eu countries will as well , but i do n't know that you would get the eu as a collective body to do so , and that starts looking awkward , sestanovich said .
" that starts creating some problems . "
facing a basque separatist movement on its own soil , spain is concerned about the implications of europe recognizing kosovo 's independence outside the un framework .
the issue is up for discussion by the contact group for kosovo - the united states , britain , germany , italy and russia - when it meets on tuesday in paris .
no immediate plans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the security council is divided over the issue of kosovo meanwhile , un diplomats said the security council had no immediate plan to take up a revised draft resolution put forward by britain on may 31 that would reaffirm support for the un plan for kosovo .
the new draft , sponsored by the united states , belgium , britain , france , italy , slovakia and germany , calls for " full implementation " of the provisions contained in the ahtisaari plan .
though technically a serbian province , kosovo has been un-run since the end of the nato assault in mid-1999 .
some 10,000 ethnic albanians died and hundreds of thousands fled kosovo during the 1998-1999 conflict between serbian government troops and ethnic albanian separatists . dw staff / afp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bush : it 's time for kosovo 's independence us president george w. bush rejected sunday the idea of an " endless dialogue " on the future status of kosovo , saying the time was ripe to move towards independence for the albanian-majority serbian province .
-lrb- 10.06.2007 -rrb- kosovo question contributes to eu-russia troubles a us anti-missile defense system , pipeline politics , polish meat , press freedom and iran policy have all been issues in the disputes between the west and russia ahead of the g8 summit .

they warned that , without compromise , efforts to end the crisis over the draft of the constitution that was rejected by voters in france and the netherlands would fail at the summit on june 21 and 22 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso expects a " new dynamic " in talks " if we fail again , then it will have very negative consequences , " barroso said at a joint session of the european parliament with national representatives . strong rhetoric from warsaw " if we want to have success in this issue , then we must all move , " said foreign minister steinmeier .
" i have the impression that the willingness to move is absolutely there , " he added , and said he hoped it would be the case for all sides at the summit .
but steinmeier 's conviction that " a new dynamic has come into the talks " is in stark contrast to recent rhetoric from polish prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski , who has repeatedly threatened to veto the draft treaty because he disagrees with its provisions for how member states would vote on policy issues .
" poland will never accept , under any pretext , the system that has been put on the table to us , " kaczynski told polish public radio tuesday . poland fears losing clout warsaw is concerned that plans to reform the way member states vote on decisions affecting the whole bloc could cost it some of its clout .
it wants the voting system to be based on the square root of the number , in millions , of the population of each member state .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french rejected an eu constitution in 2005 but germany , which holds the eu 's rotating presidency until the end of next month , when it hands over to portugal , has poured cold water on the polish proposal .
german chancellor angela merkel has up to now refused to take a second look at the voting mechanism issue , for fear that reopening the debate would lead to an avalanche of demands on various issues from all member states .
the voting system , which poland had previously accepted , would mean that 55 percent of eu members with at least 65 percent of the eu 's population would be required to pass resolutions .
kaczynski now says the system is unfair to smaller nations , and has called for the eu to prolong the debate for another year . " the current situation makes a lot of people unhappy , " kaczynski told a press conference later on tuesday .
" we are the only ones with enough courage to say so , because we are a large country and also because we are the most affected " by the qualified majority system of voting proposed at present . " we will not allow ourselves to be radically downgraded , " he said . ' delay is not a solution ' barroso rejected kaczynski 's notion that there was still time to change the eu treaties , as a decision would not be made for at least a year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier : ' the willingness is there ' " delay is not a solution .
the problem will not go away .

the german eu presidency has been trying to steer a course through the different opinions of the eu members on how to draft a new treaty that would replace the draft constitution dealt a death blow in 2005 by the french and the dutch .
germany plans to submit a list of topics that would be discussed by an intergovernmental conference to eu members at the summit meeting .
but poland has threatened to bar the conference from getting down to business if the list of topics for debate does not meet with its approval . merkel on monday began a marathon of diplomatic meetings , during which she will meet , in the space of one week , with seven european heads of state or government , including polish president lech kaczynski , the prime minister 's twin brother . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de french proposal to end eu crisis makes headway french president nicolas sarkozy 's idea of a simplified treaty designed to end the european union 's constitional crisis appears to be gaining support .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de development aid -pipe- 12.06.2007 eu resumes direct aid to palestinian authority großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hamas-led government has been blacklisted by the west with the backing of the us administration , a 15-month-old economic embargo of the hamas-led palestinian authority is being eased with direct financial aid from european donors . in the one month since washington agreed to allow donors to send funds to finance minister salam fayyad through a palestine liberation organization -lrb- plo -rrb- account , it has received at least $ 160 million .
on monday , the european union said it was renewing support by launching a four-million-euro -lrb- $ 5.3 million -rrb- project to help ensure that palestinian taxpayers ' money is spent efficiently and that expenditures are accounted for .
diplomats said the eu was also considering expanding an existing aid mechanism to pay palestinian police .
some israeli officials have criticized what they see as a shift in us policy aimed at bolstering palestinian president mahmoud abbas , whose fatah faction joined a unity government led by islamist hamas three months ago .
they also object to plans to finance the police , which fall under the hamas-run interior ministry .
" the palestinian authority 's financial position is much better today than six months ago .
we are losing , " said a senior israeli official involved in overseeing the embargo imposed after islamist hamas came to power in 2006 .
the embargo was leveled after hamas , which is blacklisted by the west as a terrorist organization , took office in march 2006 .
the party has continued to defy western demands to recognize israel , renounce violence and abide by previous interim peace deals .
support from eu palestinian information minister mustapha barghuti on monday welcomed the resumption of eu aid to the palestinian finance ministry and urged brussels to keep it flowing .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : once physical , the divide between east and west has become economic the average east-west wage difference is 21 percent , although in certain sectors , westerners earned as much as 41 percent more than their eastern-german counterparts , the online study showed .
" it is a big problem that so many years after reunification , such earnings discrepancies still exist , " reinhard bispinck of the hans böckler foundation told reporters after announcing the results .
" clearly we have n't managed to get the economies of both parts of the country on equal footing . "
gap cuts across sectors the wage gap cuts across trades : a cook in western germany takes home an average 1,311 euros per month -lrb- $ 1,750 -rrb- , compared with 985 euros in the east .
a web designer in the west takes home an average 41 percent more than their eastern counterparts : 2,300 euros compared to 1,360 euros .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the difference was biggest between web designers eastern german auto mechanics , data-entry workers , accountants , secretaries , bookkeepers , machinists and retail buyers all were paid about a third of what they would earn in the western states .
and there was a 20 percent discrepancy between geriatric nurses , civil engineers , teachers , metal workers , and cooks .
how to account for the chasm between eastern and western pay scales ?
the main problem lies in the east 's stagnant economy , bispinck said , noting eastern unemployment is nearly double that in the west .
fewer wage agreements moreover , the number of workers who are paid according to collective-bargaining agreements or union scales is much lower in the east , bispinck pointed out .
" in the ' new ' german states just 50 percent of workers are paid at union wages , compared with two-thirds in the west .
that gives eastern-german employers a much greater chance to pay less , " bispinck said .
" if the economic upswing continues for a while , then there is a chance for the east to catch up , " he added , although he admitted there had been no sign of this happening so far . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de west germans have hang-ups about going east as they pick up pictures taken over the easter holidays , few western germans are flipping through photos of the country 's east , and experts say not many vacations in the former east germany are being planned .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a giant bluefin tuna fish at home in an aquarium eu fisheries ministers reached separate agreements that will restrict how much bluefin tuna and eel fisherman can pull from the waters surrounding europe . welcoming the deals , eu fisheries commissioner joe borg said that they " mark an important step on the way to ensuring the sustainability of european fisheries . " " i am glad that the severely depleted eel and bluefin tuna stocks will shortly receive the protection that they so badly need , " he added .
" indeed , this protection will not come one day too soon . " on tuna , the ministers backed plans to cut member states ' fishing quotas for this year by 10 percent as part of a 15-year package to save the species , which has become a victim of its success with consumers . environmentalists have warned that tuna face eventual extinction if fishing continued at current rates to feed a worldwide fad for japanese food such as sushi . under the measures , the amount of time fishing boats can be at sea will be limited to six months a year , while the minimum size of fish allowed to be taken was raised from 10 kilos -lrb- 22 pounds -rrb- to 30 to help them reproduce . the package , which will hit france , italy and spain particularly hard as they are the eu 's biggest tuna fishing nations , is part of a broader global effort to protect tuna which was agreed in january in japan . eel deal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a british classic : fish and chips the measures aim to boost stocks by ensuring that a minimum 40 percent of eel will not be fished when they leave rivers in western europe to lay their eggs in the sargasso sea between the caribbean and florida . eel stocks have been in a freefall since 1980 , plunging by 95-99 percent , according the convention on international trade in endangered species , or cites . young eel are exported from europe to asia , particularly japan and china , where they are considered a great delicacy .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a giant bluefin tuna fish at home in an aquarium eu fisheries ministers reached separate agreements that will restrict how much bluefin tuna and eel fisherman can pull from the waters surrounding europe . welcoming the deals , eu fisheries commissioner joe borg said that they " mark an important step on the way to ensuring the sustainability of european fisheries . " " i am glad that the severely depleted eel and bluefin tuna stocks will shortly receive the protection that they so badly need , " he added .
" indeed , this protection will not come one day too soon . " on tuna , the ministers backed plans to cut member states ' fishing quotas for this year by 10 percent as part of a 15-year package to save the species , which has become a victim of its success with consumers . environmentalists have warned that tuna face eventual extinction if fishing continued at current rates to feed a worldwide fad for japanese food such as sushi . under the measures , the amount of time fishing boats can be at sea will be limited to six months a year , while the minimum size of fish allowed to be taken was raised from 10 kilos -lrb- 22 pounds -rrb- to 30 to help them reproduce . the package , which will hit france , italy and spain particularly hard as they are the eu 's biggest tuna fishing nations , is part of a broader global effort to protect tuna which was agreed in january in japan . eel deal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a british classic : fish and chips the measures aim to boost stocks by ensuring that a minimum 40 percent of eel will not be fished when they leave rivers in western europe to lay their eggs in the sargasso sea between the caribbean and florida . eel stocks have been in a freefall since 1980 , plunging by 95-99 percent , according the convention on international trade in endangered species , or cites . young eel are exported from europe to asia , particularly japan and china , where they are considered a great delicacy .

they warned that , without compromise , efforts to end the crisis over the draft of the constitution that was rejected by voters in france and the netherlands would fail at the summit on june 21 and 22 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso expects a " new dynamic " in talks " if we fail again , then it will have very negative consequences , " barroso said at a joint session of the european parliament with national representatives . strong rhetoric from warsaw " if we want to have success in this issue , then we must all move , " said foreign minister steinmeier .
" i have the impression that the willingness to move is absolutely there , " he added , and said he hoped it would be the case for all sides at the summit .
but steinmeier 's conviction that " a new dynamic has come into the talks " is in stark contrast to recent rhetoric from polish prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski , who has repeatedly threatened to veto the draft treaty because he disagrees with its provisions for how member states would vote on policy issues .
" poland will never accept , under any pretext , the system that has been put on the table to us , " kaczynski told polish public radio tuesday . poland fears losing clout warsaw is concerned that plans to reform the way member states vote on decisions affecting the whole bloc could cost it some of its clout .
it wants the voting system to be based on the square root of the number , in millions , of the population of each member state .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french rejected an eu constitution in 2005 but germany , which holds the eu 's rotating presidency until the end of next month , when it hands over to portugal , has poured cold water on the polish proposal .
german chancellor angela merkel has up to now refused to take a second look at the voting mechanism issue , for fear that reopening the debate would lead to an avalanche of demands on various issues from all member states .
the voting system , which poland had previously accepted , would mean that 55 percent of eu members with at least 65 percent of the eu 's population would be required to pass resolutions .
kaczynski now says the system is unfair to smaller nations , and has called for the eu to prolong the debate for another year . " the current situation makes a lot of people unhappy , " kaczynski told a press conference later on tuesday .
" we are the only ones with enough courage to say so , because we are a large country and also because we are the most affected " by the qualified majority system of voting proposed at present . " we will not allow ourselves to be radically downgraded , " he said . ' delay is not a solution ' barroso rejected kaczynski 's notion that there was still time to change the eu treaties , as a decision would not be made for at least a year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier : ' the willingness is there ' " delay is not a solution .
the problem will not go away .
help us to find a solution , " barroso told members of the european parliament .
the german eu presidency has been trying to steer a course through the different opinions of the eu members on how to draft a new treaty that would replace the draft constitution dealt a death blow in 2005 by the french and the dutch .
germany plans to submit a list of topics that would be discussed by an intergovernmental conference to eu members at the summit meeting .
but poland has threatened to bar the conference from getting down to business if the list of topics for debate does not meet with its approval . merkel on monday began a marathon of diplomatic meetings , during which she will meet , in the space of one week , with seven european heads of state or government , including polish president lech kaczynski , the prime minister 's twin brother . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de french proposal to end eu crisis makes headway french president nicolas sarkozy 's idea of a simplified treaty designed to end the european union 's constitional crisis appears to be gaining support .

" we should not waste too much time in making decisions , " the secretary general told reporters on monday .
he said it was " absolutely necessary that the security council should take a fair and sound judgment on this by endorsing " un mediator martti ahtisaari 's plan for kosovo 's " supervised independence . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : united nation secretary general ban ki-moon ban was briefing reporters on his recent foreign trip , including stops in panama , spain and germany where he attended the g8 summit last week .
during a visit to albania sunday , us president george w. bush called for speedy moves to give kosovo independence , saying the days of " endless dialogue " were over despite the outright hostility of serbia and its ally russia .
" we need to get moving , and the end result is independence , " he noted .
but serbian prime minister vojislav kostunica said monday that his country was " rightfully outraged over the us policy on kosovo " and insisted washington had no right to give away serbian territory .
no more delays bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president george bush received a hero 's welcome in albania on sunday us state department spokesman tom casey , however , urged the security council on monday to move quickly .
" there is a resolution that is tabled at the un , " casey said .
" i expect those discussions to move forward .
i expect there will be a vote on it . "
department spokesman sean mccormack played down the prospect of a russian veto .
" nobody wants it to get to that point , " mccormack said .
" nobody wants to see a veto . "
russian foreign minister sergei lavrov last month said a veto would be a last resort .
" i hope a veto will not be necessary , " lavrov said after a meeting of foreign ministers of the group of eight industrialized nations in potsdam , germany .
rising tensions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbian prime minister vojislav kostunica -lrb- right -rrb- some political analysts hope moscow would at least abstain from voting on kosovo in the council , although they said it was unlikely given the rising us-russia tensions over a planned us missile defense system in eastern europe .
" if there is a veto , the most likely outcome is a unilateral declaration of independence , " said stephen sestanovich of the council on foreign relations .
" i would expect that washington will recognize kosovo and that at least a majority of eu countries will as well , but i do n't know that you would get the eu as a collective body to do so , and that starts looking awkward , sestanovich said .
" that starts creating some problems . "
facing a basque separatist movement on its own soil , spain is concerned about the implications of europe recognizing kosovo 's independence outside the un framework .
the issue is up for discussion by the contact group for kosovo - the united states , britain , germany , italy and russia - when it meets on tuesday in paris .
no immediate plans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the security council is divided over the issue of kosovo meanwhile , un diplomats said the security council had no immediate plan to take up a revised draft resolution put forward by britain on may 31 that would reaffirm support for the un plan for kosovo .
the new draft , sponsored by the united states , belgium , britain , france , italy , slovakia and germany , calls for " full implementation " of the provisions contained in the ahtisaari plan .
though technically a serbian province , kosovo has been un-run since the end of the nato assault in mid-1999 .
some 10,000 ethnic albanians died and hundreds of thousands fled kosovo during the 1998-1999 conflict between serbian government troops and ethnic albanian separatists . dw staff / afp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bush : it 's time for kosovo 's independence us president george w. bush rejected sunday the idea of an " endless dialogue " on the future status of kosovo , saying the time was ripe to move towards independence for the albanian-majority serbian province .
-lrb- 10.06.2007 -rrb- kosovo question contributes to eu-russia troubles a us anti-missile defense system , pipeline politics , polish meat , press freedom and iran policy have all been issues in the disputes between the west and russia ahead of the g8 summit .

for example , artist walter de maria 's so-called " kasseler loch , " or kassel whole , a 1,000-meter -lrb- 3,280 feet -rrb- metal pole pounded vertically into the ground and sculptor claes oldenburg 's 12-meter-high pick-ax seemingly stuck into the bank of the fulda river by a passing giant ca n't be missed . and no visitor will forget jonathan borowsky 's " man walking to the sky , " a sculpture of a man walking up a pole 25 meters into the air directly in front of the kassel train station .

for many visitors , the mix of old and new really gives this quiet city its unique atmosphere . while strolling through one of the kassel 's many parks , visitors may feel like they are being watched .
on top of a castle in the hillside that is wilhelmshohe park stands a towering bronze statue of hercules . built in 1719 , the statue tops an octagonal castle overlooking kassel with a cascading landscaping which is unique to germany .
the panoramic view from the apex of the park makes the walk up to hercules ' perch worthwhile . tourists following the german fairytale route , a trail from hanau to bremen , will land in kassel due to the city 's two most famous sons . wilhelm and jacob grimm moved to the town in 1798 and over the years collected many of their famous tales within the city 's medieval walls , including rapunzel , cinderella and little red riding hood . located in bellevue palace , the brothers grimm museum highlights not just the storytelling prowess of the brothers -lrb- their last collection contained over 200 fairytales -rrb- but also their linguistic and political work . documenta xii since its inaugural event in 1955 , documenta has helped to transform kassel into a worldwide destination for contemporary art .
its three-month-long show is an artistic free-for-all and takes place in the middle of a medieval park . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kassel expects large crowds this year the people of kassel are invited to the party .
instead of the invitation-only cocktail parties of documentas past , the curators will host a celebration to thank the residents of kassel for their support through 12 documentas . the party will feature norwegian rock band kaizers orchestra and the dj formation cluster , and will culminate in an illumination of the park 's renowned water gardens . from the collection of old master paintings in the wilhelmshöhe palace art gallery to the clean modern design of the karl branner bridge , kassel is a city of contradiction . a contradiction that is sure to be deepened through the summer as the artists , curators and documenta visitors descend upon the city .

they warned that , without compromise , efforts to end the crisis over the draft of the constitution that was rejected by voters in france and the netherlands would fail at the summit on june 21 and 22 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso expects a " new dynamic " in talks " if we fail again , then it will have very negative consequences , " barroso said at a joint session of the european parliament with national representatives . strong rhetoric from warsaw " if we want to have success in this issue , then we must all move , " said foreign minister steinmeier .
" i have the impression that the willingness to move is absolutely there , " he added , and said he hoped it would be the case for all sides at the summit .
but steinmeier 's conviction that " a new dynamic has come into the talks " is in stark contrast to recent rhetoric from polish prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski , who has repeatedly threatened to veto the draft treaty because he disagrees with its provisions for how member states would vote on policy issues .
" poland will never accept , under any pretext , the system that has been put on the table to us , " kaczynski told polish public radio tuesday . poland fears losing clout warsaw is concerned that plans to reform the way member states vote on decisions affecting the whole bloc could cost it some of its clout .
it wants the voting system to be based on the square root of the number , in millions , of the population of each member state .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french rejected an eu constitution in 2005 but germany , which holds the eu 's rotating presidency until the end of next month , when it hands over to portugal , has poured cold water on the polish proposal .
german chancellor angela merkel has up to now refused to take a second look at the voting mechanism issue , for fear that reopening the debate would lead to an avalanche of demands on various issues from all member states .
the voting system , which poland had previously accepted , would mean that 55 percent of eu members with at least 65 percent of the eu 's population would be required to pass resolutions .
kaczynski now says the system is unfair to smaller nations , and has called for the eu to prolong the debate for another year . " the current situation makes a lot of people unhappy , " kaczynski told a press conference later on tuesday .

they warned that , without compromise , efforts to end the crisis over the draft of the constitution that was rejected by voters in france and the netherlands would fail at the summit on june 21 and 22 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso expects a " new dynamic " in talks " if we fail again , then it will have very negative consequences , " barroso said at a joint session of the european parliament with national representatives . strong rhetoric from warsaw " if we want to have success in this issue , then we must all move , " said foreign minister steinmeier .
" i have the impression that the willingness to move is absolutely there , " he added , and said he hoped it would be the case for all sides at the summit .
but steinmeier 's conviction that " a new dynamic has come into the talks " is in stark contrast to recent rhetoric from polish prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski , who has repeatedly threatened to veto the draft treaty because he disagrees with its provisions for how member states would vote on policy issues .
" poland will never accept , under any pretext , the system that has been put on the table to us , " kaczynski told polish public radio tuesday . poland fears losing clout warsaw is concerned that plans to reform the way member states vote on decisions affecting the whole bloc could cost it some of its clout .
it wants the voting system to be based on the square root of the number , in millions , of the population of each member state .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french rejected an eu constitution in 2005 but germany , which holds the eu 's rotating presidency until the end of next month , when it hands over to portugal , has poured cold water on the polish proposal .
german chancellor angela merkel has up to now refused to take a second look at the voting mechanism issue , for fear that reopening the debate would lead to an avalanche of demands on various issues from all member states .
the voting system , which poland had previously accepted , would mean that 55 percent of eu members with at least 65 percent of the eu 's population would be required to pass resolutions .
kaczynski now says the system is unfair to smaller nations , and has called for the eu to prolong the debate for another year . " the current situation makes a lot of people unhappy , " kaczynski told a press conference later on tuesday .

" the situation right now is a complete mess , " borg told reporters in luxembourg ahead of a meeting of eu interior ministers on tuesday .
" it 's a free for all . " " each year 600 immigrants are dying - this is a very conservative estimate i must say - on the threshold of europe .
the figure could rise again this year , " he said . several boats with illegal migrants have recently capsized in the waters between the mediterranean island and libya .
eighteen bodies were found in the zone last month by a french ship . borg said he would urge eu countries to help with " burden sharing " by accepting any would-be immigrants who are rescued in international waters . " it is only fair that those immigrants who are saved are distributed on a rotational basis between the 27 eu member states , " he said . " temporarily those immigrants should go to the nearest european state until they are transferred to the designated country of destination , " he said . the country of destination would be chosen based on size and population . a tough task bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sweden hosts the largest number of iraqi refugees in the eu eu diplomats have said that borg faces a tough task in convincing his eu partners to help .
many countries agree on the need to save people but few are keen to take responsibility for illegal migrants once they are safely ashore . some believe it would be better to work closely with the countries that people are fleeing or crossing to reach europe , concerned that " burden sharing " might appear to immigrants as a " free ticket " to move deeper into the eu . " i do n't think that this is a free flight to go to paris , " borg said .
" i think that the desperation of these people is very evident . " " they first cross the desert ... and if they survive that they try to cross the mediterranean and if they survive that then they are accepted or saved by the european authorities . he said that the number of people arriving was small in eu terms but that malta , with a population of around 400,000 , had to bear the heaviest load in dealing with a problem that has significantly grown in recent weeks . " from the beginning of this year our coast guard has saved 350 -lrb- people -rrb- , 250 of whom in the past 10-15 days , " he said . describing himself as a pragmatic politician , borg said he was not expecting miracles from tuesday 's talks . " a commitment , that would be ideal ... but at least that the discussion will start , " he said refuge crises bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european commission hopes to harmonize asylum rules across the union despite a commitment to an eu-wide common asylum system , member states not only take different approaches to asylum claims but also apply very different standards of treatment to asylum seekers . sweden , for instance , has demanded that other eu countries take in more vulnerable people fleeing iraq and has also called for a further harmonization of widely differing asylum procedures in the eu .
some 9,000 iraqis found a new home in sweden last year .
stockholm expects some 20,000 more this year .
sweden grants refugee status or other protection to almost all iraqi asylum seekers .
eu diplomats said the number of iraqis seeking refuge in the bloc was likely to reach 40,000 this year .
around 20,000 iraqis applied for asylum in the eu in 2006 , which is , compared to 2005 , an increase of 77 percent .
regional solutions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu justice commissioner franco frattini eu ministers earlier this year said that there was no need for resettlement of iraqis inside the eu and added that the iraqi refugee crisis must be tackled in the region .
meanwhile , the european commission has slammed member states for a lack of solidarity in hosting asylum seekers and dealing with refugee crisis and wants to use the meeting in luxembourg to drum up support for new plans aimed at harmonizing asylum rules across the eu .

" the situation right now is a complete mess , " borg told reporters in luxembourg ahead of a meeting of eu interior ministers on tuesday .
" it 's a free for all . " " each year 600 immigrants are dying - this is a very conservative estimate i must say - on the threshold of europe .
the figure could rise again this year , " he said . several boats with illegal migrants have recently capsized in the waters between the mediterranean island and libya .
eighteen bodies were found in the zone last month by a french ship . borg said he would urge eu countries to help with " burden sharing " by accepting any would-be immigrants who are rescued in international waters . " it is only fair that those immigrants who are saved are distributed on a rotational basis between the 27 eu member states , " he said . " temporarily those immigrants should go to the nearest european state until they are transferred to the designated country of destination , " he said . the country of destination would be chosen based on size and population . a tough task bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sweden hosts the largest number of iraqi refugees in the eu eu diplomats have said that borg faces a tough task in convincing his eu partners to help .
many countries agree on the need to save people but few are keen to take responsibility for illegal migrants once they are safely ashore . some believe it would be better to work closely with the countries that people are fleeing or crossing to reach europe , concerned that " burden sharing " might appear to immigrants as a " free ticket " to move deeper into the eu . " i do n't think that this is a free flight to go to paris , " borg said .
" i think that the desperation of these people is very evident . " " they first cross the desert ... and if they survive that they try to cross the mediterranean and if they survive that then they are accepted or saved by the european authorities . he said that the number of people arriving was small in eu terms but that malta , with a population of around 400,000 , had to bear the heaviest load in dealing with a problem that has significantly grown in recent weeks . " from the beginning of this year our coast guard has saved 350 -lrb- people -rrb- , 250 of whom in the past 10-15 days , " he said . describing himself as a pragmatic politician , borg said he was not expecting miracles from tuesday 's talks .

some 9,000 iraqis found a new home in sweden last year .
stockholm expects some 20,000 more this year .
sweden grants refugee status or other protection to almost all iraqi asylum seekers .
eu diplomats said the number of iraqis seeking refuge in the bloc was likely to reach 40,000 this year .
around 20,000 iraqis applied for asylum in the eu in 2006 , which is , compared to 2005 , an increase of 77 percent .

" the situation right now is a complete mess , " borg told reporters in luxembourg ahead of a meeting of eu interior ministers on tuesday .
" it 's a free for all . " " each year 600 immigrants are dying - this is a very conservative estimate i must say - on the threshold of europe .
the figure could rise again this year , " he said . several boats with illegal migrants have recently capsized in the waters between the mediterranean island and libya .
eighteen bodies were found in the zone last month by a french ship . borg said he would urge eu countries to help with " burden sharing " by accepting any would-be immigrants who are rescued in international waters . " it is only fair that those immigrants who are saved are distributed on a rotational basis between the 27 eu member states , " he said . " temporarily those immigrants should go to the nearest european state until they are transferred to the designated country of destination , " he said . the country of destination would be chosen based on size and population . a tough task bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sweden hosts the largest number of iraqi refugees in the eu eu diplomats have said that borg faces a tough task in convincing his eu partners to help .
many countries agree on the need to save people but few are keen to take responsibility for illegal migrants once they are safely ashore . some believe it would be better to work closely with the countries that people are fleeing or crossing to reach europe , concerned that " burden sharing " might appear to immigrants as a " free ticket " to move deeper into the eu . " i do n't think that this is a free flight to go to paris , " borg said .
" i think that the desperation of these people is very evident . " " they first cross the desert ... and if they survive that they try to cross the mediterranean and if they survive that then they are accepted or saved by the european authorities . he said that the number of people arriving was small in eu terms but that malta , with a population of around 400,000 , had to bear the heaviest load in dealing with a problem that has significantly grown in recent weeks . " from the beginning of this year our coast guard has saved 350 -lrb- people -rrb- , 250 of whom in the past 10-15 days , " he said . describing himself as a pragmatic politician , borg said he was not expecting miracles from tuesday 's talks . " a commitment , that would be ideal ... but at least that the discussion will start , " he said refuge crises bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european commission hopes to harmonize asylum rules across the union despite a commitment to an eu-wide common asylum system , member states not only take different approaches to asylum claims but also apply very different standards of treatment to asylum seekers . sweden , for instance , has demanded that other eu countries take in more vulnerable people fleeing iraq and has also called for a further harmonization of widely differing asylum procedures in the eu .
some 9,000 iraqis found a new home in sweden last year .
stockholm expects some 20,000 more this year .
sweden grants refugee status or other protection to almost all iraqi asylum seekers .
eu diplomats said the number of iraqis seeking refuge in the bloc was likely to reach 40,000 this year .
around 20,000 iraqis applied for asylum in the eu in 2006 , which is , compared to 2005 , an increase of 77 percent .
regional solutions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu justice commissioner franco frattini eu ministers earlier this year said that there was no need for resettlement of iraqis inside the eu and added that the iraqi refugee crisis must be tackled in the region .
meanwhile , the european commission has slammed member states for a lack of solidarity in hosting asylum seekers and dealing with refugee crisis and wants to use the meeting in luxembourg to drum up support for new plans aimed at harmonizing asylum rules across the eu .
currently , there are some 20 different systems of asylum in the 27-nation bloc .
the commission , the eu 's executive arm , wants to have more harmonized rules in place by 2010 .
unfulfilled pledges bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : about 500,000 illegal immigrants enter the eu each year eu justice commissioner franco frattini is expected to use the luxembourg meeting to rebuke governments for not fulfilling pledges to send technical equipment for the bloc 's border control agency frontex .
boats , helicopters and planes needed to patrol the eu 's southern maritime borders existed only " on paper , " frontex said monday .
about 500,000 illegal immigrants enter the eu each year , mainly from poor african countries .
the bloc has responded by stepping up border controls , with so-called " frontline " states , spain , italy and malta , demanding even tougher measures against illegals .
eu officials have accused maltese authorities of failing to meet their international duties to save lives by refusing to admit migrants rescued by vessels outside its search and rescue area .
officials in malta deny they have ever left migrants at sea in distress .
ai appeal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : illegal immigration is driven mainly by economic forces human rights watchdog amnesty international issued an appeal to the german eu presidency to set up a rescue plan for immigrants in distress at sea .
" the eu must draw consequences and investigate the latest incidents , " said amnesty 's director for europe , dick oostings .
eu ministers are also expected to discuss commission proposals to introduce tough sanctions for employers of illegal migrants , including heavy fines and prison sentences for the worst offenders .
the commission argues that the prospect of finding an illicit job in the eu was the main driving force behind illegal immigration .
but the plan could run into fierce opposition from some member states as the eu does not have the competence to interfere with matters of criminal law . dw staff / afp , dpa -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the situation right now is a complete mess , " borg told reporters in luxembourg ahead of a meeting of eu interior ministers on tuesday .
" it 's a free for all . " " each year 600 immigrants are dying - this is a very conservative estimate i must say - on the threshold of europe .
the figure could rise again this year , " he said . several boats with illegal migrants have recently capsized in the waters between the mediterranean island and libya .
eighteen bodies were found in the zone last month by a french ship . borg said he would urge eu countries to help with " burden sharing " by accepting any would-be immigrants who are rescued in international waters . " it is only fair that those immigrants who are saved are distributed on a rotational basis between the 27 eu member states , " he said . " temporarily those immigrants should go to the nearest european state until they are transferred to the designated country of destination , " he said . the country of destination would be chosen based on size and population . a tough task bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sweden hosts the largest number of iraqi refugees in the eu eu diplomats have said that borg faces a tough task in convincing his eu partners to help .
many countries agree on the need to save people but few are keen to take responsibility for illegal migrants once they are safely ashore . some believe it would be better to work closely with the countries that people are fleeing or crossing to reach europe , concerned that " burden sharing " might appear to immigrants as a " free ticket " to move deeper into the eu . " i do n't think that this is a free flight to go to paris , " borg said .
" i think that the desperation of these people is very evident . " " they first cross the desert ... and if they survive that they try to cross the mediterranean and if they survive that then they are accepted or saved by the european authorities . he said that the number of people arriving was small in eu terms but that malta , with a population of around 400,000 , had to bear the heaviest load in dealing with a problem that has significantly grown in recent weeks . " from the beginning of this year our coast guard has saved 350 -lrb- people -rrb- , 250 of whom in the past 10-15 days , " he said . describing himself as a pragmatic politician , borg said he was not expecting miracles from tuesday 's talks . " a commitment , that would be ideal ... but at least that the discussion will start , " he said refuge crises bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european commission hopes to harmonize asylum rules across the union despite a commitment to an eu-wide common asylum system , member states not only take different approaches to asylum claims but also apply very different standards of treatment to asylum seekers . sweden , for instance , has demanded that other eu countries take in more vulnerable people fleeing iraq and has also called for a further harmonization of widely differing asylum procedures in the eu .
some 9,000 iraqis found a new home in sweden last year .
stockholm expects some 20,000 more this year .
sweden grants refugee status or other protection to almost all iraqi asylum seekers .
eu diplomats said the number of iraqis seeking refuge in the bloc was likely to reach 40,000 this year .
around 20,000 iraqis applied for asylum in the eu in 2006 , which is , compared to 2005 , an increase of 77 percent .
regional solutions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu justice commissioner franco frattini eu ministers earlier this year said that there was no need for resettlement of iraqis inside the eu and added that the iraqi refugee crisis must be tackled in the region .
meanwhile , the european commission has slammed member states for a lack of solidarity in hosting asylum seekers and dealing with refugee crisis and wants to use the meeting in luxembourg to drum up support for new plans aimed at harmonizing asylum rules across the eu .
currently , there are some 20 different systems of asylum in the 27-nation bloc .
the commission , the eu 's executive arm , wants to have more harmonized rules in place by 2010 .
unfulfilled pledges bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : about 500,000 illegal immigrants enter the eu each year eu justice commissioner franco frattini is expected to use the luxembourg meeting to rebuke governments for not fulfilling pledges to send technical equipment for the bloc 's border control agency frontex .
boats , helicopters and planes needed to patrol the eu 's southern maritime borders existed only " on paper , " frontex said monday .
about 500,000 illegal immigrants enter the eu each year , mainly from poor african countries .
the bloc has responded by stepping up border controls , with so-called " frontline " states , spain , italy and malta , demanding even tougher measures against illegals .
eu officials have accused maltese authorities of failing to meet their international duties to save lives by refusing to admit migrants rescued by vessels outside its search and rescue area .
officials in malta deny they have ever left migrants at sea in distress .
ai appeal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : illegal immigration is driven mainly by economic forces human rights watchdog amnesty international issued an appeal to the german eu presidency to set up a rescue plan for immigrants in distress at sea .
" the eu must draw consequences and investigate the latest incidents , " said amnesty 's director for europe , dick oostings .
eu ministers are also expected to discuss commission proposals to introduce tough sanctions for employers of illegal migrants , including heavy fines and prison sentences for the worst offenders .
the commission argues that the prospect of finding an illicit job in the eu was the main driving force behind illegal immigration .
but the plan could run into fierce opposition from some member states as the eu does not have the competence to interfere with matters of criminal law . dw staff / afp , dpa -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" police from the 27 eu countries , attempting to identify a suspect using hair , sperm or fingernail samples , will be able to compare it with dna information gathered for criminal investigations in other eu states . aside from biometric data , police will also be able to share vehicle registration information when conducting such investigations . the agreement also allows police from different eu states to conduct joint , cross-border operations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : questions are being asked about how far is too far in the fight against crime and terrorism ?
" this is an important day , " german interior minister wolfgang schäuble , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency until the end of the month , told reporters .
" this provides us with an important source of information . " eu justice and security commissioner franco frattini told a news conference : " this will make the eu a safer area . " some countries already using system the scheme extends most of the treaty of prüm - a police cooperation deal signed in may 2005 by austria , belgium , france , germany , luxembourg , the netherlands and spain - to all 27 eu nations . the push for stronger eu wide security came from germany , which is a co-author of the prüm treaty . the seven " prüm " agreement countries were already sharing information from their national databases , with the other 20 countries to join the network soon , schäuble said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german interior minister schäuble " serious crime , serious threats to the men and women of the european union can only be combated by effective cooperation and effective exchange of data and information , " schäuble told reporters . schäuble said austria had reported " sensational breakthroughs " since it began using the system , reporting more than a thousand data matches in one six-week period . to protect privacy , a " hit / no hit " system will be introduced under which police will only be immediately told whether a dna sample , for example , they are studying matches one held in the database of another eu country .
they will then have to request further information about the matching data . eu justice commissioner franco frattini described the move as " a very important first step " which demonstrates how a well thought-out agreement between a few countries can quickly be introduced eu-wide . can not take action police will not be able to take action in another eu country after entering in " hot pursuit " of suspects under a demand by britain and ireland linked to problems in northern ireland , diplomats have said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dna information just a click away police officers will have to ask permission to conduct cross-border searches . but they will be able to be deployed for major sporting and other events wearing their national uniforms and carrying weapons ; an arrangement used to good effect by germany when it hosted last year 's soccer world cup . british home office minister joan ryan also welcomed the agreement . " criminals do not respect borders , " she told the eu ministers .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : once physical , the divide between east and west has become economic the average east-west wage difference is 21 percent , although in certain sectors , westerners earned as much as 41 percent more than their eastern-german counterparts , the online study showed .
" it is a big problem that so many years after reunification , such earnings discrepancies still exist , " reinhard bispinck of the hans böckler foundation told reporters after announcing the results .
" clearly we have n't managed to get the economies of both parts of the country on equal footing . "
gap cuts across sectors the wage gap cuts across trades : a cook in western germany takes home an average 1,311 euros per month -lrb- $ 1,750 -rrb- , compared with 985 euros in the east .
a web designer in the west takes home an average 41 percent more than their eastern counterparts : 2,300 euros compared to 1,360 euros .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the difference was biggest between web designers eastern german auto mechanics , data-entry workers , accountants , secretaries , bookkeepers , machinists and retail buyers all were paid about a third of what they would earn in the western states .
and there was a 20 percent discrepancy between geriatric nurses , civil engineers , teachers , metal workers , and cooks .
how to account for the chasm between eastern and western pay scales ?
the main problem lies in the east 's stagnant economy , bispinck said , noting eastern unemployment is nearly double that in the west .
fewer wage agreements moreover , the number of workers who are paid according to collective-bargaining agreements or union scales is much lower in the east , bispinck pointed out .
" in the ' new ' german states just 50 percent of workers are paid at union wages , compared with two-thirds in the west .
that gives eastern-german employers a much greater chance to pay less , " bispinck said .
" if the economic upswing continues for a while , then there is a chance for the east to catch up , " he added , although he admitted there had been no sign of this happening so far . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de west germans have hang-ups about going east as they pick up pictures taken over the easter holidays , few western germans are flipping through photos of the country 's east , and experts say not many vacations in the former east germany are being planned .

" the situation right now is a complete mess , " borg told reporters in luxembourg ahead of a meeting of eu interior ministers on tuesday .
" it 's a free for all . " " each year 600 immigrants are dying - this is a very conservative estimate i must say - on the threshold of europe .
the figure could rise again this year , " he said . several boats with illegal migrants have recently capsized in the waters between the mediterranean island and libya .
eighteen bodies were found in the zone last month by a french ship . borg said he would urge eu countries to help with " burden sharing " by accepting any would-be immigrants who are rescued in international waters . " it is only fair that those immigrants who are saved are distributed on a rotational basis between the 27 eu member states , " he said . " temporarily those immigrants should go to the nearest european state until they are transferred to the designated country of destination , " he said . the country of destination would be chosen based on size and population . a tough task bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sweden hosts the largest number of iraqi refugees in the eu eu diplomats have said that borg faces a tough task in convincing his eu partners to help .
many countries agree on the need to save people but few are keen to take responsibility for illegal migrants once they are safely ashore . some believe it would be better to work closely with the countries that people are fleeing or crossing to reach europe , concerned that " burden sharing " might appear to immigrants as a " free ticket " to move deeper into the eu . " i do n't think that this is a free flight to go to paris , " borg said .
" i think that the desperation of these people is very evident . " " they first cross the desert ... and if they survive that they try to cross the mediterranean and if they survive that then they are accepted or saved by the european authorities . he said that the number of people arriving was small in eu terms but that malta , with a population of around 400,000 , had to bear the heaviest load in dealing with a problem that has significantly grown in recent weeks . " from the beginning of this year our coast guard has saved 350 -lrb- people -rrb- , 250 of whom in the past 10-15 days , " he said . describing himself as a pragmatic politician , borg said he was not expecting miracles from tuesday 's talks . " a commitment , that would be ideal ... but at least that the discussion will start , " he said refuge crises bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european commission hopes to harmonize asylum rules across the union despite a commitment to an eu-wide common asylum system , member states not only take different approaches to asylum claims but also apply very different standards of treatment to asylum seekers . sweden , for instance , has demanded that other eu countries take in more vulnerable people fleeing iraq and has also called for a further harmonization of widely differing asylum procedures in the eu .
some 9,000 iraqis found a new home in sweden last year .
stockholm expects some 20,000 more this year .
sweden grants refugee status or other protection to almost all iraqi asylum seekers .
eu diplomats said the number of iraqis seeking refuge in the bloc was likely to reach 40,000 this year .
around 20,000 iraqis applied for asylum in the eu in 2006 , which is , compared to 2005 , an increase of 77 percent .
regional solutions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu justice commissioner franco frattini eu ministers earlier this year said that there was no need for resettlement of iraqis inside the eu and added that the iraqi refugee crisis must be tackled in the region .
meanwhile , the european commission has slammed member states for a lack of solidarity in hosting asylum seekers and dealing with refugee crisis and wants to use the meeting in luxembourg to drum up support for new plans aimed at harmonizing asylum rules across the eu .
currently , there are some 20 different systems of asylum in the 27-nation bloc .
the commission , the eu 's executive arm , wants to have more harmonized rules in place by 2010 .

boats , helicopters and planes needed to patrol the eu 's southern maritime borders existed only " on paper , " frontex said monday .
about 500,000 illegal immigrants enter the eu each year , mainly from poor african countries .
the bloc has responded by stepping up border controls , with so-called " frontline " states , spain , italy and malta , demanding even tougher measures against illegals .
eu officials have accused maltese authorities of failing to meet their international duties to save lives by refusing to admit migrants rescued by vessels outside its search and rescue area .
officials in malta deny they have ever left migrants at sea in distress .
ai appeal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : illegal immigration is driven mainly by economic forces human rights watchdog amnesty international issued an appeal to the german eu presidency to set up a rescue plan for immigrants in distress at sea .
" the eu must draw consequences and investigate the latest incidents , " said amnesty 's director for europe , dick oostings .
eu ministers are also expected to discuss commission proposals to introduce tough sanctions for employers of illegal migrants , including heavy fines and prison sentences for the worst offenders .
the commission argues that the prospect of finding an illicit job in the eu was the main driving force behind illegal immigration .

they warned that , without compromise , efforts to end the crisis over the draft of the constitution that was rejected by voters in france and the netherlands would fail at the summit on june 21 and 22 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso expects a " new dynamic " in talks " if we fail again , then it will have very negative consequences , " barroso said at a joint session of the european parliament with national representatives . strong rhetoric from warsaw " if we want to have success in this issue , then we must all move , " said foreign minister steinmeier .
" i have the impression that the willingness to move is absolutely there , " he added , and said he hoped it would be the case for all sides at the summit .
but steinmeier 's conviction that " a new dynamic has come into the talks " is in stark contrast to recent rhetoric from polish prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski , who has repeatedly threatened to veto the draft treaty because he disagrees with its provisions for how member states would vote on policy issues .
" poland will never accept , under any pretext , the system that has been put on the table to us , " kaczynski told polish public radio tuesday . poland fears losing clout warsaw is concerned that plans to reform the way member states vote on decisions affecting the whole bloc could cost it some of its clout .
it wants the voting system to be based on the square root of the number , in millions , of the population of each member state .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french rejected an eu constitution in 2005 but germany , which holds the eu 's rotating presidency until the end of next month , when it hands over to portugal , has poured cold water on the polish proposal .
german chancellor angela merkel has up to now refused to take a second look at the voting mechanism issue , for fear that reopening the debate would lead to an avalanche of demands on various issues from all member states .
the voting system , which poland had previously accepted , would mean that 55 percent of eu members with at least 65 percent of the eu 's population would be required to pass resolutions .
kaczynski now says the system is unfair to smaller nations , and has called for the eu to prolong the debate for another year . " the current situation makes a lot of people unhappy , " kaczynski told a press conference later on tuesday .
" we are the only ones with enough courage to say so , because we are a large country and also because we are the most affected " by the qualified majority system of voting proposed at present . " we will not allow ourselves to be radically downgraded , " he said . ' delay is not a solution ' barroso rejected kaczynski 's notion that there was still time to change the eu treaties , as a decision would not be made for at least a year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier : ' the willingness is there ' " delay is not a solution .
the problem will not go away .
help us to find a solution , " barroso told members of the european parliament .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a giant bluefin tuna fish at home in an aquarium eu fisheries ministers reached separate agreements that will restrict how much bluefin tuna and eel fisherman can pull from the waters surrounding europe . welcoming the deals , eu fisheries commissioner joe borg said that they " mark an important step on the way to ensuring the sustainability of european fisheries . " " i am glad that the severely depleted eel and bluefin tuna stocks will shortly receive the protection that they so badly need , " he added .
" indeed , this protection will not come one day too soon . " on tuna , the ministers backed plans to cut member states ' fishing quotas for this year by 10 percent as part of a 15-year package to save the species , which has become a victim of its success with consumers . environmentalists have warned that tuna face eventual extinction if fishing continued at current rates to feed a worldwide fad for japanese food such as sushi . under the measures , the amount of time fishing boats can be at sea will be limited to six months a year , while the minimum size of fish allowed to be taken was raised from 10 kilos -lrb- 22 pounds -rrb- to 30 to help them reproduce . the package , which will hit france , italy and spain particularly hard as they are the eu 's biggest tuna fishing nations , is part of a broader global effort to protect tuna which was agreed in january in japan . eel deal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a british classic : fish and chips the measures aim to boost stocks by ensuring that a minimum 40 percent of eel will not be fished when they leave rivers in western europe to lay their eggs in the sargasso sea between the caribbean and florida . eel stocks have been in a freefall since 1980 , plunging by 95-99 percent , according the convention on international trade in endangered species , or cites . young eel are exported from europe to asia , particularly japan and china , where they are considered a great delicacy .

for example , artist walter de maria 's so-called " kasseler loch , " or kassel whole , a 1,000-meter -lrb- 3,280 feet -rrb- metal pole pounded vertically into the ground and sculptor claes oldenburg 's 12-meter-high pick-ax seemingly stuck into the bank of the fulda river by a passing giant ca n't be missed . and no visitor will forget jonathan borowsky 's " man walking to the sky , " a sculpture of a man walking up a pole 25 meters into the air directly in front of the kassel train station . " old " kassel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kassel 's " man walking to the sky " the city 's art installations make up only part of its charm .
for many visitors , the mix of old and new really gives this quiet city its unique atmosphere . while strolling through one of the kassel 's many parks , visitors may feel like they are being watched .
on top of a castle in the hillside that is wilhelmshohe park stands a towering bronze statue of hercules . built in 1719 , the statue tops an octagonal castle overlooking kassel with a cascading landscaping which is unique to germany .
the panoramic view from the apex of the park makes the walk up to hercules ' perch worthwhile . tourists following the german fairytale route , a trail from hanau to bremen , will land in kassel due to the city 's two most famous sons . wilhelm and jacob grimm moved to the town in 1798 and over the years collected many of their famous tales within the city 's medieval walls , including rapunzel , cinderella and little red riding hood . located in bellevue palace , the brothers grimm museum highlights not just the storytelling prowess of the brothers -lrb- their last collection contained over 200 fairytales -rrb- but also their linguistic and political work . documenta xii since its inaugural event in 1955 , documenta has helped to transform kassel into a worldwide destination for contemporary art .
its three-month-long show is an artistic free-for-all and takes place in the middle of a medieval park . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kassel expects large crowds this year the people of kassel are invited to the party .
instead of the invitation-only cocktail parties of documentas past , the curators will host a celebration to thank the residents of kassel for their support through 12 documentas . the party will feature norwegian rock band kaizers orchestra and the dj formation cluster , and will culminate in an illumination of the park 's renowned water gardens . from the collection of old master paintings in the wilhelmshöhe palace art gallery to the clean modern design of the karl branner bridge , kassel is a city of contradiction . a contradiction that is sure to be deepened through the summer as the artists , curators and documenta visitors descend upon the city .
the brothers grimm would be proud . documenta 12 runs from june 16 to sept .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a giant bluefin tuna fish at home in an aquarium eu fisheries ministers reached separate agreements that will restrict how much bluefin tuna and eel fisherman can pull from the waters surrounding europe . welcoming the deals , eu fisheries commissioner joe borg said that they " mark an important step on the way to ensuring the sustainability of european fisheries . " " i am glad that the severely depleted eel and bluefin tuna stocks will shortly receive the protection that they so badly need , " he added .
" indeed , this protection will not come one day too soon . " on tuna , the ministers backed plans to cut member states ' fishing quotas for this year by 10 percent as part of a 15-year package to save the species , which has become a victim of its success with consumers . environmentalists have warned that tuna face eventual extinction if fishing continued at current rates to feed a worldwide fad for japanese food such as sushi . under the measures , the amount of time fishing boats can be at sea will be limited to six months a year , while the minimum size of fish allowed to be taken was raised from 10 kilos -lrb- 22 pounds -rrb- to 30 to help them reproduce . the package , which will hit france , italy and spain particularly hard as they are the eu 's biggest tuna fishing nations , is part of a broader global effort to protect tuna which was agreed in january in japan . eel deal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a british classic : fish and chips the measures aim to boost stocks by ensuring that a minimum 40 percent of eel will not be fished when they leave rivers in western europe to lay their eggs in the sargasso sea between the caribbean and florida . eel stocks have been in a freefall since 1980 , plunging by 95-99 percent , according the convention on international trade in endangered species , or cites . young eel are exported from europe to asia , particularly japan and china , where they are considered a great delicacy .

they warned that , without compromise , efforts to end the crisis over the draft of the constitution that was rejected by voters in france and the netherlands would fail at the summit on june 21 and 22 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso expects a " new dynamic " in talks " if we fail again , then it will have very negative consequences , " barroso said at a joint session of the european parliament with national representatives . strong rhetoric from warsaw " if we want to have success in this issue , then we must all move , " said foreign minister steinmeier .
" i have the impression that the willingness to move is absolutely there , " he added , and said he hoped it would be the case for all sides at the summit .
but steinmeier 's conviction that " a new dynamic has come into the talks " is in stark contrast to recent rhetoric from polish prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski , who has repeatedly threatened to veto the draft treaty because he disagrees with its provisions for how member states would vote on policy issues .
" poland will never accept , under any pretext , the system that has been put on the table to us , " kaczynski told polish public radio tuesday . poland fears losing clout warsaw is concerned that plans to reform the way member states vote on decisions affecting the whole bloc could cost it some of its clout .
it wants the voting system to be based on the square root of the number , in millions , of the population of each member state .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french rejected an eu constitution in 2005 but germany , which holds the eu 's rotating presidency until the end of next month , when it hands over to portugal , has poured cold water on the polish proposal .
german chancellor angela merkel has up to now refused to take a second look at the voting mechanism issue , for fear that reopening the debate would lead to an avalanche of demands on various issues from all member states .
the voting system , which poland had previously accepted , would mean that 55 percent of eu members with at least 65 percent of the eu 's population would be required to pass resolutions .
kaczynski now says the system is unfair to smaller nations , and has called for the eu to prolong the debate for another year . " the current situation makes a lot of people unhappy , " kaczynski told a press conference later on tuesday .
" we are the only ones with enough courage to say so , because we are a large country and also because we are the most affected " by the qualified majority system of voting proposed at present . " we will not allow ourselves to be radically downgraded , " he said . ' delay is not a solution ' barroso rejected kaczynski 's notion that there was still time to change the eu treaties , as a decision would not be made for at least a year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier : ' the willingness is there ' " delay is not a solution .
the problem will not go away .
help us to find a solution , " barroso told members of the european parliament .
the german eu presidency has been trying to steer a course through the different opinions of the eu members on how to draft a new treaty that would replace the draft constitution dealt a death blow in 2005 by the french and the dutch .
germany plans to submit a list of topics that would be discussed by an intergovernmental conference to eu members at the summit meeting .
but poland has threatened to bar the conference from getting down to business if the list of topics for debate does not meet with its approval . merkel on monday began a marathon of diplomatic meetings , during which she will meet , in the space of one week , with seven european heads of state or government , including polish president lech kaczynski , the prime minister 's twin brother . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de french proposal to end eu crisis makes headway french president nicolas sarkozy 's idea of a simplified treaty designed to end the european union 's constitional crisis appears to be gaining support .
-lrb- 24.05.2007 -rrb- italy 's pm throws support behind two-speed europe italy has warned that a core group of european union members could move ahead with closer integration if a satisfactory deal can not be reached on reforming the bloc 's institutions .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de travel -pipe- 12.06.2007 a mix of old and new , kassel prepares for documenta 12 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : documenta 12 attracts visitors for three months the documenta art show begins on saturday in kassel , a city caught between old and new very much to the delight of its many visitors . every five years the world-renowned exhibition of contemporary art brings an air of excitement into this normally reserved german city . for the common visitor , a short walk through kassel reveals that something different is going on in this city .
for example , artist walter de maria 's so-called " kasseler loch , " or kassel whole , a 1,000-meter -lrb- 3,280 feet -rrb- metal pole pounded vertically into the ground and sculptor claes oldenburg 's 12-meter-high pick-ax seemingly stuck into the bank of the fulda river by a passing giant ca n't be missed . and no visitor will forget jonathan borowsky 's " man walking to the sky , " a sculpture of a man walking up a pole 25 meters into the air directly in front of the kassel train station . " old " kassel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kassel 's " man walking to the sky " the city 's art installations make up only part of its charm .
for many visitors , the mix of old and new really gives this quiet city its unique atmosphere . while strolling through one of the kassel 's many parks , visitors may feel like they are being watched .
on top of a castle in the hillside that is wilhelmshohe park stands a towering bronze statue of hercules . built in 1719 , the statue tops an octagonal castle overlooking kassel with a cascading landscaping which is unique to germany .
the panoramic view from the apex of the park makes the walk up to hercules ' perch worthwhile . tourists following the german fairytale route , a trail from hanau to bremen , will land in kassel due to the city 's two most famous sons . wilhelm and jacob grimm moved to the town in 1798 and over the years collected many of their famous tales within the city 's medieval walls , including rapunzel , cinderella and little red riding hood . located in bellevue palace , the brothers grimm museum highlights not just the storytelling prowess of the brothers -lrb- their last collection contained over 200 fairytales -rrb- but also their linguistic and political work . documenta xii since its inaugural event in 1955 , documenta has helped to transform kassel into a worldwide destination for contemporary art .
its three-month-long show is an artistic free-for-all and takes place in the middle of a medieval park . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kassel expects large crowds this year the people of kassel are invited to the party .
instead of the invitation-only cocktail parties of documentas past , the curators will host a celebration to thank the residents of kassel for their support through 12 documentas . the party will feature norwegian rock band kaizers orchestra and the dj formation cluster , and will culminate in an illumination of the park 's renowned water gardens . from the collection of old master paintings in the wilhelmshöhe palace art gallery to the clean modern design of the karl branner bridge , kassel is a city of contradiction . a contradiction that is sure to be deepened through the summer as the artists , curators and documenta visitors descend upon the city .
the brothers grimm would be proud . documenta 12 runs from june 16 to sept .

on monday , the european union said it was renewing support by launching a four-million-euro -lrb- $ 5.3 million -rrb- project to help ensure that palestinian taxpayers ' money is spent efficiently and that expenditures are accounted for .
diplomats said the eu was also considering expanding an existing aid mechanism to pay palestinian police .
some israeli officials have criticized what they see as a shift in us policy aimed at bolstering palestinian president mahmoud abbas , whose fatah faction joined a unity government led by islamist hamas three months ago .
they also object to plans to finance the police , which fall under the hamas-run interior ministry .
" the palestinian authority 's financial position is much better today than six months ago .
we are losing , " said a senior israeli official involved in overseeing the embargo imposed after islamist hamas came to power in 2006 .
the embargo was leveled after hamas , which is blacklisted by the west as a terrorist organization , took office in march 2006 .
the party has continued to defy western demands to recognize israel , renounce violence and abide by previous interim peace deals .
support from eu palestinian information minister mustapha barghuti on monday welcomed the resumption of eu aid to the palestinian finance ministry and urged brussels to keep it flowing .

" we do n't see why there should not be direct cooperation now , " added the minister , who is also the spokesman for the power-sharing palestinian government .
barghuti , who is due to travel to brussels on tuesday , said palestinians did not want to become dependent on foreign hand-outs but required financial support from the european union for much-needed " institution-building . "

but the court of first instance upheld the american company 's right to use the names on merchandise .
" the court of first instance dismisses actions in proceedings taken by budejovicky against anheuser-busch concerning the use of community trademarks , " the court of first instance in luxembourg said in a statement .
weakened reputation budvar had said that under french law , an appellation of origin could not be used for any product or service which would weaken its reputation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beer might be nice at the bar , but it 's a business , too st. louis , missouri-based anheuser-busch , the largest us brewer , applied for the trademarks in 1996 at the office for harmonization in the internal market , which is responsible for eu-wide trademarks .
the us company and the czech budvar have taken legal action against each other in national courts across europe .
anheuser-busch won the registration for several words related to budweiser , which it has used for products as stationery , cleaning supplies and clothing .
budvar said that the court ruling would have no impact on its business . " today 's decisions are not substantial from the point of view of budejovicky budvar 's beer sales and do not threaten its current business activities in eu countries , " the company said .
privatization fears in may , a europe-wide grouping of beer lovers called on czechs to lobby their government not to privatize budejovicky budvar - the country 's third largest brewery .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : production line in the budvar brewery in the czech republic " czech citizens should petition their government to ensure that budvar remains a state asset and stays that way for the next century , " the president of the european beer consumers union -lrb- ebcu -rrb- , terry lock , said in prague .
the center-right czech government announced the first step towards privatizing budvar at the beginning of april when the agriculture minister announced that the brewery would be transformed into a shareholder company .
anheuser-busch is tipped to be a frontrunner to buy the last major czech brewery not yet snapped up by a global drinks company .
to the ebcu , brewing multinationals like anheuser-busch and belgium 's inbev represent a threat to traditionally-brewed quality beer .

" " i am glad that the severely depleted eel and bluefin tuna stocks will shortly receive the protection that they so badly need , " he added .
" indeed , this protection will not come one day too soon . " on tuna , the ministers backed plans to cut member states ' fishing quotas for this year by 10 percent as part of a 15-year package to save the species , which has become a victim of its success with consumers . environmentalists have warned that tuna face eventual extinction if fishing continued at current rates to feed a worldwide fad for japanese food such as sushi . under the measures , the amount of time fishing boats can be at sea will be limited to six months a year , while the minimum size of fish allowed to be taken was raised from 10 kilos -lrb- 22 pounds -rrb- to 30 to help them reproduce . the package , which will hit france , italy and spain particularly hard as they are the eu 's biggest tuna fishing nations , is part of a broader global effort to protect tuna which was agreed in january in japan . eel deal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a british classic : fish and chips the measures aim to boost stocks by ensuring that a minimum 40 percent of eel will not be fished when they leave rivers in western europe to lay their eggs in the sargasso sea between the caribbean and florida . eel stocks have been in a freefall since 1980 , plunging by 95-99 percent , according the convention on international trade in endangered species , or cites . young eel are exported from europe to asia , particularly japan and china , where they are considered a great delicacy .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german interior minister schäuble " serious crime , serious threats to the men and women of the european union can only be combated by effective cooperation and effective exchange of data and information , " schäuble told reporters . schäuble said austria had reported " sensational breakthroughs " since it began using the system , reporting more than a thousand data matches in one six-week period . to protect privacy , a " hit / no hit " system will be introduced under which police will only be immediately told whether a dna sample , for example , they are studying matches one held in the database of another eu country .
they will then have to request further information about the matching data . eu justice commissioner franco frattini described the move as " a very important first step " which demonstrates how a well thought-out agreement between a few countries can quickly be introduced eu-wide . can not take action police will not be able to take action in another eu country after entering in " hot pursuit " of suspects under a demand by britain and ireland linked to problems in northern ireland , diplomats have said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dna information just a click away police officers will have to ask permission to conduct cross-border searches . but they will be able to be deployed for major sporting and other events wearing their national uniforms and carrying weapons ; an arrangement used to good effect by germany when it hosted last year 's soccer world cup . british home office minister joan ryan also welcomed the agreement . " criminals do not respect borders , " she told the eu ministers .
" it is therefore vitally important that our law enforcement authorities have the tools available to obtain information held by other eu countries as quickly as possible to help with the investigation and prevention of crime . "
" dizzying " however , some members of the european parliament -lrb- meps -rrb- are critical of the measures , saying it was discussed at " dizzying speed . "
" the entire process is a complete scandal , " british liberal sarah ludford told the eu-observer .
uk conservative mep syed kamall said : " the prüm treaty has been a dangerous pet project of the german presidency . " " in forcing it through , the germans have ignored the views of the european parliament and the concerns of the eu data protection chief , " he said , adding that " we are sleepwalking into a big brother europe while our government stands idly by . "

for example , artist walter de maria 's so-called " kasseler loch , " or kassel whole , a 1,000-meter -lrb- 3,280 feet -rrb- metal pole pounded vertically into the ground and sculptor claes oldenburg 's 12-meter-high pick-ax seemingly stuck into the bank of the fulda river by a passing giant ca n't be missed . and no visitor will forget jonathan borowsky 's " man walking to the sky , " a sculpture of a man walking up a pole 25 meters into the air directly in front of the kassel train station .

" we should not waste too much time in making decisions , " the secretary general told reporters on monday .
he said it was " absolutely necessary that the security council should take a fair and sound judgment on this by endorsing " un mediator martti ahtisaari 's plan for kosovo 's " supervised independence . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : united nation secretary general ban ki-moon ban was briefing reporters on his recent foreign trip , including stops in panama , spain and germany where he attended the g8 summit last week .
during a visit to albania sunday , us president george w. bush called for speedy moves to give kosovo independence , saying the days of " endless dialogue " were over despite the outright hostility of serbia and its ally russia .
" we need to get moving , and the end result is independence , " he noted .
but serbian prime minister vojislav kostunica said monday that his country was " rightfully outraged over the us policy on kosovo " and insisted washington had no right to give away serbian territory .
no more delays bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president george bush received a hero 's welcome in albania on sunday us state department spokesman tom casey , however , urged the security council on monday to move quickly .
" there is a resolution that is tabled at the un , " casey said .
" i expect those discussions to move forward .
i expect there will be a vote on it . "
department spokesman sean mccormack played down the prospect of a russian veto .
" nobody wants it to get to that point , " mccormack said .
" nobody wants to see a veto . "
russian foreign minister sergei lavrov last month said a veto would be a last resort .
" i hope a veto will not be necessary , " lavrov said after a meeting of foreign ministers of the group of eight industrialized nations in potsdam , germany .
rising tensions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbian prime minister vojislav kostunica -lrb- right -rrb- some political analysts hope moscow would at least abstain from voting on kosovo in the council , although they said it was unlikely given the rising us-russia tensions over a planned us missile defense system in eastern europe .
" if there is a veto , the most likely outcome is a unilateral declaration of independence , " said stephen sestanovich of the council on foreign relations .
" i would expect that washington will recognize kosovo and that at least a majority of eu countries will as well , but i do n't know that you would get the eu as a collective body to do so , and that starts looking awkward , sestanovich said .
" that starts creating some problems . "
facing a basque separatist movement on its own soil , spain is concerned about the implications of europe recognizing kosovo 's independence outside the un framework .
the issue is up for discussion by the contact group for kosovo - the united states , britain , germany , italy and russia - when it meets on tuesday in paris .
no immediate plans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the security council is divided over the issue of kosovo meanwhile , un diplomats said the security council had no immediate plan to take up a revised draft resolution put forward by britain on may 31 that would reaffirm support for the un plan for kosovo .
the new draft , sponsored by the united states , belgium , britain , france , italy , slovakia and germany , calls for " full implementation " of the provisions contained in the ahtisaari plan .
though technically a serbian province , kosovo has been un-run since the end of the nato assault in mid-1999 .
some 10,000 ethnic albanians died and hundreds of thousands fled kosovo during the 1998-1999 conflict between serbian government troops and ethnic albanian separatists . dw staff / afp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bush : it 's time for kosovo 's independence us president george w. bush rejected sunday the idea of an " endless dialogue " on the future status of kosovo , saying the time was ripe to move towards independence for the albanian-majority serbian province .

" police from the 27 eu countries , attempting to identify a suspect using hair , sperm or fingernail samples , will be able to compare it with dna information gathered for criminal investigations in other eu states . aside from biometric data , police will also be able to share vehicle registration information when conducting such investigations . the agreement also allows police from different eu states to conduct joint , cross-border operations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : questions are being asked about how far is too far in the fight against crime and terrorism ?
" this is an important day , " german interior minister wolfgang schäuble , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency until the end of the month , told reporters .
" this provides us with an important source of information . " eu justice and security commissioner franco frattini told a news conference : " this will make the eu a safer area . " some countries already using system the scheme extends most of the treaty of prüm - a police cooperation deal signed in may 2005 by austria , belgium , france , germany , luxembourg , the netherlands and spain - to all 27 eu nations . the push for stronger eu wide security came from germany , which is a co-author of the prüm treaty . the seven " prüm " agreement countries were already sharing information from their national databases , with the other 20 countries to join the network soon , schäuble said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german interior minister schäuble " serious crime , serious threats to the men and women of the european union can only be combated by effective cooperation and effective exchange of data and information , " schäuble told reporters . schäuble said austria had reported " sensational breakthroughs " since it began using the system , reporting more than a thousand data matches in one six-week period . to protect privacy , a " hit / no hit " system will be introduced under which police will only be immediately told whether a dna sample , for example , they are studying matches one held in the database of another eu country .
they will then have to request further information about the matching data . eu justice commissioner franco frattini described the move as " a very important first step " which demonstrates how a well thought-out agreement between a few countries can quickly be introduced eu-wide . can not take action police will not be able to take action in another eu country after entering in " hot pursuit " of suspects under a demand by britain and ireland linked to problems in northern ireland , diplomats have said .

" criminals do not respect borders , " she told the eu ministers .
" it is therefore vitally important that our law enforcement authorities have the tools available to obtain information held by other eu countries as quickly as possible to help with the investigation and prevention of crime . "
" dizzying " however , some members of the european parliament -lrb- meps -rrb- are critical of the measures , saying it was discussed at " dizzying speed . "
" the entire process is a complete scandal , " british liberal sarah ludford told the eu-observer .
uk conservative mep syed kamall said : " the prüm treaty has been a dangerous pet project of the german presidency . " " in forcing it through , the germans have ignored the views of the european parliament and the concerns of the eu data protection chief , " he said , adding that " we are sleepwalking into a big brother europe while our government stands idly by .

" it is a big problem that so many years after reunification , such earnings discrepancies still exist , " reinhard bispinck of the hans böckler foundation told reporters after announcing the results .
" clearly we have n't managed to get the economies of both parts of the country on equal footing . "
gap cuts across sectors the wage gap cuts across trades : a cook in western germany takes home an average 1,311 euros per month -lrb- $ 1,750 -rrb- , compared with 985 euros in the east .
a web designer in the west takes home an average 41 percent more than their eastern counterparts : 2,300 euros compared to 1,360 euros .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the difference was biggest between web designers eastern german auto mechanics , data-entry workers , accountants , secretaries , bookkeepers , machinists and retail buyers all were paid about a third of what they would earn in the western states .
and there was a 20 percent discrepancy between geriatric nurses , civil engineers , teachers , metal workers , and cooks .
how to account for the chasm between eastern and western pay scales ?
the main problem lies in the east 's stagnant economy , bispinck said , noting eastern unemployment is nearly double that in the west .
fewer wage agreements moreover , the number of workers who are paid according to collective-bargaining agreements or union scales is much lower in the east , bispinck pointed out .
" in the ' new ' german states just 50 percent of workers are paid at union wages , compared with two-thirds in the west .
that gives eastern-german employers a much greater chance to pay less , " bispinck said .
" if the economic upswing continues for a while , then there is a chance for the east to catch up , " he added , although he admitted there had been no sign of this happening so far . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de west germans have hang-ups about going east as they pick up pictures taken over the easter holidays , few western germans are flipping through photos of the country 's east , and experts say not many vacations in the former east germany are being planned .

" the situation right now is a complete mess , " borg told reporters in luxembourg ahead of a meeting of eu interior ministers on tuesday .
" it 's a free for all . " " each year 600 immigrants are dying - this is a very conservative estimate i must say - on the threshold of europe .
the figure could rise again this year , " he said . several boats with illegal migrants have recently capsized in the waters between the mediterranean island and libya .
eighteen bodies were found in the zone last month by a french ship . borg said he would urge eu countries to help with " burden sharing " by accepting any would-be immigrants who are rescued in international waters . " it is only fair that those immigrants who are saved are distributed on a rotational basis between the 27 eu member states , " he said . " temporarily those immigrants should go to the nearest european state until they are transferred to the designated country of destination , " he said . the country of destination would be chosen based on size and population . a tough task bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sweden hosts the largest number of iraqi refugees in the eu eu diplomats have said that borg faces a tough task in convincing his eu partners to help .
many countries agree on the need to save people but few are keen to take responsibility for illegal migrants once they are safely ashore . some believe it would be better to work closely with the countries that people are fleeing or crossing to reach europe , concerned that " burden sharing " might appear to immigrants as a " free ticket " to move deeper into the eu . " i do n't think that this is a free flight to go to paris , " borg said .
" i think that the desperation of these people is very evident . " " they first cross the desert ... and if they survive that they try to cross the mediterranean and if they survive that then they are accepted or saved by the european authorities . he said that the number of people arriving was small in eu terms but that malta , with a population of around 400,000 , had to bear the heaviest load in dealing with a problem that has significantly grown in recent weeks . " from the beginning of this year our coast guard has saved 350 -lrb- people -rrb- , 250 of whom in the past 10-15 days , " he said . describing himself as a pragmatic politician , borg said he was not expecting miracles from tuesday 's talks . " a commitment , that would be ideal ... but at least that the discussion will start , " he said refuge crises bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european commission hopes to harmonize asylum rules across the union despite a commitment to an eu-wide common asylum system , member states not only take different approaches to asylum claims but also apply very different standards of treatment to asylum seekers . sweden , for instance , has demanded that other eu countries take in more vulnerable people fleeing iraq and has also called for a further harmonization of widely differing asylum procedures in the eu .
some 9,000 iraqis found a new home in sweden last year .
stockholm expects some 20,000 more this year .
sweden grants refugee status or other protection to almost all iraqi asylum seekers .
eu diplomats said the number of iraqis seeking refuge in the bloc was likely to reach 40,000 this year .
around 20,000 iraqis applied for asylum in the eu in 2006 , which is , compared to 2005 , an increase of 77 percent .
regional solutions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu justice commissioner franco frattini eu ministers earlier this year said that there was no need for resettlement of iraqis inside the eu and added that the iraqi refugee crisis must be tackled in the region .
meanwhile , the european commission has slammed member states for a lack of solidarity in hosting asylum seekers and dealing with refugee crisis and wants to use the meeting in luxembourg to drum up support for new plans aimed at harmonizing asylum rules across the eu .
currently , there are some 20 different systems of asylum in the 27-nation bloc .
the commission , the eu 's executive arm , wants to have more harmonized rules in place by 2010 .
unfulfilled pledges bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : about 500,000 illegal immigrants enter the eu each year eu justice commissioner franco frattini is expected to use the luxembourg meeting to rebuke governments for not fulfilling pledges to send technical equipment for the bloc 's border control agency frontex .
boats , helicopters and planes needed to patrol the eu 's southern maritime borders existed only " on paper , " frontex said monday .
about 500,000 illegal immigrants enter the eu each year , mainly from poor african countries .
the bloc has responded by stepping up border controls , with so-called " frontline " states , spain , italy and malta , demanding even tougher measures against illegals .
eu officials have accused maltese authorities of failing to meet their international duties to save lives by refusing to admit migrants rescued by vessels outside its search and rescue area .
officials in malta deny they have ever left migrants at sea in distress .
ai appeal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : illegal immigration is driven mainly by economic forces human rights watchdog amnesty international issued an appeal to the german eu presidency to set up a rescue plan for immigrants in distress at sea .
" the eu must draw consequences and investigate the latest incidents , " said amnesty 's director for europe , dick oostings .
eu ministers are also expected to discuss commission proposals to introduce tough sanctions for employers of illegal migrants , including heavy fines and prison sentences for the worst offenders .
the commission argues that the prospect of finding an illicit job in the eu was the main driving force behind illegal immigration .
but the plan could run into fierce opposition from some member states as the eu does not have the competence to interfere with matters of criminal law . dw staff / afp , dpa -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the situation right now is a complete mess , " borg told reporters in luxembourg ahead of a meeting of eu interior ministers on tuesday .
" it 's a free for all . " " each year 600 immigrants are dying - this is a very conservative estimate i must say - on the threshold of europe .
the figure could rise again this year , " he said . several boats with illegal migrants have recently capsized in the waters between the mediterranean island and libya .
eighteen bodies were found in the zone last month by a french ship . borg said he would urge eu countries to help with " burden sharing " by accepting any would-be immigrants who are rescued in international waters . " it is only fair that those immigrants who are saved are distributed on a rotational basis between the 27 eu member states , " he said . " temporarily those immigrants should go to the nearest european state until they are transferred to the designated country of destination , " he said . the country of destination would be chosen based on size and population . a tough task bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sweden hosts the largest number of iraqi refugees in the eu eu diplomats have said that borg faces a tough task in convincing his eu partners to help .
many countries agree on the need to save people but few are keen to take responsibility for illegal migrants once they are safely ashore . some believe it would be better to work closely with the countries that people are fleeing or crossing to reach europe , concerned that " burden sharing " might appear to immigrants as a " free ticket " to move deeper into the eu . " i do n't think that this is a free flight to go to paris , " borg said .
" i think that the desperation of these people is very evident . " " they first cross the desert ... and if they survive that they try to cross the mediterranean and if they survive that then they are accepted or saved by the european authorities . he said that the number of people arriving was small in eu terms but that malta , with a population of around 400,000 , had to bear the heaviest load in dealing with a problem that has significantly grown in recent weeks . " from the beginning of this year our coast guard has saved 350 -lrb- people -rrb- , 250 of whom in the past 10-15 days , " he said . describing himself as a pragmatic politician , borg said he was not expecting miracles from tuesday 's talks . " a commitment , that would be ideal ... but at least that the discussion will start , " he said refuge crises bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european commission hopes to harmonize asylum rules across the union despite a commitment to an eu-wide common asylum system , member states not only take different approaches to asylum claims but also apply very different standards of treatment to asylum seekers . sweden , for instance , has demanded that other eu countries take in more vulnerable people fleeing iraq and has also called for a further harmonization of widely differing asylum procedures in the eu .
some 9,000 iraqis found a new home in sweden last year .
stockholm expects some 20,000 more this year .
sweden grants refugee status or other protection to almost all iraqi asylum seekers .
eu diplomats said the number of iraqis seeking refuge in the bloc was likely to reach 40,000 this year .
around 20,000 iraqis applied for asylum in the eu in 2006 , which is , compared to 2005 , an increase of 77 percent .
regional solutions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu justice commissioner franco frattini eu ministers earlier this year said that there was no need for resettlement of iraqis inside the eu and added that the iraqi refugee crisis must be tackled in the region .
meanwhile , the european commission has slammed member states for a lack of solidarity in hosting asylum seekers and dealing with refugee crisis and wants to use the meeting in luxembourg to drum up support for new plans aimed at harmonizing asylum rules across the eu .
currently , there are some 20 different systems of asylum in the 27-nation bloc .
the commission , the eu 's executive arm , wants to have more harmonized rules in place by 2010 .
unfulfilled pledges bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : about 500,000 illegal immigrants enter the eu each year eu justice commissioner franco frattini is expected to use the luxembourg meeting to rebuke governments for not fulfilling pledges to send technical equipment for the bloc 's border control agency frontex .
boats , helicopters and planes needed to patrol the eu 's southern maritime borders existed only " on paper , " frontex said monday .
about 500,000 illegal immigrants enter the eu each year , mainly from poor african countries .
the bloc has responded by stepping up border controls , with so-called " frontline " states , spain , italy and malta , demanding even tougher measures against illegals .
eu officials have accused maltese authorities of failing to meet their international duties to save lives by refusing to admit migrants rescued by vessels outside its search and rescue area .
officials in malta deny they have ever left migrants at sea in distress .
ai appeal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : illegal immigration is driven mainly by economic forces human rights watchdog amnesty international issued an appeal to the german eu presidency to set up a rescue plan for immigrants in distress at sea .
" the eu must draw consequences and investigate the latest incidents , " said amnesty 's director for europe , dick oostings .
eu ministers are also expected to discuss commission proposals to introduce tough sanctions for employers of illegal migrants , including heavy fines and prison sentences for the worst offenders .
the commission argues that the prospect of finding an illicit job in the eu was the main driving force behind illegal immigration .

on monday , the european union said it was renewing support by launching a four-million-euro -lrb- $ 5.3 million -rrb- project to help ensure that palestinian taxpayers ' money is spent efficiently and that expenditures are accounted for .
diplomats said the eu was also considering expanding an existing aid mechanism to pay palestinian police .
some israeli officials have criticized what they see as a shift in us policy aimed at bolstering palestinian president mahmoud abbas , whose fatah faction joined a unity government led by islamist hamas three months ago .
they also object to plans to finance the police , which fall under the hamas-run interior ministry .
" the palestinian authority 's financial position is much better today than six months ago .
we are losing , " said a senior israeli official involved in overseeing the embargo imposed after islamist hamas came to power in 2006 .
the embargo was leveled after hamas , which is blacklisted by the west as a terrorist organization , took office in march 2006 .
the party has continued to defy western demands to recognize israel , renounce violence and abide by previous interim peace deals .
support from eu palestinian information minister mustapha barghuti on monday welcomed the resumption of eu aid to the palestinian finance ministry and urged brussels to keep it flowing .
" this is a positive step that should be followed " by others , he said in berlin , where he was a guest of the friedrich ebert foundation .
" we do n't see why there should not be direct cooperation now , " added the minister , who is also the spokesman for the power-sharing palestinian government .
barghuti , who is due to travel to brussels on tuesday , said palestinians did not want to become dependent on foreign hand-outs but required financial support from the european union for much-needed " institution-building . "
" we do n't want to create a dependency .
if you want palestinians to survive , this palestinian government should be empowered , " he said .
despite the freeze on direct aid , the european union 's financial assistance in 2006 - extended indirectly through a mechanism that avoided the hamas-led government - reached around 700 million euros . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de eu continues palestinian aid embargo , criticizes israeli policy the european union 's aid commissioner said although conditions were worsening in the palestinian territories , eu aid would continue to sidestep the hamas-led government until it denounces violence and recognizes israel .
-lrb- 27.04.2007 -rrb- eu says no to aiding palestinian unity government new palestinian finance minister salam fayyad has failed to convince the european union to agree to resume aid to the palestinian authority despite what he called a " very acute financial crisis " .
-lrb- 11.04.2007 -rrb- germany slowly builds bridges to palestinian government after senior un and eu officials met with members of the palestinian government this week , germany is making its own efforts to improve relations .
angela merkel will travel to the region at the end of the month .
-lrb- 21.03.2007 -rrb- eu countries reach out to non-hamas palestinian ministers european union countries were prepared to reach out to non-hamas members of the new palestinian unity government on tuesday , but it will be some time before the eu restores direct aid , officials said .

for example , artist walter de maria 's so-called " kasseler loch , " or kassel whole , a 1,000-meter -lrb- 3,280 feet -rrb- metal pole pounded vertically into the ground and sculptor claes oldenburg 's 12-meter-high pick-ax seemingly stuck into the bank of the fulda river by a passing giant ca n't be missed . and no visitor will forget jonathan borowsky 's " man walking to the sky , " a sculpture of a man walking up a pole 25 meters into the air directly in front of the kassel train station . " old " kassel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kassel 's " man walking to the sky " the city 's art installations make up only part of its charm .
for many visitors , the mix of old and new really gives this quiet city its unique atmosphere . while strolling through one of the kassel 's many parks , visitors may feel like they are being watched .
on top of a castle in the hillside that is wilhelmshohe park stands a towering bronze statue of hercules . built in 1719 , the statue tops an octagonal castle overlooking kassel with a cascading landscaping which is unique to germany .
the panoramic view from the apex of the park makes the walk up to hercules ' perch worthwhile . tourists following the german fairytale route , a trail from hanau to bremen , will land in kassel due to the city 's two most famous sons . wilhelm and jacob grimm moved to the town in 1798 and over the years collected many of their famous tales within the city 's medieval walls , including rapunzel , cinderella and little red riding hood . located in bellevue palace , the brothers grimm museum highlights not just the storytelling prowess of the brothers -lrb- their last collection contained over 200 fairytales -rrb- but also their linguistic and political work . documenta xii since its inaugural event in 1955 , documenta has helped to transform kassel into a worldwide destination for contemporary art .
its three-month-long show is an artistic free-for-all and takes place in the middle of a medieval park . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kassel expects large crowds this year the people of kassel are invited to the party .
instead of the invitation-only cocktail parties of documentas past , the curators will host a celebration to thank the residents of kassel for their support through 12 documentas . the party will feature norwegian rock band kaizers orchestra and the dj formation cluster , and will culminate in an illumination of the park 's renowned water gardens . from the collection of old master paintings in the wilhelmshöhe palace art gallery to the clean modern design of the karl branner bridge , kassel is a city of contradiction . a contradiction that is sure to be deepened through the summer as the artists , curators and documenta visitors descend upon the city .

for example , artist walter de maria 's so-called " kasseler loch , " or kassel whole , a 1,000-meter -lrb- 3,280 feet -rrb- metal pole pounded vertically into the ground and sculptor claes oldenburg 's 12-meter-high pick-ax seemingly stuck into the bank of the fulda river by a passing giant ca n't be missed . and no visitor will forget jonathan borowsky 's " man walking to the sky , " a sculpture of a man walking up a pole 25 meters into the air directly in front of the kassel train station . " old " kassel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kassel 's " man walking to the sky " the city 's art installations make up only part of its charm .
for many visitors , the mix of old and new really gives this quiet city its unique atmosphere . while strolling through one of the kassel 's many parks , visitors may feel like they are being watched .
on top of a castle in the hillside that is wilhelmshohe park stands a towering bronze statue of hercules . built in 1719 , the statue tops an octagonal castle overlooking kassel with a cascading landscaping which is unique to germany .
the panoramic view from the apex of the park makes the walk up to hercules ' perch worthwhile . tourists following the german fairytale route , a trail from hanau to bremen , will land in kassel due to the city 's two most famous sons . wilhelm and jacob grimm moved to the town in 1798 and over the years collected many of their famous tales within the city 's medieval walls , including rapunzel , cinderella and little red riding hood . located in bellevue palace , the brothers grimm museum highlights not just the storytelling prowess of the brothers -lrb- their last collection contained over 200 fairytales -rrb- but also their linguistic and political work . documenta xii since its inaugural event in 1955 , documenta has helped to transform kassel into a worldwide destination for contemporary art .
its three-month-long show is an artistic free-for-all and takes place in the middle of a medieval park . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kassel expects large crowds this year the people of kassel are invited to the party .
instead of the invitation-only cocktail parties of documentas past , the curators will host a celebration to thank the residents of kassel for their support through 12 documentas . the party will feature norwegian rock band kaizers orchestra and the dj formation cluster , and will culminate in an illumination of the park 's renowned water gardens . from the collection of old master paintings in the wilhelmshöhe palace art gallery to the clean modern design of the karl branner bridge , kassel is a city of contradiction . a contradiction that is sure to be deepened through the summer as the artists , curators and documenta visitors descend upon the city .
the brothers grimm would be proud . documenta 12 runs from june 16 to sept .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a giant bluefin tuna fish at home in an aquarium eu fisheries ministers reached separate agreements that will restrict how much bluefin tuna and eel fisherman can pull from the waters surrounding europe . welcoming the deals , eu fisheries commissioner joe borg said that they " mark an important step on the way to ensuring the sustainability of european fisheries . " " i am glad that the severely depleted eel and bluefin tuna stocks will shortly receive the protection that they so badly need , " he added .

they warned that , without compromise , efforts to end the crisis over the draft of the constitution that was rejected by voters in france and the netherlands would fail at the summit on june 21 and 22 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso expects a " new dynamic " in talks " if we fail again , then it will have very negative consequences , " barroso said at a joint session of the european parliament with national representatives . strong rhetoric from warsaw " if we want to have success in this issue , then we must all move , " said foreign minister steinmeier .
" i have the impression that the willingness to move is absolutely there , " he added , and said he hoped it would be the case for all sides at the summit .
but steinmeier 's conviction that " a new dynamic has come into the talks " is in stark contrast to recent rhetoric from polish prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski , who has repeatedly threatened to veto the draft treaty because he disagrees with its provisions for how member states would vote on policy issues .
" poland will never accept , under any pretext , the system that has been put on the table to us , " kaczynski told polish public radio tuesday . poland fears losing clout warsaw is concerned that plans to reform the way member states vote on decisions affecting the whole bloc could cost it some of its clout .
it wants the voting system to be based on the square root of the number , in millions , of the population of each member state .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french rejected an eu constitution in 2005 but germany , which holds the eu 's rotating presidency until the end of next month , when it hands over to portugal , has poured cold water on the polish proposal .
german chancellor angela merkel has up to now refused to take a second look at the voting mechanism issue , for fear that reopening the debate would lead to an avalanche of demands on various issues from all member states .
the voting system , which poland had previously accepted , would mean that 55 percent of eu members with at least 65 percent of the eu 's population would be required to pass resolutions .
kaczynski now says the system is unfair to smaller nations , and has called for the eu to prolong the debate for another year . " the current situation makes a lot of people unhappy , " kaczynski told a press conference later on tuesday .
" we are the only ones with enough courage to say so , because we are a large country and also because we are the most affected " by the qualified majority system of voting proposed at present . " we will not allow ourselves to be radically downgraded , " he said . ' delay is not a solution ' barroso rejected kaczynski 's notion that there was still time to change the eu treaties , as a decision would not be made for at least a year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier : ' the willingness is there ' " delay is not a solution .
the problem will not go away .

the german eu presidency has been trying to steer a course through the different opinions of the eu members on how to draft a new treaty that would replace the draft constitution dealt a death blow in 2005 by the french and the dutch .
germany plans to submit a list of topics that would be discussed by an intergovernmental conference to eu members at the summit meeting .
but poland has threatened to bar the conference from getting down to business if the list of topics for debate does not meet with its approval . merkel on monday began a marathon of diplomatic meetings , during which she will meet , in the space of one week , with seven european heads of state or government , including polish president lech kaczynski , the prime minister 's twin brother . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de french proposal to end eu crisis makes headway french president nicolas sarkozy 's idea of a simplified treaty designed to end the european union 's constitional crisis appears to be gaining support .

they warned that , without compromise , efforts to end the crisis over the draft of the constitution that was rejected by voters in france and the netherlands would fail at the summit on june 21 and 22 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso expects a " new dynamic " in talks " if we fail again , then it will have very negative consequences , " barroso said at a joint session of the european parliament with national representatives . strong rhetoric from warsaw " if we want to have success in this issue , then we must all move , " said foreign minister steinmeier .
" i have the impression that the willingness to move is absolutely there , " he added , and said he hoped it would be the case for all sides at the summit .
but steinmeier 's conviction that " a new dynamic has come into the talks " is in stark contrast to recent rhetoric from polish prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski , who has repeatedly threatened to veto the draft treaty because he disagrees with its provisions for how member states would vote on policy issues .
" poland will never accept , under any pretext , the system that has been put on the table to us , " kaczynski told polish public radio tuesday . poland fears losing clout warsaw is concerned that plans to reform the way member states vote on decisions affecting the whole bloc could cost it some of its clout .
it wants the voting system to be based on the square root of the number , in millions , of the population of each member state .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french rejected an eu constitution in 2005 but germany , which holds the eu 's rotating presidency until the end of next month , when it hands over to portugal , has poured cold water on the polish proposal .
german chancellor angela merkel has up to now refused to take a second look at the voting mechanism issue , for fear that reopening the debate would lead to an avalanche of demands on various issues from all member states .
the voting system , which poland had previously accepted , would mean that 55 percent of eu members with at least 65 percent of the eu 's population would be required to pass resolutions .
kaczynski now says the system is unfair to smaller nations , and has called for the eu to prolong the debate for another year . " the current situation makes a lot of people unhappy , " kaczynski told a press conference later on tuesday .
" we are the only ones with enough courage to say so , because we are a large country and also because we are the most affected " by the qualified majority system of voting proposed at present . " we will not allow ourselves to be radically downgraded , " he said . ' delay is not a solution ' barroso rejected kaczynski 's notion that there was still time to change the eu treaties , as a decision would not be made for at least a year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier : ' the willingness is there ' " delay is not a solution .
the problem will not go away .
help us to find a solution , " barroso told members of the european parliament .
the german eu presidency has been trying to steer a course through the different opinions of the eu members on how to draft a new treaty that would replace the draft constitution dealt a death blow in 2005 by the french and the dutch .
germany plans to submit a list of topics that would be discussed by an intergovernmental conference to eu members at the summit meeting .
but poland has threatened to bar the conference from getting down to business if the list of topics for debate does not meet with its approval . merkel on monday began a marathon of diplomatic meetings , during which she will meet , in the space of one week , with seven european heads of state or government , including polish president lech kaczynski , the prime minister 's twin brother . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de french proposal to end eu crisis makes headway french president nicolas sarkozy 's idea of a simplified treaty designed to end the european union 's constitional crisis appears to be gaining support .

readers shared their favorite types of german beer .
what 's yours ? the following comments reflect the views of dw-world.de readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . depending on the time of year , i prefer the following beers : ayinger or paulaner maerzen in spring , ayinger bräu-weisse or hofbräu münchner kindl in summer , hofbräu oktoberfest in fall , and aventius wheat doppelbock or weizen eisbock in winter . - scott anderson , us i 'm glad i had as much paulaner as i could before i decided to change my lifestyle .
it 's heavy on the stomach but i loved the taste ! - steph , philippines i must say that my favorite type of beer is definitely german pilsner . - todd liebman , us augustiner !
it 's the closest i 'll ever get to heaven .
in second place , every other german beer i 've had the pleasure to drink .
prost ! - john langford , us my favorite beer is thurn und taxis from regensburg . - dumitru florea , romania i lived in germany - bitburg to be exact - and moved to florida in 1990 .
i have been to cologne a few times and i must say that their bier is very good , even compared to bitburger pils .
but the früh kölsch i had last time i was there was fantastic - the best beer i 've had in a while . - charles litavic , us well , of course beck 's is the best .

" we should not waste too much time in making decisions , " the secretary general told reporters on monday .
he said it was " absolutely necessary that the security council should take a fair and sound judgment on this by endorsing " un mediator martti ahtisaari 's plan for kosovo 's " supervised independence . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : united nation secretary general ban ki-moon ban was briefing reporters on his recent foreign trip , including stops in panama , spain and germany where he attended the g8 summit last week .
during a visit to albania sunday , us president george w. bush called for speedy moves to give kosovo independence , saying the days of " endless dialogue " were over despite the outright hostility of serbia and its ally russia .
" we need to get moving , and the end result is independence , " he noted .
but serbian prime minister vojislav kostunica said monday that his country was " rightfully outraged over the us policy on kosovo " and insisted washington had no right to give away serbian territory .
no more delays bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president george bush received a hero 's welcome in albania on sunday us state department spokesman tom casey , however , urged the security council on monday to move quickly .
" there is a resolution that is tabled at the un , " casey said .
" i expect those discussions to move forward .
i expect there will be a vote on it . "
department spokesman sean mccormack played down the prospect of a russian veto .
" nobody wants it to get to that point , " mccormack said .
" nobody wants to see a veto . "
russian foreign minister sergei lavrov last month said a veto would be a last resort .
" i hope a veto will not be necessary , " lavrov said after a meeting of foreign ministers of the group of eight industrialized nations in potsdam , germany .
rising tensions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbian prime minister vojislav kostunica -lrb- right -rrb- some political analysts hope moscow would at least abstain from voting on kosovo in the council , although they said it was unlikely given the rising us-russia tensions over a planned us missile defense system in eastern europe .
" if there is a veto , the most likely outcome is a unilateral declaration of independence , " said stephen sestanovich of the council on foreign relations .
" i would expect that washington will recognize kosovo and that at least a majority of eu countries will as well , but i do n't know that you would get the eu as a collective body to do so , and that starts looking awkward , sestanovich said .
" that starts creating some problems . "
facing a basque separatist movement on its own soil , spain is concerned about the implications of europe recognizing kosovo 's independence outside the un framework .
the issue is up for discussion by the contact group for kosovo - the united states , britain , germany , italy and russia - when it meets on tuesday in paris .
no immediate plans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the security council is divided over the issue of kosovo meanwhile , un diplomats said the security council had no immediate plan to take up a revised draft resolution put forward by britain on may 31 that would reaffirm support for the un plan for kosovo .
the new draft , sponsored by the united states , belgium , britain , france , italy , slovakia and germany , calls for " full implementation " of the provisions contained in the ahtisaari plan .
though technically a serbian province , kosovo has been un-run since the end of the nato assault in mid-1999 .

they warned that , without compromise , efforts to end the crisis over the draft of the constitution that was rejected by voters in france and the netherlands would fail at the summit on june 21 and 22 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso expects a " new dynamic " in talks " if we fail again , then it will have very negative consequences , " barroso said at a joint session of the european parliament with national representatives . strong rhetoric from warsaw " if we want to have success in this issue , then we must all move , " said foreign minister steinmeier .
" i have the impression that the willingness to move is absolutely there , " he added , and said he hoped it would be the case for all sides at the summit .
but steinmeier 's conviction that " a new dynamic has come into the talks " is in stark contrast to recent rhetoric from polish prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski , who has repeatedly threatened to veto the draft treaty because he disagrees with its provisions for how member states would vote on policy issues .
" poland will never accept , under any pretext , the system that has been put on the table to us , " kaczynski told polish public radio tuesday . poland fears losing clout warsaw is concerned that plans to reform the way member states vote on decisions affecting the whole bloc could cost it some of its clout .
it wants the voting system to be based on the square root of the number , in millions , of the population of each member state .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french rejected an eu constitution in 2005 but germany , which holds the eu 's rotating presidency until the end of next month , when it hands over to portugal , has poured cold water on the polish proposal .
german chancellor angela merkel has up to now refused to take a second look at the voting mechanism issue , for fear that reopening the debate would lead to an avalanche of demands on various issues from all member states .
the voting system , which poland had previously accepted , would mean that 55 percent of eu members with at least 65 percent of the eu 's population would be required to pass resolutions .
kaczynski now says the system is unfair to smaller nations , and has called for the eu to prolong the debate for another year . " the current situation makes a lot of people unhappy , " kaczynski told a press conference later on tuesday .
" we are the only ones with enough courage to say so , because we are a large country and also because we are the most affected " by the qualified majority system of voting proposed at present . " we will not allow ourselves to be radically downgraded , " he said . ' delay is not a solution ' barroso rejected kaczynski 's notion that there was still time to change the eu treaties , as a decision would not be made for at least a year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier : ' the willingness is there ' " delay is not a solution .
the problem will not go away .
help us to find a solution , " barroso told members of the european parliament .
the german eu presidency has been trying to steer a course through the different opinions of the eu members on how to draft a new treaty that would replace the draft constitution dealt a death blow in 2005 by the french and the dutch .
germany plans to submit a list of topics that would be discussed by an intergovernmental conference to eu members at the summit meeting .
but poland has threatened to bar the conference from getting down to business if the list of topics for debate does not meet with its approval . merkel on monday began a marathon of diplomatic meetings , during which she will meet , in the space of one week , with seven european heads of state or government , including polish president lech kaczynski , the prime minister 's twin brother . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de french proposal to end eu crisis makes headway french president nicolas sarkozy 's idea of a simplified treaty designed to end the european union 's constitional crisis appears to be gaining support .

but the court of first instance upheld the american company 's right to use the names on merchandise .
" the court of first instance dismisses actions in proceedings taken by budejovicky against anheuser-busch concerning the use of community trademarks , " the court of first instance in luxembourg said in a statement .
weakened reputation budvar had said that under french law , an appellation of origin could not be used for any product or service which would weaken its reputation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beer might be nice at the bar , but it 's a business , too st. louis , missouri-based anheuser-busch , the largest us brewer , applied for the trademarks in 1996 at the office for harmonization in the internal market , which is responsible for eu-wide trademarks .
the us company and the czech budvar have taken legal action against each other in national courts across europe .
anheuser-busch won the registration for several words related to budweiser , which it has used for products as stationery , cleaning supplies and clothing .
budvar said that the court ruling would have no impact on its business . " today 's decisions are not substantial from the point of view of budejovicky budvar 's beer sales and do not threaten its current business activities in eu countries , " the company said .
privatization fears in may , a europe-wide grouping of beer lovers called on czechs to lobby their government not to privatize budejovicky budvar - the country 's third largest brewery .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : production line in the budvar brewery in the czech republic " czech citizens should petition their government to ensure that budvar remains a state asset and stays that way for the next century , " the president of the european beer consumers union -lrb- ebcu -rrb- , terry lock , said in prague .
the center-right czech government announced the first step towards privatizing budvar at the beginning of april when the agriculture minister announced that the brewery would be transformed into a shareholder company .
anheuser-busch is tipped to be a frontrunner to buy the last major czech brewery not yet snapped up by a global drinks company .
to the ebcu , brewing multinationals like anheuser-busch and belgium 's inbev represent a threat to traditionally-brewed quality beer .

" we should not waste too much time in making decisions , " the secretary general told reporters on monday .
he said it was " absolutely necessary that the security council should take a fair and sound judgment on this by endorsing " un mediator martti ahtisaari 's plan for kosovo 's " supervised independence . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : united nation secretary general ban ki-moon ban was briefing reporters on his recent foreign trip , including stops in panama , spain and germany where he attended the g8 summit last week .
during a visit to albania sunday , us president george w. bush called for speedy moves to give kosovo independence , saying the days of " endless dialogue " were over despite the outright hostility of serbia and its ally russia .
" we need to get moving , and the end result is independence , " he noted .
but serbian prime minister vojislav kostunica said monday that his country was " rightfully outraged over the us policy on kosovo " and insisted washington had no right to give away serbian territory .
no more delays bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president george bush received a hero 's welcome in albania on sunday us state department spokesman tom casey , however , urged the security council on monday to move quickly .
" there is a resolution that is tabled at the un , " casey said .
" i expect those discussions to move forward .
i expect there will be a vote on it . "
department spokesman sean mccormack played down the prospect of a russian veto .
" nobody wants it to get to that point , " mccormack said .
" nobody wants to see a veto . "
russian foreign minister sergei lavrov last month said a veto would be a last resort .
" i hope a veto will not be necessary , " lavrov said after a meeting of foreign ministers of the group of eight industrialized nations in potsdam , germany .
rising tensions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbian prime minister vojislav kostunica -lrb- right -rrb- some political analysts hope moscow would at least abstain from voting on kosovo in the council , although they said it was unlikely given the rising us-russia tensions over a planned us missile defense system in eastern europe .
" if there is a veto , the most likely outcome is a unilateral declaration of independence , " said stephen sestanovich of the council on foreign relations .
" i would expect that washington will recognize kosovo and that at least a majority of eu countries will as well , but i do n't know that you would get the eu as a collective body to do so , and that starts looking awkward , sestanovich said .
" that starts creating some problems . "
facing a basque separatist movement on its own soil , spain is concerned about the implications of europe recognizing kosovo 's independence outside the un framework .
the issue is up for discussion by the contact group for kosovo - the united states , britain , germany , italy and russia - when it meets on tuesday in paris .
no immediate plans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the security council is divided over the issue of kosovo meanwhile , un diplomats said the security council had no immediate plan to take up a revised draft resolution put forward by britain on may 31 that would reaffirm support for the un plan for kosovo .
the new draft , sponsored by the united states , belgium , britain , france , italy , slovakia and germany , calls for " full implementation " of the provisions contained in the ahtisaari plan .
though technically a serbian province , kosovo has been un-run since the end of the nato assault in mid-1999 .
some 10,000 ethnic albanians died and hundreds of thousands fled kosovo during the 1998-1999 conflict between serbian government troops and ethnic albanian separatists . dw staff / afp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bush : it 's time for kosovo 's independence us president george w. bush rejected sunday the idea of an " endless dialogue " on the future status of kosovo , saying the time was ripe to move towards independence for the albanian-majority serbian province .
-lrb- 10.06.2007 -rrb- kosovo question contributes to eu-russia troubles a us anti-missile defense system , pipeline politics , polish meat , press freedom and iran policy have all been issues in the disputes between the west and russia ahead of the g8 summit .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : once physical , the divide between east and west has become economic the average east-west wage difference is 21 percent , although in certain sectors , westerners earned as much as 41 percent more than their eastern-german counterparts , the online study showed .
" it is a big problem that so many years after reunification , such earnings discrepancies still exist , " reinhard bispinck of the hans böckler foundation told reporters after announcing the results .
" clearly we have n't managed to get the economies of both parts of the country on equal footing . "
gap cuts across sectors the wage gap cuts across trades : a cook in western germany takes home an average 1,311 euros per month -lrb- $ 1,750 -rrb- , compared with 985 euros in the east .
a web designer in the west takes home an average 41 percent more than their eastern counterparts : 2,300 euros compared to 1,360 euros .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the difference was biggest between web designers eastern german auto mechanics , data-entry workers , accountants , secretaries , bookkeepers , machinists and retail buyers all were paid about a third of what they would earn in the western states .
and there was a 20 percent discrepancy between geriatric nurses , civil engineers , teachers , metal workers , and cooks .
how to account for the chasm between eastern and western pay scales ?
the main problem lies in the east 's stagnant economy , bispinck said , noting eastern unemployment is nearly double that in the west .
fewer wage agreements moreover , the number of workers who are paid according to collective-bargaining agreements or union scales is much lower in the east , bispinck pointed out .
" in the ' new ' german states just 50 percent of workers are paid at union wages , compared with two-thirds in the west .
that gives eastern-german employers a much greater chance to pay less , " bispinck said .
" if the economic upswing continues for a while , then there is a chance for the east to catch up , " he added , although he admitted there had been no sign of this happening so far . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de west germans have hang-ups about going east as they pick up pictures taken over the easter holidays , few western germans are flipping through photos of the country 's east , and experts say not many vacations in the former east germany are being planned .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de development aid -pipe- 12.06.2007 eu resumes direct aid to palestinian authority großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hamas-led government has been blacklisted by the west with the backing of the us administration , a 15-month-old economic embargo of the hamas-led palestinian authority is being eased with direct financial aid from european donors . in the one month since washington agreed to allow donors to send funds to finance minister salam fayyad through a palestine liberation organization -lrb- plo -rrb- account , it has received at least $ 160 million .
on monday , the european union said it was renewing support by launching a four-million-euro -lrb- $ 5.3 million -rrb- project to help ensure that palestinian taxpayers ' money is spent efficiently and that expenditures are accounted for .
diplomats said the eu was also considering expanding an existing aid mechanism to pay palestinian police .
some israeli officials have criticized what they see as a shift in us policy aimed at bolstering palestinian president mahmoud abbas , whose fatah faction joined a unity government led by islamist hamas three months ago .
they also object to plans to finance the police , which fall under the hamas-run interior ministry .
" the palestinian authority 's financial position is much better today than six months ago .
we are losing , " said a senior israeli official involved in overseeing the embargo imposed after islamist hamas came to power in 2006 .
the embargo was leveled after hamas , which is blacklisted by the west as a terrorist organization , took office in march 2006 .
the party has continued to defy western demands to recognize israel , renounce violence and abide by previous interim peace deals .
support from eu palestinian information minister mustapha barghuti on monday welcomed the resumption of eu aid to the palestinian finance ministry and urged brussels to keep it flowing .
" this is a positive step that should be followed " by others , he said in berlin , where he was a guest of the friedrich ebert foundation .
" we do n't see why there should not be direct cooperation now , " added the minister , who is also the spokesman for the power-sharing palestinian government .
barghuti , who is due to travel to brussels on tuesday , said palestinians did not want to become dependent on foreign hand-outs but required financial support from the european union for much-needed " institution-building . "

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a giant bluefin tuna fish at home in an aquarium eu fisheries ministers reached separate agreements that will restrict how much bluefin tuna and eel fisherman can pull from the waters surrounding europe . welcoming the deals , eu fisheries commissioner joe borg said that they " mark an important step on the way to ensuring the sustainability of european fisheries . " " i am glad that the severely depleted eel and bluefin tuna stocks will shortly receive the protection that they so badly need , " he added .
" indeed , this protection will not come one day too soon . " on tuna , the ministers backed plans to cut member states ' fishing quotas for this year by 10 percent as part of a 15-year package to save the species , which has become a victim of its success with consumers . environmentalists have warned that tuna face eventual extinction if fishing continued at current rates to feed a worldwide fad for japanese food such as sushi . under the measures , the amount of time fishing boats can be at sea will be limited to six months a year , while the minimum size of fish allowed to be taken was raised from 10 kilos -lrb- 22 pounds -rrb- to 30 to help them reproduce . the package , which will hit france , italy and spain particularly hard as they are the eu 's biggest tuna fishing nations , is part of a broader global effort to protect tuna which was agreed in january in japan . eel deal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a british classic : fish and chips the measures aim to boost stocks by ensuring that a minimum 40 percent of eel will not be fished when they leave rivers in western europe to lay their eggs in the sargasso sea between the caribbean and florida . eel stocks have been in a freefall since 1980 , plunging by 95-99 percent , according the convention on international trade in endangered species , or cites . young eel are exported from europe to asia , particularly japan and china , where they are considered a great delicacy .

on monday , the european union said it was renewing support by launching a four-million-euro -lrb- $ 5.3 million -rrb- project to help ensure that palestinian taxpayers ' money is spent efficiently and that expenditures are accounted for .
diplomats said the eu was also considering expanding an existing aid mechanism to pay palestinian police .
some israeli officials have criticized what they see as a shift in us policy aimed at bolstering palestinian president mahmoud abbas , whose fatah faction joined a unity government led by islamist hamas three months ago .
they also object to plans to finance the police , which fall under the hamas-run interior ministry .
" the palestinian authority 's financial position is much better today than six months ago .
we are losing , " said a senior israeli official involved in overseeing the embargo imposed after islamist hamas came to power in 2006 .
the embargo was leveled after hamas , which is blacklisted by the west as a terrorist organization , took office in march 2006 .
the party has continued to defy western demands to recognize israel , renounce violence and abide by previous interim peace deals .
support from eu palestinian information minister mustapha barghuti on monday welcomed the resumption of eu aid to the palestinian finance ministry and urged brussels to keep it flowing .
" this is a positive step that should be followed " by others , he said in berlin , where he was a guest of the friedrich ebert foundation .
" we do n't see why there should not be direct cooperation now , " added the minister , who is also the spokesman for the power-sharing palestinian government .
barghuti , who is due to travel to brussels on tuesday , said palestinians did not want to become dependent on foreign hand-outs but required financial support from the european union for much-needed " institution-building . "
" we do n't want to create a dependency .
if you want palestinians to survive , this palestinian government should be empowered , " he said .

" the situation right now is a complete mess , " borg told reporters in luxembourg ahead of a meeting of eu interior ministers on tuesday .
" it 's a free for all . " " each year 600 immigrants are dying - this is a very conservative estimate i must say - on the threshold of europe .
the figure could rise again this year , " he said . several boats with illegal migrants have recently capsized in the waters between the mediterranean island and libya .
eighteen bodies were found in the zone last month by a french ship . borg said he would urge eu countries to help with " burden sharing " by accepting any would-be immigrants who are rescued in international waters . " it is only fair that those immigrants who are saved are distributed on a rotational basis between the 27 eu member states , " he said . " temporarily those immigrants should go to the nearest european state until they are transferred to the designated country of destination , " he said . the country of destination would be chosen based on size and population . a tough task bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sweden hosts the largest number of iraqi refugees in the eu eu diplomats have said that borg faces a tough task in convincing his eu partners to help .
many countries agree on the need to save people but few are keen to take responsibility for illegal migrants once they are safely ashore . some believe it would be better to work closely with the countries that people are fleeing or crossing to reach europe , concerned that " burden sharing " might appear to immigrants as a " free ticket " to move deeper into the eu . " i do n't think that this is a free flight to go to paris , " borg said .
" i think that the desperation of these people is very evident . " " they first cross the desert ... and if they survive that they try to cross the mediterranean and if they survive that then they are accepted or saved by the european authorities . he said that the number of people arriving was small in eu terms but that malta , with a population of around 400,000 , had to bear the heaviest load in dealing with a problem that has significantly grown in recent weeks . " from the beginning of this year our coast guard has saved 350 -lrb- people -rrb- , 250 of whom in the past 10-15 days , " he said . describing himself as a pragmatic politician , borg said he was not expecting miracles from tuesday 's talks . " a commitment , that would be ideal ... but at least that the discussion will start , " he said refuge crises bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european commission hopes to harmonize asylum rules across the union despite a commitment to an eu-wide common asylum system , member states not only take different approaches to asylum claims but also apply very different standards of treatment to asylum seekers . sweden , for instance , has demanded that other eu countries take in more vulnerable people fleeing iraq and has also called for a further harmonization of widely differing asylum procedures in the eu .
some 9,000 iraqis found a new home in sweden last year .
stockholm expects some 20,000 more this year .
sweden grants refugee status or other protection to almost all iraqi asylum seekers .
eu diplomats said the number of iraqis seeking refuge in the bloc was likely to reach 40,000 this year .
around 20,000 iraqis applied for asylum in the eu in 2006 , which is , compared to 2005 , an increase of 77 percent .
regional solutions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu justice commissioner franco frattini eu ministers earlier this year said that there was no need for resettlement of iraqis inside the eu and added that the iraqi refugee crisis must be tackled in the region .
meanwhile , the european commission has slammed member states for a lack of solidarity in hosting asylum seekers and dealing with refugee crisis and wants to use the meeting in luxembourg to drum up support for new plans aimed at harmonizing asylum rules across the eu .
currently , there are some 20 different systems of asylum in the 27-nation bloc .
the commission , the eu 's executive arm , wants to have more harmonized rules in place by 2010 .

boats , helicopters and planes needed to patrol the eu 's southern maritime borders existed only " on paper , " frontex said monday .
about 500,000 illegal immigrants enter the eu each year , mainly from poor african countries .
the bloc has responded by stepping up border controls , with so-called " frontline " states , spain , italy and malta , demanding even tougher measures against illegals .
eu officials have accused maltese authorities of failing to meet their international duties to save lives by refusing to admit migrants rescued by vessels outside its search and rescue area .
officials in malta deny they have ever left migrants at sea in distress .

eu ministers are also expected to discuss commission proposals to introduce tough sanctions for employers of illegal migrants , including heavy fines and prison sentences for the worst offenders .

" the situation right now is a complete mess , " borg told reporters in luxembourg ahead of a meeting of eu interior ministers on tuesday .
" it 's a free for all . " " each year 600 immigrants are dying - this is a very conservative estimate i must say - on the threshold of europe .
the figure could rise again this year , " he said . several boats with illegal migrants have recently capsized in the waters between the mediterranean island and libya .
eighteen bodies were found in the zone last month by a french ship . borg said he would urge eu countries to help with " burden sharing " by accepting any would-be immigrants who are rescued in international waters . " it is only fair that those immigrants who are saved are distributed on a rotational basis between the 27 eu member states , " he said . " temporarily those immigrants should go to the nearest european state until they are transferred to the designated country of destination , " he said . the country of destination would be chosen based on size and population . a tough task bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sweden hosts the largest number of iraqi refugees in the eu eu diplomats have said that borg faces a tough task in convincing his eu partners to help .
many countries agree on the need to save people but few are keen to take responsibility for illegal migrants once they are safely ashore . some believe it would be better to work closely with the countries that people are fleeing or crossing to reach europe , concerned that " burden sharing " might appear to immigrants as a " free ticket " to move deeper into the eu . " i do n't think that this is a free flight to go to paris , " borg said .
" i think that the desperation of these people is very evident . " " they first cross the desert ... and if they survive that they try to cross the mediterranean and if they survive that then they are accepted or saved by the european authorities . he said that the number of people arriving was small in eu terms but that malta , with a population of around 400,000 , had to bear the heaviest load in dealing with a problem that has significantly grown in recent weeks . " from the beginning of this year our coast guard has saved 350 -lrb- people -rrb- , 250 of whom in the past 10-15 days , " he said . describing himself as a pragmatic politician , borg said he was not expecting miracles from tuesday 's talks . " a commitment , that would be ideal ... but at least that the discussion will start , " he said refuge crises bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european commission hopes to harmonize asylum rules across the union despite a commitment to an eu-wide common asylum system , member states not only take different approaches to asylum claims but also apply very different standards of treatment to asylum seekers . sweden , for instance , has demanded that other eu countries take in more vulnerable people fleeing iraq and has also called for a further harmonization of widely differing asylum procedures in the eu .
some 9,000 iraqis found a new home in sweden last year .
stockholm expects some 20,000 more this year .
sweden grants refugee status or other protection to almost all iraqi asylum seekers .
eu diplomats said the number of iraqis seeking refuge in the bloc was likely to reach 40,000 this year .
around 20,000 iraqis applied for asylum in the eu in 2006 , which is , compared to 2005 , an increase of 77 percent .
regional solutions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu justice commissioner franco frattini eu ministers earlier this year said that there was no need for resettlement of iraqis inside the eu and added that the iraqi refugee crisis must be tackled in the region .
meanwhile , the european commission has slammed member states for a lack of solidarity in hosting asylum seekers and dealing with refugee crisis and wants to use the meeting in luxembourg to drum up support for new plans aimed at harmonizing asylum rules across the eu .
currently , there are some 20 different systems of asylum in the 27-nation bloc .
the commission , the eu 's executive arm , wants to have more harmonized rules in place by 2010 .
unfulfilled pledges bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : about 500,000 illegal immigrants enter the eu each year eu justice commissioner franco frattini is expected to use the luxembourg meeting to rebuke governments for not fulfilling pledges to send technical equipment for the bloc 's border control agency frontex .
boats , helicopters and planes needed to patrol the eu 's southern maritime borders existed only " on paper , " frontex said monday .
about 500,000 illegal immigrants enter the eu each year , mainly from poor african countries .
the bloc has responded by stepping up border controls , with so-called " frontline " states , spain , italy and malta , demanding even tougher measures against illegals .
eu officials have accused maltese authorities of failing to meet their international duties to save lives by refusing to admit migrants rescued by vessels outside its search and rescue area .
officials in malta deny they have ever left migrants at sea in distress .
ai appeal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : illegal immigration is driven mainly by economic forces human rights watchdog amnesty international issued an appeal to the german eu presidency to set up a rescue plan for immigrants in distress at sea .
" the eu must draw consequences and investigate the latest incidents , " said amnesty 's director for europe , dick oostings .
eu ministers are also expected to discuss commission proposals to introduce tough sanctions for employers of illegal migrants , including heavy fines and prison sentences for the worst offenders .
the commission argues that the prospect of finding an illicit job in the eu was the main driving force behind illegal immigration .
but the plan could run into fierce opposition from some member states as the eu does not have the competence to interfere with matters of criminal law . dw staff / afp , dpa -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they warned that , without compromise , efforts to end the crisis over the draft of the constitution that was rejected by voters in france and the netherlands would fail at the summit on june 21 and 22 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso expects a " new dynamic " in talks " if we fail again , then it will have very negative consequences , " barroso said at a joint session of the european parliament with national representatives . strong rhetoric from warsaw " if we want to have success in this issue , then we must all move , " said foreign minister steinmeier .
" i have the impression that the willingness to move is absolutely there , " he added , and said he hoped it would be the case for all sides at the summit .
but steinmeier 's conviction that " a new dynamic has come into the talks " is in stark contrast to recent rhetoric from polish prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski , who has repeatedly threatened to veto the draft treaty because he disagrees with its provisions for how member states would vote on policy issues .
" poland will never accept , under any pretext , the system that has been put on the table to us , " kaczynski told polish public radio tuesday . poland fears losing clout warsaw is concerned that plans to reform the way member states vote on decisions affecting the whole bloc could cost it some of its clout .
it wants the voting system to be based on the square root of the number , in millions , of the population of each member state .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french rejected an eu constitution in 2005 but germany , which holds the eu 's rotating presidency until the end of next month , when it hands over to portugal , has poured cold water on the polish proposal .
german chancellor angela merkel has up to now refused to take a second look at the voting mechanism issue , for fear that reopening the debate would lead to an avalanche of demands on various issues from all member states .
the voting system , which poland had previously accepted , would mean that 55 percent of eu members with at least 65 percent of the eu 's population would be required to pass resolutions .
kaczynski now says the system is unfair to smaller nations , and has called for the eu to prolong the debate for another year . " the current situation makes a lot of people unhappy , " kaczynski told a press conference later on tuesday .
" we are the only ones with enough courage to say so , because we are a large country and also because we are the most affected " by the qualified majority system of voting proposed at present . " we will not allow ourselves to be radically downgraded , " he said . ' delay is not a solution ' barroso rejected kaczynski 's notion that there was still time to change the eu treaties , as a decision would not be made for at least a year .

the german eu presidency has been trying to steer a course through the different opinions of the eu members on how to draft a new treaty that would replace the draft constitution dealt a death blow in 2005 by the french and the dutch .
germany plans to submit a list of topics that would be discussed by an intergovernmental conference to eu members at the summit meeting .
but poland has threatened to bar the conference from getting down to business if the list of topics for debate does not meet with its approval . merkel on monday began a marathon of diplomatic meetings , during which she will meet , in the space of one week , with seven european heads of state or government , including polish president lech kaczynski , the prime minister 's twin brother . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de french proposal to end eu crisis makes headway french president nicolas sarkozy 's idea of a simplified treaty designed to end the european union 's constitional crisis appears to be gaining support .

" it 's a free for all . " " each year 600 immigrants are dying - this is a very conservative estimate i must say - on the threshold of europe .
the figure could rise again this year , " he said . several boats with illegal migrants have recently capsized in the waters between the mediterranean island and libya .
eighteen bodies were found in the zone last month by a french ship . borg said he would urge eu countries to help with " burden sharing " by accepting any would-be immigrants who are rescued in international waters . " it is only fair that those immigrants who are saved are distributed on a rotational basis between the 27 eu member states , " he said . " temporarily those immigrants should go to the nearest european state until they are transferred to the designated country of destination , " he said . the country of destination would be chosen based on size and population . a tough task bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sweden hosts the largest number of iraqi refugees in the eu eu diplomats have said that borg faces a tough task in convincing his eu partners to help .
many countries agree on the need to save people but few are keen to take responsibility for illegal migrants once they are safely ashore . some believe it would be better to work closely with the countries that people are fleeing or crossing to reach europe , concerned that " burden sharing " might appear to immigrants as a " free ticket " to move deeper into the eu . " i do n't think that this is a free flight to go to paris , " borg said .
" i think that the desperation of these people is very evident . " " they first cross the desert ... and if they survive that they try to cross the mediterranean and if they survive that then they are accepted or saved by the european authorities . he said that the number of people arriving was small in eu terms but that malta , with a population of around 400,000 , had to bear the heaviest load in dealing with a problem that has significantly grown in recent weeks . " from the beginning of this year our coast guard has saved 350 -lrb- people -rrb- , 250 of whom in the past 10-15 days , " he said . describing himself as a pragmatic politician , borg said he was not expecting miracles from tuesday 's talks .

some 9,000 iraqis found a new home in sweden last year .
stockholm expects some 20,000 more this year .
sweden grants refugee status or other protection to almost all iraqi asylum seekers .
eu diplomats said the number of iraqis seeking refuge in the bloc was likely to reach 40,000 this year .
around 20,000 iraqis applied for asylum in the eu in 2006 , which is , compared to 2005 , an increase of 77 percent .
regional solutions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu justice commissioner franco frattini eu ministers earlier this year said that there was no need for resettlement of iraqis inside the eu and added that the iraqi refugee crisis must be tackled in the region .
meanwhile , the european commission has slammed member states for a lack of solidarity in hosting asylum seekers and dealing with refugee crisis and wants to use the meeting in luxembourg to drum up support for new plans aimed at harmonizing asylum rules across the eu .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 12.06.2007 worried eu leaders call for compromise on eu constitution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a veto by poland 's kaczynski -lrb- left -rrb- would throw a wrench in merkel 's plans for the eu eu leaders , responding to polish veto threats , called on european governments to compromise on a draft eu constitution treaty at an upcoming summit . european commission president jose manuel barroso and german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier called on eu governments to be ready to compromise on changes to the eu constitution in an upcoming summit in brussels .
they warned that , without compromise , efforts to end the crisis over the draft of the constitution that was rejected by voters in france and the netherlands would fail at the summit on june 21 and 22 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso expects a " new dynamic " in talks " if we fail again , then it will have very negative consequences , " barroso said at a joint session of the european parliament with national representatives . strong rhetoric from warsaw " if we want to have success in this issue , then we must all move , " said foreign minister steinmeier .
" i have the impression that the willingness to move is absolutely there , " he added , and said he hoped it would be the case for all sides at the summit .
but steinmeier 's conviction that " a new dynamic has come into the talks " is in stark contrast to recent rhetoric from polish prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski , who has repeatedly threatened to veto the draft treaty because he disagrees with its provisions for how member states would vote on policy issues .
" poland will never accept , under any pretext , the system that has been put on the table to us , " kaczynski told polish public radio tuesday . poland fears losing clout warsaw is concerned that plans to reform the way member states vote on decisions affecting the whole bloc could cost it some of its clout .
it wants the voting system to be based on the square root of the number , in millions , of the population of each member state .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french rejected an eu constitution in 2005 but germany , which holds the eu 's rotating presidency until the end of next month , when it hands over to portugal , has poured cold water on the polish proposal .
german chancellor angela merkel has up to now refused to take a second look at the voting mechanism issue , for fear that reopening the debate would lead to an avalanche of demands on various issues from all member states .
the voting system , which poland had previously accepted , would mean that 55 percent of eu members with at least 65 percent of the eu 's population would be required to pass resolutions .
kaczynski now says the system is unfair to smaller nations , and has called for the eu to prolong the debate for another year . " the current situation makes a lot of people unhappy , " kaczynski told a press conference later on tuesday .
" we are the only ones with enough courage to say so , because we are a large country and also because we are the most affected " by the qualified majority system of voting proposed at present . " we will not allow ourselves to be radically downgraded , " he said . ' delay is not a solution ' barroso rejected kaczynski 's notion that there was still time to change the eu treaties , as a decision would not be made for at least a year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier : ' the willingness is there ' " delay is not a solution .
the problem will not go away .
help us to find a solution , " barroso told members of the european parliament .
the german eu presidency has been trying to steer a course through the different opinions of the eu members on how to draft a new treaty that would replace the draft constitution dealt a death blow in 2005 by the french and the dutch .
germany plans to submit a list of topics that would be discussed by an intergovernmental conference to eu members at the summit meeting .
but poland has threatened to bar the conference from getting down to business if the list of topics for debate does not meet with its approval . merkel on monday began a marathon of diplomatic meetings , during which she will meet , in the space of one week , with seven european heads of state or government , including polish president lech kaczynski , the prime minister 's twin brother . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de french proposal to end eu crisis makes headway french president nicolas sarkozy 's idea of a simplified treaty designed to end the european union 's constitional crisis appears to be gaining support .

" it is a big problem that so many years after reunification , such earnings discrepancies still exist , " reinhard bispinck of the hans böckler foundation told reporters after announcing the results .
" clearly we have n't managed to get the economies of both parts of the country on equal footing . "
gap cuts across sectors the wage gap cuts across trades : a cook in western germany takes home an average 1,311 euros per month -lrb- $ 1,750 -rrb- , compared with 985 euros in the east .
a web designer in the west takes home an average 41 percent more than their eastern counterparts : 2,300 euros compared to 1,360 euros .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the difference was biggest between web designers eastern german auto mechanics , data-entry workers , accountants , secretaries , bookkeepers , machinists and retail buyers all were paid about a third of what they would earn in the western states .
and there was a 20 percent discrepancy between geriatric nurses , civil engineers , teachers , metal workers , and cooks .
how to account for the chasm between eastern and western pay scales ?
the main problem lies in the east 's stagnant economy , bispinck said , noting eastern unemployment is nearly double that in the west .
fewer wage agreements moreover , the number of workers who are paid according to collective-bargaining agreements or union scales is much lower in the east , bispinck pointed out .
" in the ' new ' german states just 50 percent of workers are paid at union wages , compared with two-thirds in the west .
that gives eastern-german employers a much greater chance to pay less , " bispinck said .
" if the economic upswing continues for a while , then there is a chance for the east to catch up , " he added , although he admitted there had been no sign of this happening so far . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de west germans have hang-ups about going east as they pick up pictures taken over the easter holidays , few western germans are flipping through photos of the country 's east , and experts say not many vacations in the former east germany are being planned .
-lrb- 16.04.2007 -rrb- germans celebrate unity day with mixed emotions as germans celebrate the 16th anniversary of reunification tuesday , there 's no masking a sense of disillusionment at the failure to tackle the country 's economic and demographic woes resulting from the tumultuous event .
-lrb- 03.10.2006 -rrb- women fleeing eastern germany , leaving men behind higher education levels and a lack of job opportunities have led many young women to leave eastern germany .
the men who are left behind are often unskilled , unmarried and more ripe for recruitment by far-right groups .

for example , artist walter de maria 's so-called " kasseler loch , " or kassel whole , a 1,000-meter -lrb- 3,280 feet -rrb- metal pole pounded vertically into the ground and sculptor claes oldenburg 's 12-meter-high pick-ax seemingly stuck into the bank of the fulda river by a passing giant ca n't be missed . and no visitor will forget jonathan borowsky 's " man walking to the sky , " a sculpture of a man walking up a pole 25 meters into the air directly in front of the kassel train station . " old " kassel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kassel 's " man walking to the sky " the city 's art installations make up only part of its charm .
for many visitors , the mix of old and new really gives this quiet city its unique atmosphere . while strolling through one of the kassel 's many parks , visitors may feel like they are being watched .
on top of a castle in the hillside that is wilhelmshohe park stands a towering bronze statue of hercules . built in 1719 , the statue tops an octagonal castle overlooking kassel with a cascading landscaping which is unique to germany .
the panoramic view from the apex of the park makes the walk up to hercules ' perch worthwhile . tourists following the german fairytale route , a trail from hanau to bremen , will land in kassel due to the city 's two most famous sons . wilhelm and jacob grimm moved to the town in 1798 and over the years collected many of their famous tales within the city 's medieval walls , including rapunzel , cinderella and little red riding hood . located in bellevue palace , the brothers grimm museum highlights not just the storytelling prowess of the brothers -lrb- their last collection contained over 200 fairytales -rrb- but also their linguistic and political work . documenta xii since its inaugural event in 1955 , documenta has helped to transform kassel into a worldwide destination for contemporary art .
its three-month-long show is an artistic free-for-all and takes place in the middle of a medieval park . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kassel expects large crowds this year the people of kassel are invited to the party .
instead of the invitation-only cocktail parties of documentas past , the curators will host a celebration to thank the residents of kassel for their support through 12 documentas . the party will feature norwegian rock band kaizers orchestra and the dj formation cluster , and will culminate in an illumination of the park 's renowned water gardens . from the collection of old master paintings in the wilhelmshöhe palace art gallery to the clean modern design of the karl branner bridge , kassel is a city of contradiction . a contradiction that is sure to be deepened through the summer as the artists , curators and documenta visitors descend upon the city .
the brothers grimm would be proud . documenta 12 runs from june 16 to sept .

they warned that , without compromise , efforts to end the crisis over the draft of the constitution that was rejected by voters in france and the netherlands would fail at the summit on june 21 and 22 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso expects a " new dynamic " in talks " if we fail again , then it will have very negative consequences , " barroso said at a joint session of the european parliament with national representatives . strong rhetoric from warsaw " if we want to have success in this issue , then we must all move , " said foreign minister steinmeier .
" i have the impression that the willingness to move is absolutely there , " he added , and said he hoped it would be the case for all sides at the summit .
but steinmeier 's conviction that " a new dynamic has come into the talks " is in stark contrast to recent rhetoric from polish prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski , who has repeatedly threatened to veto the draft treaty because he disagrees with its provisions for how member states would vote on policy issues .
" poland will never accept , under any pretext , the system that has been put on the table to us , " kaczynski told polish public radio tuesday . poland fears losing clout warsaw is concerned that plans to reform the way member states vote on decisions affecting the whole bloc could cost it some of its clout .
it wants the voting system to be based on the square root of the number , in millions , of the population of each member state .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french rejected an eu constitution in 2005 but germany , which holds the eu 's rotating presidency until the end of next month , when it hands over to portugal , has poured cold water on the polish proposal .
german chancellor angela merkel has up to now refused to take a second look at the voting mechanism issue , for fear that reopening the debate would lead to an avalanche of demands on various issues from all member states .
the voting system , which poland had previously accepted , would mean that 55 percent of eu members with at least 65 percent of the eu 's population would be required to pass resolutions .
kaczynski now says the system is unfair to smaller nations , and has called for the eu to prolong the debate for another year . " the current situation makes a lot of people unhappy , " kaczynski told a press conference later on tuesday .
" we are the only ones with enough courage to say so , because we are a large country and also because we are the most affected " by the qualified majority system of voting proposed at present . " we will not allow ourselves to be radically downgraded , " he said . ' delay is not a solution ' barroso rejected kaczynski 's notion that there was still time to change the eu treaties , as a decision would not be made for at least a year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier : ' the willingness is there ' " delay is not a solution .
the problem will not go away .
help us to find a solution , " barroso told members of the european parliament .
the german eu presidency has been trying to steer a course through the different opinions of the eu members on how to draft a new treaty that would replace the draft constitution dealt a death blow in 2005 by the french and the dutch .
germany plans to submit a list of topics that would be discussed by an intergovernmental conference to eu members at the summit meeting .
but poland has threatened to bar the conference from getting down to business if the list of topics for debate does not meet with its approval . merkel on monday began a marathon of diplomatic meetings , during which she will meet , in the space of one week , with seven european heads of state or government , including polish president lech kaczynski , the prime minister 's twin brother . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de french proposal to end eu crisis makes headway french president nicolas sarkozy 's idea of a simplified treaty designed to end the european union 's constitional crisis appears to be gaining support .

but the court of first instance upheld the american company 's right to use the names on merchandise .
" the court of first instance dismisses actions in proceedings taken by budejovicky against anheuser-busch concerning the use of community trademarks , " the court of first instance in luxembourg said in a statement .
weakened reputation budvar had said that under french law , an appellation of origin could not be used for any product or service which would weaken its reputation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beer might be nice at the bar , but it 's a business , too st. louis , missouri-based anheuser-busch , the largest us brewer , applied for the trademarks in 1996 at the office for harmonization in the internal market , which is responsible for eu-wide trademarks .
the us company and the czech budvar have taken legal action against each other in national courts across europe .
anheuser-busch won the registration for several words related to budweiser , which it has used for products as stationery , cleaning supplies and clothing .
budvar said that the court ruling would have no impact on its business . " today 's decisions are not substantial from the point of view of budejovicky budvar 's beer sales and do not threaten its current business activities in eu countries , " the company said .
privatization fears in may , a europe-wide grouping of beer lovers called on czechs to lobby their government not to privatize budejovicky budvar - the country 's third largest brewery .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : production line in the budvar brewery in the czech republic " czech citizens should petition their government to ensure that budvar remains a state asset and stays that way for the next century , " the president of the european beer consumers union -lrb- ebcu -rrb- , terry lock , said in prague .
the center-right czech government announced the first step towards privatizing budvar at the beginning of april when the agriculture minister announced that the brewery would be transformed into a shareholder company .
anheuser-busch is tipped to be a frontrunner to buy the last major czech brewery not yet snapped up by a global drinks company .
to the ebcu , brewing multinationals like anheuser-busch and belgium 's inbev represent a threat to traditionally-brewed quality beer .
" there are people who brew beer and people who sell beer .

but the court of first instance upheld the american company 's right to use the names on merchandise .
" the court of first instance dismisses actions in proceedings taken by budejovicky against anheuser-busch concerning the use of community trademarks , " the court of first instance in luxembourg said in a statement .
weakened reputation budvar had said that under french law , an appellation of origin could not be used for any product or service which would weaken its reputation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beer might be nice at the bar , but it 's a business , too st. louis , missouri-based anheuser-busch , the largest us brewer , applied for the trademarks in 1996 at the office for harmonization in the internal market , which is responsible for eu-wide trademarks .
the us company and the czech budvar have taken legal action against each other in national courts across europe .
anheuser-busch won the registration for several words related to budweiser , which it has used for products as stationery , cleaning supplies and clothing .
budvar said that the court ruling would have no impact on its business . " today 's decisions are not substantial from the point of view of budejovicky budvar 's beer sales and do not threaten its current business activities in eu countries , " the company said .
privatization fears in may , a europe-wide grouping of beer lovers called on czechs to lobby their government not to privatize budejovicky budvar - the country 's third largest brewery .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : production line in the budvar brewery in the czech republic " czech citizens should petition their government to ensure that budvar remains a state asset and stays that way for the next century , " the president of the european beer consumers union -lrb- ebcu -rrb- , terry lock , said in prague .
the center-right czech government announced the first step towards privatizing budvar at the beginning of april when the agriculture minister announced that the brewery would be transformed into a shareholder company .
anheuser-busch is tipped to be a frontrunner to buy the last major czech brewery not yet snapped up by a global drinks company .
to the ebcu , brewing multinationals like anheuser-busch and belgium 's inbev represent a threat to traditionally-brewed quality beer .

" the situation right now is a complete mess , " borg told reporters in luxembourg ahead of a meeting of eu interior ministers on tuesday .
" it 's a free for all . " " each year 600 immigrants are dying - this is a very conservative estimate i must say - on the threshold of europe .
the figure could rise again this year , " he said . several boats with illegal migrants have recently capsized in the waters between the mediterranean island and libya .
eighteen bodies were found in the zone last month by a french ship . borg said he would urge eu countries to help with " burden sharing " by accepting any would-be immigrants who are rescued in international waters . " it is only fair that those immigrants who are saved are distributed on a rotational basis between the 27 eu member states , " he said . " temporarily those immigrants should go to the nearest european state until they are transferred to the designated country of destination , " he said . the country of destination would be chosen based on size and population . a tough task bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sweden hosts the largest number of iraqi refugees in the eu eu diplomats have said that borg faces a tough task in convincing his eu partners to help .
many countries agree on the need to save people but few are keen to take responsibility for illegal migrants once they are safely ashore . some believe it would be better to work closely with the countries that people are fleeing or crossing to reach europe , concerned that " burden sharing " might appear to immigrants as a " free ticket " to move deeper into the eu . " i do n't think that this is a free flight to go to paris , " borg said .
" i think that the desperation of these people is very evident . " " they first cross the desert ... and if they survive that they try to cross the mediterranean and if they survive that then they are accepted or saved by the european authorities . he said that the number of people arriving was small in eu terms but that malta , with a population of around 400,000 , had to bear the heaviest load in dealing with a problem that has significantly grown in recent weeks . " from the beginning of this year our coast guard has saved 350 -lrb- people -rrb- , 250 of whom in the past 10-15 days , " he said . describing himself as a pragmatic politician , borg said he was not expecting miracles from tuesday 's talks . " a commitment , that would be ideal ... but at least that the discussion will start , " he said refuge crises bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european commission hopes to harmonize asylum rules across the union despite a commitment to an eu-wide common asylum system , member states not only take different approaches to asylum claims but also apply very different standards of treatment to asylum seekers . sweden , for instance , has demanded that other eu countries take in more vulnerable people fleeing iraq and has also called for a further harmonization of widely differing asylum procedures in the eu .
some 9,000 iraqis found a new home in sweden last year .
stockholm expects some 20,000 more this year .
sweden grants refugee status or other protection to almost all iraqi asylum seekers .
eu diplomats said the number of iraqis seeking refuge in the bloc was likely to reach 40,000 this year .
around 20,000 iraqis applied for asylum in the eu in 2006 , which is , compared to 2005 , an increase of 77 percent .
regional solutions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu justice commissioner franco frattini eu ministers earlier this year said that there was no need for resettlement of iraqis inside the eu and added that the iraqi refugee crisis must be tackled in the region .
meanwhile , the european commission has slammed member states for a lack of solidarity in hosting asylum seekers and dealing with refugee crisis and wants to use the meeting in luxembourg to drum up support for new plans aimed at harmonizing asylum rules across the eu .
currently , there are some 20 different systems of asylum in the 27-nation bloc .
the commission , the eu 's executive arm , wants to have more harmonized rules in place by 2010 .
unfulfilled pledges bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : about 500,000 illegal immigrants enter the eu each year eu justice commissioner franco frattini is expected to use the luxembourg meeting to rebuke governments for not fulfilling pledges to send technical equipment for the bloc 's border control agency frontex .
boats , helicopters and planes needed to patrol the eu 's southern maritime borders existed only " on paper , " frontex said monday .
about 500,000 illegal immigrants enter the eu each year , mainly from poor african countries .
the bloc has responded by stepping up border controls , with so-called " frontline " states , spain , italy and malta , demanding even tougher measures against illegals .
eu officials have accused maltese authorities of failing to meet their international duties to save lives by refusing to admit migrants rescued by vessels outside its search and rescue area .
officials in malta deny they have ever left migrants at sea in distress .
ai appeal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : illegal immigration is driven mainly by economic forces human rights watchdog amnesty international issued an appeal to the german eu presidency to set up a rescue plan for immigrants in distress at sea .
" the eu must draw consequences and investigate the latest incidents , " said amnesty 's director for europe , dick oostings .
eu ministers are also expected to discuss commission proposals to introduce tough sanctions for employers of illegal migrants , including heavy fines and prison sentences for the worst offenders .
the commission argues that the prospect of finding an illicit job in the eu was the main driving force behind illegal immigration .
but the plan could run into fierce opposition from some member states as the eu does not have the competence to interfere with matters of criminal law . dw staff / afp , dpa -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the court of first instance upheld the american company 's right to use the names on merchandise .
" the court of first instance dismisses actions in proceedings taken by budejovicky against anheuser-busch concerning the use of community trademarks , " the court of first instance in luxembourg said in a statement .
weakened reputation budvar had said that under french law , an appellation of origin could not be used for any product or service which would weaken its reputation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beer might be nice at the bar , but it 's a business , too st. louis , missouri-based anheuser-busch , the largest us brewer , applied for the trademarks in 1996 at the office for harmonization in the internal market , which is responsible for eu-wide trademarks .
the us company and the czech budvar have taken legal action against each other in national courts across europe .
anheuser-busch won the registration for several words related to budweiser , which it has used for products as stationery , cleaning supplies and clothing .
budvar said that the court ruling would have no impact on its business . " today 's decisions are not substantial from the point of view of budejovicky budvar 's beer sales and do not threaten its current business activities in eu countries , " the company said .
privatization fears in may , a europe-wide grouping of beer lovers called on czechs to lobby their government not to privatize budejovicky budvar - the country 's third largest brewery .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : production line in the budvar brewery in the czech republic " czech citizens should petition their government to ensure that budvar remains a state asset and stays that way for the next century , " the president of the european beer consumers union -lrb- ebcu -rrb- , terry lock , said in prague .
the center-right czech government announced the first step towards privatizing budvar at the beginning of april when the agriculture minister announced that the brewery would be transformed into a shareholder company .
anheuser-busch is tipped to be a frontrunner to buy the last major czech brewery not yet snapped up by a global drinks company .
to the ebcu , brewing multinationals like anheuser-busch and belgium 's inbev represent a threat to traditionally-brewed quality beer .
" there are people who brew beer and people who sell beer .
that is the essential difference , " the head of the swiss beer lovers ' association , abo , laurent mousson , told reuters . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : thirsty yanks prowl cologne for special suds prompted by an article in the new york times , american tourists to germany are getting interested in kölsch beer .

with private financial backing , the friends have hired oakwood on the night and are aiming to attract up to 7,500 people .

the 61-year-old has been publishing poetry for 33 years , with books including we 're going on a bear hunt and mustard , custard , grumble belly and gravy .
he also lectures and teaches in universities on children 's literature , and takes his one-man show to schools around the world .
as he commences his two-year stint in the role , taking over from jacqueline wilson , he tells the bbc news website about his plans and his passion for writing .
how does it feel to be chosen as children 's laureate ?
very heady stuff , really .
i just hope i can live up to the expectations .
your predecessor jacqueline wilson used her time in the role to promote reading to children at bedtime .
do you have any plans ?
one of the things i would like to do is help set up a website where poets and children can perform their poems , like a youtube for performance poetry .
where did that idea come from ?
partly from my son joe .
he 's a film-maker and he cut through all the flim-flam of poems on the page and said : " come on , this is the medium of today , dad . "
have your children always been an inspiration ?
oh , yes indeed .
they gave me ideas and taught me things .
but i 've always been nervous of using them as a test bed .
just because dad thought something was funny does n't mean they ever did .
respect is fatal , is n't it ?
you 've been quite critical of the way schools teach stories and story-writing .
will you be using your position to campaign for a change ?
well , i thought i 'd be positive about it .
instead of being critical and negative , we could get teachers to contribute ideas on how to encourage children to read , perform and enjoy a huge variety of poems .
instead of teaching right and wrong answers , it 's about thinking poems are things you can climb into and investigate - just as you would climb into a cupboard and feel your way around to find out where you are .
children are generally enthusiastic about nursery rhymes and poems like yours , but how do you encourage them to progress to more challenging work like under milk wood or the iliad ?
well , i think under milk wood is a perfect example .
the exciting thing dylan thomas did was to write a radio play of many voices .
you could take a classroom and split the voices between people .
get them to stand on chairs and call it out around the room to see what happens .
you could read some lines in unison , and others you could chant like a song .
you can show children that there are many different kinds of poem , and you use your voice and your body to make them more enjoyable .
the promotion machine for harry potter has been grinding away for a couple of months already - what do you think about the impact of the book ?
i do n't think there 's been much impact on the way children read .
we 've had massive cult books before - people used to queue around the block for the next roald dahl .
but i love the idea that there is excitement around the book .
that 's very powerful .
will you be reading it ?
possibly .
i read the first two-and-a-half .
i 'm not going to boast i got any further than that .
will i read the last one ?
well , maybe in my job as the children 's laureate it would be quite a good idea in case people ask me what i think of it .
you write a lot of nonsense verse .
do you think people are silly enough in the real world ?
i think the lovely thing about nonsense is that , usually in literature , we 're looking for motivation .
but if you take hey diddle diddle , there is no reason why a dish should run away with a spoon .
it does n't have the usual logic of stories - that 's quite liberating and bracing for a moment .
finally , you 've been a published poet for 33 years .
what 's the best rhyme you 've come up with ?
the jammiest one was " do n't throw fruit-at-a computer " .
do you get it ?

well , maybe in my job as the children 's laureate it would be quite a good idea in case people ask me what i think of it .
you write a lot of nonsense verse .
do you think people are silly enough in the real world ?
i think the lovely thing about nonsense is that , usually in literature , we 're looking for motivation .

the 61-year-old has been publishing poetry for 33 years , with books including we 're going on a bear hunt and mustard , custard , grumble belly and gravy .
he also lectures and teaches in universities on children 's literature , and takes his one-man show to schools around the world .
as he commences his two-year stint in the role , taking over from jacqueline wilson , he tells the bbc news website about his plans and his passion for writing .
how does it feel to be chosen as children 's laureate ?
very heady stuff , really .
i just hope i can live up to the expectations .
your predecessor jacqueline wilson used her time in the role to promote reading to children at bedtime .
do you have any plans ?
one of the things i would like to do is help set up a website where poets and children can perform their poems , like a youtube for performance poetry .
we 're going on a bear hunt is one of rosen 's most popular books where did that idea come from ?
partly from my son joe .
he 's a film-maker and he cut through all the flim-flam of poems on the page and said : " come on , this is the medium of today , dad . "
have your children always been an inspiration ?
oh , yes indeed .
they gave me ideas and taught me things .
but i 've always been nervous of using them as a test bed .
just because dad thought something was funny does n't mean they ever did .
respect is fatal , is n't it ?
you 've been quite critical of the way schools teach stories and story-writing .
will you be using your position to campaign for a change ?
well , i thought i 'd be positive about it .
instead of being critical and negative , we could get teachers to contribute ideas on how to encourage children to read , perform and enjoy a huge variety of poems .
instead of teaching right and wrong answers , it 's about thinking poems are things you can climb into and investigate - just as you would climb into a cupboard and feel your way around to find out where you are .
children are generally enthusiastic about nursery rhymes and poems like yours , but how do you encourage them to progress to more challenging work like under milk wood or the iliad ?
well , i think under milk wood is a perfect example .
the exciting thing dylan thomas did was to write a radio play of many voices .
you could take a classroom and split the voices between people .
get them to stand on chairs and call it out around the room to see what happens .
you could read some lines in unison , and others you could chant like a song .
you can show children that there are many different kinds of poem , and you use your voice and your body to make them more enjoyable .
rosen admits he has to catch up with jk rowling 's harry potter series the promotion machine for harry potter has been grinding away for a couple of months already - what do you think about the impact of the book ?
i do n't think there 's been much impact on the way children read .
we 've had massive cult books before - people used to queue around the block for the next roald dahl .
but i love the idea that there is excitement around the book .
that 's very powerful .
will you be reading it ?
possibly .
i read the first two-and-a-half .
i 'm not going to boast i got any further than that .

about 600 polish people currently live in consett and more are expected to arrive to work over the summer .
the cards will contain phrases such as " are you injured ? " or " please turn your music down " .
officers will hold up the cards and point to the phrases , rather than attempting to pronounce the words .
polish is very difficult language to speak so i think it 's much easier for the officer to point the phrases out alexandra jorocka , police translator alexandra jorocka , who works as an interpreter for durham and northumbria police , said the scheme would make life much easier for the police .
she said : " " officers will not try to speak the language , instead they will point to the simple phrases .
" polish is very difficult language to speak so i think it 's much easier for the officer to point the phrases out , but it 's not a 100 % solution to the communication problem .
" you still need interpreters to be there , but it will make life easier on the street , especially as lots more polish people will be coming in the summer . "
earlier this week communities secretary ruth kelly called for the amount of material being translated by bodies such as councils to be cut in a bid to encourage immigrants to learn english .
she said translation had been " used too frequently and without thought " .

banaz mahmod was killed after falling in love with a man her family did not want her to marry .
her father mahmod mahmod , 52 , and uncle ari mahmod , 50 , from mitcham , london , were convicted of murder on monday .
human rights barrister usha sood said so-called " honour " crimes were becoming more common and were " being perpetrated in the hundreds every year . "
miss mahmod 's father and uncle ordered the murder because they believed she had shamed the family , the three-month trial at the old bailey heard .
a third defendant , darbad mares-rasull , was cleared of conspiracy to pervert the course of justice .
ari mahmod was also found guilty of conspiracy to pervert the course of justice .
mohamad hama , 30 , of west norwood , south london , an associate of ari , had already pleaded guilty to the murder .
the police described miss mahmod 's murder as an " honour killing . "
ms sood , who specialises in asian family cases , told bbc radio five live " honour crimes of some sort " whether or not they resulted in death , were becoming more common in the uk .
" but certainly honour crimes are being perpetrated in the hundreds every year , " she said .
miss mahmod had made several attempts to warn police her life was in danger , even naming those she thought would kill her .
in mobile phone footage recorded following an earlier attempt on her life by her father in december 2005 , she said she was " really scared " .
however her statement following the assault was allegedly not taken seriously enough by investigating officers .
' suicide cases ' diana nammi , of the iranian and kurdish women 's rights organisation , also told the bbc she believed there were " lot of cases " of honour killings .
" there are lots of suicide cases where woman have been forced to commit suicide , " she added .
banaz 's boyfriend was threatened by her family boyfriend 's heartache killed in the name of honour she said police in the uk must treat the issue " seriously and sensitively " .
" banaz repeatedly went to police and she seek help but police failed to help her and she was killed , " she said .
" and they could help her and they could save her , actually .

her father mahmod mahmod , 52 , and uncle ari mahmod , 50 , from mitcham , london , were convicted of murder on monday .
human rights barrister usha sood said so-called " honour " crimes were becoming more common and were " being perpetrated in the hundreds every year . "

banaz mahmod was killed after falling in love with a man her family did not want her to marry .
her father mahmod mahmod , 52 , and uncle ari mahmod , 50 , from mitcham , london , were convicted of murder on monday .
human rights barrister usha sood said so-called " honour " crimes were becoming more common and were " being perpetrated in the hundreds every year . "
miss mahmod 's father and uncle ordered the murder because they believed she had shamed the family , the three-month trial at the old bailey heard .
a third defendant , darbad mares-rasull , was cleared of conspiracy to pervert the course of justice .
ari mahmod was also found guilty of conspiracy to pervert the course of justice .
mohamad hama , 30 , of west norwood , south london , an associate of ari , had already pleaded guilty to the murder .
the police described miss mahmod 's murder as an " honour killing . "
ms sood , who specialises in asian family cases , told bbc radio five live " honour crimes of some sort " whether or not they resulted in death , were becoming more common in the uk .
" but certainly honour crimes are being perpetrated in the hundreds every year , " she said .
miss mahmod had made several attempts to warn police her life was in danger , even naming those she thought would kill her .
in mobile phone footage recorded following an earlier attempt on her life by her father in december 2005 , she said she was " really scared " .
however her statement following the assault was allegedly not taken seriously enough by investigating officers .
' suicide cases ' diana nammi , of the iranian and kurdish women 's rights organisation , also told the bbc she believed there were " lot of cases " of honour killings .
" there are lots of suicide cases where woman have been forced to commit suicide , " she added .
banaz 's boyfriend was threatened by her family boyfriend 's heartache killed in the name of honour she said police in the uk must treat the issue " seriously and sensitively " .
" banaz repeatedly went to police and she seek help but police failed to help her and she was killed , " she said .
" and they could help her and they could save her , actually .
and there is not any unit to deal with honour killing cases . "
several officers are being investigated as part of an internal review of the case by scotland yard 's directorate of professional standards .
miss mahmod fled but later went back to her family and tried to carry on her relationship with boyfriend rahmat sulemani in secret .
mr sulemani broke down in tears when giving testimony , saying they had been threatened with death if they carried on seeing each other .
he later said : " my life went away when banaz died .
" the only thing which was keeping me going was the moment to see justice being done for banaz . "
' ultimate betrayal ' miss mahmod was urged to stay at a safe house but told officers she believed she would be safe at home because her mother was there .
she disappeared on 24 january and her decomposed body was discovered in handsworth , birmingham , three months later .
her sister bekhal , 22 , who is in hiding from the family , condemned her relatives for taking her relative 's life .
she said : " to do this to their own flesh and blood was unforgivable .
forgiveness is n't even a question .
they do n't deserve to be on this earth . "

consumer price inflation fell to 2.5 % last month , against 2.8 % in april , the office for national statistics said .
the retail prices index , an inflation measure often used in pay bargaining , fell to 4.3 % in may from 4.5 % .
analysts still expect the bank of england to raise interest rates later this year to ensure that inflation falls to 2 % , the government 's target .
bank warning on monday , bank of england governor mervyn king warned people to expect higher interest rates by the end of the year unless consumers and companies slow spending . "
the bank is by no means out of the inflation woods yet " howard archer , global insight mr king told the welsh cbi that the bank 's monetary policy committee was still concerned that spending was rising faster than the economy 's ability to cope with the higher demand , and said that " more persistent inflationary pressures have picked up " .
he also warned borrowers , especially those contemplating house purchases , that " it would be unwise to borrow so much that the repayments are affordable only if interest rates remain at their existing levels " .
despite four interest rates rises since august last year , there are still mixed signals as to whether house prices are falling across the uk .
" the bank is by no means out of the inflation woods yet and another interest rate hike remains very much on the cards by august at the latest , " said howard archer , chief economist at global insight .
forward-looking financial markets in the uk are expecting base rates to reach 6 % by the end of 2007 .
utility bills falling prices for gas and electricity , compared with the rises one year ago , was the main reason for the reduction in inflation , the ons said .
lower food prices , particularly for vegetables and meat , also helped to keep inflation in check .
however , food prices are still rising at 5 % , twice the inflation rate .
the cost of air travel rose sharply compared with falls in the same month a year ago .
the core inflation rate , which excludes food , alcohol , tobacco and energy , was up to 1.9 % , compared with 1.8 % in april .
inflation has now been above the government 's target for 13 months .
