children from underprivileged families are more likely to be exposed to pollutants than their higher-income counterparts . germany 's children are being exposed to a wide range of harmful pollutants , according to a nationwide study by the federal environment agency uba . uba 's president andreas troge said all of those children surveyed showed concentrations of organochloride substances , including the poisonous pesticide ddt .
although substances such as ddt have been banned for decades , they are still stored in people 's fat tissue and are thought to be passed on to children when they are nursed . in addition , troge said it was " alarming " that softening agents for plastics were detectable in all of the children 's urine . " there are certain substances which we are truly worried about , " troge said at the study 's presentation in berlin on tuesday .
he said it was unclear how they could enter the human body .
but it was assumed that these were not due to small children 's plastic toys .
rather food packaging could be responsible , he said , such as the seals on twist-off lids or foils which have direct contact to fatty foods . the child environment survey examined 1,790 children between the ages of three and 14 from 2003 to 2006 .
it is the first representative study available on german children 's exposure to harmful substances , uba said . smoking is the homemade danger bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smoking continues to be the number one pollutant for children the major pollutant indoors continued to be tobacco smoke , troge said .
about half of those children surveyed were exposed to smoke in the home . there had been a noticeable change for the worse in germany 's eastern states , the report showed .
mothers in eastern germany were increasingly smoking , and therefore increasingly exposing their children to smoke .
this led to more frequent inflammation of the middle ear as well as susceptibility to other infections , the survey said . " we can only appeal to parents ' particular responsibility here , " troge said . social class also played a role .
those children from lower class families were more exposed to second-hand smoke than those from higher-income groups . noise pollution disturbs many children troge said it was also striking that 14 percent of the children surveyed showed hearing loss .
six percent felt disturbed by street and aircraft noise . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the health hazards of traffic are often underestimated " traffic is a dominating source of noise and we ca n't underestimate its negative effects , " troge said .
" noise affects our entire organism and promotes sleep , concentration and metabolic disorders , as well as high blood pressure and heart disease . " the underprivileged were more affected by noise pollution than high-income families , he said .
this was due to the fact that people with lower incomes more often lived in inexpensive but unattractive areas , for example along busy roads .
this also led to higher lead contents in the blood of children from lower-income families . environment minister sigmar gabriel , who also attended the study 's presentation , called on local authorities to introduce anti-noise policies not only for the rich , but also for those less well-off .
gabriel said it was a question of " ecological justice . " fruit juice contained more pesticides troge said it was surprising that the exposure of children to harmful molds was growing .
eight percent of those children surveyed showed high sensitivity to indoor mold , which can cause allergies or respiratory illnesses . according to uba , this development could be traced back to the increased spread of such molds indoors , which had to do with poor ventilation in better insulated homes . children from higher-income families , however , also showed traces of harmful substances , for example organophosphate pesticides .
troge said he assumed this could be traced to fruit juices , which they 're more likely to drink . but troge said there were also positive results in the study .
children were less exposed to heavy metals , the wood preservative pentachlorophenol -lrb- pcp -rrb- or polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons than was the case at the beginning of the 1990s . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

children from underprivileged families are more likely to be exposed to pollutants than their higher-income counterparts . germany 's children are being exposed to a wide range of harmful pollutants , according to a nationwide study by the federal environment agency uba . uba 's president andreas troge said all of those children surveyed showed concentrations of organochloride substances , including the poisonous pesticide ddt .
although substances such as ddt have been banned for decades , they are still stored in people 's fat tissue and are thought to be passed on to children when they are nursed . in addition , troge said it was " alarming " that softening agents for plastics were detectable in all of the children 's urine . " there are certain substances which we are truly worried about , " troge said at the study 's presentation in berlin on tuesday .
he said it was unclear how they could enter the human body .
but it was assumed that these were not due to small children 's plastic toys .
rather food packaging could be responsible , he said , such as the seals on twist-off lids or foils which have direct contact to fatty foods . the child environment survey examined 1,790 children between the ages of three and 14 from 2003 to 2006 .
it is the first representative study available on german children 's exposure to harmful substances , uba said . smoking is the homemade danger bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smoking continues to be the number one pollutant for children the major pollutant indoors continued to be tobacco smoke , troge said .
about half of those children surveyed were exposed to smoke in the home . there had been a noticeable change for the worse in germany 's eastern states , the report showed .
mothers in eastern germany were increasingly smoking , and therefore increasingly exposing their children to smoke .
this led to more frequent inflammation of the middle ear as well as susceptibility to other infections , the survey said . " we can only appeal to parents ' particular responsibility here , " troge said . social class also played a role .
those children from lower class families were more exposed to second-hand smoke than those from higher-income groups . noise pollution disturbs many children troge said it was also striking that 14 percent of the children surveyed showed hearing loss .
six percent felt disturbed by street and aircraft noise . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the health hazards of traffic are often underestimated " traffic is a dominating source of noise and we ca n't underestimate its negative effects , " troge said .
" noise affects our entire organism and promotes sleep , concentration and metabolic disorders , as well as high blood pressure and heart disease . " the underprivileged were more affected by noise pollution than high-income families , he said .
this was due to the fact that people with lower incomes more often lived in inexpensive but unattractive areas , for example along busy roads .
this also led to higher lead contents in the blood of children from lower-income families . environment minister sigmar gabriel , who also attended the study 's presentation , called on local authorities to introduce anti-noise policies not only for the rich , but also for those less well-off .
gabriel said it was a question of " ecological justice . " fruit juice contained more pesticides troge said it was surprising that the exposure of children to harmful molds was growing .
eight percent of those children surveyed showed high sensitivity to indoor mold , which can cause allergies or respiratory illnesses . according to uba , this development could be traced back to the increased spread of such molds indoors , which had to do with poor ventilation in better insulated homes . children from higher-income families , however , also showed traces of harmful substances , for example organophosphate pesticides .

but while german companies are also broadening production on the asian giant 's market , product safety concerns abound . germany is known for its high-quality , precision products , and as the world 's export leader , it relies on that image to sell its technology and other goods . so respected is german expertise , for instance , that some can not keep from copying it .
during her visit to the china this week , german chancellor angela merkel criticized chinese copies of german cars slated for display at the frankfurt auto show in september .
but , possible product piracy is one issue ; quality control of german products made in china is another . " among european countries , german companies are certainly among the leaders in producing in china , " said victor vogt of the cologne chamber of commerce and industry -lrb- ihk -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " fake " product market in nanjing of around five million registered german companies , around 3,000 produce or are represented in china , vogt said . checking products yet the " made in china " label has taken serious beating due to safety concerns among products ranging from food to toothpaste to tires .
with american toymaker mattel in recent weeks having to recall up to 18 million toys made in china , the issue has grabbed even more attention among the public . " because of mattel 's massive recall , our work has become more important than ever , " said a press release of the hong kong branch of the cologne-based tüv rheinland . the company claims to be the world leader in product quality testing and examines everything from skin cream to hotels and cruise ships .
it examines over 100,000 products a year in 60 different countries , but its main markets are the united states and europe . toys make up about 15-20 percent of the products the group tests . " in mattel 's case , there seems to have been a problem in quality management , " said hartmut müller-gerbes of the cologne headquarters of tüv rheinland . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " polly pocket " - the mattel doll that started it all china , for its part , has defended the quality of its exports .
it has blamed faults in us designs - and not chinese workmanship - for the mattel recalls and also pointed to varying global product standards . that 's where tüv comes in . müller-gerbes said companies can pay a fee -lrb- 3,000 euros , or $ 4,000 , is a base price -rrb- to have their products tested by tüv in the hopes of gaining a " seal of quality . "
the tüv standards are often far higher than those required by law , but can give companies an edge in the market . furthermore , tüv is informed about the product safety regulations in specific countries . " some german discounters like aldi and lidl force their production companies in china to go to the tüv branch there to be informed before they even begin production of toys , for instance , for the german market , " müller-gerbes said . he stressed that with mattel 's dolls , cars and action figures - which were recalled because they contained lead paint , or tiny magnets that are harmful if swallowed - it was not standards which were too low .
the problem was faulty production . however , he also said that there are far too many products which go to market without being inspected at all . further expansion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china 's sweat shops are infamous but rather than questioning goods production in china , more and more german companies are producing there to save money , especially in labor costs . also , they seek to gain better footing in the asian market . the deutz company , which manufactures diesel engines for trucks and construction equipment , just entered into a joint venture with faw , the biggest vehicle and car manufacturer in china . " so far , we produce only in germany and spain , " said andrea bleesen of the deutz company .
" we have to follow our customers in this market as china grows and grows .

" while the majority of those deutz engines will be be sold within china , around 20 percent may be sold world-wide and will have to fulfill quality and emissions standands of the appropriate countries . but bleesen is not worried about possible infringements on quality . " it 's deutz technology and we will maintain german quality , even in china , " she said . vogt of ihk agreed . " german companies which produce in china normally use the same standards they have in germany because some of the products have to come back to european markets , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daimlerchrysler factory in beijing vogt pointed out that many german companies , like mail-order firms , do not actually produce themselves .

but while german companies are also broadening production on the asian giant 's market , product safety concerns abound . germany is known for its high-quality , precision products , and as the world 's export leader , it relies on that image to sell its technology and other goods . so respected is german expertise , for instance , that some can not keep from copying it .
during her visit to the china this week , german chancellor angela merkel criticized chinese copies of german cars slated for display at the frankfurt auto show in september .
but , possible product piracy is one issue ; quality control of german products made in china is another . " among european countries , german companies are certainly among the leaders in producing in china , " said victor vogt of the cologne chamber of commerce and industry -lrb- ihk -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " fake " product market in nanjing of around five million registered german companies , around 3,000 produce or are represented in china , vogt said . checking products yet the " made in china " label has taken serious beating due to safety concerns among products ranging from food to toothpaste to tires .
with american toymaker mattel in recent weeks having to recall up to 18 million toys made in china , the issue has grabbed even more attention among the public . " because of mattel 's massive recall , our work has become more important than ever , " said a press release of the hong kong branch of the cologne-based tüv rheinland . the company claims to be the world leader in product quality testing and examines everything from skin cream to hotels and cruise ships .
it examines over 100,000 products a year in 60 different countries , but its main markets are the united states and europe . toys make up about 15-20 percent of the products the group tests . " in mattel 's case , there seems to have been a problem in quality management , " said hartmut müller-gerbes of the cologne headquarters of tüv rheinland . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " polly pocket " - the mattel doll that started it all china , for its part , has defended the quality of its exports .
it has blamed faults in us designs - and not chinese workmanship - for the mattel recalls and also pointed to varying global product standards . that 's where tüv comes in . müller-gerbes said companies can pay a fee -lrb- 3,000 euros , or $ 4,000 , is a base price -rrb- to have their products tested by tüv in the hopes of gaining a " seal of quality . "
the tüv standards are often far higher than those required by law , but can give companies an edge in the market . furthermore , tüv is informed about the product safety regulations in specific countries . " some german discounters like aldi and lidl force their production companies in china to go to the tüv branch there to be informed before they even begin production of toys , for instance , for the german market , " müller-gerbes said . he stressed that with mattel 's dolls , cars and action figures - which were recalled because they contained lead paint , or tiny magnets that are harmful if swallowed - it was not standards which were too low .
the problem was faulty production . however , he also said that there are far too many products which go to market without being inspected at all . further expansion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china 's sweat shops are infamous but rather than questioning goods production in china , more and more german companies are producing there to save money , especially in labor costs . also , they seek to gain better footing in the asian market . the deutz company , which manufactures diesel engines for trucks and construction equipment , just entered into a joint venture with faw , the biggest vehicle and car manufacturer in china . " so far , we produce only in germany and spain , " said andrea bleesen of the deutz company .
" we have to follow our customers in this market as china grows and grows .
they say they need equipment adjusted for local needs , so rather than manufacture here in europe , it makes sense to produce in asia since it will also save us in transportation costs . " while the majority of those deutz engines will be be sold within china , around 20 percent may be sold world-wide and will have to fulfill quality and emissions standands of the appropriate countries . but bleesen is not worried about possible infringements on quality . " it 's deutz technology and we will maintain german quality , even in china , " she said . vogt of ihk agreed . " german companies which produce in china normally use the same standards they have in germany because some of the products have to come back to european markets , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daimlerchrysler factory in beijing vogt pointed out that many german companies , like mail-order firms , do not actually produce themselves .
instead , they outsource to chinese producers . " but they must ensure that the products undergo quality checks before they leave china , " he said .
" however , you can never guarantee that production quality is one hundert percent because only a random sample of products is tested - say , one hundred items of millions produced . " a shift in mentality whether its technology or toys , " the world public has become more aware of product safety issues due to the mattel scandal , " said müller-gerbes . he said the task now at hand is to ensure that more inspections are conducted and safety laws enforced , regardless of the country .
he also indicated that a seal of quality is becoming increasingly important due to the sheer number of products on the market . " in the toy market , at least , quality seals can help parents weed out the bad apples and narrow down their choices , " müller-gerbes said . finally , consumers must shift their own habits of going after the cheapest price rather than the better quality , he said . louisa schaefer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

children from underprivileged families are more likely to be exposed to pollutants than their higher-income counterparts . germany 's children are being exposed to a wide range of harmful pollutants , according to a nationwide study by the federal environment agency uba . uba 's president andreas troge said all of those children surveyed showed concentrations of organochloride substances , including the poisonous pesticide ddt .
although substances such as ddt have been banned for decades , they are still stored in people 's fat tissue and are thought to be passed on to children when they are nursed . in addition , troge said it was " alarming " that softening agents for plastics were detectable in all of the children 's urine . " there are certain substances which we are truly worried about , " troge said at the study 's presentation in berlin on tuesday .
he said it was unclear how they could enter the human body .
but it was assumed that these were not due to small children 's plastic toys .
rather food packaging could be responsible , he said , such as the seals on twist-off lids or foils which have direct contact to fatty foods . the child environment survey examined 1,790 children between the ages of three and 14 from 2003 to 2006 .
it is the first representative study available on german children 's exposure to harmful substances , uba said . smoking is the homemade danger bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smoking continues to be the number one pollutant for children the major pollutant indoors continued to be tobacco smoke , troge said .
about half of those children surveyed were exposed to smoke in the home . there had been a noticeable change for the worse in germany 's eastern states , the report showed .
mothers in eastern germany were increasingly smoking , and therefore increasingly exposing their children to smoke .
this led to more frequent inflammation of the middle ear as well as susceptibility to other infections , the survey said . " we can only appeal to parents ' particular responsibility here , " troge said . social class also played a role .
those children from lower class families were more exposed to second-hand smoke than those from higher-income groups . noise pollution disturbs many children troge said it was also striking that 14 percent of the children surveyed showed hearing loss .
six percent felt disturbed by street and aircraft noise . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the health hazards of traffic are often underestimated " traffic is a dominating source of noise and we ca n't underestimate its negative effects , " troge said .
" noise affects our entire organism and promotes sleep , concentration and metabolic disorders , as well as high blood pressure and heart disease . " the underprivileged were more affected by noise pollution than high-income families , he said .
this was due to the fact that people with lower incomes more often lived in inexpensive but unattractive areas , for example along busy roads .
this also led to higher lead contents in the blood of children from lower-income families . environment minister sigmar gabriel , who also attended the study 's presentation , called on local authorities to introduce anti-noise policies not only for the rich , but also for those less well-off .
gabriel said it was a question of " ecological justice . " fruit juice contained more pesticides troge said it was surprising that the exposure of children to harmful molds was growing .
eight percent of those children surveyed showed high sensitivity to indoor mold , which can cause allergies or respiratory illnesses . according to uba , this development could be traced back to the increased spread of such molds indoors , which had to do with poor ventilation in better insulated homes . children from higher-income families , however , also showed traces of harmful substances , for example organophosphate pesticides .
troge said he assumed this could be traced to fruit juices , which they 're more likely to drink . but troge said there were also positive results in the study .

keyboard movements and password entry could also be monitored . cologne 's stadt-anzeiger -lrb- ksta -rrb- and the national tageszeitung -lrb- taz -rrb- newspapers reported wednesday that germany 's interior ministry wants to employ fake e-mails to allow agents to search private computers . according to a 22-page paper from the interior ministry -lrb- a copy of which ksta obtained -rrb- , the plan would involve sending e-mails attached with trojan horse malware to suspected terrorists .
the paper said that " sending e-mails under the names of other government authorities " could be employed in justified , exceptional cases . the interior ministry distinguished between two types of searches : a one-time " perusal " of a computer , or long-term " surveillance . " tiny bits of information bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spying software has to be " customized " the spying software would install itself onto a private computer and search for particular data , which would then be sent to criminal police computers as soon as the user goes online .
only minimal data would be transmitted so as not to arouse the user 's suspicion . also , entries made onto keyboards could be monitored , which would allow agents to track passwords used to call up information on external servers . tageszeitung reported that the spying software could slip past anti-virus programs and firewalls used on private computers . tagesschau.de , the online portal of germany 's ard broadcaster , reported that in the 22-page paper , the interior ministry answered questions posed by the justice ministry about searching computers linked to the internet . apparently , the paper was intended as a basis for a technical discussion on friday between experts from germany 's ruling coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- . warnings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bka agent at anti-terror center in berlin the justice ministry has warned the interior ministry against implementing such a plan .
according to tagesschau.de , the justice ministry said that " manipulating mails from german government agencies could put general correspondence from those institutions at risk . " jörg ziercke , the president of the federal criminal police office -lrb- bka -rrb- , has downplayed concerns about internet monitoring .
he said that the debate was intended to " instill fear " among the public .
he told german weekly magazine stern that such " online monitoring " of terrorist suspects would only involve five to ten cases a year .
more , he said , would not be possible because the efforts involved in surveillance of one suspect were intense as " software must be customized for each case . " german interior minister wolfgang schäuble , who is a member of the conservative cdu , has pressed for new laws to combat terrorism .
politicians are set to discuss legal questions surrounding such proposals this friday .
the center-left spd has meanwhile voiced criticism of schäuble 's e-mail-trojan surveillance plan . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 29.08.2007 german foreign minister warns against exploiting arctic großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier -lrb- right -rrb- took in the dramatic effect of global warming german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier has cautioned against countries breaking the law in attempts to reap the arctic 's natural energy resources .
the warning comes shortly after russia laid claims to the area . " i very much believe that everybody should respect international law , " steinmeier said while visiting a research station at ny alesund on spitzbergen , a norwegian island in the arctic ocean .
" the north pole is not a law-free zone ; there are international accords which must be respected by all nations who have interests here .
if everybody sticks to the rules , there will be no conflict . " steinmeier was referring to russia .
earlier this month , members of a russian submarine expedition planted a flag beneath the north pole , thereby allowing moscow to reassert that the seabed is an extension of its own land mass . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ny alesund polar research base in spitzbergen " spectacular exploits mean very little , " said steinmeier , who was accompanied by his norwegian counterpart , jonas gahr stoere . the arctic sea has become both a vulnerable and contested place .
scientists believe the sea bed contains massive oil and gas reserves , which could become easier to access as global warming causes the north pole 's ice caps to melt . " dramatic " effects on wednesday , steinmeier told german broadcaster zdf that the effects of global warming which he was witnessing in the arctic sea were " dramatic . " he had observed how the glaciers on spitzbergen were melting and said the island should serve as an " early warning " of the consequences of climate change . the foreign minister warned that the phenomenon would trigger territorial conflicts as the race for the arctic 's resources gets underway .
he said , however , that nations had an obligation to protect " nature 's treasures . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a russian flag , but is it a russian north pole ?
russia 's august expedition has prompted various sovereignty claims to arctic territory by other countries - including denmark , canada and the united states - to grow louder . steinmeier , for his part , has been visiting spitzbergen as part of a fact-finding trip on climate change and clean energy . on wednesday , he will travel to the us state of california with the aim of strengthening trans-atlantic ties to combat climate change .
steinmeier is due to meet with california 's governor , arnold schwarzennegger , who has set landmark goals for reducing greenhouse gases partially blamed for global warming . the german environmentalist green party has criticized steinmeier 's trip to the north , claiming that the foreign minister is trying to woo norwegian gas suppliers . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de asia -pipe- 29.08.2007 german firms expand in china amid product safety worries großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china 's nanjing automobile now produces mg model sports cars german chancellor angela merkel is seeking better business ties with china while on tour there .
but while german companies are also broadening production on the asian giant 's market , product safety concerns abound . germany is known for its high-quality , precision products , and as the world 's export leader , it relies on that image to sell its technology and other goods . so respected is german expertise , for instance , that some can not keep from copying it .
during her visit to the china this week , german chancellor angela merkel criticized chinese copies of german cars slated for display at the frankfurt auto show in september .
but , possible product piracy is one issue ; quality control of german products made in china is another . " among european countries , german companies are certainly among the leaders in producing in china , " said victor vogt of the cologne chamber of commerce and industry -lrb- ihk -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " fake " product market in nanjing of around five million registered german companies , around 3,000 produce or are represented in china , vogt said . checking products yet the " made in china " label has taken serious beating due to safety concerns among products ranging from food to toothpaste to tires .
with american toymaker mattel in recent weeks having to recall up to 18 million toys made in china , the issue has grabbed even more attention among the public . " because of mattel 's massive recall , our work has become more important than ever , " said a press release of the hong kong branch of the cologne-based tüv rheinland . the company claims to be the world leader in product quality testing and examines everything from skin cream to hotels and cruise ships .
it examines over 100,000 products a year in 60 different countries , but its main markets are the united states and europe . toys make up about 15-20 percent of the products the group tests . " in mattel 's case , there seems to have been a problem in quality management , " said hartmut müller-gerbes of the cologne headquarters of tüv rheinland . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " polly pocket " - the mattel doll that started it all china , for its part , has defended the quality of its exports .
it has blamed faults in us designs - and not chinese workmanship - for the mattel recalls and also pointed to varying global product standards . that 's where tüv comes in . müller-gerbes said companies can pay a fee -lrb- 3,000 euros , or $ 4,000 , is a base price -rrb- to have their products tested by tüv in the hopes of gaining a " seal of quality . "
the tüv standards are often far higher than those required by law , but can give companies an edge in the market . furthermore , tüv is informed about the product safety regulations in specific countries . " some german discounters like aldi and lidl force their production companies in china to go to the tüv branch there to be informed before they even begin production of toys , for instance , for the german market , " müller-gerbes said . he stressed that with mattel 's dolls , cars and action figures - which were recalled because they contained lead paint , or tiny magnets that are harmful if swallowed - it was not standards which were too low .
the problem was faulty production . however , he also said that there are far too many products which go to market without being inspected at all . further expansion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china 's sweat shops are infamous but rather than questioning goods production in china , more and more german companies are producing there to save money , especially in labor costs . also , they seek to gain better footing in the asian market . the deutz company , which manufactures diesel engines for trucks and construction equipment , just entered into a joint venture with faw , the biggest vehicle and car manufacturer in china . " so far , we produce only in germany and spain , " said andrea bleesen of the deutz company .
" we have to follow our customers in this market as china grows and grows .
they say they need equipment adjusted for local needs , so rather than manufacture here in europe , it makes sense to produce in asia since it will also save us in transportation costs . " while the majority of those deutz engines will be be sold within china , around 20 percent may be sold world-wide and will have to fulfill quality and emissions standands of the appropriate countries . but bleesen is not worried about possible infringements on quality . " it 's deutz technology and we will maintain german quality , even in china , " she said . vogt of ihk agreed . " german companies which produce in china normally use the same standards they have in germany because some of the products have to come back to european markets , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daimlerchrysler factory in beijing vogt pointed out that many german companies , like mail-order firms , do not actually produce themselves .
instead , they outsource to chinese producers . " but they must ensure that the products undergo quality checks before they leave china , " he said .
" however , you can never guarantee that production quality is one hundert percent because only a random sample of products is tested - say , one hundred items of millions produced . " a shift in mentality whether its technology or toys , " the world public has become more aware of product safety issues due to the mattel scandal , " said müller-gerbes . he said the task now at hand is to ensure that more inspections are conducted and safety laws enforced , regardless of the country .
he also indicated that a seal of quality is becoming increasingly important due to the sheer number of products on the market . " in the toy market , at least , quality seals can help parents weed out the bad apples and narrow down their choices , " müller-gerbes said . finally , consumers must shift their own habits of going after the cheapest price rather than the better quality , he said . louisa schaefer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

its 90 percent albanian majority are demanding independence , a move flatly rejected by serbia , who says it can only offer broad autonomy . " from my responsibility as kfor commander , we need the decision on the final status of kosovo as soon as possible , " kather told a farewell news conference .

but while german companies are also broadening production on the asian giant 's market , product safety concerns abound . germany is known for its high-quality , precision products , and as the world 's export leader , it relies on that image to sell its technology and other goods . so respected is german expertise , for instance , that some can not keep from copying it .
during her visit to the china this week , german chancellor angela merkel criticized chinese copies of german cars slated for display at the frankfurt auto show in september .
but , possible product piracy is one issue ; quality control of german products made in china is another . " among european countries , german companies are certainly among the leaders in producing in china , " said victor vogt of the cologne chamber of commerce and industry -lrb- ihk -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " fake " product market in nanjing of around five million registered german companies , around 3,000 produce or are represented in china , vogt said . checking products yet the " made in china " label has taken serious beating due to safety concerns among products ranging from food to toothpaste to tires .
with american toymaker mattel in recent weeks having to recall up to 18 million toys made in china , the issue has grabbed even more attention among the public . " because of mattel 's massive recall , our work has become more important than ever , " said a press release of the hong kong branch of the cologne-based tüv rheinland . the company claims to be the world leader in product quality testing and examines everything from skin cream to hotels and cruise ships .
it examines over 100,000 products a year in 60 different countries , but its main markets are the united states and europe . toys make up about 15-20 percent of the products the group tests . " in mattel 's case , there seems to have been a problem in quality management , " said hartmut müller-gerbes of the cologne headquarters of tüv rheinland . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " polly pocket " - the mattel doll that started it all china , for its part , has defended the quality of its exports .
it has blamed faults in us designs - and not chinese workmanship - for the mattel recalls and also pointed to varying global product standards . that 's where tüv comes in . müller-gerbes said companies can pay a fee -lrb- 3,000 euros , or $ 4,000 , is a base price -rrb- to have their products tested by tüv in the hopes of gaining a " seal of quality . "
the tüv standards are often far higher than those required by law , but can give companies an edge in the market . furthermore , tüv is informed about the product safety regulations in specific countries . " some german discounters like aldi and lidl force their production companies in china to go to the tüv branch there to be informed before they even begin production of toys , for instance , for the german market , " müller-gerbes said . he stressed that with mattel 's dolls , cars and action figures - which were recalled because they contained lead paint , or tiny magnets that are harmful if swallowed - it was not standards which were too low .
the problem was faulty production . however , he also said that there are far too many products which go to market without being inspected at all . further expansion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china 's sweat shops are infamous but rather than questioning goods production in china , more and more german companies are producing there to save money , especially in labor costs . also , they seek to gain better footing in the asian market . the deutz company , which manufactures diesel engines for trucks and construction equipment , just entered into a joint venture with faw , the biggest vehicle and car manufacturer in china . " so far , we produce only in germany and spain , " said andrea bleesen of the deutz company .
" we have to follow our customers in this market as china grows and grows .
they say they need equipment adjusted for local needs , so rather than manufacture here in europe , it makes sense to produce in asia since it will also save us in transportation costs . " while the majority of those deutz engines will be be sold within china , around 20 percent may be sold world-wide and will have to fulfill quality and emissions standands of the appropriate countries . but bleesen is not worried about possible infringements on quality . " it 's deutz technology and we will maintain german quality , even in china , " she said . vogt of ihk agreed . " german companies which produce in china normally use the same standards they have in germany because some of the products have to come back to european markets , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daimlerchrysler factory in beijing vogt pointed out that many german companies , like mail-order firms , do not actually produce themselves .
instead , they outsource to chinese producers . " but they must ensure that the products undergo quality checks before they leave china , " he said .
" however , you can never guarantee that production quality is one hundert percent because only a random sample of products is tested - say , one hundred items of millions produced . " a shift in mentality whether its technology or toys , " the world public has become more aware of product safety issues due to the mattel scandal , " said müller-gerbes . he said the task now at hand is to ensure that more inspections are conducted and safety laws enforced , regardless of the country .
he also indicated that a seal of quality is becoming increasingly important due to the sheer number of products on the market . " in the toy market , at least , quality seals can help parents weed out the bad apples and narrow down their choices , " müller-gerbes said . finally , consumers must shift their own habits of going after the cheapest price rather than the better quality , he said . louisa schaefer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the next day , jung travels to macedonia and albania . on friday , jung visits to kosovo where he meets with president fatmir sejdiu .
there , he is also to attend the formal handing over from german to french command of the approximately 16,000-strong nato kosovo force -lrb- kfor -rrb- peacekeeping contingent . growing tension bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is just one of 34 countries whose troops are under kfor command on the eve of jung 's departure , the outgoing german commander in kosovo , lieutenant-general roland kather , warned of " increased nervousness " in the province and called for a swift decision on kosovo 's status . although kosovo is still officially part of serbia , the province has been administered by the united nations since 1999 .
its 90 percent albanian majority are demanding independence , a move flatly rejected by serbia , who says it can only offer broad autonomy . " from my responsibility as kfor commander , we need the decision on the final status of kosovo as soon as possible , " kather told a farewell news conference .
" we need it because everybody is waiting .
we need it to come up with economic development , and by that , at the same time to provide for security . " new round of kosovo talks meanwhile , negotiators from serbia and kosovo return to vienna on thursday to meet envoys from the troika of the united states , european union and russia in the latest bid for a deal on the fate of kosovo . the new round of talks was called after russia rejected a un draft resolution granting kosovo independence under eu supervision .

the eu should push ahead to implement his plan as soon as the troika reports back . " it is high time to move from the conflict-management phase to the endgame , " he told a forum in bled , slovenia . " otherwise the stalemate will persist , but the eu can not afford kosovo to become just another frozen conflict , " the former finnish president said .
" doing nothing is not an option . " on monday , kosovo prime minister agim ceku said he expects kosovo to declare independence and seek recognition from its western backers right after talks with serbia close on dec .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 29.08.2007 german foreign minister warns against exploiting arctic großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier -lrb- right -rrb- took in the dramatic effect of global warming german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier has cautioned against countries breaking the law in attempts to reap the arctic 's natural energy resources .
the warning comes shortly after russia laid claims to the area . " i very much believe that everybody should respect international law , " steinmeier said while visiting a research station at ny alesund on spitzbergen , a norwegian island in the arctic ocean .
" the north pole is not a law-free zone ; there are international accords which must be respected by all nations who have interests here .
if everybody sticks to the rules , there will be no conflict . " steinmeier was referring to russia .
earlier this month , members of a russian submarine expedition planted a flag beneath the north pole , thereby allowing moscow to reassert that the seabed is an extension of its own land mass . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ny alesund polar research base in spitzbergen " spectacular exploits mean very little , " said steinmeier , who was accompanied by his norwegian counterpart , jonas gahr stoere . the arctic sea has become both a vulnerable and contested place .
scientists believe the sea bed contains massive oil and gas reserves , which could become easier to access as global warming causes the north pole 's ice caps to melt . " dramatic " effects on wednesday , steinmeier told german broadcaster zdf that the effects of global warming which he was witnessing in the arctic sea were " dramatic . " he had observed how the glaciers on spitzbergen were melting and said the island should serve as an " early warning " of the consequences of climate change . the foreign minister warned that the phenomenon would trigger territorial conflicts as the race for the arctic 's resources gets underway .
he said , however , that nations had an obligation to protect " nature 's treasures . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a russian flag , but is it a russian north pole ?
russia 's august expedition has prompted various sovereignty claims to arctic territory by other countries - including denmark , canada and the united states - to grow louder . steinmeier , for his part , has been visiting spitzbergen as part of a fact-finding trip on climate change and clean energy . on wednesday , he will travel to the us state of california with the aim of strengthening trans-atlantic ties to combat climate change .
steinmeier is due to meet with california 's governor , arnold schwarzennegger , who has set landmark goals for reducing greenhouse gases partially blamed for global warming . the german environmentalist green party has criticized steinmeier 's trip to the north , claiming that the foreign minister is trying to woo norwegian gas suppliers . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but while german companies are also broadening production on the asian giant 's market , product safety concerns abound . germany is known for its high-quality , precision products , and as the world 's export leader , it relies on that image to sell its technology and other goods . so respected is german expertise , for instance , that some can not keep from copying it .
during her visit to the china this week , german chancellor angela merkel criticized chinese copies of german cars slated for display at the frankfurt auto show in september .
but , possible product piracy is one issue ; quality control of german products made in china is another .

with american toymaker mattel in recent weeks having to recall up to 18 million toys made in china , the issue has grabbed even more attention among the public . " because of mattel 's massive recall , our work has become more important than ever , " said a press release of the hong kong branch of the cologne-based tüv rheinland . the company claims to be the world leader in product quality testing and examines everything from skin cream to hotels and cruise ships .

" we have to follow our customers in this market as china grows and grows .

the next day , jung travels to macedonia and albania . on friday , jung visits to kosovo where he meets with president fatmir sejdiu .
there , he is also to attend the formal handing over from german to french command of the approximately 16,000-strong nato kosovo force -lrb- kfor -rrb- peacekeeping contingent . growing tension bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is just one of 34 countries whose troops are under kfor command on the eve of jung 's departure , the outgoing german commander in kosovo , lieutenant-general roland kather , warned of " increased nervousness " in the province and called for a swift decision on kosovo 's status . although kosovo is still officially part of serbia , the province has been administered by the united nations since 1999 .
its 90 percent albanian majority are demanding independence , a move flatly rejected by serbia , who says it can only offer broad autonomy . " from my responsibility as kfor commander , we need the decision on the final status of kosovo as soon as possible , " kather told a farewell news conference .
" we need it because everybody is waiting .
we need it to come up with economic development , and by that , at the same time to provide for security . " new round of kosovo talks meanwhile , negotiators from serbia and kosovo return to vienna on thursday to meet envoys from the troika of the united states , european union and russia in the latest bid for a deal on the fate of kosovo . the new round of talks was called after russia rejected a un draft resolution granting kosovo independence under eu supervision .
the plan was prepared by un special envoy martti ahtisaari following 13 months of negotiations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an albanian man in kosovo stands near a graffiti , reading " self-determination " at the beginning of the week , ahtisaari said chances of a serb-albanian deal were nil .
the eu should push ahead to implement his plan as soon as the troika reports back . " it is high time to move from the conflict-management phase to the endgame , " he told a forum in bled , slovenia . " otherwise the stalemate will persist , but the eu can not afford kosovo to become just another frozen conflict , " the former finnish president said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de asia -pipe- 29.08.2007 german firms expand in china amid product safety worries großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china 's nanjing automobile now produces mg model sports cars german chancellor angela merkel is seeking better business ties with china while on tour there .
but while german companies are also broadening production on the asian giant 's market , product safety concerns abound . germany is known for its high-quality , precision products , and as the world 's export leader , it relies on that image to sell its technology and other goods . so respected is german expertise , for instance , that some can not keep from copying it .
during her visit to the china this week , german chancellor angela merkel criticized chinese copies of german cars slated for display at the frankfurt auto show in september .
but , possible product piracy is one issue ; quality control of german products made in china is another . " among european countries , german companies are certainly among the leaders in producing in china , " said victor vogt of the cologne chamber of commerce and industry -lrb- ihk -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " fake " product market in nanjing of around five million registered german companies , around 3,000 produce or are represented in china , vogt said . checking products yet the " made in china " label has taken serious beating due to safety concerns among products ranging from food to toothpaste to tires .
with american toymaker mattel in recent weeks having to recall up to 18 million toys made in china , the issue has grabbed even more attention among the public . " because of mattel 's massive recall , our work has become more important than ever , " said a press release of the hong kong branch of the cologne-based tüv rheinland . the company claims to be the world leader in product quality testing and examines everything from skin cream to hotels and cruise ships .
it examines over 100,000 products a year in 60 different countries , but its main markets are the united states and europe . toys make up about 15-20 percent of the products the group tests . " in mattel 's case , there seems to have been a problem in quality management , " said hartmut müller-gerbes of the cologne headquarters of tüv rheinland . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " polly pocket " - the mattel doll that started it all china , for its part , has defended the quality of its exports .
it has blamed faults in us designs - and not chinese workmanship - for the mattel recalls and also pointed to varying global product standards . that 's where tüv comes in . müller-gerbes said companies can pay a fee -lrb- 3,000 euros , or $ 4,000 , is a base price -rrb- to have their products tested by tüv in the hopes of gaining a " seal of quality . "
the tüv standards are often far higher than those required by law , but can give companies an edge in the market . furthermore , tüv is informed about the product safety regulations in specific countries . " some german discounters like aldi and lidl force their production companies in china to go to the tüv branch there to be informed before they even begin production of toys , for instance , for the german market , " müller-gerbes said . he stressed that with mattel 's dolls , cars and action figures - which were recalled because they contained lead paint , or tiny magnets that are harmful if swallowed - it was not standards which were too low .
the problem was faulty production . however , he also said that there are far too many products which go to market without being inspected at all . further expansion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china 's sweat shops are infamous but rather than questioning goods production in china , more and more german companies are producing there to save money , especially in labor costs . also , they seek to gain better footing in the asian market . the deutz company , which manufactures diesel engines for trucks and construction equipment , just entered into a joint venture with faw , the biggest vehicle and car manufacturer in china . " so far , we produce only in germany and spain , " said andrea bleesen of the deutz company .
" we have to follow our customers in this market as china grows and grows .
they say they need equipment adjusted for local needs , so rather than manufacture here in europe , it makes sense to produce in asia since it will also save us in transportation costs . " while the majority of those deutz engines will be be sold within china , around 20 percent may be sold world-wide and will have to fulfill quality and emissions standands of the appropriate countries . but bleesen is not worried about possible infringements on quality . " it 's deutz technology and we will maintain german quality , even in china , " she said . vogt of ihk agreed . " german companies which produce in china normally use the same standards they have in germany because some of the products have to come back to european markets , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daimlerchrysler factory in beijing vogt pointed out that many german companies , like mail-order firms , do not actually produce themselves .
instead , they outsource to chinese producers . " but they must ensure that the products undergo quality checks before they leave china , " he said .
" however , you can never guarantee that production quality is one hundert percent because only a random sample of products is tested - say , one hundred items of millions produced . " a shift in mentality whether its technology or toys , " the world public has become more aware of product safety issues due to the mattel scandal , " said müller-gerbes . he said the task now at hand is to ensure that more inspections are conducted and safety laws enforced , regardless of the country .
he also indicated that a seal of quality is becoming increasingly important due to the sheer number of products on the market . " in the toy market , at least , quality seals can help parents weed out the bad apples and narrow down their choices , " müller-gerbes said . finally , consumers must shift their own habits of going after the cheapest price rather than the better quality , he said . louisa schaefer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the warning comes shortly after russia laid claims to the area . " i very much believe that everybody should respect international law , " steinmeier said while visiting a research station at ny alesund on spitzbergen , a norwegian island in the arctic ocean .
" the north pole is not a law-free zone ; there are international accords which must be respected by all nations who have interests here .
if everybody sticks to the rules , there will be no conflict . " steinmeier was referring to russia .
earlier this month , members of a russian submarine expedition planted a flag beneath the north pole , thereby allowing moscow to reassert that the seabed is an extension of its own land mass . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ny alesund polar research base in spitzbergen " spectacular exploits mean very little , " said steinmeier , who was accompanied by his norwegian counterpart , jonas gahr stoere . the arctic sea has become both a vulnerable and contested place .
scientists believe the sea bed contains massive oil and gas reserves , which could become easier to access as global warming causes the north pole 's ice caps to melt . " dramatic " effects on wednesday , steinmeier told german broadcaster zdf that the effects of global warming which he was witnessing in the arctic sea were " dramatic . " he had observed how the glaciers on spitzbergen were melting and said the island should serve as an " early warning " of the consequences of climate change . the foreign minister warned that the phenomenon would trigger territorial conflicts as the race for the arctic 's resources gets underway .
he said , however , that nations had an obligation to protect " nature 's treasures . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a russian flag , but is it a russian north pole ?
russia 's august expedition has prompted various sovereignty claims to arctic territory by other countries - including denmark , canada and the united states - to grow louder . steinmeier , for his part , has been visiting spitzbergen as part of a fact-finding trip on climate change and clean energy . on wednesday , he will travel to the us state of california with the aim of strengthening trans-atlantic ties to combat climate change .
steinmeier is due to meet with california 's governor , arnold schwarzennegger , who has set landmark goals for reducing greenhouse gases partially blamed for global warming . the german environmentalist green party has criticized steinmeier 's trip to the north , claiming that the foreign minister is trying to woo norwegian gas suppliers . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" he had observed how the glaciers on spitzbergen were melting and said the island should serve as an " early warning " of the consequences of climate change . the foreign minister warned that the phenomenon would trigger territorial conflicts as the race for the arctic 's resources gets underway .
he said , however , that nations had an obligation to protect " nature 's treasures . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a russian flag , but is it a russian north pole ?
russia 's august expedition has prompted various sovereignty claims to arctic territory by other countries - including denmark , canada and the united states - to grow louder . steinmeier , for his part , has been visiting spitzbergen as part of a fact-finding trip on climate change and clean energy . on wednesday , he will travel to the us state of california with the aim of strengthening trans-atlantic ties to combat climate change .
steinmeier is due to meet with california 's governor , arnold schwarzennegger , who has set landmark goals for reducing greenhouse gases partially blamed for global warming . the german environmentalist green party has criticized steinmeier 's trip to the north , claiming that the foreign minister is trying to woo norwegian gas suppliers . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

children from underprivileged families are more likely to be exposed to pollutants than their higher-income counterparts . germany 's children are being exposed to a wide range of harmful pollutants , according to a nationwide study by the federal environment agency uba . uba 's president andreas troge said all of those children surveyed showed concentrations of organochloride substances , including the poisonous pesticide ddt .
although substances such as ddt have been banned for decades , they are still stored in people 's fat tissue and are thought to be passed on to children when they are nursed . in addition , troge said it was " alarming " that softening agents for plastics were detectable in all of the children 's urine . " there are certain substances which we are truly worried about , " troge said at the study 's presentation in berlin on tuesday .
he said it was unclear how they could enter the human body .
but it was assumed that these were not due to small children 's plastic toys .
rather food packaging could be responsible , he said , such as the seals on twist-off lids or foils which have direct contact to fatty foods . the child environment survey examined 1,790 children between the ages of three and 14 from 2003 to 2006 .
it is the first representative study available on german children 's exposure to harmful substances , uba said . smoking is the homemade danger bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smoking continues to be the number one pollutant for children the major pollutant indoors continued to be tobacco smoke , troge said .
about half of those children surveyed were exposed to smoke in the home . there had been a noticeable change for the worse in germany 's eastern states , the report showed .
mothers in eastern germany were increasingly smoking , and therefore increasingly exposing their children to smoke .
this led to more frequent inflammation of the middle ear as well as susceptibility to other infections , the survey said . " we can only appeal to parents ' particular responsibility here , " troge said . social class also played a role .
those children from lower class families were more exposed to second-hand smoke than those from higher-income groups . noise pollution disturbs many children troge said it was also striking that 14 percent of the children surveyed showed hearing loss .
six percent felt disturbed by street and aircraft noise . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the health hazards of traffic are often underestimated " traffic is a dominating source of noise and we ca n't underestimate its negative effects , " troge said .
" noise affects our entire organism and promotes sleep , concentration and metabolic disorders , as well as high blood pressure and heart disease . " the underprivileged were more affected by noise pollution than high-income families , he said .
this was due to the fact that people with lower incomes more often lived in inexpensive but unattractive areas , for example along busy roads .
this also led to higher lead contents in the blood of children from lower-income families . environment minister sigmar gabriel , who also attended the study 's presentation , called on local authorities to introduce anti-noise policies not only for the rich , but also for those less well-off .
gabriel said it was a question of " ecological justice . " fruit juice contained more pesticides troge said it was surprising that the exposure of children to harmful molds was growing .
eight percent of those children surveyed showed high sensitivity to indoor mold , which can cause allergies or respiratory illnesses . according to uba , this development could be traced back to the increased spread of such molds indoors , which had to do with poor ventilation in better insulated homes . children from higher-income families , however , also showed traces of harmful substances , for example organophosphate pesticides .
troge said he assumed this could be traced to fruit juices , which they 're more likely to drink . but troge said there were also positive results in the study .

children from underprivileged families are more likely to be exposed to pollutants than their higher-income counterparts . germany 's children are being exposed to a wide range of harmful pollutants , according to a nationwide study by the federal environment agency uba . uba 's president andreas troge said all of those children surveyed showed concentrations of organochloride substances , including the poisonous pesticide ddt .
although substances such as ddt have been banned for decades , they are still stored in people 's fat tissue and are thought to be passed on to children when they are nursed . in addition , troge said it was " alarming " that softening agents for plastics were detectable in all of the children 's urine . " there are certain substances which we are truly worried about , " troge said at the study 's presentation in berlin on tuesday .
he said it was unclear how they could enter the human body .
but it was assumed that these were not due to small children 's plastic toys .
rather food packaging could be responsible , he said , such as the seals on twist-off lids or foils which have direct contact to fatty foods . the child environment survey examined 1,790 children between the ages of three and 14 from 2003 to 2006 .
it is the first representative study available on german children 's exposure to harmful substances , uba said . smoking is the homemade danger bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smoking continues to be the number one pollutant for children the major pollutant indoors continued to be tobacco smoke , troge said .
about half of those children surveyed were exposed to smoke in the home . there had been a noticeable change for the worse in germany 's eastern states , the report showed .
mothers in eastern germany were increasingly smoking , and therefore increasingly exposing their children to smoke .
this led to more frequent inflammation of the middle ear as well as susceptibility to other infections , the survey said . " we can only appeal to parents ' particular responsibility here , " troge said . social class also played a role .
those children from lower class families were more exposed to second-hand smoke than those from higher-income groups . noise pollution disturbs many children troge said it was also striking that 14 percent of the children surveyed showed hearing loss .
six percent felt disturbed by street and aircraft noise . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the health hazards of traffic are often underestimated " traffic is a dominating source of noise and we ca n't underestimate its negative effects , " troge said .
" noise affects our entire organism and promotes sleep , concentration and metabolic disorders , as well as high blood pressure and heart disease . " the underprivileged were more affected by noise pollution than high-income families , he said .
this was due to the fact that people with lower incomes more often lived in inexpensive but unattractive areas , for example along busy roads .
this also led to higher lead contents in the blood of children from lower-income families . environment minister sigmar gabriel , who also attended the study 's presentation , called on local authorities to introduce anti-noise policies not only for the rich , but also for those less well-off .
gabriel said it was a question of " ecological justice . " fruit juice contained more pesticides troge said it was surprising that the exposure of children to harmful molds was growing .
eight percent of those children surveyed showed high sensitivity to indoor mold , which can cause allergies or respiratory illnesses . according to uba , this development could be traced back to the increased spread of such molds indoors , which had to do with poor ventilation in better insulated homes . children from higher-income families , however , also showed traces of harmful substances , for example organophosphate pesticides .
troge said he assumed this could be traced to fruit juices , which they 're more likely to drink . but troge said there were also positive results in the study .
children were less exposed to heavy metals , the wood preservative pentachlorophenol -lrb- pcp -rrb- or polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons than was the case at the beginning of the 1990s . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

keyboard movements and password entry could also be monitored . cologne 's stadt-anzeiger -lrb- ksta -rrb- and the national tageszeitung -lrb- taz -rrb- newspapers reported wednesday that germany 's interior ministry wants to employ fake e-mails to allow agents to search private computers . according to a 22-page paper from the interior ministry -lrb- a copy of which ksta obtained -rrb- , the plan would involve sending e-mails attached with trojan horse malware to suspected terrorists .
the paper said that " sending e-mails under the names of other government authorities " could be employed in justified , exceptional cases . the interior ministry distinguished between two types of searches : a one-time " perusal " of a computer , or long-term " surveillance . " tiny bits of information bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spying software has to be " customized " the spying software would install itself onto a private computer and search for particular data , which would then be sent to criminal police computers as soon as the user goes online .
only minimal data would be transmitted so as not to arouse the user 's suspicion . also , entries made onto keyboards could be monitored , which would allow agents to track passwords used to call up information on external servers . tageszeitung reported that the spying software could slip past anti-virus programs and firewalls used on private computers . tagesschau.de , the online portal of germany 's ard broadcaster , reported that in the 22-page paper , the interior ministry answered questions posed by the justice ministry about searching computers linked to the internet . apparently , the paper was intended as a basis for a technical discussion on friday between experts from germany 's ruling coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- . warnings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bka agent at anti-terror center in berlin the justice ministry has warned the interior ministry against implementing such a plan .
according to tagesschau.de , the justice ministry said that " manipulating mails from german government agencies could put general correspondence from those institutions at risk . " jörg ziercke , the president of the federal criminal police office -lrb- bka -rrb- , has downplayed concerns about internet monitoring .
he said that the debate was intended to " instill fear " among the public .
he told german weekly magazine stern that such " online monitoring " of terrorist suspects would only involve five to ten cases a year .
more , he said , would not be possible because the efforts involved in surveillance of one suspect were intense as " software must be customized for each case . " german interior minister wolfgang schäuble , who is a member of the conservative cdu , has pressed for new laws to combat terrorism .
politicians are set to discuss legal questions surrounding such proposals this friday .
the center-left spd has meanwhile voiced criticism of schäuble 's e-mail-trojan surveillance plan . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 29.08.2007 pollutants more likely to hit underprivileged children großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : various pollutants are making children more susceptible to illnesses a nationwide study in germany on environmental hazards has shown alarming results .
children from underprivileged families are more likely to be exposed to pollutants than their higher-income counterparts . germany 's children are being exposed to a wide range of harmful pollutants , according to a nationwide study by the federal environment agency uba . uba 's president andreas troge said all of those children surveyed showed concentrations of organochloride substances , including the poisonous pesticide ddt .
although substances such as ddt have been banned for decades , they are still stored in people 's fat tissue and are thought to be passed on to children when they are nursed . in addition , troge said it was " alarming " that softening agents for plastics were detectable in all of the children 's urine . " there are certain substances which we are truly worried about , " troge said at the study 's presentation in berlin on tuesday .
he said it was unclear how they could enter the human body .
but it was assumed that these were not due to small children 's plastic toys .
rather food packaging could be responsible , he said , such as the seals on twist-off lids or foils which have direct contact to fatty foods . the child environment survey examined 1,790 children between the ages of three and 14 from 2003 to 2006 .
it is the first representative study available on german children 's exposure to harmful substances , uba said . smoking is the homemade danger bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smoking continues to be the number one pollutant for children the major pollutant indoors continued to be tobacco smoke , troge said .
about half of those children surveyed were exposed to smoke in the home . there had been a noticeable change for the worse in germany 's eastern states , the report showed .
mothers in eastern germany were increasingly smoking , and therefore increasingly exposing their children to smoke .
this led to more frequent inflammation of the middle ear as well as susceptibility to other infections , the survey said . " we can only appeal to parents ' particular responsibility here , " troge said . social class also played a role .
those children from lower class families were more exposed to second-hand smoke than those from higher-income groups . noise pollution disturbs many children troge said it was also striking that 14 percent of the children surveyed showed hearing loss .
six percent felt disturbed by street and aircraft noise . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the health hazards of traffic are often underestimated " traffic is a dominating source of noise and we ca n't underestimate its negative effects , " troge said .
" noise affects our entire organism and promotes sleep , concentration and metabolic disorders , as well as high blood pressure and heart disease . " the underprivileged were more affected by noise pollution than high-income families , he said .
this was due to the fact that people with lower incomes more often lived in inexpensive but unattractive areas , for example along busy roads .
this also led to higher lead contents in the blood of children from lower-income families . environment minister sigmar gabriel , who also attended the study 's presentation , called on local authorities to introduce anti-noise policies not only for the rich , but also for those less well-off .
gabriel said it was a question of " ecological justice . " fruit juice contained more pesticides troge said it was surprising that the exposure of children to harmful molds was growing .
eight percent of those children surveyed showed high sensitivity to indoor mold , which can cause allergies or respiratory illnesses . according to uba , this development could be traced back to the increased spread of such molds indoors , which had to do with poor ventilation in better insulated homes . children from higher-income families , however , also showed traces of harmful substances , for example organophosphate pesticides .
troge said he assumed this could be traced to fruit juices , which they 're more likely to drink . but troge said there were also positive results in the study .
children were less exposed to heavy metals , the wood preservative pentachlorophenol -lrb- pcp -rrb- or polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons than was the case at the beginning of the 1990s . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but while german companies are also broadening production on the asian giant 's market , product safety concerns abound . germany is known for its high-quality , precision products , and as the world 's export leader , it relies on that image to sell its technology and other goods . so respected is german expertise , for instance , that some can not keep from copying it .
during her visit to the china this week , german chancellor angela merkel criticized chinese copies of german cars slated for display at the frankfurt auto show in september .
but , possible product piracy is one issue ; quality control of german products made in china is another . " among european countries , german companies are certainly among the leaders in producing in china , " said victor vogt of the cologne chamber of commerce and industry -lrb- ihk -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " fake " product market in nanjing of around five million registered german companies , around 3,000 produce or are represented in china , vogt said . checking products yet the " made in china " label has taken serious beating due to safety concerns among products ranging from food to toothpaste to tires .
with american toymaker mattel in recent weeks having to recall up to 18 million toys made in china , the issue has grabbed even more attention among the public . " because of mattel 's massive recall , our work has become more important than ever , " said a press release of the hong kong branch of the cologne-based tüv rheinland . the company claims to be the world leader in product quality testing and examines everything from skin cream to hotels and cruise ships .
it examines over 100,000 products a year in 60 different countries , but its main markets are the united states and europe . toys make up about 15-20 percent of the products the group tests . " in mattel 's case , there seems to have been a problem in quality management , " said hartmut müller-gerbes of the cologne headquarters of tüv rheinland . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " polly pocket " - the mattel doll that started it all china , for its part , has defended the quality of its exports .
it has blamed faults in us designs - and not chinese workmanship - for the mattel recalls and also pointed to varying global product standards . that 's where tüv comes in . müller-gerbes said companies can pay a fee -lrb- 3,000 euros , or $ 4,000 , is a base price -rrb- to have their products tested by tüv in the hopes of gaining a " seal of quality . "
the tüv standards are often far higher than those required by law , but can give companies an edge in the market . furthermore , tüv is informed about the product safety regulations in specific countries . " some german discounters like aldi and lidl force their production companies in china to go to the tüv branch there to be informed before they even begin production of toys , for instance , for the german market , " müller-gerbes said . he stressed that with mattel 's dolls , cars and action figures - which were recalled because they contained lead paint , or tiny magnets that are harmful if swallowed - it was not standards which were too low .
the problem was faulty production . however , he also said that there are far too many products which go to market without being inspected at all . further expansion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china 's sweat shops are infamous but rather than questioning goods production in china , more and more german companies are producing there to save money , especially in labor costs . also , they seek to gain better footing in the asian market . the deutz company , which manufactures diesel engines for trucks and construction equipment , just entered into a joint venture with faw , the biggest vehicle and car manufacturer in china . " so far , we produce only in germany and spain , " said andrea bleesen of the deutz company .
" we have to follow our customers in this market as china grows and grows .
they say they need equipment adjusted for local needs , so rather than manufacture here in europe , it makes sense to produce in asia since it will also save us in transportation costs . " while the majority of those deutz engines will be be sold within china , around 20 percent may be sold world-wide and will have to fulfill quality and emissions standands of the appropriate countries . but bleesen is not worried about possible infringements on quality . " it 's deutz technology and we will maintain german quality , even in china , " she said . vogt of ihk agreed . " german companies which produce in china normally use the same standards they have in germany because some of the products have to come back to european markets , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daimlerchrysler factory in beijing vogt pointed out that many german companies , like mail-order firms , do not actually produce themselves .
instead , they outsource to chinese producers . " but they must ensure that the products undergo quality checks before they leave china , " he said .
" however , you can never guarantee that production quality is one hundert percent because only a random sample of products is tested - say , one hundred items of millions produced . " a shift in mentality whether its technology or toys , " the world public has become more aware of product safety issues due to the mattel scandal , " said müller-gerbes . he said the task now at hand is to ensure that more inspections are conducted and safety laws enforced , regardless of the country .
he also indicated that a seal of quality is becoming increasingly important due to the sheer number of products on the market . " in the toy market , at least , quality seals can help parents weed out the bad apples and narrow down their choices , " müller-gerbes said . finally , consumers must shift their own habits of going after the cheapest price rather than the better quality , he said . louisa schaefer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

keyboard movements and password entry could also be monitored . cologne 's stadt-anzeiger -lrb- ksta -rrb- and the national tageszeitung -lrb- taz -rrb- newspapers reported wednesday that germany 's interior ministry wants to employ fake e-mails to allow agents to search private computers . according to a 22-page paper from the interior ministry -lrb- a copy of which ksta obtained -rrb- , the plan would involve sending e-mails attached with trojan horse malware to suspected terrorists .
the paper said that " sending e-mails under the names of other government authorities " could be employed in justified , exceptional cases . the interior ministry distinguished between two types of searches : a one-time " perusal " of a computer , or long-term " surveillance . " tiny bits of information bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spying software has to be " customized " the spying software would install itself onto a private computer and search for particular data , which would then be sent to criminal police computers as soon as the user goes online .
only minimal data would be transmitted so as not to arouse the user 's suspicion . also , entries made onto keyboards could be monitored , which would allow agents to track passwords used to call up information on external servers . tageszeitung reported that the spying software could slip past anti-virus programs and firewalls used on private computers . tagesschau.de , the online portal of germany 's ard broadcaster , reported that in the 22-page paper , the interior ministry answered questions posed by the justice ministry about searching computers linked to the internet . apparently , the paper was intended as a basis for a technical discussion on friday between experts from germany 's ruling coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- . warnings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bka agent at anti-terror center in berlin the justice ministry has warned the interior ministry against implementing such a plan .
according to tagesschau.de , the justice ministry said that " manipulating mails from german government agencies could put general correspondence from those institutions at risk . " jörg ziercke , the president of the federal criminal police office -lrb- bka -rrb- , has downplayed concerns about internet monitoring .
he said that the debate was intended to " instill fear " among the public .
he told german weekly magazine stern that such " online monitoring " of terrorist suspects would only involve five to ten cases a year .
more , he said , would not be possible because the efforts involved in surveillance of one suspect were intense as " software must be customized for each case . " german interior minister wolfgang schäuble , who is a member of the conservative cdu , has pressed for new laws to combat terrorism .
politicians are set to discuss legal questions surrounding such proposals this friday .

the warning comes shortly after russia laid claims to the area . " i very much believe that everybody should respect international law , " steinmeier said while visiting a research station at ny alesund on spitzbergen , a norwegian island in the arctic ocean .
" the north pole is not a law-free zone ; there are international accords which must be respected by all nations who have interests here .
if everybody sticks to the rules , there will be no conflict . " steinmeier was referring to russia .

scientists believe the sea bed contains massive oil and gas reserves , which could become easier to access as global warming causes the north pole 's ice caps to melt . " dramatic " effects on wednesday , steinmeier told german broadcaster zdf that the effects of global warming which he was witnessing in the arctic sea were " dramatic . " he had observed how the glaciers on spitzbergen were melting and said the island should serve as an " early warning " of the consequences of climate change . the foreign minister warned that the phenomenon would trigger territorial conflicts as the race for the arctic 's resources gets underway .
he said , however , that nations had an obligation to protect " nature 's treasures . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a russian flag , but is it a russian north pole ?
russia 's august expedition has prompted various sovereignty claims to arctic territory by other countries - including denmark , canada and the united states - to grow louder . steinmeier , for his part , has been visiting spitzbergen as part of a fact-finding trip on climate change and clean energy . on wednesday , he will travel to the us state of california with the aim of strengthening trans-atlantic ties to combat climate change .

children from underprivileged families are more likely to be exposed to pollutants than their higher-income counterparts . germany 's children are being exposed to a wide range of harmful pollutants , according to a nationwide study by the federal environment agency uba . uba 's president andreas troge said all of those children surveyed showed concentrations of organochloride substances , including the poisonous pesticide ddt .
although substances such as ddt have been banned for decades , they are still stored in people 's fat tissue and are thought to be passed on to children when they are nursed . in addition , troge said it was " alarming " that softening agents for plastics were detectable in all of the children 's urine . " there are certain substances which we are truly worried about , " troge said at the study 's presentation in berlin on tuesday .
he said it was unclear how they could enter the human body .
but it was assumed that these were not due to small children 's plastic toys .
rather food packaging could be responsible , he said , such as the seals on twist-off lids or foils which have direct contact to fatty foods . the child environment survey examined 1,790 children between the ages of three and 14 from 2003 to 2006 .
it is the first representative study available on german children 's exposure to harmful substances , uba said . smoking is the homemade danger bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smoking continues to be the number one pollutant for children the major pollutant indoors continued to be tobacco smoke , troge said .
about half of those children surveyed were exposed to smoke in the home . there had been a noticeable change for the worse in germany 's eastern states , the report showed .
mothers in eastern germany were increasingly smoking , and therefore increasingly exposing their children to smoke .
this led to more frequent inflammation of the middle ear as well as susceptibility to other infections , the survey said . " we can only appeal to parents ' particular responsibility here , " troge said . social class also played a role .
those children from lower class families were more exposed to second-hand smoke than those from higher-income groups . noise pollution disturbs many children troge said it was also striking that 14 percent of the children surveyed showed hearing loss .
six percent felt disturbed by street and aircraft noise . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the health hazards of traffic are often underestimated " traffic is a dominating source of noise and we ca n't underestimate its negative effects , " troge said .
" noise affects our entire organism and promotes sleep , concentration and metabolic disorders , as well as high blood pressure and heart disease . " the underprivileged were more affected by noise pollution than high-income families , he said .
this was due to the fact that people with lower incomes more often lived in inexpensive but unattractive areas , for example along busy roads .
this also led to higher lead contents in the blood of children from lower-income families . environment minister sigmar gabriel , who also attended the study 's presentation , called on local authorities to introduce anti-noise policies not only for the rich , but also for those less well-off .
gabriel said it was a question of " ecological justice . " fruit juice contained more pesticides troge said it was surprising that the exposure of children to harmful molds was growing .
eight percent of those children surveyed showed high sensitivity to indoor mold , which can cause allergies or respiratory illnesses . according to uba , this development could be traced back to the increased spread of such molds indoors , which had to do with poor ventilation in better insulated homes . children from higher-income families , however , also showed traces of harmful substances , for example organophosphate pesticides .
troge said he assumed this could be traced to fruit juices , which they 're more likely to drink . but troge said there were also positive results in the study .
children were less exposed to heavy metals , the wood preservative pentachlorophenol -lrb- pcp -rrb- or polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons than was the case at the beginning of the 1990s . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

children from underprivileged families are more likely to be exposed to pollutants than their higher-income counterparts . germany 's children are being exposed to a wide range of harmful pollutants , according to a nationwide study by the federal environment agency uba . uba 's president andreas troge said all of those children surveyed showed concentrations of organochloride substances , including the poisonous pesticide ddt .
although substances such as ddt have been banned for decades , they are still stored in people 's fat tissue and are thought to be passed on to children when they are nursed . in addition , troge said it was " alarming " that softening agents for plastics were detectable in all of the children 's urine . " there are certain substances which we are truly worried about , " troge said at the study 's presentation in berlin on tuesday .
he said it was unclear how they could enter the human body .
but it was assumed that these were not due to small children 's plastic toys .
rather food packaging could be responsible , he said , such as the seals on twist-off lids or foils which have direct contact to fatty foods . the child environment survey examined 1,790 children between the ages of three and 14 from 2003 to 2006 .
it is the first representative study available on german children 's exposure to harmful substances , uba said . smoking is the homemade danger bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smoking continues to be the number one pollutant for children the major pollutant indoors continued to be tobacco smoke , troge said .
about half of those children surveyed were exposed to smoke in the home . there had been a noticeable change for the worse in germany 's eastern states , the report showed .
mothers in eastern germany were increasingly smoking , and therefore increasingly exposing their children to smoke .
this led to more frequent inflammation of the middle ear as well as susceptibility to other infections , the survey said . " we can only appeal to parents ' particular responsibility here , " troge said . social class also played a role .
those children from lower class families were more exposed to second-hand smoke than those from higher-income groups . noise pollution disturbs many children troge said it was also striking that 14 percent of the children surveyed showed hearing loss .
six percent felt disturbed by street and aircraft noise . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the health hazards of traffic are often underestimated " traffic is a dominating source of noise and we ca n't underestimate its negative effects , " troge said .
" noise affects our entire organism and promotes sleep , concentration and metabolic disorders , as well as high blood pressure and heart disease . " the underprivileged were more affected by noise pollution than high-income families , he said .
this was due to the fact that people with lower incomes more often lived in inexpensive but unattractive areas , for example along busy roads .
this also led to higher lead contents in the blood of children from lower-income families . environment minister sigmar gabriel , who also attended the study 's presentation , called on local authorities to introduce anti-noise policies not only for the rich , but also for those less well-off .
gabriel said it was a question of " ecological justice . " fruit juice contained more pesticides troge said it was surprising that the exposure of children to harmful molds was growing .
eight percent of those children surveyed showed high sensitivity to indoor mold , which can cause allergies or respiratory illnesses . according to uba , this development could be traced back to the increased spread of such molds indoors , which had to do with poor ventilation in better insulated homes . children from higher-income families , however , also showed traces of harmful substances , for example organophosphate pesticides .
troge said he assumed this could be traced to fruit juices , which they 're more likely to drink . but troge said there were also positive results in the study .

but while german companies are also broadening production on the asian giant 's market , product safety concerns abound . germany is known for its high-quality , precision products , and as the world 's export leader , it relies on that image to sell its technology and other goods . so respected is german expertise , for instance , that some can not keep from copying it .
during her visit to the china this week , german chancellor angela merkel criticized chinese copies of german cars slated for display at the frankfurt auto show in september .
but , possible product piracy is one issue ; quality control of german products made in china is another . " among european countries , german companies are certainly among the leaders in producing in china , " said victor vogt of the cologne chamber of commerce and industry -lrb- ihk -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " fake " product market in nanjing of around five million registered german companies , around 3,000 produce or are represented in china , vogt said . checking products yet the " made in china " label has taken serious beating due to safety concerns among products ranging from food to toothpaste to tires .
with american toymaker mattel in recent weeks having to recall up to 18 million toys made in china , the issue has grabbed even more attention among the public . " because of mattel 's massive recall , our work has become more important than ever , " said a press release of the hong kong branch of the cologne-based tüv rheinland . the company claims to be the world leader in product quality testing and examines everything from skin cream to hotels and cruise ships .
it examines over 100,000 products a year in 60 different countries , but its main markets are the united states and europe . toys make up about 15-20 percent of the products the group tests . " in mattel 's case , there seems to have been a problem in quality management , " said hartmut müller-gerbes of the cologne headquarters of tüv rheinland . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " polly pocket " - the mattel doll that started it all china , for its part , has defended the quality of its exports .
it has blamed faults in us designs - and not chinese workmanship - for the mattel recalls and also pointed to varying global product standards . that 's where tüv comes in . müller-gerbes said companies can pay a fee -lrb- 3,000 euros , or $ 4,000 , is a base price -rrb- to have their products tested by tüv in the hopes of gaining a " seal of quality . "
the tüv standards are often far higher than those required by law , but can give companies an edge in the market . furthermore , tüv is informed about the product safety regulations in specific countries . " some german discounters like aldi and lidl force their production companies in china to go to the tüv branch there to be informed before they even begin production of toys , for instance , for the german market , " müller-gerbes said . he stressed that with mattel 's dolls , cars and action figures - which were recalled because they contained lead paint , or tiny magnets that are harmful if swallowed - it was not standards which were too low .
the problem was faulty production . however , he also said that there are far too many products which go to market without being inspected at all . further expansion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china 's sweat shops are infamous but rather than questioning goods production in china , more and more german companies are producing there to save money , especially in labor costs . also , they seek to gain better footing in the asian market . the deutz company , which manufactures diesel engines for trucks and construction equipment , just entered into a joint venture with faw , the biggest vehicle and car manufacturer in china . " so far , we produce only in germany and spain , " said andrea bleesen of the deutz company .
" we have to follow our customers in this market as china grows and grows .
they say they need equipment adjusted for local needs , so rather than manufacture here in europe , it makes sense to produce in asia since it will also save us in transportation costs . " while the majority of those deutz engines will be be sold within china , around 20 percent may be sold world-wide and will have to fulfill quality and emissions standands of the appropriate countries . but bleesen is not worried about possible infringements on quality . " it 's deutz technology and we will maintain german quality , even in china , " she said . vogt of ihk agreed . " german companies which produce in china normally use the same standards they have in germany because some of the products have to come back to european markets , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daimlerchrysler factory in beijing vogt pointed out that many german companies , like mail-order firms , do not actually produce themselves .
instead , they outsource to chinese producers . " but they must ensure that the products undergo quality checks before they leave china , " he said .
" however , you can never guarantee that production quality is one hundert percent because only a random sample of products is tested - say , one hundred items of millions produced . " a shift in mentality whether its technology or toys , " the world public has become more aware of product safety issues due to the mattel scandal , " said müller-gerbes . he said the task now at hand is to ensure that more inspections are conducted and safety laws enforced , regardless of the country .
he also indicated that a seal of quality is becoming increasingly important due to the sheer number of products on the market . " in the toy market , at least , quality seals can help parents weed out the bad apples and narrow down their choices , " müller-gerbes said . finally , consumers must shift their own habits of going after the cheapest price rather than the better quality , he said . louisa schaefer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

its 90 percent albanian majority are demanding independence , a move flatly rejected by serbia , who says it can only offer broad autonomy . " from my responsibility as kfor commander , we need the decision on the final status of kosovo as soon as possible , " kather told a farewell news conference .

the eu should push ahead to implement his plan as soon as the troika reports back . " it is high time to move from the conflict-management phase to the endgame , " he told a forum in bled , slovenia . " otherwise the stalemate will persist , but the eu can not afford kosovo to become just another frozen conflict , " the former finnish president said .
" doing nothing is not an option . " on monday , kosovo prime minister agim ceku said he expects kosovo to declare independence and seek recognition from its western backers right after talks with serbia close on dec .

children from underprivileged families are more likely to be exposed to pollutants than their higher-income counterparts . germany 's children are being exposed to a wide range of harmful pollutants , according to a nationwide study by the federal environment agency uba . uba 's president andreas troge said all of those children surveyed showed concentrations of organochloride substances , including the poisonous pesticide ddt .
although substances such as ddt have been banned for decades , they are still stored in people 's fat tissue and are thought to be passed on to children when they are nursed . in addition , troge said it was " alarming " that softening agents for plastics were detectable in all of the children 's urine . " there are certain substances which we are truly worried about , " troge said at the study 's presentation in berlin on tuesday .
he said it was unclear how they could enter the human body .
but it was assumed that these were not due to small children 's plastic toys .
rather food packaging could be responsible , he said , such as the seals on twist-off lids or foils which have direct contact to fatty foods . the child environment survey examined 1,790 children between the ages of three and 14 from 2003 to 2006 .
it is the first representative study available on german children 's exposure to harmful substances , uba said . smoking is the homemade danger bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smoking continues to be the number one pollutant for children the major pollutant indoors continued to be tobacco smoke , troge said .
about half of those children surveyed were exposed to smoke in the home . there had been a noticeable change for the worse in germany 's eastern states , the report showed .
mothers in eastern germany were increasingly smoking , and therefore increasingly exposing their children to smoke .
this led to more frequent inflammation of the middle ear as well as susceptibility to other infections , the survey said . " we can only appeal to parents ' particular responsibility here , " troge said . social class also played a role .
those children from lower class families were more exposed to second-hand smoke than those from higher-income groups . noise pollution disturbs many children troge said it was also striking that 14 percent of the children surveyed showed hearing loss .
six percent felt disturbed by street and aircraft noise . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the health hazards of traffic are often underestimated " traffic is a dominating source of noise and we ca n't underestimate its negative effects , " troge said .
" noise affects our entire organism and promotes sleep , concentration and metabolic disorders , as well as high blood pressure and heart disease . " the underprivileged were more affected by noise pollution than high-income families , he said .
this was due to the fact that people with lower incomes more often lived in inexpensive but unattractive areas , for example along busy roads .
this also led to higher lead contents in the blood of children from lower-income families . environment minister sigmar gabriel , who also attended the study 's presentation , called on local authorities to introduce anti-noise policies not only for the rich , but also for those less well-off .
gabriel said it was a question of " ecological justice . " fruit juice contained more pesticides troge said it was surprising that the exposure of children to harmful molds was growing .
eight percent of those children surveyed showed high sensitivity to indoor mold , which can cause allergies or respiratory illnesses . according to uba , this development could be traced back to the increased spread of such molds indoors , which had to do with poor ventilation in better insulated homes . children from higher-income families , however , also showed traces of harmful substances , for example organophosphate pesticides .
troge said he assumed this could be traced to fruit juices , which they 're more likely to drink . but troge said there were also positive results in the study .
children were less exposed to heavy metals , the wood preservative pentachlorophenol -lrb- pcp -rrb- or polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons than was the case at the beginning of the 1990s . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

children from underprivileged families are more likely to be exposed to pollutants than their higher-income counterparts . germany 's children are being exposed to a wide range of harmful pollutants , according to a nationwide study by the federal environment agency uba . uba 's president andreas troge said all of those children surveyed showed concentrations of organochloride substances , including the poisonous pesticide ddt .
although substances such as ddt have been banned for decades , they are still stored in people 's fat tissue and are thought to be passed on to children when they are nursed . in addition , troge said it was " alarming " that softening agents for plastics were detectable in all of the children 's urine . " there are certain substances which we are truly worried about , " troge said at the study 's presentation in berlin on tuesday .
he said it was unclear how they could enter the human body .
but it was assumed that these were not due to small children 's plastic toys .
rather food packaging could be responsible , he said , such as the seals on twist-off lids or foils which have direct contact to fatty foods . the child environment survey examined 1,790 children between the ages of three and 14 from 2003 to 2006 .
it is the first representative study available on german children 's exposure to harmful substances , uba said . smoking is the homemade danger bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smoking continues to be the number one pollutant for children the major pollutant indoors continued to be tobacco smoke , troge said .
about half of those children surveyed were exposed to smoke in the home . there had been a noticeable change for the worse in germany 's eastern states , the report showed .
mothers in eastern germany were increasingly smoking , and therefore increasingly exposing their children to smoke .
this led to more frequent inflammation of the middle ear as well as susceptibility to other infections , the survey said . " we can only appeal to parents ' particular responsibility here , " troge said . social class also played a role .
those children from lower class families were more exposed to second-hand smoke than those from higher-income groups . noise pollution disturbs many children troge said it was also striking that 14 percent of the children surveyed showed hearing loss .
six percent felt disturbed by street and aircraft noise . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the health hazards of traffic are often underestimated " traffic is a dominating source of noise and we ca n't underestimate its negative effects , " troge said .
" noise affects our entire organism and promotes sleep , concentration and metabolic disorders , as well as high blood pressure and heart disease . " the underprivileged were more affected by noise pollution than high-income families , he said .
this was due to the fact that people with lower incomes more often lived in inexpensive but unattractive areas , for example along busy roads .
this also led to higher lead contents in the blood of children from lower-income families . environment minister sigmar gabriel , who also attended the study 's presentation , called on local authorities to introduce anti-noise policies not only for the rich , but also for those less well-off .
gabriel said it was a question of " ecological justice . " fruit juice contained more pesticides troge said it was surprising that the exposure of children to harmful molds was growing .
eight percent of those children surveyed showed high sensitivity to indoor mold , which can cause allergies or respiratory illnesses . according to uba , this development could be traced back to the increased spread of such molds indoors , which had to do with poor ventilation in better insulated homes . children from higher-income families , however , also showed traces of harmful substances , for example organophosphate pesticides .
troge said he assumed this could be traced to fruit juices , which they 're more likely to drink . but troge said there were also positive results in the study .

the next day , jung travels to macedonia and albania . on friday , jung visits to kosovo where he meets with president fatmir sejdiu .
there , he is also to attend the formal handing over from german to french command of the approximately 16,000-strong nato kosovo force -lrb- kfor -rrb- peacekeeping contingent . growing tension bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is just one of 34 countries whose troops are under kfor command on the eve of jung 's departure , the outgoing german commander in kosovo , lieutenant-general roland kather , warned of " increased nervousness " in the province and called for a swift decision on kosovo 's status . although kosovo is still officially part of serbia , the province has been administered by the united nations since 1999 .
its 90 percent albanian majority are demanding independence , a move flatly rejected by serbia , who says it can only offer broad autonomy . " from my responsibility as kfor commander , we need the decision on the final status of kosovo as soon as possible , " kather told a farewell news conference .
" we need it because everybody is waiting .
we need it to come up with economic development , and by that , at the same time to provide for security . " new round of kosovo talks meanwhile , negotiators from serbia and kosovo return to vienna on thursday to meet envoys from the troika of the united states , european union and russia in the latest bid for a deal on the fate of kosovo . the new round of talks was called after russia rejected a un draft resolution granting kosovo independence under eu supervision .

the eu should push ahead to implement his plan as soon as the troika reports back . " it is high time to move from the conflict-management phase to the endgame , " he told a forum in bled , slovenia . " otherwise the stalemate will persist , but the eu can not afford kosovo to become just another frozen conflict , " the former finnish president said .
" doing nothing is not an option . " on monday , kosovo prime minister agim ceku said he expects kosovo to declare independence and seek recognition from its western backers right after talks with serbia close on dec .

the warning comes shortly after russia laid claims to the area . " i very much believe that everybody should respect international law , " steinmeier said while visiting a research station at ny alesund on spitzbergen , a norwegian island in the arctic ocean .
" the north pole is not a law-free zone ; there are international accords which must be respected by all nations who have interests here .
if everybody sticks to the rules , there will be no conflict . " steinmeier was referring to russia .
earlier this month , members of a russian submarine expedition planted a flag beneath the north pole , thereby allowing moscow to reassert that the seabed is an extension of its own land mass . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ny alesund polar research base in spitzbergen " spectacular exploits mean very little , " said steinmeier , who was accompanied by his norwegian counterpart , jonas gahr stoere . the arctic sea has become both a vulnerable and contested place .
scientists believe the sea bed contains massive oil and gas reserves , which could become easier to access as global warming causes the north pole 's ice caps to melt . " dramatic " effects on wednesday , steinmeier told german broadcaster zdf that the effects of global warming which he was witnessing in the arctic sea were " dramatic . " he had observed how the glaciers on spitzbergen were melting and said the island should serve as an " early warning " of the consequences of climate change . the foreign minister warned that the phenomenon would trigger territorial conflicts as the race for the arctic 's resources gets underway .
he said , however , that nations had an obligation to protect " nature 's treasures . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a russian flag , but is it a russian north pole ?
russia 's august expedition has prompted various sovereignty claims to arctic territory by other countries - including denmark , canada and the united states - to grow louder . steinmeier , for his part , has been visiting spitzbergen as part of a fact-finding trip on climate change and clean energy . on wednesday , he will travel to the us state of california with the aim of strengthening trans-atlantic ties to combat climate change .
steinmeier is due to meet with california 's governor , arnold schwarzennegger , who has set landmark goals for reducing greenhouse gases partially blamed for global warming . the german environmentalist green party has criticized steinmeier 's trip to the north , claiming that the foreign minister is trying to woo norwegian gas suppliers . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de asia -pipe- 29.08.2007 german firms expand in china amid product safety worries großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china 's nanjing automobile now produces mg model sports cars german chancellor angela merkel is seeking better business ties with china while on tour there .
but while german companies are also broadening production on the asian giant 's market , product safety concerns abound . germany is known for its high-quality , precision products , and as the world 's export leader , it relies on that image to sell its technology and other goods . so respected is german expertise , for instance , that some can not keep from copying it .
during her visit to the china this week , german chancellor angela merkel criticized chinese copies of german cars slated for display at the frankfurt auto show in september .
but , possible product piracy is one issue ; quality control of german products made in china is another . " among european countries , german companies are certainly among the leaders in producing in china , " said victor vogt of the cologne chamber of commerce and industry -lrb- ihk -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " fake " product market in nanjing of around five million registered german companies , around 3,000 produce or are represented in china , vogt said . checking products yet the " made in china " label has taken serious beating due to safety concerns among products ranging from food to toothpaste to tires .
with american toymaker mattel in recent weeks having to recall up to 18 million toys made in china , the issue has grabbed even more attention among the public . " because of mattel 's massive recall , our work has become more important than ever , " said a press release of the hong kong branch of the cologne-based tüv rheinland . the company claims to be the world leader in product quality testing and examines everything from skin cream to hotels and cruise ships .
it examines over 100,000 products a year in 60 different countries , but its main markets are the united states and europe . toys make up about 15-20 percent of the products the group tests . " in mattel 's case , there seems to have been a problem in quality management , " said hartmut müller-gerbes of the cologne headquarters of tüv rheinland . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " polly pocket " - the mattel doll that started it all china , for its part , has defended the quality of its exports .
it has blamed faults in us designs - and not chinese workmanship - for the mattel recalls and also pointed to varying global product standards . that 's where tüv comes in . müller-gerbes said companies can pay a fee -lrb- 3,000 euros , or $ 4,000 , is a base price -rrb- to have their products tested by tüv in the hopes of gaining a " seal of quality . "
the tüv standards are often far higher than those required by law , but can give companies an edge in the market . furthermore , tüv is informed about the product safety regulations in specific countries . " some german discounters like aldi and lidl force their production companies in china to go to the tüv branch there to be informed before they even begin production of toys , for instance , for the german market , " müller-gerbes said . he stressed that with mattel 's dolls , cars and action figures - which were recalled because they contained lead paint , or tiny magnets that are harmful if swallowed - it was not standards which were too low .
the problem was faulty production . however , he also said that there are far too many products which go to market without being inspected at all . further expansion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china 's sweat shops are infamous but rather than questioning goods production in china , more and more german companies are producing there to save money , especially in labor costs . also , they seek to gain better footing in the asian market . the deutz company , which manufactures diesel engines for trucks and construction equipment , just entered into a joint venture with faw , the biggest vehicle and car manufacturer in china . " so far , we produce only in germany and spain , " said andrea bleesen of the deutz company .
" we have to follow our customers in this market as china grows and grows .
they say they need equipment adjusted for local needs , so rather than manufacture here in europe , it makes sense to produce in asia since it will also save us in transportation costs . " while the majority of those deutz engines will be be sold within china , around 20 percent may be sold world-wide and will have to fulfill quality and emissions standands of the appropriate countries . but bleesen is not worried about possible infringements on quality . " it 's deutz technology and we will maintain german quality , even in china , " she said . vogt of ihk agreed .

children from underprivileged families are more likely to be exposed to pollutants than their higher-income counterparts . germany 's children are being exposed to a wide range of harmful pollutants , according to a nationwide study by the federal environment agency uba . uba 's president andreas troge said all of those children surveyed showed concentrations of organochloride substances , including the poisonous pesticide ddt .
although substances such as ddt have been banned for decades , they are still stored in people 's fat tissue and are thought to be passed on to children when they are nursed . in addition , troge said it was " alarming " that softening agents for plastics were detectable in all of the children 's urine . " there are certain substances which we are truly worried about , " troge said at the study 's presentation in berlin on tuesday .
he said it was unclear how they could enter the human body .
but it was assumed that these were not due to small children 's plastic toys .
rather food packaging could be responsible , he said , such as the seals on twist-off lids or foils which have direct contact to fatty foods . the child environment survey examined 1,790 children between the ages of three and 14 from 2003 to 2006 .
it is the first representative study available on german children 's exposure to harmful substances , uba said . smoking is the homemade danger bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smoking continues to be the number one pollutant for children the major pollutant indoors continued to be tobacco smoke , troge said .
about half of those children surveyed were exposed to smoke in the home . there had been a noticeable change for the worse in germany 's eastern states , the report showed .
mothers in eastern germany were increasingly smoking , and therefore increasingly exposing their children to smoke .
this led to more frequent inflammation of the middle ear as well as susceptibility to other infections , the survey said . " we can only appeal to parents ' particular responsibility here , " troge said . social class also played a role .
those children from lower class families were more exposed to second-hand smoke than those from higher-income groups . noise pollution disturbs many children troge said it was also striking that 14 percent of the children surveyed showed hearing loss .
six percent felt disturbed by street and aircraft noise . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the health hazards of traffic are often underestimated " traffic is a dominating source of noise and we ca n't underestimate its negative effects , " troge said .
" noise affects our entire organism and promotes sleep , concentration and metabolic disorders , as well as high blood pressure and heart disease . " the underprivileged were more affected by noise pollution than high-income families , he said .
this was due to the fact that people with lower incomes more often lived in inexpensive but unattractive areas , for example along busy roads .
this also led to higher lead contents in the blood of children from lower-income families . environment minister sigmar gabriel , who also attended the study 's presentation , called on local authorities to introduce anti-noise policies not only for the rich , but also for those less well-off .
gabriel said it was a question of " ecological justice . " fruit juice contained more pesticides troge said it was surprising that the exposure of children to harmful molds was growing .
eight percent of those children surveyed showed high sensitivity to indoor mold , which can cause allergies or respiratory illnesses . according to uba , this development could be traced back to the increased spread of such molds indoors , which had to do with poor ventilation in better insulated homes . children from higher-income families , however , also showed traces of harmful substances , for example organophosphate pesticides .
troge said he assumed this could be traced to fruit juices , which they 're more likely to drink . but troge said there were also positive results in the study .
children were less exposed to heavy metals , the wood preservative pentachlorophenol -lrb- pcp -rrb- or polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons than was the case at the beginning of the 1990s . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

children from underprivileged families are more likely to be exposed to pollutants than their higher-income counterparts . germany 's children are being exposed to a wide range of harmful pollutants , according to a nationwide study by the federal environment agency uba . uba 's president andreas troge said all of those children surveyed showed concentrations of organochloride substances , including the poisonous pesticide ddt .
although substances such as ddt have been banned for decades , they are still stored in people 's fat tissue and are thought to be passed on to children when they are nursed . in addition , troge said it was " alarming " that softening agents for plastics were detectable in all of the children 's urine . " there are certain substances which we are truly worried about , " troge said at the study 's presentation in berlin on tuesday .
he said it was unclear how they could enter the human body .
but it was assumed that these were not due to small children 's plastic toys .
rather food packaging could be responsible , he said , such as the seals on twist-off lids or foils which have direct contact to fatty foods . the child environment survey examined 1,790 children between the ages of three and 14 from 2003 to 2006 .
it is the first representative study available on german children 's exposure to harmful substances , uba said . smoking is the homemade danger bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smoking continues to be the number one pollutant for children the major pollutant indoors continued to be tobacco smoke , troge said .
about half of those children surveyed were exposed to smoke in the home . there had been a noticeable change for the worse in germany 's eastern states , the report showed .
mothers in eastern germany were increasingly smoking , and therefore increasingly exposing their children to smoke .
this led to more frequent inflammation of the middle ear as well as susceptibility to other infections , the survey said . " we can only appeal to parents ' particular responsibility here , " troge said . social class also played a role .
those children from lower class families were more exposed to second-hand smoke than those from higher-income groups . noise pollution disturbs many children troge said it was also striking that 14 percent of the children surveyed showed hearing loss .
six percent felt disturbed by street and aircraft noise . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the health hazards of traffic are often underestimated " traffic is a dominating source of noise and we ca n't underestimate its negative effects , " troge said .
" noise affects our entire organism and promotes sleep , concentration and metabolic disorders , as well as high blood pressure and heart disease . " the underprivileged were more affected by noise pollution than high-income families , he said .
this was due to the fact that people with lower incomes more often lived in inexpensive but unattractive areas , for example along busy roads .
this also led to higher lead contents in the blood of children from lower-income families . environment minister sigmar gabriel , who also attended the study 's presentation , called on local authorities to introduce anti-noise policies not only for the rich , but also for those less well-off .
gabriel said it was a question of " ecological justice . " fruit juice contained more pesticides troge said it was surprising that the exposure of children to harmful molds was growing .
eight percent of those children surveyed showed high sensitivity to indoor mold , which can cause allergies or respiratory illnesses . according to uba , this development could be traced back to the increased spread of such molds indoors , which had to do with poor ventilation in better insulated homes . children from higher-income families , however , also showed traces of harmful substances , for example organophosphate pesticides .
troge said he assumed this could be traced to fruit juices , which they 're more likely to drink . but troge said there were also positive results in the study .
children were less exposed to heavy metals , the wood preservative pentachlorophenol -lrb- pcp -rrb- or polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons than was the case at the beginning of the 1990s . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but , possible product piracy is one issue ; quality control of german products made in china is another . " among european countries , german companies are certainly among the leaders in producing in china , " said victor vogt of the cologne chamber of commerce and industry -lrb- ihk -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " fake " product market in nanjing of around five million registered german companies , around 3,000 produce or are represented in china , vogt said . checking products yet the " made in china " label has taken serious beating due to safety concerns among products ranging from food to toothpaste to tires .
with american toymaker mattel in recent weeks having to recall up to 18 million toys made in china , the issue has grabbed even more attention among the public . " because of mattel 's massive recall , our work has become more important than ever , " said a press release of the hong kong branch of the cologne-based tüv rheinland . the company claims to be the world leader in product quality testing and examines everything from skin cream to hotels and cruise ships .
it examines over 100,000 products a year in 60 different countries , but its main markets are the united states and europe . toys make up about 15-20 percent of the products the group tests . " in mattel 's case , there seems to have been a problem in quality management , " said hartmut müller-gerbes of the cologne headquarters of tüv rheinland . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " polly pocket " - the mattel doll that started it all china , for its part , has defended the quality of its exports .
it has blamed faults in us designs - and not chinese workmanship - for the mattel recalls and also pointed to varying global product standards . that 's where tüv comes in . müller-gerbes said companies can pay a fee -lrb- 3,000 euros , or $ 4,000 , is a base price -rrb- to have their products tested by tüv in the hopes of gaining a " seal of quality . "
the tüv standards are often far higher than those required by law , but can give companies an edge in the market . furthermore , tüv is informed about the product safety regulations in specific countries . " some german discounters like aldi and lidl force their production companies in china to go to the tüv branch there to be informed before they even begin production of toys , for instance , for the german market , " müller-gerbes said . he stressed that with mattel 's dolls , cars and action figures - which were recalled because they contained lead paint , or tiny magnets that are harmful if swallowed - it was not standards which were too low .
the problem was faulty production . however , he also said that there are far too many products which go to market without being inspected at all . further expansion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china 's sweat shops are infamous but rather than questioning goods production in china , more and more german companies are producing there to save money , especially in labor costs . also , they seek to gain better footing in the asian market . the deutz company , which manufactures diesel engines for trucks and construction equipment , just entered into a joint venture with faw , the biggest vehicle and car manufacturer in china .

" we have to follow our customers in this market as china grows and grows .
they say they need equipment adjusted for local needs , so rather than manufacture here in europe , it makes sense to produce in asia since it will also save us in transportation costs . " while the majority of those deutz engines will be be sold within china , around 20 percent may be sold world-wide and will have to fulfill quality and emissions standands of the appropriate countries . but bleesen is not worried about possible infringements on quality . " it 's deutz technology and we will maintain german quality , even in china , " she said . vogt of ihk agreed . " german companies which produce in china normally use the same standards they have in germany because some of the products have to come back to european markets , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daimlerchrysler factory in beijing vogt pointed out that many german companies , like mail-order firms , do not actually produce themselves .

the warning comes shortly after russia laid claims to the area . " i very much believe that everybody should respect international law , " steinmeier said while visiting a research station at ny alesund on spitzbergen , a norwegian island in the arctic ocean .
" the north pole is not a law-free zone ; there are international accords which must be respected by all nations who have interests here .
if everybody sticks to the rules , there will be no conflict . " steinmeier was referring to russia .
earlier this month , members of a russian submarine expedition planted a flag beneath the north pole , thereby allowing moscow to reassert that the seabed is an extension of its own land mass . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ny alesund polar research base in spitzbergen " spectacular exploits mean very little , " said steinmeier , who was accompanied by his norwegian counterpart , jonas gahr stoere . the arctic sea has become both a vulnerable and contested place .
scientists believe the sea bed contains massive oil and gas reserves , which could become easier to access as global warming causes the north pole 's ice caps to melt . " dramatic " effects on wednesday , steinmeier told german broadcaster zdf that the effects of global warming which he was witnessing in the arctic sea were " dramatic . " he had observed how the glaciers on spitzbergen were melting and said the island should serve as an " early warning " of the consequences of climate change . the foreign minister warned that the phenomenon would trigger territorial conflicts as the race for the arctic 's resources gets underway .
he said , however , that nations had an obligation to protect " nature 's treasures . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a russian flag , but is it a russian north pole ?
russia 's august expedition has prompted various sovereignty claims to arctic territory by other countries - including denmark , canada and the united states - to grow louder . steinmeier , for his part , has been visiting spitzbergen as part of a fact-finding trip on climate change and clean energy . on wednesday , he will travel to the us state of california with the aim of strengthening trans-atlantic ties to combat climate change .
steinmeier is due to meet with california 's governor , arnold schwarzennegger , who has set landmark goals for reducing greenhouse gases partially blamed for global warming . the german environmentalist green party has criticized steinmeier 's trip to the north , claiming that the foreign minister is trying to woo norwegian gas suppliers . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the next day , jung travels to macedonia and albania . on friday , jung visits to kosovo where he meets with president fatmir sejdiu .
there , he is also to attend the formal handing over from german to french command of the approximately 16,000-strong nato kosovo force -lrb- kfor -rrb- peacekeeping contingent . growing tension bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is just one of 34 countries whose troops are under kfor command on the eve of jung 's departure , the outgoing german commander in kosovo , lieutenant-general roland kather , warned of " increased nervousness " in the province and called for a swift decision on kosovo 's status . although kosovo is still officially part of serbia , the province has been administered by the united nations since 1999 .
its 90 percent albanian majority are demanding independence , a move flatly rejected by serbia , who says it can only offer broad autonomy . " from my responsibility as kfor commander , we need the decision on the final status of kosovo as soon as possible , " kather told a farewell news conference .
" we need it because everybody is waiting .
we need it to come up with economic development , and by that , at the same time to provide for security . " new round of kosovo talks meanwhile , negotiators from serbia and kosovo return to vienna on thursday to meet envoys from the troika of the united states , european union and russia in the latest bid for a deal on the fate of kosovo . the new round of talks was called after russia rejected a un draft resolution granting kosovo independence under eu supervision .
the plan was prepared by un special envoy martti ahtisaari following 13 months of negotiations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an albanian man in kosovo stands near a graffiti , reading " self-determination " at the beginning of the week , ahtisaari said chances of a serb-albanian deal were nil .
the eu should push ahead to implement his plan as soon as the troika reports back . " it is high time to move from the conflict-management phase to the endgame , " he told a forum in bled , slovenia . " otherwise the stalemate will persist , but the eu can not afford kosovo to become just another frozen conflict , " the former finnish president said .
" doing nothing is not an option . " on monday , kosovo prime minister agim ceku said he expects kosovo to declare independence and seek recognition from its western backers right after talks with serbia close on dec .

but while german companies are also broadening production on the asian giant 's market , product safety concerns abound . germany is known for its high-quality , precision products , and as the world 's export leader , it relies on that image to sell its technology and other goods . so respected is german expertise , for instance , that some can not keep from copying it .
during her visit to the china this week , german chancellor angela merkel criticized chinese copies of german cars slated for display at the frankfurt auto show in september .
but , possible product piracy is one issue ; quality control of german products made in china is another . " among european countries , german companies are certainly among the leaders in producing in china , " said victor vogt of the cologne chamber of commerce and industry -lrb- ihk -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " fake " product market in nanjing of around five million registered german companies , around 3,000 produce or are represented in china , vogt said . checking products yet the " made in china " label has taken serious beating due to safety concerns among products ranging from food to toothpaste to tires .
with american toymaker mattel in recent weeks having to recall up to 18 million toys made in china , the issue has grabbed even more attention among the public . " because of mattel 's massive recall , our work has become more important than ever , " said a press release of the hong kong branch of the cologne-based tüv rheinland . the company claims to be the world leader in product quality testing and examines everything from skin cream to hotels and cruise ships .
it examines over 100,000 products a year in 60 different countries , but its main markets are the united states and europe . toys make up about 15-20 percent of the products the group tests . " in mattel 's case , there seems to have been a problem in quality management , " said hartmut müller-gerbes of the cologne headquarters of tüv rheinland . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " polly pocket " - the mattel doll that started it all china , for its part , has defended the quality of its exports .
it has blamed faults in us designs - and not chinese workmanship - for the mattel recalls and also pointed to varying global product standards . that 's where tüv comes in . müller-gerbes said companies can pay a fee -lrb- 3,000 euros , or $ 4,000 , is a base price -rrb- to have their products tested by tüv in the hopes of gaining a " seal of quality . "
the tüv standards are often far higher than those required by law , but can give companies an edge in the market . furthermore , tüv is informed about the product safety regulations in specific countries . " some german discounters like aldi and lidl force their production companies in china to go to the tüv branch there to be informed before they even begin production of toys , for instance , for the german market , " müller-gerbes said . he stressed that with mattel 's dolls , cars and action figures - which were recalled because they contained lead paint , or tiny magnets that are harmful if swallowed - it was not standards which were too low .
the problem was faulty production . however , he also said that there are far too many products which go to market without being inspected at all . further expansion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china 's sweat shops are infamous but rather than questioning goods production in china , more and more german companies are producing there to save money , especially in labor costs . also , they seek to gain better footing in the asian market . the deutz company , which manufactures diesel engines for trucks and construction equipment , just entered into a joint venture with faw , the biggest vehicle and car manufacturer in china . " so far , we produce only in germany and spain , " said andrea bleesen of the deutz company .
" we have to follow our customers in this market as china grows and grows .
they say they need equipment adjusted for local needs , so rather than manufacture here in europe , it makes sense to produce in asia since it will also save us in transportation costs . " while the majority of those deutz engines will be be sold within china , around 20 percent may be sold world-wide and will have to fulfill quality and emissions standands of the appropriate countries . but bleesen is not worried about possible infringements on quality . " it 's deutz technology and we will maintain german quality , even in china , " she said . vogt of ihk agreed . " german companies which produce in china normally use the same standards they have in germany because some of the products have to come back to european markets , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daimlerchrysler factory in beijing vogt pointed out that many german companies , like mail-order firms , do not actually produce themselves .

he also indicated that a seal of quality is becoming increasingly important due to the sheer number of products on the market .

but while german companies are also broadening production on the asian giant 's market , product safety concerns abound . germany is known for its high-quality , precision products , and as the world 's export leader , it relies on that image to sell its technology and other goods . so respected is german expertise , for instance , that some can not keep from copying it .
during her visit to the china this week , german chancellor angela merkel criticized chinese copies of german cars slated for display at the frankfurt auto show in september .
but , possible product piracy is one issue ; quality control of german products made in china is another . " among european countries , german companies are certainly among the leaders in producing in china , " said victor vogt of the cologne chamber of commerce and industry -lrb- ihk -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " fake " product market in nanjing of around five million registered german companies , around 3,000 produce or are represented in china , vogt said . checking products yet the " made in china " label has taken serious beating due to safety concerns among products ranging from food to toothpaste to tires .
with american toymaker mattel in recent weeks having to recall up to 18 million toys made in china , the issue has grabbed even more attention among the public . " because of mattel 's massive recall , our work has become more important than ever , " said a press release of the hong kong branch of the cologne-based tüv rheinland . the company claims to be the world leader in product quality testing and examines everything from skin cream to hotels and cruise ships .
it examines over 100,000 products a year in 60 different countries , but its main markets are the united states and europe . toys make up about 15-20 percent of the products the group tests . " in mattel 's case , there seems to have been a problem in quality management , " said hartmut müller-gerbes of the cologne headquarters of tüv rheinland . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " polly pocket " - the mattel doll that started it all china , for its part , has defended the quality of its exports .
it has blamed faults in us designs - and not chinese workmanship - for the mattel recalls and also pointed to varying global product standards . that 's where tüv comes in . müller-gerbes said companies can pay a fee -lrb- 3,000 euros , or $ 4,000 , is a base price -rrb- to have their products tested by tüv in the hopes of gaining a " seal of quality . "
the tüv standards are often far higher than those required by law , but can give companies an edge in the market . furthermore , tüv is informed about the product safety regulations in specific countries . " some german discounters like aldi and lidl force their production companies in china to go to the tüv branch there to be informed before they even begin production of toys , for instance , for the german market , " müller-gerbes said . he stressed that with mattel 's dolls , cars and action figures - which were recalled because they contained lead paint , or tiny magnets that are harmful if swallowed - it was not standards which were too low .
the problem was faulty production . however , he also said that there are far too many products which go to market without being inspected at all . further expansion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china 's sweat shops are infamous but rather than questioning goods production in china , more and more german companies are producing there to save money , especially in labor costs . also , they seek to gain better footing in the asian market . the deutz company , which manufactures diesel engines for trucks and construction equipment , just entered into a joint venture with faw , the biggest vehicle and car manufacturer in china . " so far , we produce only in germany and spain , " said andrea bleesen of the deutz company .
" we have to follow our customers in this market as china grows and grows .
they say they need equipment adjusted for local needs , so rather than manufacture here in europe , it makes sense to produce in asia since it will also save us in transportation costs . " while the majority of those deutz engines will be be sold within china , around 20 percent may be sold world-wide and will have to fulfill quality and emissions standands of the appropriate countries . but bleesen is not worried about possible infringements on quality . " it 's deutz technology and we will maintain german quality , even in china , " she said . vogt of ihk agreed . " german companies which produce in china normally use the same standards they have in germany because some of the products have to come back to european markets , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daimlerchrysler factory in beijing vogt pointed out that many german companies , like mail-order firms , do not actually produce themselves .
instead , they outsource to chinese producers . " but they must ensure that the products undergo quality checks before they leave china , " he said .
" however , you can never guarantee that production quality is one hundert percent because only a random sample of products is tested - say , one hundred items of millions produced . " a shift in mentality whether its technology or toys , " the world public has become more aware of product safety issues due to the mattel scandal , " said müller-gerbes . he said the task now at hand is to ensure that more inspections are conducted and safety laws enforced , regardless of the country .
he also indicated that a seal of quality is becoming increasingly important due to the sheer number of products on the market . " in the toy market , at least , quality seals can help parents weed out the bad apples and narrow down their choices , " müller-gerbes said . finally , consumers must shift their own habits of going after the cheapest price rather than the better quality , he said . louisa schaefer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the warning comes shortly after russia laid claims to the area . " i very much believe that everybody should respect international law , " steinmeier said while visiting a research station at ny alesund on spitzbergen , a norwegian island in the arctic ocean .
" the north pole is not a law-free zone ; there are international accords which must be respected by all nations who have interests here .
if everybody sticks to the rules , there will be no conflict . " steinmeier was referring to russia .
earlier this month , members of a russian submarine expedition planted a flag beneath the north pole , thereby allowing moscow to reassert that the seabed is an extension of its own land mass . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ny alesund polar research base in spitzbergen " spectacular exploits mean very little , " said steinmeier , who was accompanied by his norwegian counterpart , jonas gahr stoere . the arctic sea has become both a vulnerable and contested place .
scientists believe the sea bed contains massive oil and gas reserves , which could become easier to access as global warming causes the north pole 's ice caps to melt . " dramatic " effects on wednesday , steinmeier told german broadcaster zdf that the effects of global warming which he was witnessing in the arctic sea were " dramatic . " he had observed how the glaciers on spitzbergen were melting and said the island should serve as an " early warning " of the consequences of climate change . the foreign minister warned that the phenomenon would trigger territorial conflicts as the race for the arctic 's resources gets underway .
he said , however , that nations had an obligation to protect " nature 's treasures . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a russian flag , but is it a russian north pole ?
russia 's august expedition has prompted various sovereignty claims to arctic territory by other countries - including denmark , canada and the united states - to grow louder . steinmeier , for his part , has been visiting spitzbergen as part of a fact-finding trip on climate change and clean energy . on wednesday , he will travel to the us state of california with the aim of strengthening trans-atlantic ties to combat climate change .
steinmeier is due to meet with california 's governor , arnold schwarzennegger , who has set landmark goals for reducing greenhouse gases partially blamed for global warming . the german environmentalist green party has criticized steinmeier 's trip to the north , claiming that the foreign minister is trying to woo norwegian gas suppliers . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

keyboard movements and password entry could also be monitored . cologne 's stadt-anzeiger -lrb- ksta -rrb- and the national tageszeitung -lrb- taz -rrb- newspapers reported wednesday that germany 's interior ministry wants to employ fake e-mails to allow agents to search private computers . according to a 22-page paper from the interior ministry -lrb- a copy of which ksta obtained -rrb- , the plan would involve sending e-mails attached with trojan horse malware to suspected terrorists .
the paper said that " sending e-mails under the names of other government authorities " could be employed in justified , exceptional cases . the interior ministry distinguished between two types of searches : a one-time " perusal " of a computer , or long-term " surveillance . " tiny bits of information bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spying software has to be " customized " the spying software would install itself onto a private computer and search for particular data , which would then be sent to criminal police computers as soon as the user goes online .
only minimal data would be transmitted so as not to arouse the user 's suspicion . also , entries made onto keyboards could be monitored , which would allow agents to track passwords used to call up information on external servers . tageszeitung reported that the spying software could slip past anti-virus programs and firewalls used on private computers . tagesschau.de , the online portal of germany 's ard broadcaster , reported that in the 22-page paper , the interior ministry answered questions posed by the justice ministry about searching computers linked to the internet . apparently , the paper was intended as a basis for a technical discussion on friday between experts from germany 's ruling coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- . warnings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bka agent at anti-terror center in berlin the justice ministry has warned the interior ministry against implementing such a plan .
according to tagesschau.de , the justice ministry said that " manipulating mails from german government agencies could put general correspondence from those institutions at risk . " jörg ziercke , the president of the federal criminal police office -lrb- bka -rrb- , has downplayed concerns about internet monitoring .
he said that the debate was intended to " instill fear " among the public .
he told german weekly magazine stern that such " online monitoring " of terrorist suspects would only involve five to ten cases a year .
more , he said , would not be possible because the efforts involved in surveillance of one suspect were intense as " software must be customized for each case . " german interior minister wolfgang schäuble , who is a member of the conservative cdu , has pressed for new laws to combat terrorism .
politicians are set to discuss legal questions surrounding such proposals this friday .
the center-left spd has meanwhile voiced criticism of schäuble 's e-mail-trojan surveillance plan . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" it is high time to move from the conflict-management phase to the endgame , " he told a forum in bled , slovenia . " otherwise the stalemate will persist , but the eu can not afford kosovo to become just another frozen conflict , " the former finnish president said .
" doing nothing is not an option . " on monday , kosovo prime minister agim ceku said he expects kosovo to declare independence and seek recognition from its western backers right after talks with serbia close on dec .

keyboard movements and password entry could also be monitored . cologne 's stadt-anzeiger -lrb- ksta -rrb- and the national tageszeitung -lrb- taz -rrb- newspapers reported wednesday that germany 's interior ministry wants to employ fake e-mails to allow agents to search private computers . according to a 22-page paper from the interior ministry -lrb- a copy of which ksta obtained -rrb- , the plan would involve sending e-mails attached with trojan horse malware to suspected terrorists .
the paper said that " sending e-mails under the names of other government authorities " could be employed in justified , exceptional cases . the interior ministry distinguished between two types of searches : a one-time " perusal " of a computer , or long-term " surveillance . " tiny bits of information bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spying software has to be " customized " the spying software would install itself onto a private computer and search for particular data , which would then be sent to criminal police computers as soon as the user goes online .
only minimal data would be transmitted so as not to arouse the user 's suspicion . also , entries made onto keyboards could be monitored , which would allow agents to track passwords used to call up information on external servers . tageszeitung reported that the spying software could slip past anti-virus programs and firewalls used on private computers . tagesschau.de , the online portal of germany 's ard broadcaster , reported that in the 22-page paper , the interior ministry answered questions posed by the justice ministry about searching computers linked to the internet . apparently , the paper was intended as a basis for a technical discussion on friday between experts from germany 's ruling coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- . warnings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bka agent at anti-terror center in berlin the justice ministry has warned the interior ministry against implementing such a plan .
according to tagesschau.de , the justice ministry said that " manipulating mails from german government agencies could put general correspondence from those institutions at risk . " jörg ziercke , the president of the federal criminal police office -lrb- bka -rrb- , has downplayed concerns about internet monitoring .
he said that the debate was intended to " instill fear " among the public .
he told german weekly magazine stern that such " online monitoring " of terrorist suspects would only involve five to ten cases a year .
more , he said , would not be possible because the efforts involved in surveillance of one suspect were intense as " software must be customized for each case . " german interior minister wolfgang schäuble , who is a member of the conservative cdu , has pressed for new laws to combat terrorism .
politicians are set to discuss legal questions surrounding such proposals this friday .

children from underprivileged families are more likely to be exposed to pollutants than their higher-income counterparts . germany 's children are being exposed to a wide range of harmful pollutants , according to a nationwide study by the federal environment agency uba . uba 's president andreas troge said all of those children surveyed showed concentrations of organochloride substances , including the poisonous pesticide ddt .
although substances such as ddt have been banned for decades , they are still stored in people 's fat tissue and are thought to be passed on to children when they are nursed . in addition , troge said it was " alarming " that softening agents for plastics were detectable in all of the children 's urine . " there are certain substances which we are truly worried about , " troge said at the study 's presentation in berlin on tuesday .
he said it was unclear how they could enter the human body .
but it was assumed that these were not due to small children 's plastic toys .
rather food packaging could be responsible , he said , such as the seals on twist-off lids or foils which have direct contact to fatty foods . the child environment survey examined 1,790 children between the ages of three and 14 from 2003 to 2006 .
it is the first representative study available on german children 's exposure to harmful substances , uba said . smoking is the homemade danger bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smoking continues to be the number one pollutant for children the major pollutant indoors continued to be tobacco smoke , troge said .
about half of those children surveyed were exposed to smoke in the home . there had been a noticeable change for the worse in germany 's eastern states , the report showed .
mothers in eastern germany were increasingly smoking , and therefore increasingly exposing their children to smoke .
this led to more frequent inflammation of the middle ear as well as susceptibility to other infections , the survey said . " we can only appeal to parents ' particular responsibility here , " troge said . social class also played a role .
those children from lower class families were more exposed to second-hand smoke than those from higher-income groups . noise pollution disturbs many children troge said it was also striking that 14 percent of the children surveyed showed hearing loss .
six percent felt disturbed by street and aircraft noise . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the health hazards of traffic are often underestimated " traffic is a dominating source of noise and we ca n't underestimate its negative effects , " troge said .
" noise affects our entire organism and promotes sleep , concentration and metabolic disorders , as well as high blood pressure and heart disease . " the underprivileged were more affected by noise pollution than high-income families , he said .
this was due to the fact that people with lower incomes more often lived in inexpensive but unattractive areas , for example along busy roads .
this also led to higher lead contents in the blood of children from lower-income families . environment minister sigmar gabriel , who also attended the study 's presentation , called on local authorities to introduce anti-noise policies not only for the rich , but also for those less well-off .
gabriel said it was a question of " ecological justice . " fruit juice contained more pesticides troge said it was surprising that the exposure of children to harmful molds was growing .
eight percent of those children surveyed showed high sensitivity to indoor mold , which can cause allergies or respiratory illnesses . according to uba , this development could be traced back to the increased spread of such molds indoors , which had to do with poor ventilation in better insulated homes . children from higher-income families , however , also showed traces of harmful substances , for example organophosphate pesticides .
troge said he assumed this could be traced to fruit juices , which they 're more likely to drink . but troge said there were also positive results in the study .

children from underprivileged families are more likely to be exposed to pollutants than their higher-income counterparts . germany 's children are being exposed to a wide range of harmful pollutants , according to a nationwide study by the federal environment agency uba . uba 's president andreas troge said all of those children surveyed showed concentrations of organochloride substances , including the poisonous pesticide ddt .
although substances such as ddt have been banned for decades , they are still stored in people 's fat tissue and are thought to be passed on to children when they are nursed . in addition , troge said it was " alarming " that softening agents for plastics were detectable in all of the children 's urine . " there are certain substances which we are truly worried about , " troge said at the study 's presentation in berlin on tuesday .
he said it was unclear how they could enter the human body .
but it was assumed that these were not due to small children 's plastic toys .
rather food packaging could be responsible , he said , such as the seals on twist-off lids or foils which have direct contact to fatty foods . the child environment survey examined 1,790 children between the ages of three and 14 from 2003 to 2006 .
it is the first representative study available on german children 's exposure to harmful substances , uba said . smoking is the homemade danger bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smoking continues to be the number one pollutant for children the major pollutant indoors continued to be tobacco smoke , troge said .
about half of those children surveyed were exposed to smoke in the home . there had been a noticeable change for the worse in germany 's eastern states , the report showed .
mothers in eastern germany were increasingly smoking , and therefore increasingly exposing their children to smoke .
this led to more frequent inflammation of the middle ear as well as susceptibility to other infections , the survey said . " we can only appeal to parents ' particular responsibility here , " troge said . social class also played a role .
those children from lower class families were more exposed to second-hand smoke than those from higher-income groups . noise pollution disturbs many children troge said it was also striking that 14 percent of the children surveyed showed hearing loss .
six percent felt disturbed by street and aircraft noise . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the health hazards of traffic are often underestimated " traffic is a dominating source of noise and we ca n't underestimate its negative effects , " troge said .
" noise affects our entire organism and promotes sleep , concentration and metabolic disorders , as well as high blood pressure and heart disease . " the underprivileged were more affected by noise pollution than high-income families , he said .
this was due to the fact that people with lower incomes more often lived in inexpensive but unattractive areas , for example along busy roads .
this also led to higher lead contents in the blood of children from lower-income families . environment minister sigmar gabriel , who also attended the study 's presentation , called on local authorities to introduce anti-noise policies not only for the rich , but also for those less well-off .
gabriel said it was a question of " ecological justice . " fruit juice contained more pesticides troge said it was surprising that the exposure of children to harmful molds was growing .
eight percent of those children surveyed showed high sensitivity to indoor mold , which can cause allergies or respiratory illnesses . according to uba , this development could be traced back to the increased spread of such molds indoors , which had to do with poor ventilation in better insulated homes . children from higher-income families , however , also showed traces of harmful substances , for example organophosphate pesticides .
troge said he assumed this could be traced to fruit juices , which they 're more likely to drink . but troge said there were also positive results in the study .

the next day , jung travels to macedonia and albania . on friday , jung visits to kosovo where he meets with president fatmir sejdiu .

its 90 percent albanian majority are demanding independence , a move flatly rejected by serbia , who says it can only offer broad autonomy . " from my responsibility as kfor commander , we need the decision on the final status of kosovo as soon as possible , " kather told a farewell news conference .
" we need it because everybody is waiting .
we need it to come up with economic development , and by that , at the same time to provide for security .

the eu should push ahead to implement his plan as soon as the troika reports back . " it is high time to move from the conflict-management phase to the endgame , " he told a forum in bled , slovenia . " otherwise the stalemate will persist , but the eu can not afford kosovo to become just another frozen conflict , " the former finnish president said .
" doing nothing is not an option . " on monday , kosovo prime minister agim ceku said he expects kosovo to declare independence and seek recognition from its western backers right after talks with serbia close on dec .

children from underprivileged families are more likely to be exposed to pollutants than their higher-income counterparts . germany 's children are being exposed to a wide range of harmful pollutants , according to a nationwide study by the federal environment agency uba . uba 's president andreas troge said all of those children surveyed showed concentrations of organochloride substances , including the poisonous pesticide ddt .
although substances such as ddt have been banned for decades , they are still stored in people 's fat tissue and are thought to be passed on to children when they are nursed . in addition , troge said it was " alarming " that softening agents for plastics were detectable in all of the children 's urine . " there are certain substances which we are truly worried about , " troge said at the study 's presentation in berlin on tuesday .
he said it was unclear how they could enter the human body .
but it was assumed that these were not due to small children 's plastic toys .
rather food packaging could be responsible , he said , such as the seals on twist-off lids or foils which have direct contact to fatty foods . the child environment survey examined 1,790 children between the ages of three and 14 from 2003 to 2006 .
it is the first representative study available on german children 's exposure to harmful substances , uba said . smoking is the homemade danger bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smoking continues to be the number one pollutant for children the major pollutant indoors continued to be tobacco smoke , troge said .
about half of those children surveyed were exposed to smoke in the home . there had been a noticeable change for the worse in germany 's eastern states , the report showed .
mothers in eastern germany were increasingly smoking , and therefore increasingly exposing their children to smoke .
this led to more frequent inflammation of the middle ear as well as susceptibility to other infections , the survey said . " we can only appeal to parents ' particular responsibility here , " troge said . social class also played a role .
those children from lower class families were more exposed to second-hand smoke than those from higher-income groups . noise pollution disturbs many children troge said it was also striking that 14 percent of the children surveyed showed hearing loss .
six percent felt disturbed by street and aircraft noise . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the health hazards of traffic are often underestimated " traffic is a dominating source of noise and we ca n't underestimate its negative effects , " troge said .
" noise affects our entire organism and promotes sleep , concentration and metabolic disorders , as well as high blood pressure and heart disease . " the underprivileged were more affected by noise pollution than high-income families , he said .
this was due to the fact that people with lower incomes more often lived in inexpensive but unattractive areas , for example along busy roads .
this also led to higher lead contents in the blood of children from lower-income families . environment minister sigmar gabriel , who also attended the study 's presentation , called on local authorities to introduce anti-noise policies not only for the rich , but also for those less well-off .
gabriel said it was a question of " ecological justice . " fruit juice contained more pesticides troge said it was surprising that the exposure of children to harmful molds was growing .
eight percent of those children surveyed showed high sensitivity to indoor mold , which can cause allergies or respiratory illnesses . according to uba , this development could be traced back to the increased spread of such molds indoors , which had to do with poor ventilation in better insulated homes . children from higher-income families , however , also showed traces of harmful substances , for example organophosphate pesticides .
troge said he assumed this could be traced to fruit juices , which they 're more likely to drink . but troge said there were also positive results in the study .

keyboard movements and password entry could also be monitored . cologne 's stadt-anzeiger -lrb- ksta -rrb- and the national tageszeitung -lrb- taz -rrb- newspapers reported wednesday that germany 's interior ministry wants to employ fake e-mails to allow agents to search private computers . according to a 22-page paper from the interior ministry -lrb- a copy of which ksta obtained -rrb- , the plan would involve sending e-mails attached with trojan horse malware to suspected terrorists .
the paper said that " sending e-mails under the names of other government authorities " could be employed in justified , exceptional cases . the interior ministry distinguished between two types of searches : a one-time " perusal " of a computer , or long-term " surveillance . " tiny bits of information bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spying software has to be " customized " the spying software would install itself onto a private computer and search for particular data , which would then be sent to criminal police computers as soon as the user goes online .
only minimal data would be transmitted so as not to arouse the user 's suspicion . also , entries made onto keyboards could be monitored , which would allow agents to track passwords used to call up information on external servers . tageszeitung reported that the spying software could slip past anti-virus programs and firewalls used on private computers . tagesschau.de , the online portal of germany 's ard broadcaster , reported that in the 22-page paper , the interior ministry answered questions posed by the justice ministry about searching computers linked to the internet . apparently , the paper was intended as a basis for a technical discussion on friday between experts from germany 's ruling coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- . warnings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bka agent at anti-terror center in berlin the justice ministry has warned the interior ministry against implementing such a plan .
according to tagesschau.de , the justice ministry said that " manipulating mails from german government agencies could put general correspondence from those institutions at risk . " jörg ziercke , the president of the federal criminal police office -lrb- bka -rrb- , has downplayed concerns about internet monitoring .
he said that the debate was intended to " instill fear " among the public .
he told german weekly magazine stern that such " online monitoring " of terrorist suspects would only involve five to ten cases a year .
more , he said , would not be possible because the efforts involved in surveillance of one suspect were intense as " software must be customized for each case . " german interior minister wolfgang schäuble , who is a member of the conservative cdu , has pressed for new laws to combat terrorism .
politicians are set to discuss legal questions surrounding such proposals this friday .
the center-left spd has meanwhile voiced criticism of schäuble 's e-mail-trojan surveillance plan . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the north pole is not a law-free zone ; there are international accords which must be respected by all nations who have interests here .

keyboard movements and password entry could also be monitored . cologne 's stadt-anzeiger -lrb- ksta -rrb- and the national tageszeitung -lrb- taz -rrb- newspapers reported wednesday that germany 's interior ministry wants to employ fake e-mails to allow agents to search private computers . according to a 22-page paper from the interior ministry -lrb- a copy of which ksta obtained -rrb- , the plan would involve sending e-mails attached with trojan horse malware to suspected terrorists .
the paper said that " sending e-mails under the names of other government authorities " could be employed in justified , exceptional cases . the interior ministry distinguished between two types of searches : a one-time " perusal " of a computer , or long-term " surveillance . " tiny bits of information bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spying software has to be " customized " the spying software would install itself onto a private computer and search for particular data , which would then be sent to criminal police computers as soon as the user goes online .
only minimal data would be transmitted so as not to arouse the user 's suspicion . also , entries made onto keyboards could be monitored , which would allow agents to track passwords used to call up information on external servers . tageszeitung reported that the spying software could slip past anti-virus programs and firewalls used on private computers . tagesschau.de , the online portal of germany 's ard broadcaster , reported that in the 22-page paper , the interior ministry answered questions posed by the justice ministry about searching computers linked to the internet . apparently , the paper was intended as a basis for a technical discussion on friday between experts from germany 's ruling coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- . warnings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bka agent at anti-terror center in berlin the justice ministry has warned the interior ministry against implementing such a plan .
according to tagesschau.de , the justice ministry said that " manipulating mails from german government agencies could put general correspondence from those institutions at risk . " jörg ziercke , the president of the federal criminal police office -lrb- bka -rrb- , has downplayed concerns about internet monitoring .
he said that the debate was intended to " instill fear " among the public .
he told german weekly magazine stern that such " online monitoring " of terrorist suspects would only involve five to ten cases a year .
more , he said , would not be possible because the efforts involved in surveillance of one suspect were intense as " software must be customized for each case . " german interior minister wolfgang schäuble , who is a member of the conservative cdu , has pressed for new laws to combat terrorism .
politicians are set to discuss legal questions surrounding such proposals this friday .

its 90 percent albanian majority are demanding independence , a move flatly rejected by serbia , who says it can only offer broad autonomy . " from my responsibility as kfor commander , we need the decision on the final status of kosovo as soon as possible , " kather told a farewell news conference .

" it is high time to move from the conflict-management phase to the endgame , " he told a forum in bled , slovenia .

" doing nothing is not an option . " on monday , kosovo prime minister agim ceku said he expects kosovo to declare independence and seek recognition from its western backers right after talks with serbia close on dec .

keyboard movements and password entry could also be monitored . cologne 's stadt-anzeiger -lrb- ksta -rrb- and the national tageszeitung -lrb- taz -rrb- newspapers reported wednesday that germany 's interior ministry wants to employ fake e-mails to allow agents to search private computers . according to a 22-page paper from the interior ministry -lrb- a copy of which ksta obtained -rrb- , the plan would involve sending e-mails attached with trojan horse malware to suspected terrorists .
the paper said that " sending e-mails under the names of other government authorities " could be employed in justified , exceptional cases . the interior ministry distinguished between two types of searches : a one-time " perusal " of a computer , or long-term " surveillance . " tiny bits of information bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spying software has to be " customized " the spying software would install itself onto a private computer and search for particular data , which would then be sent to criminal police computers as soon as the user goes online .
only minimal data would be transmitted so as not to arouse the user 's suspicion . also , entries made onto keyboards could be monitored , which would allow agents to track passwords used to call up information on external servers . tageszeitung reported that the spying software could slip past anti-virus programs and firewalls used on private computers . tagesschau.de , the online portal of germany 's ard broadcaster , reported that in the 22-page paper , the interior ministry answered questions posed by the justice ministry about searching computers linked to the internet . apparently , the paper was intended as a basis for a technical discussion on friday between experts from germany 's ruling coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- . warnings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bka agent at anti-terror center in berlin the justice ministry has warned the interior ministry against implementing such a plan .
according to tagesschau.de , the justice ministry said that " manipulating mails from german government agencies could put general correspondence from those institutions at risk . " jörg ziercke , the president of the federal criminal police office -lrb- bka -rrb- , has downplayed concerns about internet monitoring .
he said that the debate was intended to " instill fear " among the public .
he told german weekly magazine stern that such " online monitoring " of terrorist suspects would only involve five to ten cases a year .
more , he said , would not be possible because the efforts involved in surveillance of one suspect were intense as " software must be customized for each case . " german interior minister wolfgang schäuble , who is a member of the conservative cdu , has pressed for new laws to combat terrorism .
politicians are set to discuss legal questions surrounding such proposals this friday .

keyboard movements and password entry could also be monitored . cologne 's stadt-anzeiger -lrb- ksta -rrb- and the national tageszeitung -lrb- taz -rrb- newspapers reported wednesday that germany 's interior ministry wants to employ fake e-mails to allow agents to search private computers . according to a 22-page paper from the interior ministry -lrb- a copy of which ksta obtained -rrb- , the plan would involve sending e-mails attached with trojan horse malware to suspected terrorists .
the paper said that " sending e-mails under the names of other government authorities " could be employed in justified , exceptional cases . the interior ministry distinguished between two types of searches : a one-time " perusal " of a computer , or long-term " surveillance . " tiny bits of information bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spying software has to be " customized " the spying software would install itself onto a private computer and search for particular data , which would then be sent to criminal police computers as soon as the user goes online .
only minimal data would be transmitted so as not to arouse the user 's suspicion . also , entries made onto keyboards could be monitored , which would allow agents to track passwords used to call up information on external servers . tageszeitung reported that the spying software could slip past anti-virus programs and firewalls used on private computers . tagesschau.de , the online portal of germany 's ard broadcaster , reported that in the 22-page paper , the interior ministry answered questions posed by the justice ministry about searching computers linked to the internet . apparently , the paper was intended as a basis for a technical discussion on friday between experts from germany 's ruling coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- . warnings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bka agent at anti-terror center in berlin the justice ministry has warned the interior ministry against implementing such a plan .
according to tagesschau.de , the justice ministry said that " manipulating mails from german government agencies could put general correspondence from those institutions at risk . " jörg ziercke , the president of the federal criminal police office -lrb- bka -rrb- , has downplayed concerns about internet monitoring .
he said that the debate was intended to " instill fear " among the public .
he told german weekly magazine stern that such " online monitoring " of terrorist suspects would only involve five to ten cases a year .
more , he said , would not be possible because the efforts involved in surveillance of one suspect were intense as " software must be customized for each case . " german interior minister wolfgang schäuble , who is a member of the conservative cdu , has pressed for new laws to combat terrorism .
politicians are set to discuss legal questions surrounding such proposals this friday .
the center-left spd has meanwhile voiced criticism of schäuble 's e-mail-trojan surveillance plan . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but while german companies are also broadening production on the asian giant 's market , product safety concerns abound . germany is known for its high-quality , precision products , and as the world 's export leader , it relies on that image to sell its technology and other goods . so respected is german expertise , for instance , that some can not keep from copying it .
during her visit to the china this week , german chancellor angela merkel criticized chinese copies of german cars slated for display at the frankfurt auto show in september .
but , possible product piracy is one issue ; quality control of german products made in china is another . " among european countries , german companies are certainly among the leaders in producing in china , " said victor vogt of the cologne chamber of commerce and industry -lrb- ihk -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " fake " product market in nanjing of around five million registered german companies , around 3,000 produce or are represented in china , vogt said . checking products yet the " made in china " label has taken serious beating due to safety concerns among products ranging from food to toothpaste to tires .
with american toymaker mattel in recent weeks having to recall up to 18 million toys made in china , the issue has grabbed even more attention among the public . " because of mattel 's massive recall , our work has become more important than ever , " said a press release of the hong kong branch of the cologne-based tüv rheinland . the company claims to be the world leader in product quality testing and examines everything from skin cream to hotels and cruise ships .
it examines over 100,000 products a year in 60 different countries , but its main markets are the united states and europe . toys make up about 15-20 percent of the products the group tests . " in mattel 's case , there seems to have been a problem in quality management , " said hartmut müller-gerbes of the cologne headquarters of tüv rheinland . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " polly pocket " - the mattel doll that started it all china , for its part , has defended the quality of its exports .
it has blamed faults in us designs - and not chinese workmanship - for the mattel recalls and also pointed to varying global product standards . that 's where tüv comes in . müller-gerbes said companies can pay a fee -lrb- 3,000 euros , or $ 4,000 , is a base price -rrb- to have their products tested by tüv in the hopes of gaining a " seal of quality . "
the tüv standards are often far higher than those required by law , but can give companies an edge in the market . furthermore , tüv is informed about the product safety regulations in specific countries . " some german discounters like aldi and lidl force their production companies in china to go to the tüv branch there to be informed before they even begin production of toys , for instance , for the german market , " müller-gerbes said . he stressed that with mattel 's dolls , cars and action figures - which were recalled because they contained lead paint , or tiny magnets that are harmful if swallowed - it was not standards which were too low .
the problem was faulty production . however , he also said that there are far too many products which go to market without being inspected at all . further expansion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china 's sweat shops are infamous but rather than questioning goods production in china , more and more german companies are producing there to save money , especially in labor costs . also , they seek to gain better footing in the asian market . the deutz company , which manufactures diesel engines for trucks and construction equipment , just entered into a joint venture with faw , the biggest vehicle and car manufacturer in china .

" it 's deutz technology and we will maintain german quality , even in china , " she said . vogt of ihk agreed .

keyboard movements and password entry could also be monitored . cologne 's stadt-anzeiger -lrb- ksta -rrb- and the national tageszeitung -lrb- taz -rrb- newspapers reported wednesday that germany 's interior ministry wants to employ fake e-mails to allow agents to search private computers . according to a 22-page paper from the interior ministry -lrb- a copy of which ksta obtained -rrb- , the plan would involve sending e-mails attached with trojan horse malware to suspected terrorists .
the paper said that " sending e-mails under the names of other government authorities " could be employed in justified , exceptional cases . the interior ministry distinguished between two types of searches : a one-time " perusal " of a computer , or long-term " surveillance . " tiny bits of information bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spying software has to be " customized " the spying software would install itself onto a private computer and search for particular data , which would then be sent to criminal police computers as soon as the user goes online .
only minimal data would be transmitted so as not to arouse the user 's suspicion . also , entries made onto keyboards could be monitored , which would allow agents to track passwords used to call up information on external servers . tageszeitung reported that the spying software could slip past anti-virus programs and firewalls used on private computers . tagesschau.de , the online portal of germany 's ard broadcaster , reported that in the 22-page paper , the interior ministry answered questions posed by the justice ministry about searching computers linked to the internet . apparently , the paper was intended as a basis for a technical discussion on friday between experts from germany 's ruling coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- . warnings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bka agent at anti-terror center in berlin the justice ministry has warned the interior ministry against implementing such a plan .
according to tagesschau.de , the justice ministry said that " manipulating mails from german government agencies could put general correspondence from those institutions at risk . " jörg ziercke , the president of the federal criminal police office -lrb- bka -rrb- , has downplayed concerns about internet monitoring .
he said that the debate was intended to " instill fear " among the public .
he told german weekly magazine stern that such " online monitoring " of terrorist suspects would only involve five to ten cases a year .
more , he said , would not be possible because the efforts involved in surveillance of one suspect were intense as " software must be customized for each case . " german interior minister wolfgang schäuble , who is a member of the conservative cdu , has pressed for new laws to combat terrorism .
politicians are set to discuss legal questions surrounding such proposals this friday .

but while german companies are also broadening production on the asian giant 's market , product safety concerns abound . germany is known for its high-quality , precision products , and as the world 's export leader , it relies on that image to sell its technology and other goods . so respected is german expertise , for instance , that some can not keep from copying it .
during her visit to the china this week , german chancellor angela merkel criticized chinese copies of german cars slated for display at the frankfurt auto show in september .
but , possible product piracy is one issue ; quality control of german products made in china is another . " among european countries , german companies are certainly among the leaders in producing in china , " said victor vogt of the cologne chamber of commerce and industry -lrb- ihk -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " fake " product market in nanjing of around five million registered german companies , around 3,000 produce or are represented in china , vogt said . checking products yet the " made in china " label has taken serious beating due to safety concerns among products ranging from food to toothpaste to tires .
with american toymaker mattel in recent weeks having to recall up to 18 million toys made in china , the issue has grabbed even more attention among the public . " because of mattel 's massive recall , our work has become more important than ever , " said a press release of the hong kong branch of the cologne-based tüv rheinland . the company claims to be the world leader in product quality testing and examines everything from skin cream to hotels and cruise ships .
it examines over 100,000 products a year in 60 different countries , but its main markets are the united states and europe . toys make up about 15-20 percent of the products the group tests . " in mattel 's case , there seems to have been a problem in quality management , " said hartmut müller-gerbes of the cologne headquarters of tüv rheinland . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " polly pocket " - the mattel doll that started it all china , for its part , has defended the quality of its exports .
it has blamed faults in us designs - and not chinese workmanship - for the mattel recalls and also pointed to varying global product standards . that 's where tüv comes in . müller-gerbes said companies can pay a fee -lrb- 3,000 euros , or $ 4,000 , is a base price -rrb- to have their products tested by tüv in the hopes of gaining a " seal of quality . "
the tüv standards are often far higher than those required by law , but can give companies an edge in the market . furthermore , tüv is informed about the product safety regulations in specific countries . " some german discounters like aldi and lidl force their production companies in china to go to the tüv branch there to be informed before they even begin production of toys , for instance , for the german market , " müller-gerbes said . he stressed that with mattel 's dolls , cars and action figures - which were recalled because they contained lead paint , or tiny magnets that are harmful if swallowed - it was not standards which were too low .
the problem was faulty production . however , he also said that there are far too many products which go to market without being inspected at all . further expansion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china 's sweat shops are infamous but rather than questioning goods production in china , more and more german companies are producing there to save money , especially in labor costs . also , they seek to gain better footing in the asian market . the deutz company , which manufactures diesel engines for trucks and construction equipment , just entered into a joint venture with faw , the biggest vehicle and car manufacturer in china . " so far , we produce only in germany and spain , " said andrea bleesen of the deutz company .
" we have to follow our customers in this market as china grows and grows .
they say they need equipment adjusted for local needs , so rather than manufacture here in europe , it makes sense to produce in asia since it will also save us in transportation costs . " while the majority of those deutz engines will be be sold within china , around 20 percent may be sold world-wide and will have to fulfill quality and emissions standands of the appropriate countries . but bleesen is not worried about possible infringements on quality . " it 's deutz technology and we will maintain german quality , even in china , " she said . vogt of ihk agreed . " german companies which produce in china normally use the same standards they have in germany because some of the products have to come back to european markets , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daimlerchrysler factory in beijing vogt pointed out that many german companies , like mail-order firms , do not actually produce themselves .
instead , they outsource to chinese producers . " but they must ensure that the products undergo quality checks before they leave china , " he said .
" however , you can never guarantee that production quality is one hundert percent because only a random sample of products is tested - say , one hundred items of millions produced . " a shift in mentality whether its technology or toys , " the world public has become more aware of product safety issues due to the mattel scandal , " said müller-gerbes . he said the task now at hand is to ensure that more inspections are conducted and safety laws enforced , regardless of the country .
he also indicated that a seal of quality is becoming increasingly important due to the sheer number of products on the market . " in the toy market , at least , quality seals can help parents weed out the bad apples and narrow down their choices , " müller-gerbes said . finally , consumers must shift their own habits of going after the cheapest price rather than the better quality , he said . louisa schaefer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

its 90 percent albanian majority are demanding independence , a move flatly rejected by serbia , who says it can only offer broad autonomy .

the warning comes shortly after russia laid claims to the area . " i very much believe that everybody should respect international law , " steinmeier said while visiting a research station at ny alesund on spitzbergen , a norwegian island in the arctic ocean .
" the north pole is not a law-free zone ; there are international accords which must be respected by all nations who have interests here .
if everybody sticks to the rules , there will be no conflict . " steinmeier was referring to russia .
earlier this month , members of a russian submarine expedition planted a flag beneath the north pole , thereby allowing moscow to reassert that the seabed is an extension of its own land mass . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ny alesund polar research base in spitzbergen " spectacular exploits mean very little , " said steinmeier , who was accompanied by his norwegian counterpart , jonas gahr stoere . the arctic sea has become both a vulnerable and contested place .
scientists believe the sea bed contains massive oil and gas reserves , which could become easier to access as global warming causes the north pole 's ice caps to melt . " dramatic " effects on wednesday , steinmeier told german broadcaster zdf that the effects of global warming which he was witnessing in the arctic sea were " dramatic . " he had observed how the glaciers on spitzbergen were melting and said the island should serve as an " early warning " of the consequences of climate change . the foreign minister warned that the phenomenon would trigger territorial conflicts as the race for the arctic 's resources gets underway .
he said , however , that nations had an obligation to protect " nature 's treasures . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a russian flag , but is it a russian north pole ?
russia 's august expedition has prompted various sovereignty claims to arctic territory by other countries - including denmark , canada and the united states - to grow louder . steinmeier , for his part , has been visiting spitzbergen as part of a fact-finding trip on climate change and clean energy . on wednesday , he will travel to the us state of california with the aim of strengthening trans-atlantic ties to combat climate change .
steinmeier is due to meet with california 's governor , arnold schwarzennegger , who has set landmark goals for reducing greenhouse gases partially blamed for global warming . the german environmentalist green party has criticized steinmeier 's trip to the north , claiming that the foreign minister is trying to woo norwegian gas suppliers . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

children from underprivileged families are more likely to be exposed to pollutants than their higher-income counterparts . germany 's children are being exposed to a wide range of harmful pollutants , according to a nationwide study by the federal environment agency uba . uba 's president andreas troge said all of those children surveyed showed concentrations of organochloride substances , including the poisonous pesticide ddt .

the next day , jung travels to macedonia and albania . on friday , jung visits to kosovo where he meets with president fatmir sejdiu .
there , he is also to attend the formal handing over from german to french command of the approximately 16,000-strong nato kosovo force -lrb- kfor -rrb- peacekeeping contingent . growing tension bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is just one of 34 countries whose troops are under kfor command on the eve of jung 's departure , the outgoing german commander in kosovo , lieutenant-general roland kather , warned of " increased nervousness " in the province and called for a swift decision on kosovo 's status . although kosovo is still officially part of serbia , the province has been administered by the united nations since 1999 .
its 90 percent albanian majority are demanding independence , a move flatly rejected by serbia , who says it can only offer broad autonomy . " from my responsibility as kfor commander , we need the decision on the final status of kosovo as soon as possible , " kather told a farewell news conference .
" we need it because everybody is waiting .
we need it to come up with economic development , and by that , at the same time to provide for security . " new round of kosovo talks meanwhile , negotiators from serbia and kosovo return to vienna on thursday to meet envoys from the troika of the united states , european union and russia in the latest bid for a deal on the fate of kosovo . the new round of talks was called after russia rejected a un draft resolution granting kosovo independence under eu supervision .
the plan was prepared by un special envoy martti ahtisaari following 13 months of negotiations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an albanian man in kosovo stands near a graffiti , reading " self-determination " at the beginning of the week , ahtisaari said chances of a serb-albanian deal were nil .
the eu should push ahead to implement his plan as soon as the troika reports back . " it is high time to move from the conflict-management phase to the endgame , " he told a forum in bled , slovenia . " otherwise the stalemate will persist , but the eu can not afford kosovo to become just another frozen conflict , " the former finnish president said .
" doing nothing is not an option . " on monday , kosovo prime minister agim ceku said he expects kosovo to declare independence and seek recognition from its western backers right after talks with serbia close on dec .

children from underprivileged families are more likely to be exposed to pollutants than their higher-income counterparts . germany 's children are being exposed to a wide range of harmful pollutants , according to a nationwide study by the federal environment agency uba . uba 's president andreas troge said all of those children surveyed showed concentrations of organochloride substances , including the poisonous pesticide ddt .
although substances such as ddt have been banned for decades , they are still stored in people 's fat tissue and are thought to be passed on to children when they are nursed . in addition , troge said it was " alarming " that softening agents for plastics were detectable in all of the children 's urine . " there are certain substances which we are truly worried about , " troge said at the study 's presentation in berlin on tuesday .
he said it was unclear how they could enter the human body .
but it was assumed that these were not due to small children 's plastic toys .
rather food packaging could be responsible , he said , such as the seals on twist-off lids or foils which have direct contact to fatty foods . the child environment survey examined 1,790 children between the ages of three and 14 from 2003 to 2006 .
it is the first representative study available on german children 's exposure to harmful substances , uba said . smoking is the homemade danger bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smoking continues to be the number one pollutant for children the major pollutant indoors continued to be tobacco smoke , troge said .
about half of those children surveyed were exposed to smoke in the home . there had been a noticeable change for the worse in germany 's eastern states , the report showed .

this led to more frequent inflammation of the middle ear as well as susceptibility to other infections , the survey said . " we can only appeal to parents ' particular responsibility here , " troge said . social class also played a role .
those children from lower class families were more exposed to second-hand smoke than those from higher-income groups . noise pollution disturbs many children troge said it was also striking that 14 percent of the children surveyed showed hearing loss .

" noise affects our entire organism and promotes sleep , concentration and metabolic disorders , as well as high blood pressure and heart disease . " the underprivileged were more affected by noise pollution than high-income families , he said .
this was due to the fact that people with lower incomes more often lived in inexpensive but unattractive areas , for example along busy roads .
this also led to higher lead contents in the blood of children from lower-income families . environment minister sigmar gabriel , who also attended the study 's presentation , called on local authorities to introduce anti-noise policies not only for the rich , but also for those less well-off .

but while german companies are also broadening production on the asian giant 's market , product safety concerns abound . germany is known for its high-quality , precision products , and as the world 's export leader , it relies on that image to sell its technology and other goods . so respected is german expertise , for instance , that some can not keep from copying it .
during her visit to the china this week , german chancellor angela merkel criticized chinese copies of german cars slated for display at the frankfurt auto show in september .
but , possible product piracy is one issue ; quality control of german products made in china is another . " among european countries , german companies are certainly among the leaders in producing in china , " said victor vogt of the cologne chamber of commerce and industry -lrb- ihk -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " fake " product market in nanjing of around five million registered german companies , around 3,000 produce or are represented in china , vogt said . checking products yet the " made in china " label has taken serious beating due to safety concerns among products ranging from food to toothpaste to tires .
with american toymaker mattel in recent weeks having to recall up to 18 million toys made in china , the issue has grabbed even more attention among the public . " because of mattel 's massive recall , our work has become more important than ever , " said a press release of the hong kong branch of the cologne-based tüv rheinland . the company claims to be the world leader in product quality testing and examines everything from skin cream to hotels and cruise ships .
it examines over 100,000 products a year in 60 different countries , but its main markets are the united states and europe . toys make up about 15-20 percent of the products the group tests . " in mattel 's case , there seems to have been a problem in quality management , " said hartmut müller-gerbes of the cologne headquarters of tüv rheinland . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " polly pocket " - the mattel doll that started it all china , for its part , has defended the quality of its exports .
it has blamed faults in us designs - and not chinese workmanship - for the mattel recalls and also pointed to varying global product standards . that 's where tüv comes in . müller-gerbes said companies can pay a fee -lrb- 3,000 euros , or $ 4,000 , is a base price -rrb- to have their products tested by tüv in the hopes of gaining a " seal of quality . "
the tüv standards are often far higher than those required by law , but can give companies an edge in the market . furthermore , tüv is informed about the product safety regulations in specific countries . " some german discounters like aldi and lidl force their production companies in china to go to the tüv branch there to be informed before they even begin production of toys , for instance , for the german market , " müller-gerbes said . he stressed that with mattel 's dolls , cars and action figures - which were recalled because they contained lead paint , or tiny magnets that are harmful if swallowed - it was not standards which were too low .
the problem was faulty production . however , he also said that there are far too many products which go to market without being inspected at all . further expansion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china 's sweat shops are infamous but rather than questioning goods production in china , more and more german companies are producing there to save money , especially in labor costs . also , they seek to gain better footing in the asian market . the deutz company , which manufactures diesel engines for trucks and construction equipment , just entered into a joint venture with faw , the biggest vehicle and car manufacturer in china . " so far , we produce only in germany and spain , " said andrea bleesen of the deutz company .
" we have to follow our customers in this market as china grows and grows .
they say they need equipment adjusted for local needs , so rather than manufacture here in europe , it makes sense to produce in asia since it will also save us in transportation costs . " while the majority of those deutz engines will be be sold within china , around 20 percent may be sold world-wide and will have to fulfill quality and emissions standands of the appropriate countries . but bleesen is not worried about possible infringements on quality . " it 's deutz technology and we will maintain german quality , even in china , " she said . vogt of ihk agreed . " german companies which produce in china normally use the same standards they have in germany because some of the products have to come back to european markets , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daimlerchrysler factory in beijing vogt pointed out that many german companies , like mail-order firms , do not actually produce themselves .

he also indicated that a seal of quality is becoming increasingly important due to the sheer number of products on the market .

children from underprivileged families are more likely to be exposed to pollutants than their higher-income counterparts . germany 's children are being exposed to a wide range of harmful pollutants , according to a nationwide study by the federal environment agency uba . uba 's president andreas troge said all of those children surveyed showed concentrations of organochloride substances , including the poisonous pesticide ddt .
although substances such as ddt have been banned for decades , they are still stored in people 's fat tissue and are thought to be passed on to children when they are nursed . in addition , troge said it was " alarming " that softening agents for plastics were detectable in all of the children 's urine . " there are certain substances which we are truly worried about , " troge said at the study 's presentation in berlin on tuesday .
he said it was unclear how they could enter the human body .
but it was assumed that these were not due to small children 's plastic toys .
rather food packaging could be responsible , he said , such as the seals on twist-off lids or foils which have direct contact to fatty foods . the child environment survey examined 1,790 children between the ages of three and 14 from 2003 to 2006 .
it is the first representative study available on german children 's exposure to harmful substances , uba said . smoking is the homemade danger bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smoking continues to be the number one pollutant for children the major pollutant indoors continued to be tobacco smoke , troge said .
about half of those children surveyed were exposed to smoke in the home . there had been a noticeable change for the worse in germany 's eastern states , the report showed .
mothers in eastern germany were increasingly smoking , and therefore increasingly exposing their children to smoke .
this led to more frequent inflammation of the middle ear as well as susceptibility to other infections , the survey said . " we can only appeal to parents ' particular responsibility here , " troge said . social class also played a role .
those children from lower class families were more exposed to second-hand smoke than those from higher-income groups . noise pollution disturbs many children troge said it was also striking that 14 percent of the children surveyed showed hearing loss .
six percent felt disturbed by street and aircraft noise . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the health hazards of traffic are often underestimated " traffic is a dominating source of noise and we ca n't underestimate its negative effects , " troge said .
" noise affects our entire organism and promotes sleep , concentration and metabolic disorders , as well as high blood pressure and heart disease . " the underprivileged were more affected by noise pollution than high-income families , he said .
this was due to the fact that people with lower incomes more often lived in inexpensive but unattractive areas , for example along busy roads .
this also led to higher lead contents in the blood of children from lower-income families . environment minister sigmar gabriel , who also attended the study 's presentation , called on local authorities to introduce anti-noise policies not only for the rich , but also for those less well-off .
gabriel said it was a question of " ecological justice . " fruit juice contained more pesticides troge said it was surprising that the exposure of children to harmful molds was growing .
eight percent of those children surveyed showed high sensitivity to indoor mold , which can cause allergies or respiratory illnesses . according to uba , this development could be traced back to the increased spread of such molds indoors , which had to do with poor ventilation in better insulated homes . children from higher-income families , however , also showed traces of harmful substances , for example organophosphate pesticides .
troge said he assumed this could be traced to fruit juices , which they 're more likely to drink . but troge said there were also positive results in the study .
children were less exposed to heavy metals , the wood preservative pentachlorophenol -lrb- pcp -rrb- or polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons than was the case at the beginning of the 1990s . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

here she comments on the impact of abdullah gul 's election as president .
mr gul is a former islamist whose wife controversially wears the headscarf .
ms shafak was tried last year - and acquitted - on charges of " insulting turkishness " in her novel , the bastard of istanbul . "
in the history of every country , there are certain periods when time flows more quickly and perhaps more painfully .
the year 2007 has been one of the most turbulent years in recent turkish history .
and yet , turkey has an amazing capacity to rapidly normalise things and generate stability out of commotion .
now , after months of mass demonstrations and rising political tension , turkey has finally chosen its president .
much to the dismay of the conventional secular elite , the former foreign minister , abdullah gul , has become the new president .
in fact , very few people have a problem with mr gul 's personality .
he has been a successful , pro-eu diplomat and a mild and moderate voice within his party .
his public support for journalists and writers on trial has also brought him close to intellectuals .
today , in addition to his own electorate , he has the empathy and support of many in the intelligentsia and business circles .
interestingly , it was less mr gul himself than his wife who has been discussed and challenged - if not rejected - by the country 's mainstream elite .
idealised image in turkey today any debate on gender or women is almost instantly overshadowed by politics . "
turkish ... society and culture is a harmonious fusion of seemingly opposite forces " elif shafak women 's bodies and images have become ideological battlegrounds .
it is around the symbols of femininity that bleak political dilemmas revolve .
and among all the symbols of femininity none has been as problematic as the headscarf .
gender issues have always been vital in the consolidation of the modern turkish nation , founded by kemal ataturk after the collapse of the ottoman empire .
his reformist movement was unique among those emerging from the muslim world in that it ventured and managed to transform not only the public sphere but also the private sphere - the domain of mothers , wives and daughters .
eighty years on , today 's trouble with women with headscarves is that they do not fit into this picture of the idealised " modern turkish woman " .
women in spotlight with the gul presidency now in progress , the modern turkish nation state will for the first time have a first lady wearing a headscarf .
and here lies the crux of the problem .
that headscarf has been interpreted as the symbol of darker and deeper changes .
if the first lady wears a headscarf , maintain the secularist elite , the whole secular system could be undermined .
there is a lot of talk on the theme " how should an ideal turkish woman look ? "
newspapers , tv channels , radios , workshops , panels and conferences centre on this question .
interestingly , turkish women have been at the forefront of this debate .
it seems some of turkey 's westernised , modern , secularist women are determined to show their opposition to the " other " turkish women .
family traditions as a novelist , the linguistic jam in this whole debate is of great interest to me .
i can find more than eight different words in turkish , each of which stand for some form of headscarf .
yemeni , turbaan , esharp , charshaf - every one is different .
but this complexity is completely lost when they are all lumped together under the category of " the veil " .
when we talk about the headscarf now , words explain less and confuse more .
women wear the headscarf for different reasons .
most wear it out of habit or for utterly traditional reasons rather than political motives .
not all covered women are giving a political message .
similarly , not all covered women are " ignorant " or " repressed " .
more significantly , the structure of the turkish family constantly brings together covered and uncovered women .
sometimes the mother-in-law is covered but the daughter-in-law is not .
one sister is covered but not another .
even taking a stroll along a crowded street in istanbul will show us how covered and uncovered women live together all the time .
muslim and secular turkish politics might thrive upon dualities but turkish society does not .
the society and culture is a harmonious fusion of seemingly opposite forces .
when western media cover the situation in turkey they frequently use terms such as " islamist " for the ruling ak party .
that , however , is misleading .
in order to understand the akp 's internal dynamics and continuing political success we need to abandon the term " islamist " or " fundamentalist " altogether .
we can call them " muslim democrats " for instance .
or find another concept that works .
within the amazing diversity of the muslim world , turkey occupies a unique place .
in an age when the number of people who believe in a clash of civilisations escalates every day , here is a country that is predominantly muslim and staunchly secular at the same time .
and here is a country that started its modernisation more than 150 years ago and today wants to join the eu .
the discussion on the president 's wife and the position of women in turkey lies at the centre of all these massive political debates . "

here she comments on the impact of abdullah gul 's election as president .
mr gul is a former islamist whose wife controversially wears the headscarf .
ms shafak was tried last year - and acquitted - on charges of " insulting turkishness " in her novel , the bastard of istanbul .
in the history of every country , there are certain periods when time flows more quickly and perhaps more painfully .
the year 2007 has been one of the most turbulent years in recent turkish history .
turkey 's pop music reveals its close identification with the west and yet , turkey has an amazing capacity to rapidly normalise things and generate stability out of commotion .
now , after months of mass demonstrations and rising political tension , turkey has finally chosen its president .
much to the dismay of the conventional secular elite , the former foreign minister , abdullah gul , has become the new president .
in fact , very few people have a problem with mr gul 's personality .
he has been a successful , pro-eu diplomat and a mild and moderate voice within his party .
his public support for journalists and writers on trial has also brought him close to intellectuals .
today , in addition to his own electorate , he has the empathy and support of many in the intelligentsia and business circles .
interestingly , it was less mr gul himself than his wife who has been discussed and challenged - if not rejected - by the country 's mainstream elite .
idealised image in turkey today any debate on gender or women is almost instantly overshadowed by politics .
turkish ... society and culture is a harmonious fusion of seemingly opposite forces elif shafak women 's bodies and images have become ideological battlegrounds .
it is around the symbols of femininity that bleak political dilemmas revolve .
and among all the symbols of femininity none has been as problematic as the headscarf .
gender issues have always been vital in the consolidation of the modern turkish nation , founded by kemal ataturk after the collapse of the ottoman empire .
his reformist movement was unique among those emerging from the muslim world in that it ventured and managed to transform not only the public sphere but also the private sphere - the domain of mothers , wives and daughters .
eighty years on , today 's trouble with women with headscarves is that they do not fit into this picture of the idealised " modern turkish woman " .
women in spotlight with the gul presidency now in progress , the modern turkish nation state will for the first time have a first lady wearing a headscarf .
mrs gul 's headscarf has divided opinion among turks and here lies the crux of the problem .
that headscarf has been interpreted as the symbol of darker and deeper changes .
if the first lady wears a headscarf , maintain the secularist elite , the whole secular system could be undermined .
there is a lot of talk on the theme " how should an ideal turkish woman look ? "
newspapers , tv channels , radios , workshops , panels and conferences centre on this question .
interestingly , turkish women have been at the forefront of this debate .
it seems some of turkey 's westernised , modern , secularist women are determined to show their opposition to the " other " turkish women .
family traditions as a novelist , the linguistic jam in this whole debate is of great interest to me .
i can find more than eight different words in turkish , each of which stand for some form of headscarf .
yemeni , turbaan , esharp , charshaf - every one is different .
but this complexity is completely lost when they are all lumped together under the category of " the veil " .
turkish society , like its fashions , seeks to reconcile opposites when we talk about the headscarf now , words explain less and confuse more .
women wear the headscarf for different reasons .
most wear it out of habit or for utterly traditional reasons rather than political motives .
not all covered women are giving a political message .
similarly , not all covered women are " ignorant " or " repressed " .
more significantly , the structure of the turkish family constantly brings together covered and uncovered women .

manufacturers will have to start complying from october next year .
after a public consultation 15 images , including ones of diseased lungs , have been chosen to accompany text warnings about lung cancer and heart disease .
anti-smoking campaigners welcomed the move but smokers ' lobby group forest said they were being " victimised " .
health secretary alan johnson told bbc news there was evidence from other countries that the new images would help people quit .
" we do think it will help the number of people , who want to give up to smoking - the vast majority of smokers want to give up - and this will give them an extra push , " he said .
ec keen the graphic adverts come just over a month before the minimum age for buying tobacco in england and wales increases from 16 to 18 , bringing it in line with alcohol .
as well as publishing the legislation on wednesday , the department of health will unveil the 15 images - chosen from an original list of 40 - that are to be used . "
there 's a hardcore of smokers who say ' yes , yes but i 'm going to put my head in the sand " ' adam kirby , of advertising agency saatchi and saatchi in pictures : smoking warnings send us your comments the government promised it would introduce picture warnings on cigarette packets in its public health white paper in 2004 and in recent years the european commission has been urging member countries to do so as well .
the uk is the first eu country to publish the pictures on all tobacco products .
under the new rules , it is expected that cigarette packs with written warnings only will not be allowed on sale past september 30 next year .
for other tobacco packets , the deadline will be september 30 2009 .
ministers have said the current system of written warnings has become less effective .
' smokers deterred ' other countries such as canada and brazil have already introduced picture warnings and research shows it has been effective in raising awareness about the risks associated with smoking .
a study by canada 's university of waterloo earlier this year found that 15 % of canadian smokers had been deterred from having a cigarette - more than double the rate in australia and the us which had text warnings at the time of the research . "

manufacturers will have to start complying from october next year .
after a public consultation 15 images , including ones of diseased lungs , have been chosen to accompany text warnings about lung cancer and heart disease .
anti-smoking campaigners welcomed the move but smokers ' lobby group forest said they were being " victimised " .
health secretary alan johnson told bbc news there was evidence from other countries that the new images would help people quit .
" we do think it will help the number of people , who want to give up to smoking - the vast majority of smokers want to give up - and this will give them an extra push , " he said .
ec keen the graphic adverts come just over a month before the minimum age for buying tobacco in england and wales increases from 16 to 18 , bringing it in line with alcohol .
as well as publishing the legislation on wednesday , the department of health will unveil the 15 images - chosen from an original list of 40 - that are to be used .

the uk is the first eu country to publish the pictures on all tobacco products .
under the new rules , it is expected that cigarette packs with written warnings only will not be allowed on sale past september 30 next year .
for other tobacco packets , the deadline will be september 30 2009 .
ministers have said the current system of written warnings has become less effective .
' smokers deterred ' other countries such as canada and brazil have already introduced picture warnings and research shows it has been effective in raising awareness about the risks associated with smoking .
a study by canada 's university of waterloo earlier this year found that 15 % of canadian smokers had been deterred from having a cigarette - more than double the rate in australia and the us which had text warnings at the time of the research .
the government are bullying smokers simply because they can get away with it neil rafferty smokers ' lobby group forest amanda sandford , from anti-smoking campaigners ash , said she hoped the chosen images would be as graphic as possible .
" evidence from international studies is that the stronger warnings are better , " she said .
but neil rafferty , a spokesman for smokers ' lobby group forest , described the initiative as the " victimisation " of smokers .
" you could construct exactly the same argument for placing graphic images on bottles of alcohol , but because most people like to drink alcohol , the government does n't want to offend the majority .
" the government are bullying smokers simply because they can get away with it . "
smuggled tobacco adam kirby of advertising agency saatchi and saatchi told bbc radio 4 's today that he was particularly " revolted " by the images of rotten teeth , which looked like " broken gravestones " .
" i think it works with some people some of the time , " he said .
" but there 's a hardcore of smokers who say ' yes , yes but i 'm going to put my head in the sand ' . "
professor robert west of cancer research uk estimated between 5,000 - 10,000 people would stop smoking as a result of the adverts , saving around 2,500 lives a year .
but he said increasing the cost of smoking would make the biggest difference , particularly to the poorest sections of society .
" the government is facing a huge smuggling problem , " he said .
" smuggled tobacco is half the price of a regular pack and 40 % of tobacco is smuggled , mostly rolled tobacco .
" we need to bear down on that as much as we can . "
the legislation comes weeks after england came into line with the rest of the uk by banning smoking in enclosed public places , including pubs and restaurants .

it is feared that a squeeze on credit - the amount of money circulating in the banking system - could hurt companies and consumers .
but what does this market turbulence mean for your own personal finances ?
stocks and shares millions of britons own shares directly , accounting for about 13 % of the total value of companies on the london stock exchange .
investors have had a white-knuckle ride in the recent weeks with many billions wiped off the value of the uk 's top 100 publicly listed companies .
analysts have warned investors to expect continued turbulence as the extent of the credit problems affecting banks and their wider economic implications becomes clear .
investors worried about further falls always have the option to sell their shares for cash .
but investment experts advise that shares should be seen as long-term investments and decisions should not be made on the basis of daily , or weekly , fluctuations in value .
pension funds the health of personal and occupational pension schemes is linked to the performance of the stock market .
experts say recent falls knocked billions off the value of company pension schemes , which invest in individual company shares .
according to forecasts from actuaries aon consulting and lane , clark & peacock , ftse 100 companies had a combined deficit in their final salary pension schemes of between £ 15bn and £ 26bn by the end of thursday , 16 august .
some city firms are said to have frozen recruitment this compared with estimated surpluses of between £ 9bn and £ 12bn in company schemes before the recent market turbulence began in july .
companies have steadily been rebuilding their pension schemes since the collapse of the dotcom boom in 2000 sent markets reeling .
people nearing retirement and not on a guaranteed-benefit pension could feel the effects of the market turmoil because they may not have time to make up any losses incurred .
but aon 's marcus hurd said people should not overreact to the current situation and " should n't get too concerned about one week of falls " .
mortgages the wave of mortgage defaults in the us has raised the spectre of similar problems in the uk and cast doubt over how much longer the house-price boom can be sustained .
house repossessions in the uk rose 30 % in the first six months of 2007 while research by credit rating firm fitch argued that the uk housing market was among the most over-valued in europe .
concerns surround the number of people with variable-rate mortgages , which are particularly sensitive to rising interest rates .
experts believe the us mortgage crisis will not be repeated in the uk pressure on people to meet their mortgage payments , particularly in london and the south east , where rising prices have forced many homeowners to borrow up to the hilt to get on the housing ladder , is also a worry .
but experts say lending conditions are much stiffer than in the us , while the market is being underpinned by strong demand , a shortage of new homes and a robust economy .
recent data showing a fall in inflation , allied to concerns about market instability , means many experts feel the bank of england will refrain from further rate rises for the time being .
" much will clearly depend on how inflation , growth and financial markets develop over the coming weeks , " said howard archer , chief economist with global insight .
job security the favourable economic conditions of recent years - with low interest rates making credit cheaply available - has helped companies expand and fuelled a takeover boom .
but there are clear signs of retrenchment in the financial sector , with firms struggling to find buyers for the debt needed to fund multi-billion pound deals .
jonathan said , from the centre for economics and business research , told the bbc that up to 5,000 jobs may go as a result of the recent turmoil , and that 2007 bonuses will fall by up to 15 % .
