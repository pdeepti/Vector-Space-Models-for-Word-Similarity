program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de middle east -pipe- 15.06.2007 opinion : international deployment in gaza would be useless großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli prime minister ehud olmert said that " serious consideration " should be given to deploying international forces along the gaza-egypt border .
dw 's peter philipp does n't think that this is a good idea . it 's intriguing that a call for stationing international troops in gaza should come from israel , the country which in the course of its history always vehemently opposed such operations .
israel , however , did n't change its attitude about the gaza strip because it wants to support a peace-promoting initiative .
the whole purpose of the exercise is to primarily pull the rug from under hamas ' feet by cutting their weapon supplies .
fatah , on the other hand , would keep getting armed , even from israel itself .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it is , therefore , no wonder that hamas rejected the idea of international forces and threatened to treat them as an occupying power .
it would be a mistake for anybody - whether in brussels or washington - to think seriously about acting on israel 's offer .
unlike south lebanon , where a un force -lrb- unifil -rrb- has been trying for years to support the re-assertion of lebanese state sovereignty , the gaza strip is no sovereign state .
it is , instead , an area marked by a struggle for power .
it would be unimaginable for either europeans or americans to have even the remotest interest in trying to maintain order there .
and even as a border patrol , the deployment would be useless .
if the smuggling of weapons to the gaza strip were really to be cut off , then egypt would be in the best position to do it : it controls the southern side of the gaza border and should be able to prevent the smuggling of weapons from its territory .
in general , not only egypt but also other arab countries should get involved : the arab league welcomed the formation of the palestinian unity government ; it has always treated the palestine conflict as its central subject and it should have a strong interest in preventing the escalation of violence in gaza - especially after it presented its own peace plan in beirut and riad .
the arab league can not allow all this to fall through because of the power struggle between hamas and fatah , let alone because no arab leader has an interest in a hamas-controlled unit in gaza .
the arab league should perhaps establish its own deployment force and send it to gaza : its contingent would be in the eyes of hamas and fatah much less suspicious than the europeans or the americans , and the league could prove for the first time in its history that it 's capable of more than making proclamations and passing resolutions .
and if that did happen , one could count on israel rejecting international troops again .
that 's not how olmert 's government imagined the whole affair .

dw 's peter philipp does n't think that this is a good idea . it 's intriguing that a call for stationing international troops in gaza should come from israel , the country which in the course of its history always vehemently opposed such operations .
israel , however , did n't change its attitude about the gaza strip because it wants to support a peace-promoting initiative .
the whole purpose of the exercise is to primarily pull the rug from under hamas ' feet by cutting their weapon supplies .
fatah , on the other hand , would keep getting armed , even from israel itself .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it is , therefore , no wonder that hamas rejected the idea of international forces and threatened to treat them as an occupying power .
it would be a mistake for anybody - whether in brussels or washington - to think seriously about acting on israel 's offer .
unlike south lebanon , where a un force -lrb- unifil -rrb- has been trying for years to support the re-assertion of lebanese state sovereignty , the gaza strip is no sovereign state .
it is , instead , an area marked by a struggle for power .
it would be unimaginable for either europeans or americans to have even the remotest interest in trying to maintain order there .
and even as a border patrol , the deployment would be useless .
if the smuggling of weapons to the gaza strip were really to be cut off , then egypt would be in the best position to do it : it controls the southern side of the gaza border and should be able to prevent the smuggling of weapons from its territory .
in general , not only egypt but also other arab countries should get involved : the arab league welcomed the formation of the palestinian unity government ; it has always treated the palestine conflict as its central subject and it should have a strong interest in preventing the escalation of violence in gaza - especially after it presented its own peace plan in beirut and riad .
the arab league can not allow all this to fall through because of the power struggle between hamas and fatah , let alone because no arab leader has an interest in a hamas-controlled unit in gaza .
the arab league should perhaps establish its own deployment force and send it to gaza : its contingent would be in the eyes of hamas and fatah much less suspicious than the europeans or the americans , and the league could prove for the first time in its history that it 's capable of more than making proclamations and passing resolutions .
and if that did happen , one could count on israel rejecting international troops again .
that 's not how olmert 's government imagined the whole affair .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de music -pipe- 15.06.2007 wagner festival throws international spotlight on small town großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wagner festival is a spectacle of drama and passion every summer , the richard wagner festival in the southern german city of bayreuth attracts international attention and the wait for tickets can take years .
why does this prestigious event take place in a small town ? four centuries ago , margrave christian established his residence in bayreuth .
later , the prussian margrave wilhelmine , sister of frederick the great and a dedicated patron of the arts , transformed the princely residence into an arts center and a baroque jewel .
the city 's distinctive landmarks include the " new palace " with its courtly gardens , the " eremitage castle park " and the margrave 's opera house , considered europe 's most beautiful baroque theater .
it all began with a dream but the picturesque bavarian city remains best known for its association with the operatic composer richard wagner who lived in bayreuth from 1872 until his death in 1883 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : richard wagner remains bayreuth 's most famous son wagner , composer , playwright and theater director all rolled into one , dreamed of a gesamtkunstwerk , -lrb- a total work of art -rrb- , that is , a perfect blend of poetry , song and drama .
the established theaters in the big cities were completely inadequate for staging plans of that scale .
so wagner considered staging his own festival .
the margrave 's opera house in bayreuth , which then had the biggest stage in the german speaking lands , came to his attention .
in early 1871 , joined by his wife cosima , wagner traveled to bayreuth .
but he soon realized that a baroque theater with balconies would be unsuitable for his festival idea .
" however , the unique charm and the location of the friendly city itself were what i had been wishing for , " he wrote .
" an utterly beautiful and generous plot of land not far from the town was given to me as a gift and for the purpose of building the theater i had in mind . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bayreuth festspielhaus or opera house the cornerstone to wagner 's festspielhaus was laid in 1872 .
in it , wagner enclosed a piece of paper with the inscription : " herein i enclose a secret , may it rest for a hundred years .
as long as it is protected by stone , it will reveal itself to the world . "
the rich and famous the bayreuth festspielhaus is both a world cultural monument and an ultramodern theater reserved exclusively for the works of richard wagner .
in the evenings , the stage is set alight by dramatic scenes from the germanic legends .
but from early morning , the grounds outdoors are populated by ticket seekers .
the official route to festival admission can involve a wait of seven years or longer .
the number of people seeking tickets exceeds that of tickets available by a factor of 10 to one .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel and her husband have become regulars at the festival on opening day , bayreuth is a firework of myth , fashion and media , where presidents and corporate bosses rub shoulders with show business celebrities .
less sensational are the many music critics on hand , who convey every nuance of the performances inside to the world outside , upholding bayreuth 's status as a musical nerve center of the nation and of the theater world .
since 1876 , the bayreuth festival has accompanied every high and low point of german history .
its current director is a grandson of the composer : 87-year-old wolfgang wagner , who has run the festival since 1951 .
the wagner family , however , has been dogged by a feud over who should run the festival in future .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : katharina wagner could take over the reins of the festival there is speculation that wolfgang wagner 's youngest daughter , katharina could be a possible successor .
the 29-year old has earned some critical acclaim as an opera director on other stages .
the coming season starts on july 25 with katharina wagner 's first production in bayreuth .

the organization , whose primary goal is to improve living conditions of people in developing regions , reached a milestone of a different kind on wednesday as it released financial figures for 2006 .
for the first time , the gtz 's business volume surpassed the one billion euro mark .
turnover rose to a total of 917.8 million euros -lrb- $ 1,221.42 million -rrb- , marking an increase of 4.8 percent over the previous year .
in the case of charitable donations , the group took in a whopping 770 million euros - a rise of 11 percent on last year .
aid contracts from around the world wolfgang schmitt , director of the organization , said the extraordinarily good figures mirrored the high esteem that the gtz is held in for its work not just in germany but around the world .
" there 's been a trend in the past years that others donors , industrialized countries and other developing nations have been increasingly supplying their own funds to engage the gtz , " he said .
" the trend has been continuing and so we can now almost speak of records . "

the un refugee agency , unhcr , was the biggest player here by bankrolling the gtz with 21 million euros .
the gtz also raked in a host of contracts from around the world - the ethiopian government built a network of health care centers with the help of development experts from the gtz and even institutions such as the world bank and the eu commission hired the services of the german aid group .
recipe to success schmitt emphasized that the gtz had become something of a world leader in the field of developmental aid .
the recipe to its success is the gtz 's focus on long-term goals and sustainability as opposed to other aid organizations , schmitt said .
" there 's a tendency in the development industry to score quick successes , " schmitt said .
" but if you look at the problems and responsibilities in the field , then you realize that these are things for which even europe needed centuries to overcome .
that 's why you need to have patience and stamina when it comes to development and cooperation . "

the recipe to its success is the gtz 's focus on long-term goals and sustainability as opposed to other aid organizations , schmitt said .
" there 's a tendency in the development industry to score quick successes , " schmitt said .
" but if you look at the problems and responsibilities in the field , then you realize that these are things for which even europe needed centuries to overcome .
that 's why you need to have patience and stamina when it comes to development and cooperation . "
rosy future bernd eisenblätter , another gtz director , said the organization tended to attract skilled and highly qualified applicants around the world . last year , the number of gtz experts sent abroad rose by 4.8 percent to 1,100 persons .
most of them -lrb- 39 percent -rrb- work in africa .
" we get many more applicants than we can hire , even on a limited basis , " eisenblätter said .
" they 're highly-motivated , highly-qualified and 60 to 70 percent of them are women .

the organization , whose primary goal is to improve living conditions of people in developing regions , reached a milestone of a different kind on wednesday as it released financial figures for 2006 .
for the first time , the gtz 's business volume surpassed the one billion euro mark .
turnover rose to a total of 917.8 million euros -lrb- $ 1,221.42 million -rrb- , marking an increase of 4.8 percent over the previous year .
in the case of charitable donations , the group took in a whopping 770 million euros - a rise of 11 percent on last year .
aid contracts from around the world wolfgang schmitt , director of the organization , said the extraordinarily good figures mirrored the high esteem that the gtz is held in for its work not just in germany but around the world .
" there 's been a trend in the past years that others donors , industrialized countries and other developing nations have been increasingly supplying their own funds to engage the gtz , " he said .
" the trend has been continuing and so we can now almost speak of records . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul the gtz 's main employer last year remained the german ministry for economic cooperation and development which handed the aid group more than 700 million euros to realize development projects in africa and other regions .

why does this prestigious event take place in a small town ? four centuries ago , margrave christian established his residence in bayreuth .
later , the prussian margrave wilhelmine , sister of frederick the great and a dedicated patron of the arts , transformed the princely residence into an arts center and a baroque jewel .
the city 's distinctive landmarks include the " new palace " with its courtly gardens , the " eremitage castle park " and the margrave 's opera house , considered europe 's most beautiful baroque theater .
it all began with a dream but the picturesque bavarian city remains best known for its association with the operatic composer richard wagner who lived in bayreuth from 1872 until his death in 1883 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : richard wagner remains bayreuth 's most famous son wagner , composer , playwright and theater director all rolled into one , dreamed of a gesamtkunstwerk , -lrb- a total work of art -rrb- , that is , a perfect blend of poetry , song and drama .
the established theaters in the big cities were completely inadequate for staging plans of that scale .
so wagner considered staging his own festival .
the margrave 's opera house in bayreuth , which then had the biggest stage in the german speaking lands , came to his attention .
in early 1871 , joined by his wife cosima , wagner traveled to bayreuth .
but he soon realized that a baroque theater with balconies would be unsuitable for his festival idea .
" however , the unique charm and the location of the friendly city itself were what i had been wishing for , " he wrote .

as long as it is protected by stone , it will reveal itself to the world . "
the rich and famous the bayreuth festspielhaus is both a world cultural monument and an ultramodern theater reserved exclusively for the works of richard wagner .
in the evenings , the stage is set alight by dramatic scenes from the germanic legends .
but from early morning , the grounds outdoors are populated by ticket seekers .
the official route to festival admission can involve a wait of seven years or longer .
the number of people seeking tickets exceeds that of tickets available by a factor of 10 to one .

less sensational are the many music critics on hand , who convey every nuance of the performances inside to the world outside , upholding bayreuth 's status as a musical nerve center of the nation and of the theater world .
since 1876 , the bayreuth festival has accompanied every high and low point of german history .
its current director is a grandson of the composer : 87-year-old wolfgang wagner , who has run the festival since 1951 .
the wagner family , however , has been dogged by a feud over who should run the festival in future .

german soldiers killed nearly 80 percent of the south west africa tribe during colonial rule more than 100 years ago . in 1904 in the german territory of south west africa , today 's namibia , german troops led by general lothar von trotha mercilessly put down a rebellion of the indigenous herero people .
general von trotha once remarked he wanted to exterminate " the revolting tribes in rivers of blood . "
by the time the conflict ended four years later , between 45,000 to 65,000 herero were killed , many of whom suffered in work camps some consider the forerunners to wwii-era concentration camps .
germany 's development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul publically apologized for the genocide three years ago .
so far , successive german governments have refused to enter into any discussions on possible reparations .
decrying " business as ususal " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : henrik witboi was a herero chief but germany 's left party wants to begin talks between germany and namibia that could lead to monetary compensation .
hüseyin aydin , spokesperson for the left party , said the acknowledgement of a genocide meant no one could continue with business as usual .
members of the ruling coalition made up of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- voiced opposition to the idea of reparations .
anke eimer of the cdu said " isolated views " in favor of reparations did not reflect the general opinion in namibia .
gert weisskirchen of the spd expressed his disgust at the killings but rejected what he called intentions of the left party " to instrumentalize the sufferings " of the herero and nama people .
he also reminded parliament of germany 's generous development aid to namibia .
a request for dialogue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a herero woman wearing the traditional hat chief kuaima riruako , the traditional leader of the herero people , attended the wednesday parliamentary debate with his wife , who was dressed in traditional herero style with the unique broad hat .
earlier wednesday , riruako had thanked the left party for its initiative .
he also expressed satisfaction that munich had changed general von trotha street to herero street .
" more than 100 years after the fateful war against my people i am not here to seek revenge against anybody , " riruako told deutsche welle .
" i have only been appealing to the government of the federal republic of germany for a dialogue so that we can talk about our colonial experience . "
the herero never completely recovered from the conflict and of the around 100,000 that today live in namibia many live in poverty or work on the farms of white landowners .
in 2001 , tribal leaders tried to sue germany for compensation in us courts , but the claim for $ 4 billion -lrb- 3.12 billion euros -rrb- never went very far .
they also want reparations from deutsche bank , which allegedly profited from the forced labor in the camps .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de development aid -pipe- 15.06.2007 german aid group scores major financial success großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : improving the water supply in developing regions remains an essential goal of the gtz one of the best known aid and development organizations worldwide , germany 's gtz registered a record business volume last year as international donors in the public and private sectors lined up to hand it aid contracts . whether it 's improving the water supply in africa , introducing renewable energy in china , laying wells in afghanistan or promoting democracy in south america , the german-based gtz aid group is active worldwide .
the organization , whose primary goal is to improve living conditions of people in developing regions , reached a milestone of a different kind on wednesday as it released financial figures for 2006 .
for the first time , the gtz 's business volume surpassed the one billion euro mark .
turnover rose to a total of 917.8 million euros -lrb- $ 1,221.42 million -rrb- , marking an increase of 4.8 percent over the previous year .
in the case of charitable donations , the group took in a whopping 770 million euros - a rise of 11 percent on last year .
aid contracts from around the world wolfgang schmitt , director of the organization , said the extraordinarily good figures mirrored the high esteem that the gtz is held in for its work not just in germany but around the world .
" there 's been a trend in the past years that others donors , industrialized countries and other developing nations have been increasingly supplying their own funds to engage the gtz , " he said .
" the trend has been continuing and so we can now almost speak of records . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul the gtz 's main employer last year remained the german ministry for economic cooperation and development which handed the aid group more than 700 million euros to realize development projects in africa and other regions .
but even co-financed projects , where third parties supply additional funds for projects that the gtz carries out for the german development ministry , got a huge boost last year by rising 29 percent to 61 million euros .
the un refugee agency , unhcr , was the biggest player here by bankrolling the gtz with 21 million euros .
the gtz also raked in a host of contracts from around the world - the ethiopian government built a network of health care centers with the help of development experts from the gtz and even institutions such as the world bank and the eu commission hired the services of the german aid group .
recipe to success schmitt emphasized that the gtz had become something of a world leader in the field of developmental aid .
the recipe to its success is the gtz 's focus on long-term goals and sustainability as opposed to other aid organizations , schmitt said .
" there 's a tendency in the development industry to score quick successes , " schmitt said .
" but if you look at the problems and responsibilities in the field , then you realize that these are things for which even europe needed centuries to overcome .
that 's why you need to have patience and stamina when it comes to development and cooperation . "
rosy future bernd eisenblätter , another gtz director , said the organization tended to attract skilled and highly qualified applicants around the world . last year , the number of gtz experts sent abroad rose by 4.8 percent to 1,100 persons .
most of them -lrb- 39 percent -rrb- work in africa .
" we get many more applicants than we can hire , even on a limited basis , " eisenblätter said .
" they 're highly-motivated , highly-qualified and 60 to 70 percent of them are women .
that 's why i 'm not worried at all about the future of the gtz .
it shows there 's huge potential and a huge interest in the field of development work and in the gtz . " dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de middle east -pipe- 15.06.2007 opinion : international deployment in gaza would be useless großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli prime minister ehud olmert said that " serious consideration " should be given to deploying international forces along the gaza-egypt border .
dw 's peter philipp does n't think that this is a good idea . it 's intriguing that a call for stationing international troops in gaza should come from israel , the country which in the course of its history always vehemently opposed such operations .
israel , however , did n't change its attitude about the gaza strip because it wants to support a peace-promoting initiative .
the whole purpose of the exercise is to primarily pull the rug from under hamas ' feet by cutting their weapon supplies .
fatah , on the other hand , would keep getting armed , even from israel itself .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it is , therefore , no wonder that hamas rejected the idea of international forces and threatened to treat them as an occupying power .
it would be a mistake for anybody - whether in brussels or washington - to think seriously about acting on israel 's offer .
unlike south lebanon , where a un force -lrb- unifil -rrb- has been trying for years to support the re-assertion of lebanese state sovereignty , the gaza strip is no sovereign state .
it is , instead , an area marked by a struggle for power .
it would be unimaginable for either europeans or americans to have even the remotest interest in trying to maintain order there .
and even as a border patrol , the deployment would be useless .
if the smuggling of weapons to the gaza strip were really to be cut off , then egypt would be in the best position to do it : it controls the southern side of the gaza border and should be able to prevent the smuggling of weapons from its territory .
in general , not only egypt but also other arab countries should get involved : the arab league welcomed the formation of the palestinian unity government ; it has always treated the palestine conflict as its central subject and it should have a strong interest in preventing the escalation of violence in gaza - especially after it presented its own peace plan in beirut and riad .
the arab league can not allow all this to fall through because of the power struggle between hamas and fatah , let alone because no arab leader has an interest in a hamas-controlled unit in gaza .
the arab league should perhaps establish its own deployment force and send it to gaza : its contingent would be in the eyes of hamas and fatah much less suspicious than the europeans or the americans , and the league could prove for the first time in its history that it 's capable of more than making proclamations and passing resolutions .
and if that did happen , one could count on israel rejecting international troops again .
that 's not how olmert 's government imagined the whole affair .

german soldiers killed nearly 80 percent of the south west africa tribe during colonial rule more than 100 years ago . in 1904 in the german territory of south west africa , today 's namibia , german troops led by general lothar von trotha mercilessly put down a rebellion of the indigenous herero people .
general von trotha once remarked he wanted to exterminate " the revolting tribes in rivers of blood . "
by the time the conflict ended four years later , between 45,000 to 65,000 herero were killed , many of whom suffered in work camps some consider the forerunners to wwii-era concentration camps .
germany 's development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul publically apologized for the genocide three years ago .
so far , successive german governments have refused to enter into any discussions on possible reparations .
decrying " business as ususal " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : henrik witboi was a herero chief but germany 's left party wants to begin talks between germany and namibia that could lead to monetary compensation .
hüseyin aydin , spokesperson for the left party , said the acknowledgement of a genocide meant no one could continue with business as usual .
members of the ruling coalition made up of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- voiced opposition to the idea of reparations .
anke eimer of the cdu said " isolated views " in favor of reparations did not reflect the general opinion in namibia .
gert weisskirchen of the spd expressed his disgust at the killings but rejected what he called intentions of the left party " to instrumentalize the sufferings " of the herero and nama people .
he also reminded parliament of germany 's generous development aid to namibia .
a request for dialogue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a herero woman wearing the traditional hat chief kuaima riruako , the traditional leader of the herero people , attended the wednesday parliamentary debate with his wife , who was dressed in traditional herero style with the unique broad hat .
earlier wednesday , riruako had thanked the left party for its initiative .
he also expressed satisfaction that munich had changed general von trotha street to herero street .
" more than 100 years after the fateful war against my people i am not here to seek revenge against anybody , " riruako told deutsche welle .
" i have only been appealing to the government of the federal republic of germany for a dialogue so that we can talk about our colonial experience . "
the herero never completely recovered from the conflict and of the around 100,000 that today live in namibia many live in poverty or work on the farms of white landowners .
in 2001 , tribal leaders tried to sue germany for compensation in us courts , but the claim for $ 4 billion -lrb- 3.12 billion euros -rrb- never went very far .
they also want reparations from deutsche bank , which allegedly profited from the forced labor in the camps .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de music -pipe- 15.06.2007 wagner festival throws international spotlight on small town großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wagner festival is a spectacle of drama and passion every summer , the richard wagner festival in the southern german city of bayreuth attracts international attention and the wait for tickets can take years .
why does this prestigious event take place in a small town ? four centuries ago , margrave christian established his residence in bayreuth .
later , the prussian margrave wilhelmine , sister of frederick the great and a dedicated patron of the arts , transformed the princely residence into an arts center and a baroque jewel .
the city 's distinctive landmarks include the " new palace " with its courtly gardens , the " eremitage castle park " and the margrave 's opera house , considered europe 's most beautiful baroque theater .
it all began with a dream but the picturesque bavarian city remains best known for its association with the operatic composer richard wagner who lived in bayreuth from 1872 until his death in 1883 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : richard wagner remains bayreuth 's most famous son wagner , composer , playwright and theater director all rolled into one , dreamed of a gesamtkunstwerk , -lrb- a total work of art -rrb- , that is , a perfect blend of poetry , song and drama .
the established theaters in the big cities were completely inadequate for staging plans of that scale .
so wagner considered staging his own festival .
the margrave 's opera house in bayreuth , which then had the biggest stage in the german speaking lands , came to his attention .
in early 1871 , joined by his wife cosima , wagner traveled to bayreuth .
but he soon realized that a baroque theater with balconies would be unsuitable for his festival idea .
" however , the unique charm and the location of the friendly city itself were what i had been wishing for , " he wrote .
" an utterly beautiful and generous plot of land not far from the town was given to me as a gift and for the purpose of building the theater i had in mind . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bayreuth festspielhaus or opera house the cornerstone to wagner 's festspielhaus was laid in 1872 .
in it , wagner enclosed a piece of paper with the inscription : " herein i enclose a secret , may it rest for a hundred years .
as long as it is protected by stone , it will reveal itself to the world . "
the rich and famous the bayreuth festspielhaus is both a world cultural monument and an ultramodern theater reserved exclusively for the works of richard wagner .
in the evenings , the stage is set alight by dramatic scenes from the germanic legends .
but from early morning , the grounds outdoors are populated by ticket seekers .
the official route to festival admission can involve a wait of seven years or longer .
the number of people seeking tickets exceeds that of tickets available by a factor of 10 to one .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel and her husband have become regulars at the festival on opening day , bayreuth is a firework of myth , fashion and media , where presidents and corporate bosses rub shoulders with show business celebrities .
less sensational are the many music critics on hand , who convey every nuance of the performances inside to the world outside , upholding bayreuth 's status as a musical nerve center of the nation and of the theater world .

german soldiers killed nearly 80 percent of the south west africa tribe during colonial rule more than 100 years ago . in 1904 in the german territory of south west africa , today 's namibia , german troops led by general lothar von trotha mercilessly put down a rebellion of the indigenous herero people .
general von trotha once remarked he wanted to exterminate " the revolting tribes in rivers of blood . "
by the time the conflict ended four years later , between 45,000 to 65,000 herero were killed , many of whom suffered in work camps some consider the forerunners to wwii-era concentration camps .
germany 's development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul publically apologized for the genocide three years ago .
so far , successive german governments have refused to enter into any discussions on possible reparations .
decrying " business as ususal " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : henrik witboi was a herero chief but germany 's left party wants to begin talks between germany and namibia that could lead to monetary compensation .
hüseyin aydin , spokesperson for the left party , said the acknowledgement of a genocide meant no one could continue with business as usual .
members of the ruling coalition made up of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- voiced opposition to the idea of reparations .
anke eimer of the cdu said " isolated views " in favor of reparations did not reflect the general opinion in namibia .
gert weisskirchen of the spd expressed his disgust at the killings but rejected what he called intentions of the left party " to instrumentalize the sufferings " of the herero and nama people .
he also reminded parliament of germany 's generous development aid to namibia .
a request for dialogue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a herero woman wearing the traditional hat chief kuaima riruako , the traditional leader of the herero people , attended the wednesday parliamentary debate with his wife , who was dressed in traditional herero style with the unique broad hat .
earlier wednesday , riruako had thanked the left party for its initiative .
he also expressed satisfaction that munich had changed general von trotha street to herero street .
" more than 100 years after the fateful war against my people i am not here to seek revenge against anybody , " riruako told deutsche welle .
" i have only been appealing to the government of the federal republic of germany for a dialogue so that we can talk about our colonial experience . "
the herero never completely recovered from the conflict and of the around 100,000 that today live in namibia many live in poverty or work on the farms of white landowners .
in 2001 , tribal leaders tried to sue germany for compensation in us courts , but the claim for $ 4 billion -lrb- 3.12 billion euros -rrb- never went very far .
they also want reparations from deutsche bank , which allegedly profited from the forced labor in the camps .
the german parliament 's motion on reparations was referred to some committees of the parliament .
a final vote is not expected until the fall .
observers doubt the ruling coalition will vote in favor of reparations . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

why does this prestigious event take place in a small town ? four centuries ago , margrave christian established his residence in bayreuth .
later , the prussian margrave wilhelmine , sister of frederick the great and a dedicated patron of the arts , transformed the princely residence into an arts center and a baroque jewel .
the city 's distinctive landmarks include the " new palace " with its courtly gardens , the " eremitage castle park " and the margrave 's opera house , considered europe 's most beautiful baroque theater .
it all began with a dream but the picturesque bavarian city remains best known for its association with the operatic composer richard wagner who lived in bayreuth from 1872 until his death in 1883 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : richard wagner remains bayreuth 's most famous son wagner , composer , playwright and theater director all rolled into one , dreamed of a gesamtkunstwerk , -lrb- a total work of art -rrb- , that is , a perfect blend of poetry , song and drama .
the established theaters in the big cities were completely inadequate for staging plans of that scale .
so wagner considered staging his own festival .
the margrave 's opera house in bayreuth , which then had the biggest stage in the german speaking lands , came to his attention .
in early 1871 , joined by his wife cosima , wagner traveled to bayreuth .
but he soon realized that a baroque theater with balconies would be unsuitable for his festival idea .
" however , the unique charm and the location of the friendly city itself were what i had been wishing for , " he wrote .
" an utterly beautiful and generous plot of land not far from the town was given to me as a gift and for the purpose of building the theater i had in mind . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bayreuth festspielhaus or opera house the cornerstone to wagner 's festspielhaus was laid in 1872 .
in it , wagner enclosed a piece of paper with the inscription : " herein i enclose a secret , may it rest for a hundred years .
as long as it is protected by stone , it will reveal itself to the world . "
the rich and famous the bayreuth festspielhaus is both a world cultural monument and an ultramodern theater reserved exclusively for the works of richard wagner .
in the evenings , the stage is set alight by dramatic scenes from the germanic legends .
but from early morning , the grounds outdoors are populated by ticket seekers .
the official route to festival admission can involve a wait of seven years or longer .
the number of people seeking tickets exceeds that of tickets available by a factor of 10 to one .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel and her husband have become regulars at the festival on opening day , bayreuth is a firework of myth , fashion and media , where presidents and corporate bosses rub shoulders with show business celebrities .
less sensational are the many music critics on hand , who convey every nuance of the performances inside to the world outside , upholding bayreuth 's status as a musical nerve center of the nation and of the theater world .
since 1876 , the bayreuth festival has accompanied every high and low point of german history .
its current director is a grandson of the composer : 87-year-old wolfgang wagner , who has run the festival since 1951 .
the wagner family , however , has been dogged by a feud over who should run the festival in future .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world war ii -pipe- 15.06.2007 us wartime treatment of germans may get new look großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at 17 , eberhard fuhr was sent to a camp for four years .
now he lectures on his experience after six years of trying , a us senator has made progress toward establishing a committee to examine the possible mistreatment of some german-americans during world war ii . some disappeared under cover of night ; others were taken during raids on their place of employment .
about a third were kidnapped by us agents in other countries and brought to the us by force .
none had a lawyer , and none were charged with or convicted of a crime .
many were imprisoned for the duration of the war , and even after .
terror suspects bound for guantanamo bay ?
not quite .
the scenario applied to thousands of german-americans during world war ii , whose experience of wartime internment has so far had little publicity , and even less sympathy , in the us .
the story of how the us treated japanese-americans during world war ii is well known .
some 120,000 men , women and children living on the west coast , the majority of them us citizens , were stripped of their property and sent to remote " war relocation camps " in the interior of the country .
bildunterschrift : activities were part of camp life ; here , the sports club but the plight of the 11,000 german resident aliens who were also sent to wartime internment in the us has gotten little attention so far .
earlier this month , us senator russ feingold of wisconsin , whose constituency is heavily german-american , took a step toward changing that .
for the past six years , feingold has been trying to pass a bill to create a commission that would examine the us treatment of interned german-americans - as well as italians and other europeans - during world war ii .
a second commission would look at the treatment of jewish refugees fleeing persecution .
" these people are dying " a stand-alone bill on the " wartime treatment study act " has been blocked repeatedly over the last six years by an anonymous republican senator .
now the legislation - which was passed in the form of an amendment to the controversial immigration bill - is uncertain .
" it is so urgent that we pass this legislation , " the liberal democrat feingold said when he introduced the amendment .
" we can not wait any longer … the people who were affected by these policies are dying . "
congress " did the right thing by recognizing and apologizing for the mistreatment of japanese-americans during world war ii , " feingold said .
" but our work in this area is not done . "
no reparations - just accounting bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of japanese were sent from the coast to the middle of the country unlike surviving japanese americans , who were awarded $ 1.2 billion in reparations in 1988 as part of the modern " redress movement , " feingold 's amendment does not seek reparations for the interned germans or their families .
rather , it would " simply review the facts and circumstances the us government 's treatment of german-americans , italian-americans and other european-americans during world war ii . "
survivors from the era and historians alike have made clear that the situation in the camps was far from dire , and that the detainees were , on the whole , treated humanely .
and many observers have seized the debate as a chance to slam the idea of creating a congressional commission to examine 60-year-old events .
but stephen fox , a historian and the author of " fear itself : inside the fbi roundup of german americans during world war ii : the past as prologue , " argues that it is , indeed , important for the government to own up to past actions - especially in light of the current government 's " war on terror " and the newly casual attitudes toward civil liberties .
parallels with guantanamo ?
in an introduction to his book , which contains oral histories and justice department documentation on 50 internees , fox argues : " the most damning aspects of the american internment experience were decisions to hold persons for indeterminate periods on the basis of their political views , their attitudes toward authority , and their personalities - even after it had been determined they were not dangerous . "
bildunterschrift : in us camps , detainees slept in bunkhouses today , americans are " attuned and sensitive to the issue that guantanamo , abu ghraib , and racial profiling here in the us post 9/11 , where people are rounded up and held indeterminately , are invasions of the bill of rights and the constitution , " fox said .
the fact that japanese-american internees were officially acknowledged in the 1980s angered a lot of the surviving germans , fox claimed .
" because they were in the same camps , they thought they should be treated equally , " he said .
but he noted there are two " core problems " in stirring up public sympathy for german-americans from that era .
the first is hitler and the holocaust , which he called " a hurdle german-americans will have a hard time overcoming . "
the other problem is 9/11 , fox said .
" that made it hard for people to have sympathy for people who attack us … and german-americans were perceived during world war ii as enemies of the country . "
numbers are " not too significant " american historian eric kurlander , currently a research fellow at the university of cologne in germany , also advocates studying the past as a way to avoid repeating mistakes .
but , he argued , " there are certainly more significant examples of authoritarian handling of suspects . "
while careful to say that " every individual who suffered detainment deserves to have their stories told , " kurlander said he could think of other things that warrant more urgent attention from congress .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fort lincoln camp , circa 1943 the problem is , that compared to the huge german-american population in the us at the time , the number of german-americans who were detained is miniscule , kurlander argued .
" you 're in the middle of an extremely destructive war with germany .
there are millions of soldiers on the battlefields , spies , double agents , and 50 million deaths world wide , " kurlander explained .
meanwhile , " tens and hundreds of thousands of people in every country had their lives displaced and disrupted ; they had to flee to the countryside and live in conditions little better than at camps . "
" anyone wrongly put in jail has reason to complain , " kurlander acknowledged .
" but given the scale of crimes committed in that war - by the russian and german governments , and what we ourselves were doing in the pacific to the pows and women and children there … detaining 10 or 11,000 people over a period of three years - we are not talking about anything too significant .

not quite .
the scenario applied to thousands of german-americans during world war ii , whose experience of wartime internment has so far had little publicity , and even less sympathy , in the us .
the story of how the us treated japanese-americans during world war ii is well known .

earlier this month , us senator russ feingold of wisconsin , whose constituency is heavily german-american , took a step toward changing that .
for the past six years , feingold has been trying to pass a bill to create a commission that would examine the us treatment of interned german-americans - as well as italians and other europeans - during world war ii .
a second commission would look at the treatment of jewish refugees fleeing persecution .
" these people are dying " a stand-alone bill on the " wartime treatment study act " has been blocked repeatedly over the last six years by an anonymous republican senator .
now the legislation - which was passed in the form of an amendment to the controversial immigration bill - is uncertain .
" it is so urgent that we pass this legislation , " the liberal democrat feingold said when he introduced the amendment .
" we can not wait any longer … the people who were affected by these policies are dying . "

earlier this month , us senator russ feingold of wisconsin , whose constituency is heavily german-american , took a step toward changing that .
for the past six years , feingold has been trying to pass a bill to create a commission that would examine the us treatment of interned german-americans - as well as italians and other europeans - during world war ii .
a second commission would look at the treatment of jewish refugees fleeing persecution .
" these people are dying " a stand-alone bill on the " wartime treatment study act " has been blocked repeatedly over the last six years by an anonymous republican senator .
now the legislation - which was passed in the form of an amendment to the controversial immigration bill - is uncertain .
" it is so urgent that we pass this legislation , " the liberal democrat feingold said when he introduced the amendment .
" we can not wait any longer … the people who were affected by these policies are dying . "

rather , it would " simply review the facts and circumstances the us government 's treatment of german-americans , italian-americans and other european-americans during world war ii . "
survivors from the era and historians alike have made clear that the situation in the camps was far from dire , and that the detainees were , on the whole , treated humanely .
and many observers have seized the debate as a chance to slam the idea of creating a congressional commission to examine 60-year-old events .
but stephen fox , a historian and the author of " fear itself : inside the fbi roundup of german americans during world war ii : the past as prologue , " argues that it is , indeed , important for the government to own up to past actions - especially in light of the current government 's " war on terror " and the newly casual attitudes toward civil liberties .
parallels with guantanamo ?
in an introduction to his book , which contains oral histories and justice department documentation on 50 internees , fox argues : " the most damning aspects of the american internment experience were decisions to hold persons for indeterminate periods on the basis of their political views , their attitudes toward authority , and their personalities - even after it had been determined they were not dangerous . "
bildunterschrift : in us camps , detainees slept in bunkhouses today , americans are " attuned and sensitive to the issue that guantanamo , abu ghraib , and racial profiling here in the us post 9/11 , where people are rounded up and held indeterminately , are invasions of the bill of rights and the constitution , " fox said .
the fact that japanese-american internees were officially acknowledged in the 1980s angered a lot of the surviving germans , fox claimed .
" because they were in the same camps , they thought they should be treated equally , " he said .
but he noted there are two " core problems " in stirring up public sympathy for german-americans from that era .
the first is hitler and the holocaust , which he called " a hurdle german-americans will have a hard time overcoming . "
the other problem is 9/11 , fox said .
" that made it hard for people to have sympathy for people who attack us … and german-americans were perceived during world war ii as enemies of the country . "
numbers are " not too significant " american historian eric kurlander , currently a research fellow at the university of cologne in germany , also advocates studying the past as a way to avoid repeating mistakes .
but , he argued , " there are certainly more significant examples of authoritarian handling of suspects . "
while careful to say that " every individual who suffered detainment deserves to have their stories told , " kurlander said he could think of other things that warrant more urgent attention from congress .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fort lincoln camp , circa 1943 the problem is , that compared to the huge german-american population in the us at the time , the number of german-americans who were detained is miniscule , kurlander argued .

the organization , whose primary goal is to improve living conditions of people in developing regions , reached a milestone of a different kind on wednesday as it released financial figures for 2006 .
for the first time , the gtz 's business volume surpassed the one billion euro mark .
turnover rose to a total of 917.8 million euros -lrb- $ 1,221.42 million -rrb- , marking an increase of 4.8 percent over the previous year .
in the case of charitable donations , the group took in a whopping 770 million euros - a rise of 11 percent on last year .
aid contracts from around the world wolfgang schmitt , director of the organization , said the extraordinarily good figures mirrored the high esteem that the gtz is held in for its work not just in germany but around the world .
" there 's been a trend in the past years that others donors , industrialized countries and other developing nations have been increasingly supplying their own funds to engage the gtz , " he said .
" the trend has been continuing and so we can now almost speak of records . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul the gtz 's main employer last year remained the german ministry for economic cooperation and development which handed the aid group more than 700 million euros to realize development projects in africa and other regions .
but even co-financed projects , where third parties supply additional funds for projects that the gtz carries out for the german development ministry , got a huge boost last year by rising 29 percent to 61 million euros .
the un refugee agency , unhcr , was the biggest player here by bankrolling the gtz with 21 million euros .
the gtz also raked in a host of contracts from around the world - the ethiopian government built a network of health care centers with the help of development experts from the gtz and even institutions such as the world bank and the eu commission hired the services of the german aid group .
recipe to success schmitt emphasized that the gtz had become something of a world leader in the field of developmental aid .
the recipe to its success is the gtz 's focus on long-term goals and sustainability as opposed to other aid organizations , schmitt said .
" there 's a tendency in the development industry to score quick successes , " schmitt said .
" but if you look at the problems and responsibilities in the field , then you realize that these are things for which even europe needed centuries to overcome .
that 's why you need to have patience and stamina when it comes to development and cooperation . "
rosy future bernd eisenblätter , another gtz director , said the organization tended to attract skilled and highly qualified applicants around the world . last year , the number of gtz experts sent abroad rose by 4.8 percent to 1,100 persons .
most of them -lrb- 39 percent -rrb- work in africa .
" we get many more applicants than we can hire , even on a limited basis , " eisenblätter said .
" they 're highly-motivated , highly-qualified and 60 to 70 percent of them are women .
that 's why i 'm not worried at all about the future of the gtz .
it shows there 's huge potential and a huge interest in the field of development work and in the gtz . " dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in an introduction to his book , which contains oral histories and justice department documentation on 50 internees , fox argues : " the most damning aspects of the american internment experience were decisions to hold persons for indeterminate periods on the basis of their political views , their attitudes toward authority , and their personalities - even after it had been determined they were not dangerous . "
bildunterschrift : in us camps , detainees slept in bunkhouses today , americans are " attuned and sensitive to the issue that guantanamo , abu ghraib , and racial profiling here in the us post 9/11 , where people are rounded up and held indeterminately , are invasions of the bill of rights and the constitution , " fox said .
the fact that japanese-american internees were officially acknowledged in the 1980s angered a lot of the surviving germans , fox claimed .
" because they were in the same camps , they thought they should be treated equally , " he said .
but he noted there are two " core problems " in stirring up public sympathy for german-americans from that era .
the first is hitler and the holocaust , which he called " a hurdle german-americans will have a hard time overcoming . "
the other problem is 9/11 , fox said .
" that made it hard for people to have sympathy for people who attack us … and german-americans were perceived during world war ii as enemies of the country . "
numbers are " not too significant " american historian eric kurlander , currently a research fellow at the university of cologne in germany , also advocates studying the past as a way to avoid repeating mistakes .
but , he argued , " there are certainly more significant examples of authoritarian handling of suspects . "
while careful to say that " every individual who suffered detainment deserves to have their stories told , " kurlander said he could think of other things that warrant more urgent attention from congress .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fort lincoln camp , circa 1943 the problem is , that compared to the huge german-american population in the us at the time , the number of german-americans who were detained is miniscule , kurlander argued .
" you 're in the middle of an extremely destructive war with germany .
there are millions of soldiers on the battlefields , spies , double agents , and 50 million deaths world wide , " kurlander explained .
meanwhile , " tens and hundreds of thousands of people in every country had their lives displaced and disrupted ; they had to flee to the countryside and live in conditions little better than at camps . "
" anyone wrongly put in jail has reason to complain , " kurlander acknowledged .
" but given the scale of crimes committed in that war - by the russian and german governments , and what we ourselves were doing in the pacific to the pows and women and children there … detaining 10 or 11,000 people over a period of three years - we are not talking about anything too significant .

terror suspects bound for guantanamo bay ?
not quite .
the scenario applied to thousands of german-americans during world war ii , whose experience of wartime internment has so far had little publicity , and even less sympathy , in the us .
the story of how the us treated japanese-americans during world war ii is well known .
some 120,000 men , women and children living on the west coast , the majority of them us citizens , were stripped of their property and sent to remote " war relocation camps " in the interior of the country .
bildunterschrift : activities were part of camp life ; here , the sports club but the plight of the 11,000 german resident aliens who were also sent to wartime internment in the us has gotten little attention so far .
earlier this month , us senator russ feingold of wisconsin , whose constituency is heavily german-american , took a step toward changing that .
for the past six years , feingold has been trying to pass a bill to create a commission that would examine the us treatment of interned german-americans - as well as italians and other europeans - during world war ii .
a second commission would look at the treatment of jewish refugees fleeing persecution .
" these people are dying " a stand-alone bill on the " wartime treatment study act " has been blocked repeatedly over the last six years by an anonymous republican senator .
now the legislation - which was passed in the form of an amendment to the controversial immigration bill - is uncertain .
" it is so urgent that we pass this legislation , " the liberal democrat feingold said when he introduced the amendment .
" we can not wait any longer … the people who were affected by these policies are dying . "
congress " did the right thing by recognizing and apologizing for the mistreatment of japanese-americans during world war ii , " feingold said .
" but our work in this area is not done . "
no reparations - just accounting bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of japanese were sent from the coast to the middle of the country unlike surviving japanese americans , who were awarded $ 1.2 billion in reparations in 1988 as part of the modern " redress movement , " feingold 's amendment does not seek reparations for the interned germans or their families .
rather , it would " simply review the facts and circumstances the us government 's treatment of german-americans , italian-americans and other european-americans during world war ii . "
survivors from the era and historians alike have made clear that the situation in the camps was far from dire , and that the detainees were , on the whole , treated humanely .
and many observers have seized the debate as a chance to slam the idea of creating a congressional commission to examine 60-year-old events .
but stephen fox , a historian and the author of " fear itself : inside the fbi roundup of german americans during world war ii : the past as prologue , " argues that it is , indeed , important for the government to own up to past actions - especially in light of the current government 's " war on terror " and the newly casual attitudes toward civil liberties .

none had a lawyer , and none were charged with or convicted of a crime .
many were imprisoned for the duration of the war , and even after .
terror suspects bound for guantanamo bay ?
not quite .
the scenario applied to thousands of german-americans during world war ii , whose experience of wartime internment has so far had little publicity , and even less sympathy , in the us .
the story of how the us treated japanese-americans during world war ii is well known .
some 120,000 men , women and children living on the west coast , the majority of them us citizens , were stripped of their property and sent to remote " war relocation camps " in the interior of the country .
bildunterschrift : activities were part of camp life ; here , the sports club but the plight of the 11,000 german resident aliens who were also sent to wartime internment in the us has gotten little attention so far .
earlier this month , us senator russ feingold of wisconsin , whose constituency is heavily german-american , took a step toward changing that .
for the past six years , feingold has been trying to pass a bill to create a commission that would examine the us treatment of interned german-americans - as well as italians and other europeans - during world war ii .
a second commission would look at the treatment of jewish refugees fleeing persecution .
" these people are dying " a stand-alone bill on the " wartime treatment study act " has been blocked repeatedly over the last six years by an anonymous republican senator .
now the legislation - which was passed in the form of an amendment to the controversial immigration bill - is uncertain .
" it is so urgent that we pass this legislation , " the liberal democrat feingold said when he introduced the amendment .
" we can not wait any longer … the people who were affected by these policies are dying . "
congress " did the right thing by recognizing and apologizing for the mistreatment of japanese-americans during world war ii , " feingold said .
" but our work in this area is not done . "
no reparations - just accounting bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of japanese were sent from the coast to the middle of the country unlike surviving japanese americans , who were awarded $ 1.2 billion in reparations in 1988 as part of the modern " redress movement , " feingold 's amendment does not seek reparations for the interned germans or their families .
rather , it would " simply review the facts and circumstances the us government 's treatment of german-americans , italian-americans and other european-americans during world war ii . "
survivors from the era and historians alike have made clear that the situation in the camps was far from dire , and that the detainees were , on the whole , treated humanely .
and many observers have seized the debate as a chance to slam the idea of creating a congressional commission to examine 60-year-old events .
but stephen fox , a historian and the author of " fear itself : inside the fbi roundup of german americans during world war ii : the past as prologue , " argues that it is , indeed , important for the government to own up to past actions - especially in light of the current government 's " war on terror " and the newly casual attitudes toward civil liberties .
parallels with guantanamo ?
in an introduction to his book , which contains oral histories and justice department documentation on 50 internees , fox argues : " the most damning aspects of the american internment experience were decisions to hold persons for indeterminate periods on the basis of their political views , their attitudes toward authority , and their personalities - even after it had been determined they were not dangerous . "
bildunterschrift : in us camps , detainees slept in bunkhouses today , americans are " attuned and sensitive to the issue that guantanamo , abu ghraib , and racial profiling here in the us post 9/11 , where people are rounded up and held indeterminately , are invasions of the bill of rights and the constitution , " fox said .
the fact that japanese-american internees were officially acknowledged in the 1980s angered a lot of the surviving germans , fox claimed .
" because they were in the same camps , they thought they should be treated equally , " he said .
but he noted there are two " core problems " in stirring up public sympathy for german-americans from that era .
the first is hitler and the holocaust , which he called " a hurdle german-americans will have a hard time overcoming . "
the other problem is 9/11 , fox said .
" that made it hard for people to have sympathy for people who attack us … and german-americans were perceived during world war ii as enemies of the country . "
numbers are " not too significant " american historian eric kurlander , currently a research fellow at the university of cologne in germany , also advocates studying the past as a way to avoid repeating mistakes .
but , he argued , " there are certainly more significant examples of authoritarian handling of suspects . "
while careful to say that " every individual who suffered detainment deserves to have their stories told , " kurlander said he could think of other things that warrant more urgent attention from congress .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fort lincoln camp , circa 1943 the problem is , that compared to the huge german-american population in the us at the time , the number of german-americans who were detained is miniscule , kurlander argued .
" you 're in the middle of an extremely destructive war with germany .
there are millions of soldiers on the battlefields , spies , double agents , and 50 million deaths world wide , " kurlander explained .
meanwhile , " tens and hundreds of thousands of people in every country had their lives displaced and disrupted ; they had to flee to the countryside and live in conditions little better than at camps . "
" anyone wrongly put in jail has reason to complain , " kurlander acknowledged .
" but given the scale of crimes committed in that war - by the russian and german governments , and what we ourselves were doing in the pacific to the pows and women and children there … detaining 10 or 11,000 people over a period of three years - we are not talking about anything too significant .

german soldiers killed nearly 80 percent of the south west africa tribe during colonial rule more than 100 years ago . in 1904 in the german territory of south west africa , today 's namibia , german troops led by general lothar von trotha mercilessly put down a rebellion of the indigenous herero people .
general von trotha once remarked he wanted to exterminate " the revolting tribes in rivers of blood . "
by the time the conflict ended four years later , between 45,000 to 65,000 herero were killed , many of whom suffered in work camps some consider the forerunners to wwii-era concentration camps .
germany 's development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul publically apologized for the genocide three years ago .
so far , successive german governments have refused to enter into any discussions on possible reparations .
decrying " business as ususal " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : henrik witboi was a herero chief but germany 's left party wants to begin talks between germany and namibia that could lead to monetary compensation .
hüseyin aydin , spokesperson for the left party , said the acknowledgement of a genocide meant no one could continue with business as usual .
members of the ruling coalition made up of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- voiced opposition to the idea of reparations .
anke eimer of the cdu said " isolated views " in favor of reparations did not reflect the general opinion in namibia .
gert weisskirchen of the spd expressed his disgust at the killings but rejected what he called intentions of the left party " to instrumentalize the sufferings " of the herero and nama people .
he also reminded parliament of germany 's generous development aid to namibia .
a request for dialogue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a herero woman wearing the traditional hat chief kuaima riruako , the traditional leader of the herero people , attended the wednesday parliamentary debate with his wife , who was dressed in traditional herero style with the unique broad hat .
earlier wednesday , riruako had thanked the left party for its initiative .
he also expressed satisfaction that munich had changed general von trotha street to herero street .
" more than 100 years after the fateful war against my people i am not here to seek revenge against anybody , " riruako told deutsche welle .
" i have only been appealing to the government of the federal republic of germany for a dialogue so that we can talk about our colonial experience . "
the herero never completely recovered from the conflict and of the around 100,000 that today live in namibia many live in poverty or work on the farms of white landowners .
in 2001 , tribal leaders tried to sue germany for compensation in us courts , but the claim for $ 4 billion -lrb- 3.12 billion euros -rrb- never went very far .
they also want reparations from deutsche bank , which allegedly profited from the forced labor in the camps .

german soldiers killed nearly 80 percent of the south west africa tribe during colonial rule more than 100 years ago . in 1904 in the german territory of south west africa , today 's namibia , german troops led by general lothar von trotha mercilessly put down a rebellion of the indigenous herero people .
general von trotha once remarked he wanted to exterminate " the revolting tribes in rivers of blood . "
by the time the conflict ended four years later , between 45,000 to 65,000 herero were killed , many of whom suffered in work camps some consider the forerunners to wwii-era concentration camps .
germany 's development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul publically apologized for the genocide three years ago .
so far , successive german governments have refused to enter into any discussions on possible reparations .
decrying " business as ususal " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : henrik witboi was a herero chief but germany 's left party wants to begin talks between germany and namibia that could lead to monetary compensation .
hüseyin aydin , spokesperson for the left party , said the acknowledgement of a genocide meant no one could continue with business as usual .
members of the ruling coalition made up of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- voiced opposition to the idea of reparations .
anke eimer of the cdu said " isolated views " in favor of reparations did not reflect the general opinion in namibia .
gert weisskirchen of the spd expressed his disgust at the killings but rejected what he called intentions of the left party " to instrumentalize the sufferings " of the herero and nama people .
he also reminded parliament of germany 's generous development aid to namibia .

earlier wednesday , riruako had thanked the left party for its initiative .
he also expressed satisfaction that munich had changed general von trotha street to herero street .
" more than 100 years after the fateful war against my people i am not here to seek revenge against anybody , " riruako told deutsche welle .
" i have only been appealing to the government of the federal republic of germany for a dialogue so that we can talk about our colonial experience . "
the herero never completely recovered from the conflict and of the around 100,000 that today live in namibia many live in poverty or work on the farms of white landowners .
in 2001 , tribal leaders tried to sue germany for compensation in us courts , but the claim for $ 4 billion -lrb- 3.12 billion euros -rrb- never went very far .
they also want reparations from deutsche bank , which allegedly profited from the forced labor in the camps .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de middle east -pipe- 15.06.2007 opinion : international deployment in gaza would be useless großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli prime minister ehud olmert said that " serious consideration " should be given to deploying international forces along the gaza-egypt border .
dw 's peter philipp does n't think that this is a good idea . it 's intriguing that a call for stationing international troops in gaza should come from israel , the country which in the course of its history always vehemently opposed such operations .
israel , however , did n't change its attitude about the gaza strip because it wants to support a peace-promoting initiative .
the whole purpose of the exercise is to primarily pull the rug from under hamas ' feet by cutting their weapon supplies .
fatah , on the other hand , would keep getting armed , even from israel itself .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it is , therefore , no wonder that hamas rejected the idea of international forces and threatened to treat them as an occupying power .
it would be a mistake for anybody - whether in brussels or washington - to think seriously about acting on israel 's offer .
unlike south lebanon , where a un force -lrb- unifil -rrb- has been trying for years to support the re-assertion of lebanese state sovereignty , the gaza strip is no sovereign state .
it is , instead , an area marked by a struggle for power .
it would be unimaginable for either europeans or americans to have even the remotest interest in trying to maintain order there .
and even as a border patrol , the deployment would be useless .
if the smuggling of weapons to the gaza strip were really to be cut off , then egypt would be in the best position to do it : it controls the southern side of the gaza border and should be able to prevent the smuggling of weapons from its territory .
in general , not only egypt but also other arab countries should get involved : the arab league welcomed the formation of the palestinian unity government ; it has always treated the palestine conflict as its central subject and it should have a strong interest in preventing the escalation of violence in gaza - especially after it presented its own peace plan in beirut and riad .
the arab league can not allow all this to fall through because of the power struggle between hamas and fatah , let alone because no arab leader has an interest in a hamas-controlled unit in gaza .
the arab league should perhaps establish its own deployment force and send it to gaza : its contingent would be in the eyes of hamas and fatah much less suspicious than the europeans or the americans , and the league could prove for the first time in its history that it 's capable of more than making proclamations and passing resolutions .
and if that did happen , one could count on israel rejecting international troops again .
that 's not how olmert 's government imagined the whole affair .

dw 's peter philipp does n't think that this is a good idea . it 's intriguing that a call for stationing international troops in gaza should come from israel , the country which in the course of its history always vehemently opposed such operations .
israel , however , did n't change its attitude about the gaza strip because it wants to support a peace-promoting initiative .
the whole purpose of the exercise is to primarily pull the rug from under hamas ' feet by cutting their weapon supplies .
fatah , on the other hand , would keep getting armed , even from israel itself .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it is , therefore , no wonder that hamas rejected the idea of international forces and threatened to treat them as an occupying power .
it would be a mistake for anybody - whether in brussels or washington - to think seriously about acting on israel 's offer .
unlike south lebanon , where a un force -lrb- unifil -rrb- has been trying for years to support the re-assertion of lebanese state sovereignty , the gaza strip is no sovereign state .
it is , instead , an area marked by a struggle for power .
it would be unimaginable for either europeans or americans to have even the remotest interest in trying to maintain order there .
and even as a border patrol , the deployment would be useless .
if the smuggling of weapons to the gaza strip were really to be cut off , then egypt would be in the best position to do it : it controls the southern side of the gaza border and should be able to prevent the smuggling of weapons from its territory .
in general , not only egypt but also other arab countries should get involved : the arab league welcomed the formation of the palestinian unity government ; it has always treated the palestine conflict as its central subject and it should have a strong interest in preventing the escalation of violence in gaza - especially after it presented its own peace plan in beirut and riad .
the arab league can not allow all this to fall through because of the power struggle between hamas and fatah , let alone because no arab leader has an interest in a hamas-controlled unit in gaza .
the arab league should perhaps establish its own deployment force and send it to gaza : its contingent would be in the eyes of hamas and fatah much less suspicious than the europeans or the americans , and the league could prove for the first time in its history that it 's capable of more than making proclamations and passing resolutions .
and if that did happen , one could count on israel rejecting international troops again .
that 's not how olmert 's government imagined the whole affair .

the organization , whose primary goal is to improve living conditions of people in developing regions , reached a milestone of a different kind on wednesday as it released financial figures for 2006 .
for the first time , the gtz 's business volume surpassed the one billion euro mark .
turnover rose to a total of 917.8 million euros -lrb- $ 1,221.42 million -rrb- , marking an increase of 4.8 percent over the previous year .
in the case of charitable donations , the group took in a whopping 770 million euros - a rise of 11 percent on last year .
aid contracts from around the world wolfgang schmitt , director of the organization , said the extraordinarily good figures mirrored the high esteem that the gtz is held in for its work not just in germany but around the world .
" there 's been a trend in the past years that others donors , industrialized countries and other developing nations have been increasingly supplying their own funds to engage the gtz , " he said .
" the trend has been continuing and so we can now almost speak of records . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul the gtz 's main employer last year remained the german ministry for economic cooperation and development which handed the aid group more than 700 million euros to realize development projects in africa and other regions .
but even co-financed projects , where third parties supply additional funds for projects that the gtz carries out for the german development ministry , got a huge boost last year by rising 29 percent to 61 million euros .
the un refugee agency , unhcr , was the biggest player here by bankrolling the gtz with 21 million euros .
the gtz also raked in a host of contracts from around the world - the ethiopian government built a network of health care centers with the help of development experts from the gtz and even institutions such as the world bank and the eu commission hired the services of the german aid group .
recipe to success schmitt emphasized that the gtz had become something of a world leader in the field of developmental aid .
the recipe to its success is the gtz 's focus on long-term goals and sustainability as opposed to other aid organizations , schmitt said .
" there 's a tendency in the development industry to score quick successes , " schmitt said .
" but if you look at the problems and responsibilities in the field , then you realize that these are things for which even europe needed centuries to overcome .
that 's why you need to have patience and stamina when it comes to development and cooperation . "
rosy future bernd eisenblätter , another gtz director , said the organization tended to attract skilled and highly qualified applicants around the world . last year , the number of gtz experts sent abroad rose by 4.8 percent to 1,100 persons .
most of them -lrb- 39 percent -rrb- work in africa .
" we get many more applicants than we can hire , even on a limited basis , " eisenblätter said .
" they 're highly-motivated , highly-qualified and 60 to 70 percent of them are women .
that 's why i 'm not worried at all about the future of the gtz .
it shows there 's huge potential and a huge interest in the field of development work and in the gtz . " dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the organization , whose primary goal is to improve living conditions of people in developing regions , reached a milestone of a different kind on wednesday as it released financial figures for 2006 .
for the first time , the gtz 's business volume surpassed the one billion euro mark .
turnover rose to a total of 917.8 million euros -lrb- $ 1,221.42 million -rrb- , marking an increase of 4.8 percent over the previous year .
in the case of charitable donations , the group took in a whopping 770 million euros - a rise of 11 percent on last year .
aid contracts from around the world wolfgang schmitt , director of the organization , said the extraordinarily good figures mirrored the high esteem that the gtz is held in for its work not just in germany but around the world .
" there 's been a trend in the past years that others donors , industrialized countries and other developing nations have been increasingly supplying their own funds to engage the gtz , " he said .
" the trend has been continuing and so we can now almost speak of records . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul the gtz 's main employer last year remained the german ministry for economic cooperation and development which handed the aid group more than 700 million euros to realize development projects in africa and other regions .
but even co-financed projects , where third parties supply additional funds for projects that the gtz carries out for the german development ministry , got a huge boost last year by rising 29 percent to 61 million euros .
the un refugee agency , unhcr , was the biggest player here by bankrolling the gtz with 21 million euros .
the gtz also raked in a host of contracts from around the world - the ethiopian government built a network of health care centers with the help of development experts from the gtz and even institutions such as the world bank and the eu commission hired the services of the german aid group .
recipe to success schmitt emphasized that the gtz had become something of a world leader in the field of developmental aid .
the recipe to its success is the gtz 's focus on long-term goals and sustainability as opposed to other aid organizations , schmitt said .
" there 's a tendency in the development industry to score quick successes , " schmitt said .
" but if you look at the problems and responsibilities in the field , then you realize that these are things for which even europe needed centuries to overcome .
that 's why you need to have patience and stamina when it comes to development and cooperation . "
rosy future bernd eisenblätter , another gtz director , said the organization tended to attract skilled and highly qualified applicants around the world . last year , the number of gtz experts sent abroad rose by 4.8 percent to 1,100 persons .
most of them -lrb- 39 percent -rrb- work in africa .
" we get many more applicants than we can hire , even on a limited basis , " eisenblätter said .
" they 're highly-motivated , highly-qualified and 60 to 70 percent of them are women .
that 's why i 'm not worried at all about the future of the gtz .
it shows there 's huge potential and a huge interest in the field of development work and in the gtz . " dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

why does this prestigious event take place in a small town ? four centuries ago , margrave christian established his residence in bayreuth .
later , the prussian margrave wilhelmine , sister of frederick the great and a dedicated patron of the arts , transformed the princely residence into an arts center and a baroque jewel .
the city 's distinctive landmarks include the " new palace " with its courtly gardens , the " eremitage castle park " and the margrave 's opera house , considered europe 's most beautiful baroque theater .
it all began with a dream but the picturesque bavarian city remains best known for its association with the operatic composer richard wagner who lived in bayreuth from 1872 until his death in 1883 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : richard wagner remains bayreuth 's most famous son wagner , composer , playwright and theater director all rolled into one , dreamed of a gesamtkunstwerk , -lrb- a total work of art -rrb- , that is , a perfect blend of poetry , song and drama .
the established theaters in the big cities were completely inadequate for staging plans of that scale .
so wagner considered staging his own festival .
the margrave 's opera house in bayreuth , which then had the biggest stage in the german speaking lands , came to his attention .
in early 1871 , joined by his wife cosima , wagner traveled to bayreuth .
but he soon realized that a baroque theater with balconies would be unsuitable for his festival idea .
" however , the unique charm and the location of the friendly city itself were what i had been wishing for , " he wrote .
" an utterly beautiful and generous plot of land not far from the town was given to me as a gift and for the purpose of building the theater i had in mind . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bayreuth festspielhaus or opera house the cornerstone to wagner 's festspielhaus was laid in 1872 .
in it , wagner enclosed a piece of paper with the inscription : " herein i enclose a secret , may it rest for a hundred years .
as long as it is protected by stone , it will reveal itself to the world . "
the rich and famous the bayreuth festspielhaus is both a world cultural monument and an ultramodern theater reserved exclusively for the works of richard wagner .
in the evenings , the stage is set alight by dramatic scenes from the germanic legends .
but from early morning , the grounds outdoors are populated by ticket seekers .
the official route to festival admission can involve a wait of seven years or longer .
the number of people seeking tickets exceeds that of tickets available by a factor of 10 to one .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel and her husband have become regulars at the festival on opening day , bayreuth is a firework of myth , fashion and media , where presidents and corporate bosses rub shoulders with show business celebrities .
less sensational are the many music critics on hand , who convey every nuance of the performances inside to the world outside , upholding bayreuth 's status as a musical nerve center of the nation and of the theater world .
since 1876 , the bayreuth festival has accompanied every high and low point of german history .
its current director is a grandson of the composer : 87-year-old wolfgang wagner , who has run the festival since 1951 .
the wagner family , however , has been dogged by a feud over who should run the festival in future .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : katharina wagner could take over the reins of the festival there is speculation that wolfgang wagner 's youngest daughter , katharina could be a possible successor .

why does this prestigious event take place in a small town ? four centuries ago , margrave christian established his residence in bayreuth .
later , the prussian margrave wilhelmine , sister of frederick the great and a dedicated patron of the arts , transformed the princely residence into an arts center and a baroque jewel .
the city 's distinctive landmarks include the " new palace " with its courtly gardens , the " eremitage castle park " and the margrave 's opera house , considered europe 's most beautiful baroque theater .
it all began with a dream but the picturesque bavarian city remains best known for its association with the operatic composer richard wagner who lived in bayreuth from 1872 until his death in 1883 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : richard wagner remains bayreuth 's most famous son wagner , composer , playwright and theater director all rolled into one , dreamed of a gesamtkunstwerk , -lrb- a total work of art -rrb- , that is , a perfect blend of poetry , song and drama .
the established theaters in the big cities were completely inadequate for staging plans of that scale .
so wagner considered staging his own festival .
the margrave 's opera house in bayreuth , which then had the biggest stage in the german speaking lands , came to his attention .
in early 1871 , joined by his wife cosima , wagner traveled to bayreuth .
but he soon realized that a baroque theater with balconies would be unsuitable for his festival idea .
" however , the unique charm and the location of the friendly city itself were what i had been wishing for , " he wrote .
" an utterly beautiful and generous plot of land not far from the town was given to me as a gift and for the purpose of building the theater i had in mind . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bayreuth festspielhaus or opera house the cornerstone to wagner 's festspielhaus was laid in 1872 .
in it , wagner enclosed a piece of paper with the inscription : " herein i enclose a secret , may it rest for a hundred years .
as long as it is protected by stone , it will reveal itself to the world . "
the rich and famous the bayreuth festspielhaus is both a world cultural monument and an ultramodern theater reserved exclusively for the works of richard wagner .
in the evenings , the stage is set alight by dramatic scenes from the germanic legends .
but from early morning , the grounds outdoors are populated by ticket seekers .
the official route to festival admission can involve a wait of seven years or longer .
the number of people seeking tickets exceeds that of tickets available by a factor of 10 to one .

less sensational are the many music critics on hand , who convey every nuance of the performances inside to the world outside , upholding bayreuth 's status as a musical nerve center of the nation and of the theater world .
since 1876 , the bayreuth festival has accompanied every high and low point of german history .
its current director is a grandson of the composer : 87-year-old wolfgang wagner , who has run the festival since 1951 .
the wagner family , however , has been dogged by a feud over who should run the festival in future .

the major powers mediating for middle east peace affirmed friday their " full support " for embattled palestinian leader mahmoud abbas , eu foreign policy chief javier solana 's spokeswoman said .
egypt recalled its diplomatic and security delegations to the gaza strip .
" the presidency of the european union condemns in the strongest terms the violent seizure of power by hamas militia in the gaza strip , " martin jäger , german foreign ministry spokesman , said on behalf of the eu leadership .
" we condemn the killing of innocent civilians and legitimate security forces , " the spokesman said .
hamas in control hamas fighters were in full control of the gaza strip on friday , creating an islamic enclave on israel 's doorstep and further clouding prospects for peace after routing their secular fatah rivals in days of vicious gun battles .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a hamas militant on an armored personnel carrier inside abbas ' headquarters the radical islamist group - branded a terrorist organization by israel and the west - overran the territory hours after abbas sacked the government and declared a state of emergency in a bid to avert all-out civil war .
jäger joined the united states in backing abbas , insisting that his decision to dismiss the three-month-old hamas-fatah unity government was " in accordance with the palestinian constitution . "
germany holds the eu presidency until the end of the month .
british foreign secretary margaret beckett stressed it would be wrong for hamas to benefit from its seizure of power in gaza .
" the notion that somehow mounting a coup d 'etat is something that should be rewarded by the international community seems to me to be completely bizarre , " she said .
" this is the fault of people in hamas who want control , not partnership , " she added , stressing that the events of recent days were " not the way forward . "

now he lectures on his experience after six years of trying , a us senator has made progress toward establishing a committee to examine the possible mistreatment of some german-americans during world war ii . some disappeared under cover of night ; others were taken during raids on their place of employment .
about a third were kidnapped by us agents in other countries and brought to the us by force .
none had a lawyer , and none were charged with or convicted of a crime .
many were imprisoned for the duration of the war , and even after .
terror suspects bound for guantanamo bay ?
not quite .
the scenario applied to thousands of german-americans during world war ii , whose experience of wartime internment has so far had little publicity , and even less sympathy , in the us .
the story of how the us treated japanese-americans during world war ii is well known .
some 120,000 men , women and children living on the west coast , the majority of them us citizens , were stripped of their property and sent to remote " war relocation camps " in the interior of the country .
bildunterschrift : activities were part of camp life ; here , the sports club but the plight of the 11,000 german resident aliens who were also sent to wartime internment in the us has gotten little attention so far .
earlier this month , us senator russ feingold of wisconsin , whose constituency is heavily german-american , took a step toward changing that .
for the past six years , feingold has been trying to pass a bill to create a commission that would examine the us treatment of interned german-americans - as well as italians and other europeans - during world war ii .
a second commission would look at the treatment of jewish refugees fleeing persecution .
" these people are dying " a stand-alone bill on the " wartime treatment study act " has been blocked repeatedly over the last six years by an anonymous republican senator .
now the legislation - which was passed in the form of an amendment to the controversial immigration bill - is uncertain .
" it is so urgent that we pass this legislation , " the liberal democrat feingold said when he introduced the amendment .
" we can not wait any longer … the people who were affected by these policies are dying . "
congress " did the right thing by recognizing and apologizing for the mistreatment of japanese-americans during world war ii , " feingold said .
" but our work in this area is not done . "
no reparations - just accounting bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of japanese were sent from the coast to the middle of the country unlike surviving japanese americans , who were awarded $ 1.2 billion in reparations in 1988 as part of the modern " redress movement , " feingold 's amendment does not seek reparations for the interned germans or their families .
rather , it would " simply review the facts and circumstances the us government 's treatment of german-americans , italian-americans and other european-americans during world war ii . "
survivors from the era and historians alike have made clear that the situation in the camps was far from dire , and that the detainees were , on the whole , treated humanely .
and many observers have seized the debate as a chance to slam the idea of creating a congressional commission to examine 60-year-old events .
but stephen fox , a historian and the author of " fear itself : inside the fbi roundup of german americans during world war ii : the past as prologue , " argues that it is , indeed , important for the government to own up to past actions - especially in light of the current government 's " war on terror " and the newly casual attitudes toward civil liberties .
parallels with guantanamo ?
in an introduction to his book , which contains oral histories and justice department documentation on 50 internees , fox argues : " the most damning aspects of the american internment experience were decisions to hold persons for indeterminate periods on the basis of their political views , their attitudes toward authority , and their personalities - even after it had been determined they were not dangerous . "
bildunterschrift : in us camps , detainees slept in bunkhouses today , americans are " attuned and sensitive to the issue that guantanamo , abu ghraib , and racial profiling here in the us post 9/11 , where people are rounded up and held indeterminately , are invasions of the bill of rights and the constitution , " fox said .
the fact that japanese-american internees were officially acknowledged in the 1980s angered a lot of the surviving germans , fox claimed .
" because they were in the same camps , they thought they should be treated equally , " he said .
but he noted there are two " core problems " in stirring up public sympathy for german-americans from that era .
the first is hitler and the holocaust , which he called " a hurdle german-americans will have a hard time overcoming . "
the other problem is 9/11 , fox said .
" that made it hard for people to have sympathy for people who attack us … and german-americans were perceived during world war ii as enemies of the country . "
numbers are " not too significant " american historian eric kurlander , currently a research fellow at the university of cologne in germany , also advocates studying the past as a way to avoid repeating mistakes .
but , he argued , " there are certainly more significant examples of authoritarian handling of suspects . "
while careful to say that " every individual who suffered detainment deserves to have their stories told , " kurlander said he could think of other things that warrant more urgent attention from congress .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fort lincoln camp , circa 1943 the problem is , that compared to the huge german-american population in the us at the time , the number of german-americans who were detained is miniscule , kurlander argued .
" you 're in the middle of an extremely destructive war with germany .
there are millions of soldiers on the battlefields , spies , double agents , and 50 million deaths world wide , " kurlander explained .
meanwhile , " tens and hundreds of thousands of people in every country had their lives displaced and disrupted ; they had to flee to the countryside and live in conditions little better than at camps . "
" anyone wrongly put in jail has reason to complain , " kurlander acknowledged .
" but given the scale of crimes committed in that war - by the russian and german governments , and what we ourselves were doing in the pacific to the pows and women and children there … detaining 10 or 11,000 people over a period of three years - we are not talking about anything too significant .

german soldiers killed nearly 80 percent of the south west africa tribe during colonial rule more than 100 years ago . in 1904 in the german territory of south west africa , today 's namibia , german troops led by general lothar von trotha mercilessly put down a rebellion of the indigenous herero people .
general von trotha once remarked he wanted to exterminate " the revolting tribes in rivers of blood . "
by the time the conflict ended four years later , between 45,000 to 65,000 herero were killed , many of whom suffered in work camps some consider the forerunners to wwii-era concentration camps .
germany 's development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul publically apologized for the genocide three years ago .
so far , successive german governments have refused to enter into any discussions on possible reparations .
decrying " business as ususal " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : henrik witboi was a herero chief but germany 's left party wants to begin talks between germany and namibia that could lead to monetary compensation .
hüseyin aydin , spokesperson for the left party , said the acknowledgement of a genocide meant no one could continue with business as usual .
members of the ruling coalition made up of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- voiced opposition to the idea of reparations .
anke eimer of the cdu said " isolated views " in favor of reparations did not reflect the general opinion in namibia .
gert weisskirchen of the spd expressed his disgust at the killings but rejected what he called intentions of the left party " to instrumentalize the sufferings " of the herero and nama people .
he also reminded parliament of germany 's generous development aid to namibia .
a request for dialogue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a herero woman wearing the traditional hat chief kuaima riruako , the traditional leader of the herero people , attended the wednesday parliamentary debate with his wife , who was dressed in traditional herero style with the unique broad hat .
earlier wednesday , riruako had thanked the left party for its initiative .
he also expressed satisfaction that munich had changed general von trotha street to herero street .
" more than 100 years after the fateful war against my people i am not here to seek revenge against anybody , " riruako told deutsche welle .
" i have only been appealing to the government of the federal republic of germany for a dialogue so that we can talk about our colonial experience . "
the herero never completely recovered from the conflict and of the around 100,000 that today live in namibia many live in poverty or work on the farms of white landowners .
in 2001 , tribal leaders tried to sue germany for compensation in us courts , but the claim for $ 4 billion -lrb- 3.12 billion euros -rrb- never went very far .
they also want reparations from deutsche bank , which allegedly profited from the forced labor in the camps .
the german parliament 's motion on reparations was referred to some committees of the parliament .
a final vote is not expected until the fall .
observers doubt the ruling coalition will vote in favor of reparations . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

why does this prestigious event take place in a small town ? four centuries ago , margrave christian established his residence in bayreuth .
later , the prussian margrave wilhelmine , sister of frederick the great and a dedicated patron of the arts , transformed the princely residence into an arts center and a baroque jewel .
the city 's distinctive landmarks include the " new palace " with its courtly gardens , the " eremitage castle park " and the margrave 's opera house , considered europe 's most beautiful baroque theater .
it all began with a dream but the picturesque bavarian city remains best known for its association with the operatic composer richard wagner who lived in bayreuth from 1872 until his death in 1883 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : richard wagner remains bayreuth 's most famous son wagner , composer , playwright and theater director all rolled into one , dreamed of a gesamtkunstwerk , -lrb- a total work of art -rrb- , that is , a perfect blend of poetry , song and drama .
the established theaters in the big cities were completely inadequate for staging plans of that scale .
so wagner considered staging his own festival .
the margrave 's opera house in bayreuth , which then had the biggest stage in the german speaking lands , came to his attention .
in early 1871 , joined by his wife cosima , wagner traveled to bayreuth .
but he soon realized that a baroque theater with balconies would be unsuitable for his festival idea .
" however , the unique charm and the location of the friendly city itself were what i had been wishing for , " he wrote .
" an utterly beautiful and generous plot of land not far from the town was given to me as a gift and for the purpose of building the theater i had in mind . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bayreuth festspielhaus or opera house the cornerstone to wagner 's festspielhaus was laid in 1872 .
in it , wagner enclosed a piece of paper with the inscription : " herein i enclose a secret , may it rest for a hundred years .
as long as it is protected by stone , it will reveal itself to the world . "
the rich and famous the bayreuth festspielhaus is both a world cultural monument and an ultramodern theater reserved exclusively for the works of richard wagner .
in the evenings , the stage is set alight by dramatic scenes from the germanic legends .
but from early morning , the grounds outdoors are populated by ticket seekers .
the official route to festival admission can involve a wait of seven years or longer .

less sensational are the many music critics on hand , who convey every nuance of the performances inside to the world outside , upholding bayreuth 's status as a musical nerve center of the nation and of the theater world .
since 1876 , the bayreuth festival has accompanied every high and low point of german history .
its current director is a grandson of the composer : 87-year-old wolfgang wagner , who has run the festival since 1951 .

later , the prussian margrave wilhelmine , sister of frederick the great and a dedicated patron of the arts , transformed the princely residence into an arts center and a baroque jewel .
the city 's distinctive landmarks include the " new palace " with its courtly gardens , the " eremitage castle park " and the margrave 's opera house , considered europe 's most beautiful baroque theater .
it all began with a dream but the picturesque bavarian city remains best known for its association with the operatic composer richard wagner who lived in bayreuth from 1872 until his death in 1883 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : richard wagner remains bayreuth 's most famous son wagner , composer , playwright and theater director all rolled into one , dreamed of a gesamtkunstwerk , -lrb- a total work of art -rrb- , that is , a perfect blend of poetry , song and drama .
the established theaters in the big cities were completely inadequate for staging plans of that scale .
so wagner considered staging his own festival .
the margrave 's opera house in bayreuth , which then had the biggest stage in the german speaking lands , came to his attention .
in early 1871 , joined by his wife cosima , wagner traveled to bayreuth .
but he soon realized that a baroque theater with balconies would be unsuitable for his festival idea .
" however , the unique charm and the location of the friendly city itself were what i had been wishing for , " he wrote .
" an utterly beautiful and generous plot of land not far from the town was given to me as a gift and for the purpose of building the theater i had in mind . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bayreuth festspielhaus or opera house the cornerstone to wagner 's festspielhaus was laid in 1872 .
in it , wagner enclosed a piece of paper with the inscription : " herein i enclose a secret , may it rest for a hundred years .
as long as it is protected by stone , it will reveal itself to the world . "
the rich and famous the bayreuth festspielhaus is both a world cultural monument and an ultramodern theater reserved exclusively for the works of richard wagner .
in the evenings , the stage is set alight by dramatic scenes from the germanic legends .
but from early morning , the grounds outdoors are populated by ticket seekers .
the official route to festival admission can involve a wait of seven years or longer .
the number of people seeking tickets exceeds that of tickets available by a factor of 10 to one .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel and her husband have become regulars at the festival on opening day , bayreuth is a firework of myth , fashion and media , where presidents and corporate bosses rub shoulders with show business celebrities .
less sensational are the many music critics on hand , who convey every nuance of the performances inside to the world outside , upholding bayreuth 's status as a musical nerve center of the nation and of the theater world .
since 1876 , the bayreuth festival has accompanied every high and low point of german history .
its current director is a grandson of the composer : 87-year-old wolfgang wagner , who has run the festival since 1951 .
the wagner family , however , has been dogged by a feud over who should run the festival in future .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : katharina wagner could take over the reins of the festival there is speculation that wolfgang wagner 's youngest daughter , katharina could be a possible successor .
the 29-year old has earned some critical acclaim as an opera director on other stages .
the coming season starts on july 25 with katharina wagner 's first production in bayreuth .
she will stage " die meistersinger von nürnberg . " rick fulker -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the organization , whose primary goal is to improve living conditions of people in developing regions , reached a milestone of a different kind on wednesday as it released financial figures for 2006 .
for the first time , the gtz 's business volume surpassed the one billion euro mark .
turnover rose to a total of 917.8 million euros -lrb- $ 1,221.42 million -rrb- , marking an increase of 4.8 percent over the previous year .
in the case of charitable donations , the group took in a whopping 770 million euros - a rise of 11 percent on last year .
aid contracts from around the world wolfgang schmitt , director of the organization , said the extraordinarily good figures mirrored the high esteem that the gtz is held in for its work not just in germany but around the world .
" there 's been a trend in the past years that others donors , industrialized countries and other developing nations have been increasingly supplying their own funds to engage the gtz , " he said .
" the trend has been continuing and so we can now almost speak of records . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul the gtz 's main employer last year remained the german ministry for economic cooperation and development which handed the aid group more than 700 million euros to realize development projects in africa and other regions .
but even co-financed projects , where third parties supply additional funds for projects that the gtz carries out for the german development ministry , got a huge boost last year by rising 29 percent to 61 million euros .
the un refugee agency , unhcr , was the biggest player here by bankrolling the gtz with 21 million euros .
the gtz also raked in a host of contracts from around the world - the ethiopian government built a network of health care centers with the help of development experts from the gtz and even institutions such as the world bank and the eu commission hired the services of the german aid group .
recipe to success schmitt emphasized that the gtz had become something of a world leader in the field of developmental aid .
the recipe to its success is the gtz 's focus on long-term goals and sustainability as opposed to other aid organizations , schmitt said .
" there 's a tendency in the development industry to score quick successes , " schmitt said .
" but if you look at the problems and responsibilities in the field , then you realize that these are things for which even europe needed centuries to overcome .
that 's why you need to have patience and stamina when it comes to development and cooperation . "
rosy future bernd eisenblätter , another gtz director , said the organization tended to attract skilled and highly qualified applicants around the world . last year , the number of gtz experts sent abroad rose by 4.8 percent to 1,100 persons .
most of them -lrb- 39 percent -rrb- work in africa .
" we get many more applicants than we can hire , even on a limited basis , " eisenblätter said .
" they 're highly-motivated , highly-qualified and 60 to 70 percent of them are women .

dw 's peter philipp does n't think that this is a good idea . it 's intriguing that a call for stationing international troops in gaza should come from israel , the country which in the course of its history always vehemently opposed such operations .
israel , however , did n't change its attitude about the gaza strip because it wants to support a peace-promoting initiative .
the whole purpose of the exercise is to primarily pull the rug from under hamas ' feet by cutting their weapon supplies .
fatah , on the other hand , would keep getting armed , even from israel itself .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it is , therefore , no wonder that hamas rejected the idea of international forces and threatened to treat them as an occupying power .

the major powers mediating for middle east peace affirmed friday their " full support " for embattled palestinian leader mahmoud abbas , eu foreign policy chief javier solana 's spokeswoman said .
egypt recalled its diplomatic and security delegations to the gaza strip .
" the presidency of the european union condemns in the strongest terms the violent seizure of power by hamas militia in the gaza strip , " martin jäger , german foreign ministry spokesman , said on behalf of the eu leadership .
" we condemn the killing of innocent civilians and legitimate security forces , " the spokesman said .
hamas in control hamas fighters were in full control of the gaza strip on friday , creating an islamic enclave on israel 's doorstep and further clouding prospects for peace after routing their secular fatah rivals in days of vicious gun battles .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a hamas militant on an armored personnel carrier inside abbas ' headquarters the radical islamist group - branded a terrorist organization by israel and the west - overran the territory hours after abbas sacked the government and declared a state of emergency in a bid to avert all-out civil war .
jäger joined the united states in backing abbas , insisting that his decision to dismiss the three-month-old hamas-fatah unity government was " in accordance with the palestinian constitution . "
germany holds the eu presidency until the end of the month .
british foreign secretary margaret beckett stressed it would be wrong for hamas to benefit from its seizure of power in gaza .
" the notion that somehow mounting a coup d 'etat is something that should be rewarded by the international community seems to me to be completely bizarre , " she said .
" this is the fault of people in hamas who want control , not partnership , " she added , stressing that the events of recent days were " not the way forward . "
" extreme concern " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commissioner for external relations benita ferrero waldner eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner also expressed " extreme concern " over the gaza conflict and said in a statement she would hold talks with top quartet officials on friday .
the united states has already given full backing to abbas .
us secretary of state condoleezza rice said : " president abbas has exercised his lawful authority as president of the palestinian authority and leader of the palestinian people , " rice told reporters on wednesday .
" and we fully support him in his decisions to try to end this crisis for the palestinian people and to give them an opportunity to return to peace and a better future , " she said .
russia 's foreign minister sergei lavrov did not take sides in the conflict but said friday no un troops could be sent to gaza unless hamas and fatah agreed to such a deployment .
the palestinians should halt their " fratricidal " conflict , the russian foreign ministry said in a separate statement .
cairo meeting arab foreign ministers brought forward a cairo meeting scheduled originally for saturday to discuss the crisis .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamas militants in front of the security headquarters after they captured it from fatah arab league ambassadors appealed to both hamas and abbas ' secular fatah faction to return to egyptian-sponsored reconciliation talks .
egypt had been trying to broker a face-to-face meeting between the two sides after separate talks , but the breakdown of that effort was swiftly followed by the latest fighting in which at least 113 people have been killed .

german soldiers killed nearly 80 percent of the south west africa tribe during colonial rule more than 100 years ago . in 1904 in the german territory of south west africa , today 's namibia , german troops led by general lothar von trotha mercilessly put down a rebellion of the indigenous herero people .
general von trotha once remarked he wanted to exterminate " the revolting tribes in rivers of blood . "
by the time the conflict ended four years later , between 45,000 to 65,000 herero were killed , many of whom suffered in work camps some consider the forerunners to wwii-era concentration camps .
germany 's development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul publically apologized for the genocide three years ago .
so far , successive german governments have refused to enter into any discussions on possible reparations .
decrying " business as ususal " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : henrik witboi was a herero chief but germany 's left party wants to begin talks between germany and namibia that could lead to monetary compensation .
hüseyin aydin , spokesperson for the left party , said the acknowledgement of a genocide meant no one could continue with business as usual .
members of the ruling coalition made up of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- voiced opposition to the idea of reparations .
anke eimer of the cdu said " isolated views " in favor of reparations did not reflect the general opinion in namibia .
gert weisskirchen of the spd expressed his disgust at the killings but rejected what he called intentions of the left party " to instrumentalize the sufferings " of the herero and nama people .
he also reminded parliament of germany 's generous development aid to namibia .
a request for dialogue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a herero woman wearing the traditional hat chief kuaima riruako , the traditional leader of the herero people , attended the wednesday parliamentary debate with his wife , who was dressed in traditional herero style with the unique broad hat .

german soldiers killed nearly 80 percent of the south west africa tribe during colonial rule more than 100 years ago . in 1904 in the german territory of south west africa , today 's namibia , german troops led by general lothar von trotha mercilessly put down a rebellion of the indigenous herero people .
general von trotha once remarked he wanted to exterminate " the revolting tribes in rivers of blood . "
by the time the conflict ended four years later , between 45,000 to 65,000 herero were killed , many of whom suffered in work camps some consider the forerunners to wwii-era concentration camps .
germany 's development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul publically apologized for the genocide three years ago .

members of the ruling coalition made up of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- voiced opposition to the idea of reparations .
anke eimer of the cdu said " isolated views " in favor of reparations did not reflect the general opinion in namibia .

about a third were kidnapped by us agents in other countries and brought to the us by force .
none had a lawyer , and none were charged with or convicted of a crime .
many were imprisoned for the duration of the war , and even after .
terror suspects bound for guantanamo bay ?
not quite .
the scenario applied to thousands of german-americans during world war ii , whose experience of wartime internment has so far had little publicity , and even less sympathy , in the us .
the story of how the us treated japanese-americans during world war ii is well known .
some 120,000 men , women and children living on the west coast , the majority of them us citizens , were stripped of their property and sent to remote " war relocation camps " in the interior of the country .
bildunterschrift : activities were part of camp life ; here , the sports club but the plight of the 11,000 german resident aliens who were also sent to wartime internment in the us has gotten little attention so far .
earlier this month , us senator russ feingold of wisconsin , whose constituency is heavily german-american , took a step toward changing that .
for the past six years , feingold has been trying to pass a bill to create a commission that would examine the us treatment of interned german-americans - as well as italians and other europeans - during world war ii .
a second commission would look at the treatment of jewish refugees fleeing persecution .
" these people are dying " a stand-alone bill on the " wartime treatment study act " has been blocked repeatedly over the last six years by an anonymous republican senator .
now the legislation - which was passed in the form of an amendment to the controversial immigration bill - is uncertain .
" it is so urgent that we pass this legislation , " the liberal democrat feingold said when he introduced the amendment .
" we can not wait any longer … the people who were affected by these policies are dying . "
congress " did the right thing by recognizing and apologizing for the mistreatment of japanese-americans during world war ii , " feingold said .
" but our work in this area is not done . "
no reparations - just accounting bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of japanese were sent from the coast to the middle of the country unlike surviving japanese americans , who were awarded $ 1.2 billion in reparations in 1988 as part of the modern " redress movement , " feingold 's amendment does not seek reparations for the interned germans or their families .
rather , it would " simply review the facts and circumstances the us government 's treatment of german-americans , italian-americans and other european-americans during world war ii . "
survivors from the era and historians alike have made clear that the situation in the camps was far from dire , and that the detainees were , on the whole , treated humanely .
and many observers have seized the debate as a chance to slam the idea of creating a congressional commission to examine 60-year-old events .
but stephen fox , a historian and the author of " fear itself : inside the fbi roundup of german americans during world war ii : the past as prologue , " argues that it is , indeed , important for the government to own up to past actions - especially in light of the current government 's " war on terror " and the newly casual attitudes toward civil liberties .
parallels with guantanamo ?
in an introduction to his book , which contains oral histories and justice department documentation on 50 internees , fox argues : " the most damning aspects of the american internment experience were decisions to hold persons for indeterminate periods on the basis of their political views , their attitudes toward authority , and their personalities - even after it had been determined they were not dangerous . "
bildunterschrift : in us camps , detainees slept in bunkhouses today , americans are " attuned and sensitive to the issue that guantanamo , abu ghraib , and racial profiling here in the us post 9/11 , where people are rounded up and held indeterminately , are invasions of the bill of rights and the constitution , " fox said .
the fact that japanese-american internees were officially acknowledged in the 1980s angered a lot of the surviving germans , fox claimed .
" because they were in the same camps , they thought they should be treated equally , " he said .
but he noted there are two " core problems " in stirring up public sympathy for german-americans from that era .
the first is hitler and the holocaust , which he called " a hurdle german-americans will have a hard time overcoming . "
the other problem is 9/11 , fox said .
" that made it hard for people to have sympathy for people who attack us … and german-americans were perceived during world war ii as enemies of the country . "
numbers are " not too significant " american historian eric kurlander , currently a research fellow at the university of cologne in germany , also advocates studying the past as a way to avoid repeating mistakes .
but , he argued , " there are certainly more significant examples of authoritarian handling of suspects . "
while careful to say that " every individual who suffered detainment deserves to have their stories told , " kurlander said he could think of other things that warrant more urgent attention from congress .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fort lincoln camp , circa 1943 the problem is , that compared to the huge german-american population in the us at the time , the number of german-americans who were detained is miniscule , kurlander argued .
" you 're in the middle of an extremely destructive war with germany .
there are millions of soldiers on the battlefields , spies , double agents , and 50 million deaths world wide , " kurlander explained .
meanwhile , " tens and hundreds of thousands of people in every country had their lives displaced and disrupted ; they had to flee to the countryside and live in conditions little better than at camps . "
" anyone wrongly put in jail has reason to complain , " kurlander acknowledged .
" but given the scale of crimes committed in that war - by the russian and german governments , and what we ourselves were doing in the pacific to the pows and women and children there … detaining 10 or 11,000 people over a period of three years - we are not talking about anything too significant .

and many observers have seized the debate as a chance to slam the idea of creating a congressional commission to examine 60-year-old events .
but stephen fox , a historian and the author of " fear itself : inside the fbi roundup of german americans during world war ii : the past as prologue , " argues that it is , indeed , important for the government to own up to past actions - especially in light of the current government 's " war on terror " and the newly casual attitudes toward civil liberties .
parallels with guantanamo ?
in an introduction to his book , which contains oral histories and justice department documentation on 50 internees , fox argues : " the most damning aspects of the american internment experience were decisions to hold persons for indeterminate periods on the basis of their political views , their attitudes toward authority , and their personalities - even after it had been determined they were not dangerous . "
bildunterschrift : in us camps , detainees slept in bunkhouses today , americans are " attuned and sensitive to the issue that guantanamo , abu ghraib , and racial profiling here in the us post 9/11 , where people are rounded up and held indeterminately , are invasions of the bill of rights and the constitution , " fox said .
the fact that japanese-american internees were officially acknowledged in the 1980s angered a lot of the surviving germans , fox claimed .
" because they were in the same camps , they thought they should be treated equally , " he said .
but he noted there are two " core problems " in stirring up public sympathy for german-americans from that era .
the first is hitler and the holocaust , which he called " a hurdle german-americans will have a hard time overcoming . "
the other problem is 9/11 , fox said .
" that made it hard for people to have sympathy for people who attack us … and german-americans were perceived during world war ii as enemies of the country . "
numbers are " not too significant " american historian eric kurlander , currently a research fellow at the university of cologne in germany , also advocates studying the past as a way to avoid repeating mistakes .
but , he argued , " there are certainly more significant examples of authoritarian handling of suspects . "
while careful to say that " every individual who suffered detainment deserves to have their stories told , " kurlander said he could think of other things that warrant more urgent attention from congress .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fort lincoln camp , circa 1943 the problem is , that compared to the huge german-american population in the us at the time , the number of german-americans who were detained is miniscule , kurlander argued .
" you 're in the middle of an extremely destructive war with germany .
there are millions of soldiers on the battlefields , spies , double agents , and 50 million deaths world wide , " kurlander explained .
meanwhile , " tens and hundreds of thousands of people in every country had their lives displaced and disrupted ; they had to flee to the countryside and live in conditions little better than at camps . "
" anyone wrongly put in jail has reason to complain , " kurlander acknowledged .
" but given the scale of crimes committed in that war - by the russian and german governments , and what we ourselves were doing in the pacific to the pows and women and children there … detaining 10 or 11,000 people over a period of three years - we are not talking about anything too significant .

why does this prestigious event take place in a small town ? four centuries ago , margrave christian established his residence in bayreuth .
later , the prussian margrave wilhelmine , sister of frederick the great and a dedicated patron of the arts , transformed the princely residence into an arts center and a baroque jewel .
the city 's distinctive landmarks include the " new palace " with its courtly gardens , the " eremitage castle park " and the margrave 's opera house , considered europe 's most beautiful baroque theater .
it all began with a dream but the picturesque bavarian city remains best known for its association with the operatic composer richard wagner who lived in bayreuth from 1872 until his death in 1883 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : richard wagner remains bayreuth 's most famous son wagner , composer , playwright and theater director all rolled into one , dreamed of a gesamtkunstwerk , -lrb- a total work of art -rrb- , that is , a perfect blend of poetry , song and drama .
the established theaters in the big cities were completely inadequate for staging plans of that scale .
so wagner considered staging his own festival .
the margrave 's opera house in bayreuth , which then had the biggest stage in the german speaking lands , came to his attention .
in early 1871 , joined by his wife cosima , wagner traveled to bayreuth .
but he soon realized that a baroque theater with balconies would be unsuitable for his festival idea .
" however , the unique charm and the location of the friendly city itself were what i had been wishing for , " he wrote .
" an utterly beautiful and generous plot of land not far from the town was given to me as a gift and for the purpose of building the theater i had in mind . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bayreuth festspielhaus or opera house the cornerstone to wagner 's festspielhaus was laid in 1872 .
in it , wagner enclosed a piece of paper with the inscription : " herein i enclose a secret , may it rest for a hundred years .
as long as it is protected by stone , it will reveal itself to the world . "
the rich and famous the bayreuth festspielhaus is both a world cultural monument and an ultramodern theater reserved exclusively for the works of richard wagner .
in the evenings , the stage is set alight by dramatic scenes from the germanic legends .
but from early morning , the grounds outdoors are populated by ticket seekers .
the official route to festival admission can involve a wait of seven years or longer .
the number of people seeking tickets exceeds that of tickets available by a factor of 10 to one .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel and her husband have become regulars at the festival on opening day , bayreuth is a firework of myth , fashion and media , where presidents and corporate bosses rub shoulders with show business celebrities .
less sensational are the many music critics on hand , who convey every nuance of the performances inside to the world outside , upholding bayreuth 's status as a musical nerve center of the nation and of the theater world .
since 1876 , the bayreuth festival has accompanied every high and low point of german history .
its current director is a grandson of the composer : 87-year-old wolfgang wagner , who has run the festival since 1951 .
the wagner family , however , has been dogged by a feud over who should run the festival in future .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : katharina wagner could take over the reins of the festival there is speculation that wolfgang wagner 's youngest daughter , katharina could be a possible successor .
the 29-year old has earned some critical acclaim as an opera director on other stages .
the coming season starts on july 25 with katharina wagner 's first production in bayreuth .
she will stage " die meistersinger von nürnberg . " rick fulker -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw 's peter philipp does n't think that this is a good idea . it 's intriguing that a call for stationing international troops in gaza should come from israel , the country which in the course of its history always vehemently opposed such operations .
israel , however , did n't change its attitude about the gaza strip because it wants to support a peace-promoting initiative .
the whole purpose of the exercise is to primarily pull the rug from under hamas ' feet by cutting their weapon supplies .
fatah , on the other hand , would keep getting armed , even from israel itself .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it is , therefore , no wonder that hamas rejected the idea of international forces and threatened to treat them as an occupying power .
it would be a mistake for anybody - whether in brussels or washington - to think seriously about acting on israel 's offer .
unlike south lebanon , where a un force -lrb- unifil -rrb- has been trying for years to support the re-assertion of lebanese state sovereignty , the gaza strip is no sovereign state .
it is , instead , an area marked by a struggle for power .
it would be unimaginable for either europeans or americans to have even the remotest interest in trying to maintain order there .
and even as a border patrol , the deployment would be useless .
if the smuggling of weapons to the gaza strip were really to be cut off , then egypt would be in the best position to do it : it controls the southern side of the gaza border and should be able to prevent the smuggling of weapons from its territory .
in general , not only egypt but also other arab countries should get involved : the arab league welcomed the formation of the palestinian unity government ; it has always treated the palestine conflict as its central subject and it should have a strong interest in preventing the escalation of violence in gaza - especially after it presented its own peace plan in beirut and riad .
the arab league can not allow all this to fall through because of the power struggle between hamas and fatah , let alone because no arab leader has an interest in a hamas-controlled unit in gaza .
the arab league should perhaps establish its own deployment force and send it to gaza : its contingent would be in the eyes of hamas and fatah much less suspicious than the europeans or the americans , and the league could prove for the first time in its history that it 's capable of more than making proclamations and passing resolutions .
and if that did happen , one could count on israel rejecting international troops again .
that 's not how olmert 's government imagined the whole affair .

dw 's peter philipp does n't think that this is a good idea . it 's intriguing that a call for stationing international troops in gaza should come from israel , the country which in the course of its history always vehemently opposed such operations .
israel , however , did n't change its attitude about the gaza strip because it wants to support a peace-promoting initiative .
the whole purpose of the exercise is to primarily pull the rug from under hamas ' feet by cutting their weapon supplies .
fatah , on the other hand , would keep getting armed , even from israel itself .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it is , therefore , no wonder that hamas rejected the idea of international forces and threatened to treat them as an occupying power .
it would be a mistake for anybody - whether in brussels or washington - to think seriously about acting on israel 's offer .
unlike south lebanon , where a un force -lrb- unifil -rrb- has been trying for years to support the re-assertion of lebanese state sovereignty , the gaza strip is no sovereign state .
it is , instead , an area marked by a struggle for power .
it would be unimaginable for either europeans or americans to have even the remotest interest in trying to maintain order there .
and even as a border patrol , the deployment would be useless .
if the smuggling of weapons to the gaza strip were really to be cut off , then egypt would be in the best position to do it : it controls the southern side of the gaza border and should be able to prevent the smuggling of weapons from its territory .
in general , not only egypt but also other arab countries should get involved : the arab league welcomed the formation of the palestinian unity government ; it has always treated the palestine conflict as its central subject and it should have a strong interest in preventing the escalation of violence in gaza - especially after it presented its own peace plan in beirut and riad .
the arab league can not allow all this to fall through because of the power struggle between hamas and fatah , let alone because no arab leader has an interest in a hamas-controlled unit in gaza .
the arab league should perhaps establish its own deployment force and send it to gaza : its contingent would be in the eyes of hamas and fatah much less suspicious than the europeans or the americans , and the league could prove for the first time in its history that it 's capable of more than making proclamations and passing resolutions .
and if that did happen , one could count on israel rejecting international troops again .

the organization , whose primary goal is to improve living conditions of people in developing regions , reached a milestone of a different kind on wednesday as it released financial figures for 2006 .
for the first time , the gtz 's business volume surpassed the one billion euro mark .
turnover rose to a total of 917.8 million euros -lrb- $ 1,221.42 million -rrb- , marking an increase of 4.8 percent over the previous year .
in the case of charitable donations , the group took in a whopping 770 million euros - a rise of 11 percent on last year .
aid contracts from around the world wolfgang schmitt , director of the organization , said the extraordinarily good figures mirrored the high esteem that the gtz is held in for its work not just in germany but around the world .
" there 's been a trend in the past years that others donors , industrialized countries and other developing nations have been increasingly supplying their own funds to engage the gtz , " he said .
" the trend has been continuing and so we can now almost speak of records . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul the gtz 's main employer last year remained the german ministry for economic cooperation and development which handed the aid group more than 700 million euros to realize development projects in africa and other regions .
but even co-financed projects , where third parties supply additional funds for projects that the gtz carries out for the german development ministry , got a huge boost last year by rising 29 percent to 61 million euros .
the un refugee agency , unhcr , was the biggest player here by bankrolling the gtz with 21 million euros .
the gtz also raked in a host of contracts from around the world - the ethiopian government built a network of health care centers with the help of development experts from the gtz and even institutions such as the world bank and the eu commission hired the services of the german aid group .
recipe to success schmitt emphasized that the gtz had become something of a world leader in the field of developmental aid .
the recipe to its success is the gtz 's focus on long-term goals and sustainability as opposed to other aid organizations , schmitt said .
" there 's a tendency in the development industry to score quick successes , " schmitt said .
" but if you look at the problems and responsibilities in the field , then you realize that these are things for which even europe needed centuries to overcome .
that 's why you need to have patience and stamina when it comes to development and cooperation . "
rosy future bernd eisenblätter , another gtz director , said the organization tended to attract skilled and highly qualified applicants around the world . last year , the number of gtz experts sent abroad rose by 4.8 percent to 1,100 persons .
most of them -lrb- 39 percent -rrb- work in africa .
" we get many more applicants than we can hire , even on a limited basis , " eisenblätter said .
" they 're highly-motivated , highly-qualified and 60 to 70 percent of them are women .
that 's why i 'm not worried at all about the future of the gtz .
it shows there 's huge potential and a huge interest in the field of development work and in the gtz . " dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the organization , whose primary goal is to improve living conditions of people in developing regions , reached a milestone of a different kind on wednesday as it released financial figures for 2006 .
for the first time , the gtz 's business volume surpassed the one billion euro mark .
turnover rose to a total of 917.8 million euros -lrb- $ 1,221.42 million -rrb- , marking an increase of 4.8 percent over the previous year .
in the case of charitable donations , the group took in a whopping 770 million euros - a rise of 11 percent on last year .
aid contracts from around the world wolfgang schmitt , director of the organization , said the extraordinarily good figures mirrored the high esteem that the gtz is held in for its work not just in germany but around the world .
" there 's been a trend in the past years that others donors , industrialized countries and other developing nations have been increasingly supplying their own funds to engage the gtz , " he said .
" the trend has been continuing and so we can now almost speak of records . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul the gtz 's main employer last year remained the german ministry for economic cooperation and development which handed the aid group more than 700 million euros to realize development projects in africa and other regions .
but even co-financed projects , where third parties supply additional funds for projects that the gtz carries out for the german development ministry , got a huge boost last year by rising 29 percent to 61 million euros .
the un refugee agency , unhcr , was the biggest player here by bankrolling the gtz with 21 million euros .
the gtz also raked in a host of contracts from around the world - the ethiopian government built a network of health care centers with the help of development experts from the gtz and even institutions such as the world bank and the eu commission hired the services of the german aid group .
recipe to success schmitt emphasized that the gtz had become something of a world leader in the field of developmental aid .
the recipe to its success is the gtz 's focus on long-term goals and sustainability as opposed to other aid organizations , schmitt said .
" there 's a tendency in the development industry to score quick successes , " schmitt said .
" but if you look at the problems and responsibilities in the field , then you realize that these are things for which even europe needed centuries to overcome .
that 's why you need to have patience and stamina when it comes to development and cooperation . "
rosy future bernd eisenblätter , another gtz director , said the organization tended to attract skilled and highly qualified applicants around the world . last year , the number of gtz experts sent abroad rose by 4.8 percent to 1,100 persons .
most of them -lrb- 39 percent -rrb- work in africa .
" we get many more applicants than we can hire , even on a limited basis , " eisenblätter said .
" they 're highly-motivated , highly-qualified and 60 to 70 percent of them are women .
that 's why i 'm not worried at all about the future of the gtz .
it shows there 's huge potential and a huge interest in the field of development work and in the gtz . " dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

why does this prestigious event take place in a small town ? four centuries ago , margrave christian established his residence in bayreuth .
later , the prussian margrave wilhelmine , sister of frederick the great and a dedicated patron of the arts , transformed the princely residence into an arts center and a baroque jewel .
the city 's distinctive landmarks include the " new palace " with its courtly gardens , the " eremitage castle park " and the margrave 's opera house , considered europe 's most beautiful baroque theater .
it all began with a dream but the picturesque bavarian city remains best known for its association with the operatic composer richard wagner who lived in bayreuth from 1872 until his death in 1883 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : richard wagner remains bayreuth 's most famous son wagner , composer , playwright and theater director all rolled into one , dreamed of a gesamtkunstwerk , -lrb- a total work of art -rrb- , that is , a perfect blend of poetry , song and drama .
the established theaters in the big cities were completely inadequate for staging plans of that scale .
so wagner considered staging his own festival .
the margrave 's opera house in bayreuth , which then had the biggest stage in the german speaking lands , came to his attention .
in early 1871 , joined by his wife cosima , wagner traveled to bayreuth .
but he soon realized that a baroque theater with balconies would be unsuitable for his festival idea .
" however , the unique charm and the location of the friendly city itself were what i had been wishing for , " he wrote .
" an utterly beautiful and generous plot of land not far from the town was given to me as a gift and for the purpose of building the theater i had in mind . "

as long as it is protected by stone , it will reveal itself to the world . "
the rich and famous the bayreuth festspielhaus is both a world cultural monument and an ultramodern theater reserved exclusively for the works of richard wagner .
in the evenings , the stage is set alight by dramatic scenes from the germanic legends .
but from early morning , the grounds outdoors are populated by ticket seekers .
the official route to festival admission can involve a wait of seven years or longer .
the number of people seeking tickets exceeds that of tickets available by a factor of 10 to one .

less sensational are the many music critics on hand , who convey every nuance of the performances inside to the world outside , upholding bayreuth 's status as a musical nerve center of the nation and of the theater world .
since 1876 , the bayreuth festival has accompanied every high and low point of german history .
its current director is a grandson of the composer : 87-year-old wolfgang wagner , who has run the festival since 1951 .
the wagner family , however , has been dogged by a feud over who should run the festival in future .

the major powers mediating for middle east peace affirmed friday their " full support " for embattled palestinian leader mahmoud abbas , eu foreign policy chief javier solana 's spokeswoman said .
egypt recalled its diplomatic and security delegations to the gaza strip .
" the presidency of the european union condemns in the strongest terms the violent seizure of power by hamas militia in the gaza strip , " martin jäger , german foreign ministry spokesman , said on behalf of the eu leadership .
" we condemn the killing of innocent civilians and legitimate security forces , " the spokesman said .
hamas in control hamas fighters were in full control of the gaza strip on friday , creating an islamic enclave on israel 's doorstep and further clouding prospects for peace after routing their secular fatah rivals in days of vicious gun battles .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a hamas militant on an armored personnel carrier inside abbas ' headquarters the radical islamist group - branded a terrorist organization by israel and the west - overran the territory hours after abbas sacked the government and declared a state of emergency in a bid to avert all-out civil war .
jäger joined the united states in backing abbas , insisting that his decision to dismiss the three-month-old hamas-fatah unity government was " in accordance with the palestinian constitution . "
germany holds the eu presidency until the end of the month .
british foreign secretary margaret beckett stressed it would be wrong for hamas to benefit from its seizure of power in gaza .
" the notion that somehow mounting a coup d 'etat is something that should be rewarded by the international community seems to me to be completely bizarre , " she said .
" this is the fault of people in hamas who want control , not partnership , " she added , stressing that the events of recent days were " not the way forward . "
" extreme concern " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commissioner for external relations benita ferrero waldner eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner also expressed " extreme concern " over the gaza conflict and said in a statement she would hold talks with top quartet officials on friday .
the united states has already given full backing to abbas .
us secretary of state condoleezza rice said : " president abbas has exercised his lawful authority as president of the palestinian authority and leader of the palestinian people , " rice told reporters on wednesday .
" and we fully support him in his decisions to try to end this crisis for the palestinian people and to give them an opportunity to return to peace and a better future , " she said .
russia 's foreign minister sergei lavrov did not take sides in the conflict but said friday no un troops could be sent to gaza unless hamas and fatah agreed to such a deployment .
the palestinians should halt their " fratricidal " conflict , the russian foreign ministry said in a separate statement .
cairo meeting arab foreign ministers brought forward a cairo meeting scheduled originally for saturday to discuss the crisis .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamas militants in front of the security headquarters after they captured it from fatah arab league ambassadors appealed to both hamas and abbas ' secular fatah faction to return to egyptian-sponsored reconciliation talks .
egypt had been trying to broker a face-to-face meeting between the two sides after separate talks , but the breakdown of that effort was swiftly followed by the latest fighting in which at least 113 people have been killed .
" its failure , god forbid , will have deeply negative consequences , " the ambassadors warned . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german soldiers killed nearly 80 percent of the south west africa tribe during colonial rule more than 100 years ago . in 1904 in the german territory of south west africa , today 's namibia , german troops led by general lothar von trotha mercilessly put down a rebellion of the indigenous herero people .
general von trotha once remarked he wanted to exterminate " the revolting tribes in rivers of blood . "
by the time the conflict ended four years later , between 45,000 to 65,000 herero were killed , many of whom suffered in work camps some consider the forerunners to wwii-era concentration camps .
germany 's development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul publically apologized for the genocide three years ago .
so far , successive german governments have refused to enter into any discussions on possible reparations .
decrying " business as ususal " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : henrik witboi was a herero chief but germany 's left party wants to begin talks between germany and namibia that could lead to monetary compensation .
hüseyin aydin , spokesperson for the left party , said the acknowledgement of a genocide meant no one could continue with business as usual .
members of the ruling coalition made up of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- voiced opposition to the idea of reparations .
anke eimer of the cdu said " isolated views " in favor of reparations did not reflect the general opinion in namibia .
gert weisskirchen of the spd expressed his disgust at the killings but rejected what he called intentions of the left party " to instrumentalize the sufferings " of the herero and nama people .
he also reminded parliament of germany 's generous development aid to namibia .
a request for dialogue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a herero woman wearing the traditional hat chief kuaima riruako , the traditional leader of the herero people , attended the wednesday parliamentary debate with his wife , who was dressed in traditional herero style with the unique broad hat .
earlier wednesday , riruako had thanked the left party for its initiative .
he also expressed satisfaction that munich had changed general von trotha street to herero street .
" more than 100 years after the fateful war against my people i am not here to seek revenge against anybody , " riruako told deutsche welle .
" i have only been appealing to the government of the federal republic of germany for a dialogue so that we can talk about our colonial experience . "
the herero never completely recovered from the conflict and of the around 100,000 that today live in namibia many live in poverty or work on the farms of white landowners .
in 2001 , tribal leaders tried to sue germany for compensation in us courts , but the claim for $ 4 billion -lrb- 3.12 billion euros -rrb- never went very far .
they also want reparations from deutsche bank , which allegedly profited from the forced labor in the camps .
the german parliament 's motion on reparations was referred to some committees of the parliament .
a final vote is not expected until the fall .
observers doubt the ruling coalition will vote in favor of reparations . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german soldiers killed nearly 80 percent of the south west africa tribe during colonial rule more than 100 years ago . in 1904 in the german territory of south west africa , today 's namibia , german troops led by general lothar von trotha mercilessly put down a rebellion of the indigenous herero people .
general von trotha once remarked he wanted to exterminate " the revolting tribes in rivers of blood . "
by the time the conflict ended four years later , between 45,000 to 65,000 herero were killed , many of whom suffered in work camps some consider the forerunners to wwii-era concentration camps .
germany 's development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul publically apologized for the genocide three years ago .
so far , successive german governments have refused to enter into any discussions on possible reparations .
decrying " business as ususal " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : henrik witboi was a herero chief but germany 's left party wants to begin talks between germany and namibia that could lead to monetary compensation .
hüseyin aydin , spokesperson for the left party , said the acknowledgement of a genocide meant no one could continue with business as usual .
members of the ruling coalition made up of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- voiced opposition to the idea of reparations .
anke eimer of the cdu said " isolated views " in favor of reparations did not reflect the general opinion in namibia .
gert weisskirchen of the spd expressed his disgust at the killings but rejected what he called intentions of the left party " to instrumentalize the sufferings " of the herero and nama people .
he also reminded parliament of germany 's generous development aid to namibia .
a request for dialogue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a herero woman wearing the traditional hat chief kuaima riruako , the traditional leader of the herero people , attended the wednesday parliamentary debate with his wife , who was dressed in traditional herero style with the unique broad hat .
earlier wednesday , riruako had thanked the left party for its initiative .
he also expressed satisfaction that munich had changed general von trotha street to herero street .
" more than 100 years after the fateful war against my people i am not here to seek revenge against anybody , " riruako told deutsche welle .
" i have only been appealing to the government of the federal republic of germany for a dialogue so that we can talk about our colonial experience . "
the herero never completely recovered from the conflict and of the around 100,000 that today live in namibia many live in poverty or work on the farms of white landowners .
in 2001 , tribal leaders tried to sue germany for compensation in us courts , but the claim for $ 4 billion -lrb- 3.12 billion euros -rrb- never went very far .
they also want reparations from deutsche bank , which allegedly profited from the forced labor in the camps .
the german parliament 's motion on reparations was referred to some committees of the parliament .
a final vote is not expected until the fall .
observers doubt the ruling coalition will vote in favor of reparations . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

terror suspects bound for guantanamo bay ?
not quite .
the scenario applied to thousands of german-americans during world war ii , whose experience of wartime internment has so far had little publicity , and even less sympathy , in the us .
the story of how the us treated japanese-americans during world war ii is well known .
some 120,000 men , women and children living on the west coast , the majority of them us citizens , were stripped of their property and sent to remote " war relocation camps " in the interior of the country .
bildunterschrift : activities were part of camp life ; here , the sports club but the plight of the 11,000 german resident aliens who were also sent to wartime internment in the us has gotten little attention so far .
earlier this month , us senator russ feingold of wisconsin , whose constituency is heavily german-american , took a step toward changing that .
for the past six years , feingold has been trying to pass a bill to create a commission that would examine the us treatment of interned german-americans - as well as italians and other europeans - during world war ii .
a second commission would look at the treatment of jewish refugees fleeing persecution .
" these people are dying " a stand-alone bill on the " wartime treatment study act " has been blocked repeatedly over the last six years by an anonymous republican senator .
now the legislation - which was passed in the form of an amendment to the controversial immigration bill - is uncertain .
" it is so urgent that we pass this legislation , " the liberal democrat feingold said when he introduced the amendment .
" we can not wait any longer … the people who were affected by these policies are dying . "
congress " did the right thing by recognizing and apologizing for the mistreatment of japanese-americans during world war ii , " feingold said .
" but our work in this area is not done . "
no reparations - just accounting bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of japanese were sent from the coast to the middle of the country unlike surviving japanese americans , who were awarded $ 1.2 billion in reparations in 1988 as part of the modern " redress movement , " feingold 's amendment does not seek reparations for the interned germans or their families .
rather , it would " simply review the facts and circumstances the us government 's treatment of german-americans , italian-americans and other european-americans during world war ii . "
survivors from the era and historians alike have made clear that the situation in the camps was far from dire , and that the detainees were , on the whole , treated humanely .
and many observers have seized the debate as a chance to slam the idea of creating a congressional commission to examine 60-year-old events .
but stephen fox , a historian and the author of " fear itself : inside the fbi roundup of german americans during world war ii : the past as prologue , " argues that it is , indeed , important for the government to own up to past actions - especially in light of the current government 's " war on terror " and the newly casual attitudes toward civil liberties .
parallels with guantanamo ?
in an introduction to his book , which contains oral histories and justice department documentation on 50 internees , fox argues : " the most damning aspects of the american internment experience were decisions to hold persons for indeterminate periods on the basis of their political views , their attitudes toward authority , and their personalities - even after it had been determined they were not dangerous . "
bildunterschrift : in us camps , detainees slept in bunkhouses today , americans are " attuned and sensitive to the issue that guantanamo , abu ghraib , and racial profiling here in the us post 9/11 , where people are rounded up and held indeterminately , are invasions of the bill of rights and the constitution , " fox said .
the fact that japanese-american internees were officially acknowledged in the 1980s angered a lot of the surviving germans , fox claimed .
" because they were in the same camps , they thought they should be treated equally , " he said .
but he noted there are two " core problems " in stirring up public sympathy for german-americans from that era .
the first is hitler and the holocaust , which he called " a hurdle german-americans will have a hard time overcoming . "
the other problem is 9/11 , fox said .
" that made it hard for people to have sympathy for people who attack us … and german-americans were perceived during world war ii as enemies of the country . "
numbers are " not too significant " american historian eric kurlander , currently a research fellow at the university of cologne in germany , also advocates studying the past as a way to avoid repeating mistakes .
but , he argued , " there are certainly more significant examples of authoritarian handling of suspects . "
while careful to say that " every individual who suffered detainment deserves to have their stories told , " kurlander said he could think of other things that warrant more urgent attention from congress .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fort lincoln camp , circa 1943 the problem is , that compared to the huge german-american population in the us at the time , the number of german-americans who were detained is miniscule , kurlander argued .
" you 're in the middle of an extremely destructive war with germany .
there are millions of soldiers on the battlefields , spies , double agents , and 50 million deaths world wide , " kurlander explained .
meanwhile , " tens and hundreds of thousands of people in every country had their lives displaced and disrupted ; they had to flee to the countryside and live in conditions little better than at camps . "
" anyone wrongly put in jail has reason to complain , " kurlander acknowledged .
" but given the scale of crimes committed in that war - by the russian and german governments , and what we ourselves were doing in the pacific to the pows and women and children there … detaining 10 or 11,000 people over a period of three years - we are not talking about anything too significant .

the first is hitler and the holocaust , which he called " a hurdle german-americans will have a hard time overcoming . "

numbers are " not too significant " american historian eric kurlander , currently a research fellow at the university of cologne in germany , also advocates studying the past as a way to avoid repeating mistakes .
but , he argued , " there are certainly more significant examples of authoritarian handling of suspects . "
while careful to say that " every individual who suffered detainment deserves to have their stories told , " kurlander said he could think of other things that warrant more urgent attention from congress .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fort lincoln camp , circa 1943 the problem is , that compared to the huge german-american population in the us at the time , the number of german-americans who were detained is miniscule , kurlander argued .

terror suspects bound for guantanamo bay ?
not quite .
the scenario applied to thousands of german-americans during world war ii , whose experience of wartime internment has so far had little publicity , and even less sympathy , in the us .
the story of how the us treated japanese-americans during world war ii is well known .
some 120,000 men , women and children living on the west coast , the majority of them us citizens , were stripped of their property and sent to remote " war relocation camps " in the interior of the country .
bildunterschrift : activities were part of camp life ; here , the sports club but the plight of the 11,000 german resident aliens who were also sent to wartime internment in the us has gotten little attention so far .
earlier this month , us senator russ feingold of wisconsin , whose constituency is heavily german-american , took a step toward changing that .
for the past six years , feingold has been trying to pass a bill to create a commission that would examine the us treatment of interned german-americans - as well as italians and other europeans - during world war ii .
a second commission would look at the treatment of jewish refugees fleeing persecution .
" these people are dying " a stand-alone bill on the " wartime treatment study act " has been blocked repeatedly over the last six years by an anonymous republican senator .
now the legislation - which was passed in the form of an amendment to the controversial immigration bill - is uncertain .
" it is so urgent that we pass this legislation , " the liberal democrat feingold said when he introduced the amendment .
" we can not wait any longer … the people who were affected by these policies are dying . "
congress " did the right thing by recognizing and apologizing for the mistreatment of japanese-americans during world war ii , " feingold said .
" but our work in this area is not done . "
no reparations - just accounting bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of japanese were sent from the coast to the middle of the country unlike surviving japanese americans , who were awarded $ 1.2 billion in reparations in 1988 as part of the modern " redress movement , " feingold 's amendment does not seek reparations for the interned germans or their families .
rather , it would " simply review the facts and circumstances the us government 's treatment of german-americans , italian-americans and other european-americans during world war ii . "
survivors from the era and historians alike have made clear that the situation in the camps was far from dire , and that the detainees were , on the whole , treated humanely .
and many observers have seized the debate as a chance to slam the idea of creating a congressional commission to examine 60-year-old events .
but stephen fox , a historian and the author of " fear itself : inside the fbi roundup of german americans during world war ii : the past as prologue , " argues that it is , indeed , important for the government to own up to past actions - especially in light of the current government 's " war on terror " and the newly casual attitudes toward civil liberties .
parallels with guantanamo ?
in an introduction to his book , which contains oral histories and justice department documentation on 50 internees , fox argues : " the most damning aspects of the american internment experience were decisions to hold persons for indeterminate periods on the basis of their political views , their attitudes toward authority , and their personalities - even after it had been determined they were not dangerous . "
bildunterschrift : in us camps , detainees slept in bunkhouses today , americans are " attuned and sensitive to the issue that guantanamo , abu ghraib , and racial profiling here in the us post 9/11 , where people are rounded up and held indeterminately , are invasions of the bill of rights and the constitution , " fox said .
the fact that japanese-american internees were officially acknowledged in the 1980s angered a lot of the surviving germans , fox claimed .
" because they were in the same camps , they thought they should be treated equally , " he said .
but he noted there are two " core problems " in stirring up public sympathy for german-americans from that era .
the first is hitler and the holocaust , which he called " a hurdle german-americans will have a hard time overcoming . "

the major powers mediating for middle east peace affirmed friday their " full support " for embattled palestinian leader mahmoud abbas , eu foreign policy chief javier solana 's spokeswoman said .
egypt recalled its diplomatic and security delegations to the gaza strip .
" the presidency of the european union condemns in the strongest terms the violent seizure of power by hamas militia in the gaza strip , " martin jäger , german foreign ministry spokesman , said on behalf of the eu leadership .
" we condemn the killing of innocent civilians and legitimate security forces , " the spokesman said .
hamas in control hamas fighters were in full control of the gaza strip on friday , creating an islamic enclave on israel 's doorstep and further clouding prospects for peace after routing their secular fatah rivals in days of vicious gun battles .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a hamas militant on an armored personnel carrier inside abbas ' headquarters the radical islamist group - branded a terrorist organization by israel and the west - overran the territory hours after abbas sacked the government and declared a state of emergency in a bid to avert all-out civil war .
jäger joined the united states in backing abbas , insisting that his decision to dismiss the three-month-old hamas-fatah unity government was " in accordance with the palestinian constitution . "
germany holds the eu presidency until the end of the month .
british foreign secretary margaret beckett stressed it would be wrong for hamas to benefit from its seizure of power in gaza .
" the notion that somehow mounting a coup d 'etat is something that should be rewarded by the international community seems to me to be completely bizarre , " she said .
" this is the fault of people in hamas who want control , not partnership , " she added , stressing that the events of recent days were " not the way forward . "
" extreme concern " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commissioner for external relations benita ferrero waldner eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner also expressed " extreme concern " over the gaza conflict and said in a statement she would hold talks with top quartet officials on friday .
the united states has already given full backing to abbas .
us secretary of state condoleezza rice said : " president abbas has exercised his lawful authority as president of the palestinian authority and leader of the palestinian people , " rice told reporters on wednesday .
" and we fully support him in his decisions to try to end this crisis for the palestinian people and to give them an opportunity to return to peace and a better future , " she said .
russia 's foreign minister sergei lavrov did not take sides in the conflict but said friday no un troops could be sent to gaza unless hamas and fatah agreed to such a deployment .
the palestinians should halt their " fratricidal " conflict , the russian foreign ministry said in a separate statement .
cairo meeting arab foreign ministers brought forward a cairo meeting scheduled originally for saturday to discuss the crisis .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamas militants in front of the security headquarters after they captured it from fatah arab league ambassadors appealed to both hamas and abbas ' secular fatah faction to return to egyptian-sponsored reconciliation talks .
egypt had been trying to broker a face-to-face meeting between the two sides after separate talks , but the breakdown of that effort was swiftly followed by the latest fighting in which at least 113 people have been killed .
" its failure , god forbid , will have deeply negative consequences , " the ambassadors warned . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the organization , whose primary goal is to improve living conditions of people in developing regions , reached a milestone of a different kind on wednesday as it released financial figures for 2006 .
for the first time , the gtz 's business volume surpassed the one billion euro mark .
turnover rose to a total of 917.8 million euros -lrb- $ 1,221.42 million -rrb- , marking an increase of 4.8 percent over the previous year .
in the case of charitable donations , the group took in a whopping 770 million euros - a rise of 11 percent on last year .
aid contracts from around the world wolfgang schmitt , director of the organization , said the extraordinarily good figures mirrored the high esteem that the gtz is held in for its work not just in germany but around the world .
" there 's been a trend in the past years that others donors , industrialized countries and other developing nations have been increasingly supplying their own funds to engage the gtz , " he said .
" the trend has been continuing and so we can now almost speak of records . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul the gtz 's main employer last year remained the german ministry for economic cooperation and development which handed the aid group more than 700 million euros to realize development projects in africa and other regions .
but even co-financed projects , where third parties supply additional funds for projects that the gtz carries out for the german development ministry , got a huge boost last year by rising 29 percent to 61 million euros .
the un refugee agency , unhcr , was the biggest player here by bankrolling the gtz with 21 million euros .
the gtz also raked in a host of contracts from around the world - the ethiopian government built a network of health care centers with the help of development experts from the gtz and even institutions such as the world bank and the eu commission hired the services of the german aid group .
recipe to success schmitt emphasized that the gtz had become something of a world leader in the field of developmental aid .
the recipe to its success is the gtz 's focus on long-term goals and sustainability as opposed to other aid organizations , schmitt said .
" there 's a tendency in the development industry to score quick successes , " schmitt said .
" but if you look at the problems and responsibilities in the field , then you realize that these are things for which even europe needed centuries to overcome .
that 's why you need to have patience and stamina when it comes to development and cooperation . "
rosy future bernd eisenblätter , another gtz director , said the organization tended to attract skilled and highly qualified applicants around the world . last year , the number of gtz experts sent abroad rose by 4.8 percent to 1,100 persons .
most of them -lrb- 39 percent -rrb- work in africa .
" we get many more applicants than we can hire , even on a limited basis , " eisenblätter said .
" they 're highly-motivated , highly-qualified and 60 to 70 percent of them are women .
that 's why i 'm not worried at all about the future of the gtz .

dw 's peter philipp does n't think that this is a good idea . it 's intriguing that a call for stationing international troops in gaza should come from israel , the country which in the course of its history always vehemently opposed such operations .
israel , however , did n't change its attitude about the gaza strip because it wants to support a peace-promoting initiative .

german soldiers killed nearly 80 percent of the south west africa tribe during colonial rule more than 100 years ago . in 1904 in the german territory of south west africa , today 's namibia , german troops led by general lothar von trotha mercilessly put down a rebellion of the indigenous herero people .
general von trotha once remarked he wanted to exterminate " the revolting tribes in rivers of blood . "
by the time the conflict ended four years later , between 45,000 to 65,000 herero were killed , many of whom suffered in work camps some consider the forerunners to wwii-era concentration camps .
germany 's development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul publically apologized for the genocide three years ago .
so far , successive german governments have refused to enter into any discussions on possible reparations .
decrying " business as ususal " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : henrik witboi was a herero chief but germany 's left party wants to begin talks between germany and namibia that could lead to monetary compensation .
hüseyin aydin , spokesperson for the left party , said the acknowledgement of a genocide meant no one could continue with business as usual .
members of the ruling coalition made up of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- voiced opposition to the idea of reparations .
anke eimer of the cdu said " isolated views " in favor of reparations did not reflect the general opinion in namibia .
gert weisskirchen of the spd expressed his disgust at the killings but rejected what he called intentions of the left party " to instrumentalize the sufferings " of the herero and nama people .
he also reminded parliament of germany 's generous development aid to namibia .

earlier wednesday , riruako had thanked the left party for its initiative .
he also expressed satisfaction that munich had changed general von trotha street to herero street .
" more than 100 years after the fateful war against my people i am not here to seek revenge against anybody , " riruako told deutsche welle .
" i have only been appealing to the government of the federal republic of germany for a dialogue so that we can talk about our colonial experience . "
the herero never completely recovered from the conflict and of the around 100,000 that today live in namibia many live in poverty or work on the farms of white landowners .
in 2001 , tribal leaders tried to sue germany for compensation in us courts , but the claim for $ 4 billion -lrb- 3.12 billion euros -rrb- never went very far .
they also want reparations from deutsche bank , which allegedly profited from the forced labor in the camps .

german soldiers killed nearly 80 percent of the south west africa tribe during colonial rule more than 100 years ago . in 1904 in the german territory of south west africa , today 's namibia , german troops led by general lothar von trotha mercilessly put down a rebellion of the indigenous herero people .
general von trotha once remarked he wanted to exterminate " the revolting tribes in rivers of blood . "
by the time the conflict ended four years later , between 45,000 to 65,000 herero were killed , many of whom suffered in work camps some consider the forerunners to wwii-era concentration camps .
germany 's development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul publically apologized for the genocide three years ago .
so far , successive german governments have refused to enter into any discussions on possible reparations .
decrying " business as ususal " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : henrik witboi was a herero chief but germany 's left party wants to begin talks between germany and namibia that could lead to monetary compensation .
hüseyin aydin , spokesperson for the left party , said the acknowledgement of a genocide meant no one could continue with business as usual .
members of the ruling coalition made up of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- voiced opposition to the idea of reparations .
anke eimer of the cdu said " isolated views " in favor of reparations did not reflect the general opinion in namibia .
gert weisskirchen of the spd expressed his disgust at the killings but rejected what he called intentions of the left party " to instrumentalize the sufferings " of the herero and nama people .
he also reminded parliament of germany 's generous development aid to namibia .
a request for dialogue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a herero woman wearing the traditional hat chief kuaima riruako , the traditional leader of the herero people , attended the wednesday parliamentary debate with his wife , who was dressed in traditional herero style with the unique broad hat .
earlier wednesday , riruako had thanked the left party for its initiative .
he also expressed satisfaction that munich had changed general von trotha street to herero street .
" more than 100 years after the fateful war against my people i am not here to seek revenge against anybody , " riruako told deutsche welle .
" i have only been appealing to the government of the federal republic of germany for a dialogue so that we can talk about our colonial experience . "
the herero never completely recovered from the conflict and of the around 100,000 that today live in namibia many live in poverty or work on the farms of white landowners .
in 2001 , tribal leaders tried to sue germany for compensation in us courts , but the claim for $ 4 billion -lrb- 3.12 billion euros -rrb- never went very far .
they also want reparations from deutsche bank , which allegedly profited from the forced labor in the camps .
the german parliament 's motion on reparations was referred to some committees of the parliament .
a final vote is not expected until the fall .
observers doubt the ruling coalition will vote in favor of reparations . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

terror suspects bound for guantanamo bay ?
not quite .
the scenario applied to thousands of german-americans during world war ii , whose experience of wartime internment has so far had little publicity , and even less sympathy , in the us .
the story of how the us treated japanese-americans during world war ii is well known .
some 120,000 men , women and children living on the west coast , the majority of them us citizens , were stripped of their property and sent to remote " war relocation camps " in the interior of the country .
bildunterschrift : activities were part of camp life ; here , the sports club but the plight of the 11,000 german resident aliens who were also sent to wartime internment in the us has gotten little attention so far .
earlier this month , us senator russ feingold of wisconsin , whose constituency is heavily german-american , took a step toward changing that .
for the past six years , feingold has been trying to pass a bill to create a commission that would examine the us treatment of interned german-americans - as well as italians and other europeans - during world war ii .
a second commission would look at the treatment of jewish refugees fleeing persecution .
" these people are dying " a stand-alone bill on the " wartime treatment study act " has been blocked repeatedly over the last six years by an anonymous republican senator .
now the legislation - which was passed in the form of an amendment to the controversial immigration bill - is uncertain .
" it is so urgent that we pass this legislation , " the liberal democrat feingold said when he introduced the amendment .
" we can not wait any longer … the people who were affected by these policies are dying . "
congress " did the right thing by recognizing and apologizing for the mistreatment of japanese-americans during world war ii , " feingold said .
" but our work in this area is not done . "
no reparations - just accounting bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of japanese were sent from the coast to the middle of the country unlike surviving japanese americans , who were awarded $ 1.2 billion in reparations in 1988 as part of the modern " redress movement , " feingold 's amendment does not seek reparations for the interned germans or their families .
rather , it would " simply review the facts and circumstances the us government 's treatment of german-americans , italian-americans and other european-americans during world war ii . "
survivors from the era and historians alike have made clear that the situation in the camps was far from dire , and that the detainees were , on the whole , treated humanely .
and many observers have seized the debate as a chance to slam the idea of creating a congressional commission to examine 60-year-old events .
but stephen fox , a historian and the author of " fear itself : inside the fbi roundup of german americans during world war ii : the past as prologue , " argues that it is , indeed , important for the government to own up to past actions - especially in light of the current government 's " war on terror " and the newly casual attitudes toward civil liberties .
parallels with guantanamo ?
in an introduction to his book , which contains oral histories and justice department documentation on 50 internees , fox argues : " the most damning aspects of the american internment experience were decisions to hold persons for indeterminate periods on the basis of their political views , their attitudes toward authority , and their personalities - even after it had been determined they were not dangerous . "
bildunterschrift : in us camps , detainees slept in bunkhouses today , americans are " attuned and sensitive to the issue that guantanamo , abu ghraib , and racial profiling here in the us post 9/11 , where people are rounded up and held indeterminately , are invasions of the bill of rights and the constitution , " fox said .
the fact that japanese-american internees were officially acknowledged in the 1980s angered a lot of the surviving germans , fox claimed .
" because they were in the same camps , they thought they should be treated equally , " he said .
but he noted there are two " core problems " in stirring up public sympathy for german-americans from that era .
the first is hitler and the holocaust , which he called " a hurdle german-americans will have a hard time overcoming . "
the other problem is 9/11 , fox said .
" that made it hard for people to have sympathy for people who attack us … and german-americans were perceived during world war ii as enemies of the country . "
numbers are " not too significant " american historian eric kurlander , currently a research fellow at the university of cologne in germany , also advocates studying the past as a way to avoid repeating mistakes .
but , he argued , " there are certainly more significant examples of authoritarian handling of suspects . "
while careful to say that " every individual who suffered detainment deserves to have their stories told , " kurlander said he could think of other things that warrant more urgent attention from congress .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fort lincoln camp , circa 1943 the problem is , that compared to the huge german-american population in the us at the time , the number of german-americans who were detained is miniscule , kurlander argued .
" you 're in the middle of an extremely destructive war with germany .
there are millions of soldiers on the battlefields , spies , double agents , and 50 million deaths world wide , " kurlander explained .
meanwhile , " tens and hundreds of thousands of people in every country had their lives displaced and disrupted ; they had to flee to the countryside and live in conditions little better than at camps . "
" anyone wrongly put in jail has reason to complain , " kurlander acknowledged .
" but given the scale of crimes committed in that war - by the russian and german governments , and what we ourselves were doing in the pacific to the pows and women and children there … detaining 10 or 11,000 people over a period of three years - we are not talking about anything too significant .

numbers are " not too significant " american historian eric kurlander , currently a research fellow at the university of cologne in germany , also advocates studying the past as a way to avoid repeating mistakes .
but , he argued , " there are certainly more significant examples of authoritarian handling of suspects . "
while careful to say that " every individual who suffered detainment deserves to have their stories told , " kurlander said he could think of other things that warrant more urgent attention from congress .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fort lincoln camp , circa 1943 the problem is , that compared to the huge german-american population in the us at the time , the number of german-americans who were detained is miniscule , kurlander argued .
" you 're in the middle of an extremely destructive war with germany .
there are millions of soldiers on the battlefields , spies , double agents , and 50 million deaths world wide , " kurlander explained .
meanwhile , " tens and hundreds of thousands of people in every country had their lives displaced and disrupted ; they had to flee to the countryside and live in conditions little better than at camps . "
" anyone wrongly put in jail has reason to complain , " kurlander acknowledged .
" but given the scale of crimes committed in that war - by the russian and german governments , and what we ourselves were doing in the pacific to the pows and women and children there … detaining 10 or 11,000 people over a period of three years - we are not talking about anything too significant .

why does this prestigious event take place in a small town ? four centuries ago , margrave christian established his residence in bayreuth .
later , the prussian margrave wilhelmine , sister of frederick the great and a dedicated patron of the arts , transformed the princely residence into an arts center and a baroque jewel .
the city 's distinctive landmarks include the " new palace " with its courtly gardens , the " eremitage castle park " and the margrave 's opera house , considered europe 's most beautiful baroque theater .
it all began with a dream but the picturesque bavarian city remains best known for its association with the operatic composer richard wagner who lived in bayreuth from 1872 until his death in 1883 .

the established theaters in the big cities were completely inadequate for staging plans of that scale .
so wagner considered staging his own festival .
the margrave 's opera house in bayreuth , which then had the biggest stage in the german speaking lands , came to his attention .
in early 1871 , joined by his wife cosima , wagner traveled to bayreuth .
but he soon realized that a baroque theater with balconies would be unsuitable for his festival idea .
" however , the unique charm and the location of the friendly city itself were what i had been wishing for , " he wrote .

the rich and famous the bayreuth festspielhaus is both a world cultural monument and an ultramodern theater reserved exclusively for the works of richard wagner .
in the evenings , the stage is set alight by dramatic scenes from the germanic legends .

the major powers mediating for middle east peace affirmed friday their " full support " for embattled palestinian leader mahmoud abbas , eu foreign policy chief javier solana 's spokeswoman said .
egypt recalled its diplomatic and security delegations to the gaza strip .
" the presidency of the european union condemns in the strongest terms the violent seizure of power by hamas militia in the gaza strip , " martin jäger , german foreign ministry spokesman , said on behalf of the eu leadership .
" we condemn the killing of innocent civilians and legitimate security forces , " the spokesman said .
hamas in control hamas fighters were in full control of the gaza strip on friday , creating an islamic enclave on israel 's doorstep and further clouding prospects for peace after routing their secular fatah rivals in days of vicious gun battles .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a hamas militant on an armored personnel carrier inside abbas ' headquarters the radical islamist group - branded a terrorist organization by israel and the west - overran the territory hours after abbas sacked the government and declared a state of emergency in a bid to avert all-out civil war .
jäger joined the united states in backing abbas , insisting that his decision to dismiss the three-month-old hamas-fatah unity government was " in accordance with the palestinian constitution . "
germany holds the eu presidency until the end of the month .
british foreign secretary margaret beckett stressed it would be wrong for hamas to benefit from its seizure of power in gaza .
" the notion that somehow mounting a coup d 'etat is something that should be rewarded by the international community seems to me to be completely bizarre , " she said .
" this is the fault of people in hamas who want control , not partnership , " she added , stressing that the events of recent days were " not the way forward . "
" extreme concern " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commissioner for external relations benita ferrero waldner eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner also expressed " extreme concern " over the gaza conflict and said in a statement she would hold talks with top quartet officials on friday .
the united states has already given full backing to abbas .
us secretary of state condoleezza rice said : " president abbas has exercised his lawful authority as president of the palestinian authority and leader of the palestinian people , " rice told reporters on wednesday .
" and we fully support him in his decisions to try to end this crisis for the palestinian people and to give them an opportunity to return to peace and a better future , " she said .
russia 's foreign minister sergei lavrov did not take sides in the conflict but said friday no un troops could be sent to gaza unless hamas and fatah agreed to such a deployment .
the palestinians should halt their " fratricidal " conflict , the russian foreign ministry said in a separate statement .
cairo meeting arab foreign ministers brought forward a cairo meeting scheduled originally for saturday to discuss the crisis .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamas militants in front of the security headquarters after they captured it from fatah arab league ambassadors appealed to both hamas and abbas ' secular fatah faction to return to egyptian-sponsored reconciliation talks .
egypt had been trying to broker a face-to-face meeting between the two sides after separate talks , but the breakdown of that effort was swiftly followed by the latest fighting in which at least 113 people have been killed .

the major powers mediating for middle east peace affirmed friday their " full support " for embattled palestinian leader mahmoud abbas , eu foreign policy chief javier solana 's spokeswoman said .
egypt recalled its diplomatic and security delegations to the gaza strip .
" the presidency of the european union condemns in the strongest terms the violent seizure of power by hamas militia in the gaza strip , " martin jäger , german foreign ministry spokesman , said on behalf of the eu leadership .
" we condemn the killing of innocent civilians and legitimate security forces , " the spokesman said .
hamas in control hamas fighters were in full control of the gaza strip on friday , creating an islamic enclave on israel 's doorstep and further clouding prospects for peace after routing their secular fatah rivals in days of vicious gun battles .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a hamas militant on an armored personnel carrier inside abbas ' headquarters the radical islamist group - branded a terrorist organization by israel and the west - overran the territory hours after abbas sacked the government and declared a state of emergency in a bid to avert all-out civil war .
jäger joined the united states in backing abbas , insisting that his decision to dismiss the three-month-old hamas-fatah unity government was " in accordance with the palestinian constitution . "
germany holds the eu presidency until the end of the month .
british foreign secretary margaret beckett stressed it would be wrong for hamas to benefit from its seizure of power in gaza .
" the notion that somehow mounting a coup d 'etat is something that should be rewarded by the international community seems to me to be completely bizarre , " she said .
" this is the fault of people in hamas who want control , not partnership , " she added , stressing that the events of recent days were " not the way forward . "
" extreme concern " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commissioner for external relations benita ferrero waldner eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner also expressed " extreme concern " over the gaza conflict and said in a statement she would hold talks with top quartet officials on friday .
the united states has already given full backing to abbas .
us secretary of state condoleezza rice said : " president abbas has exercised his lawful authority as president of the palestinian authority and leader of the palestinian people , " rice told reporters on wednesday .
" and we fully support him in his decisions to try to end this crisis for the palestinian people and to give them an opportunity to return to peace and a better future , " she said .
russia 's foreign minister sergei lavrov did not take sides in the conflict but said friday no un troops could be sent to gaza unless hamas and fatah agreed to such a deployment .
the palestinians should halt their " fratricidal " conflict , the russian foreign ministry said in a separate statement .
cairo meeting arab foreign ministers brought forward a cairo meeting scheduled originally for saturday to discuss the crisis .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamas militants in front of the security headquarters after they captured it from fatah arab league ambassadors appealed to both hamas and abbas ' secular fatah faction to return to egyptian-sponsored reconciliation talks .
egypt had been trying to broker a face-to-face meeting between the two sides after separate talks , but the breakdown of that effort was swiftly followed by the latest fighting in which at least 113 people have been killed .

why does this prestigious event take place in a small town ? four centuries ago , margrave christian established his residence in bayreuth .
later , the prussian margrave wilhelmine , sister of frederick the great and a dedicated patron of the arts , transformed the princely residence into an arts center and a baroque jewel .
the city 's distinctive landmarks include the " new palace " with its courtly gardens , the " eremitage castle park " and the margrave 's opera house , considered europe 's most beautiful baroque theater .
it all began with a dream but the picturesque bavarian city remains best known for its association with the operatic composer richard wagner who lived in bayreuth from 1872 until his death in 1883 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : richard wagner remains bayreuth 's most famous son wagner , composer , playwright and theater director all rolled into one , dreamed of a gesamtkunstwerk , -lrb- a total work of art -rrb- , that is , a perfect blend of poetry , song and drama .
the established theaters in the big cities were completely inadequate for staging plans of that scale .
so wagner considered staging his own festival .
the margrave 's opera house in bayreuth , which then had the biggest stage in the german speaking lands , came to his attention .
in early 1871 , joined by his wife cosima , wagner traveled to bayreuth .
but he soon realized that a baroque theater with balconies would be unsuitable for his festival idea .
" however , the unique charm and the location of the friendly city itself were what i had been wishing for , " he wrote .
" an utterly beautiful and generous plot of land not far from the town was given to me as a gift and for the purpose of building the theater i had in mind . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bayreuth festspielhaus or opera house the cornerstone to wagner 's festspielhaus was laid in 1872 .
in it , wagner enclosed a piece of paper with the inscription : " herein i enclose a secret , may it rest for a hundred years .
as long as it is protected by stone , it will reveal itself to the world . "
the rich and famous the bayreuth festspielhaus is both a world cultural monument and an ultramodern theater reserved exclusively for the works of richard wagner .
in the evenings , the stage is set alight by dramatic scenes from the germanic legends .
but from early morning , the grounds outdoors are populated by ticket seekers .
the official route to festival admission can involve a wait of seven years or longer .
the number of people seeking tickets exceeds that of tickets available by a factor of 10 to one .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel and her husband have become regulars at the festival on opening day , bayreuth is a firework of myth , fashion and media , where presidents and corporate bosses rub shoulders with show business celebrities .
less sensational are the many music critics on hand , who convey every nuance of the performances inside to the world outside , upholding bayreuth 's status as a musical nerve center of the nation and of the theater world .
since 1876 , the bayreuth festival has accompanied every high and low point of german history .
its current director is a grandson of the composer : 87-year-old wolfgang wagner , who has run the festival since 1951 .
the wagner family , however , has been dogged by a feud over who should run the festival in future .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : katharina wagner could take over the reins of the festival there is speculation that wolfgang wagner 's youngest daughter , katharina could be a possible successor .
the 29-year old has earned some critical acclaim as an opera director on other stages .
the coming season starts on july 25 with katharina wagner 's first production in bayreuth .

now he lectures on his experience after six years of trying , a us senator has made progress toward establishing a committee to examine the possible mistreatment of some german-americans during world war ii . some disappeared under cover of night ; others were taken during raids on their place of employment .
about a third were kidnapped by us agents in other countries and brought to the us by force .
none had a lawyer , and none were charged with or convicted of a crime .
many were imprisoned for the duration of the war , and even after .
terror suspects bound for guantanamo bay ?
not quite .
the scenario applied to thousands of german-americans during world war ii , whose experience of wartime internment has so far had little publicity , and even less sympathy , in the us .
the story of how the us treated japanese-americans during world war ii is well known .
some 120,000 men , women and children living on the west coast , the majority of them us citizens , were stripped of their property and sent to remote " war relocation camps " in the interior of the country .
bildunterschrift : activities were part of camp life ; here , the sports club but the plight of the 11,000 german resident aliens who were also sent to wartime internment in the us has gotten little attention so far .
earlier this month , us senator russ feingold of wisconsin , whose constituency is heavily german-american , took a step toward changing that .
for the past six years , feingold has been trying to pass a bill to create a commission that would examine the us treatment of interned german-americans - as well as italians and other europeans - during world war ii .
a second commission would look at the treatment of jewish refugees fleeing persecution .
" these people are dying " a stand-alone bill on the " wartime treatment study act " has been blocked repeatedly over the last six years by an anonymous republican senator .
now the legislation - which was passed in the form of an amendment to the controversial immigration bill - is uncertain .
" it is so urgent that we pass this legislation , " the liberal democrat feingold said when he introduced the amendment .
" we can not wait any longer … the people who were affected by these policies are dying . "
congress " did the right thing by recognizing and apologizing for the mistreatment of japanese-americans during world war ii , " feingold said .
" but our work in this area is not done . "
no reparations - just accounting bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of japanese were sent from the coast to the middle of the country unlike surviving japanese americans , who were awarded $ 1.2 billion in reparations in 1988 as part of the modern " redress movement , " feingold 's amendment does not seek reparations for the interned germans or their families .
rather , it would " simply review the facts and circumstances the us government 's treatment of german-americans , italian-americans and other european-americans during world war ii . "
survivors from the era and historians alike have made clear that the situation in the camps was far from dire , and that the detainees were , on the whole , treated humanely .
and many observers have seized the debate as a chance to slam the idea of creating a congressional commission to examine 60-year-old events .
but stephen fox , a historian and the author of " fear itself : inside the fbi roundup of german americans during world war ii : the past as prologue , " argues that it is , indeed , important for the government to own up to past actions - especially in light of the current government 's " war on terror " and the newly casual attitudes toward civil liberties .
parallels with guantanamo ?
in an introduction to his book , which contains oral histories and justice department documentation on 50 internees , fox argues : " the most damning aspects of the american internment experience were decisions to hold persons for indeterminate periods on the basis of their political views , their attitudes toward authority , and their personalities - even after it had been determined they were not dangerous . "
bildunterschrift : in us camps , detainees slept in bunkhouses today , americans are " attuned and sensitive to the issue that guantanamo , abu ghraib , and racial profiling here in the us post 9/11 , where people are rounded up and held indeterminately , are invasions of the bill of rights and the constitution , " fox said .
the fact that japanese-american internees were officially acknowledged in the 1980s angered a lot of the surviving germans , fox claimed .
" because they were in the same camps , they thought they should be treated equally , " he said .
but he noted there are two " core problems " in stirring up public sympathy for german-americans from that era .
the first is hitler and the holocaust , which he called " a hurdle german-americans will have a hard time overcoming . "
the other problem is 9/11 , fox said .
" that made it hard for people to have sympathy for people who attack us … and german-americans were perceived during world war ii as enemies of the country . "
numbers are " not too significant " american historian eric kurlander , currently a research fellow at the university of cologne in germany , also advocates studying the past as a way to avoid repeating mistakes .
but , he argued , " there are certainly more significant examples of authoritarian handling of suspects . "
while careful to say that " every individual who suffered detainment deserves to have their stories told , " kurlander said he could think of other things that warrant more urgent attention from congress .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fort lincoln camp , circa 1943 the problem is , that compared to the huge german-american population in the us at the time , the number of german-americans who were detained is miniscule , kurlander argued .
" you 're in the middle of an extremely destructive war with germany .
there are millions of soldiers on the battlefields , spies , double agents , and 50 million deaths world wide , " kurlander explained .
meanwhile , " tens and hundreds of thousands of people in every country had their lives displaced and disrupted ; they had to flee to the countryside and live in conditions little better than at camps . "
" anyone wrongly put in jail has reason to complain , " kurlander acknowledged .
" but given the scale of crimes committed in that war - by the russian and german governments , and what we ourselves were doing in the pacific to the pows and women and children there … detaining 10 or 11,000 people over a period of three years - we are not talking about anything too significant .

in the case of charitable donations , the group took in a whopping 770 million euros - a rise of 11 percent on last year .
aid contracts from around the world wolfgang schmitt , director of the organization , said the extraordinarily good figures mirrored the high esteem that the gtz is held in for its work not just in germany but around the world .
" there 's been a trend in the past years that others donors , industrialized countries and other developing nations have been increasingly supplying their own funds to engage the gtz , " he said .
" the trend has been continuing and so we can now almost speak of records . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul the gtz 's main employer last year remained the german ministry for economic cooperation and development which handed the aid group more than 700 million euros to realize development projects in africa and other regions .
but even co-financed projects , where third parties supply additional funds for projects that the gtz carries out for the german development ministry , got a huge boost last year by rising 29 percent to 61 million euros .
the un refugee agency , unhcr , was the biggest player here by bankrolling the gtz with 21 million euros .
the gtz also raked in a host of contracts from around the world - the ethiopian government built a network of health care centers with the help of development experts from the gtz and even institutions such as the world bank and the eu commission hired the services of the german aid group .
recipe to success schmitt emphasized that the gtz had become something of a world leader in the field of developmental aid .
the recipe to its success is the gtz 's focus on long-term goals and sustainability as opposed to other aid organizations , schmitt said .
" there 's a tendency in the development industry to score quick successes , " schmitt said .
" but if you look at the problems and responsibilities in the field , then you realize that these are things for which even europe needed centuries to overcome .
that 's why you need to have patience and stamina when it comes to development and cooperation . "
rosy future bernd eisenblätter , another gtz director , said the organization tended to attract skilled and highly qualified applicants around the world . last year , the number of gtz experts sent abroad rose by 4.8 percent to 1,100 persons .
most of them -lrb- 39 percent -rrb- work in africa .
" we get many more applicants than we can hire , even on a limited basis , " eisenblätter said .
" they 're highly-motivated , highly-qualified and 60 to 70 percent of them are women .
that 's why i 'm not worried at all about the future of the gtz .
it shows there 's huge potential and a huge interest in the field of development work and in the gtz . " dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw 's peter philipp does n't think that this is a good idea . it 's intriguing that a call for stationing international troops in gaza should come from israel , the country which in the course of its history always vehemently opposed such operations .
israel , however , did n't change its attitude about the gaza strip because it wants to support a peace-promoting initiative .
the whole purpose of the exercise is to primarily pull the rug from under hamas ' feet by cutting their weapon supplies .
fatah , on the other hand , would keep getting armed , even from israel itself .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it is , therefore , no wonder that hamas rejected the idea of international forces and threatened to treat them as an occupying power .
it would be a mistake for anybody - whether in brussels or washington - to think seriously about acting on israel 's offer .
unlike south lebanon , where a un force -lrb- unifil -rrb- has been trying for years to support the re-assertion of lebanese state sovereignty , the gaza strip is no sovereign state .
it is , instead , an area marked by a struggle for power .
it would be unimaginable for either europeans or americans to have even the remotest interest in trying to maintain order there .
and even as a border patrol , the deployment would be useless .
if the smuggling of weapons to the gaza strip were really to be cut off , then egypt would be in the best position to do it : it controls the southern side of the gaza border and should be able to prevent the smuggling of weapons from its territory .
in general , not only egypt but also other arab countries should get involved : the arab league welcomed the formation of the palestinian unity government ; it has always treated the palestine conflict as its central subject and it should have a strong interest in preventing the escalation of violence in gaza - especially after it presented its own peace plan in beirut and riad .
the arab league can not allow all this to fall through because of the power struggle between hamas and fatah , let alone because no arab leader has an interest in a hamas-controlled unit in gaza .
the arab league should perhaps establish its own deployment force and send it to gaza : its contingent would be in the eyes of hamas and fatah much less suspicious than the europeans or the americans , and the league could prove for the first time in its history that it 's capable of more than making proclamations and passing resolutions .

the major powers mediating for middle east peace affirmed friday their " full support " for embattled palestinian leader mahmoud abbas , eu foreign policy chief javier solana 's spokeswoman said .
egypt recalled its diplomatic and security delegations to the gaza strip .
" the presidency of the european union condemns in the strongest terms the violent seizure of power by hamas militia in the gaza strip , " martin jäger , german foreign ministry spokesman , said on behalf of the eu leadership .
" we condemn the killing of innocent civilians and legitimate security forces , " the spokesman said .
hamas in control hamas fighters were in full control of the gaza strip on friday , creating an islamic enclave on israel 's doorstep and further clouding prospects for peace after routing their secular fatah rivals in days of vicious gun battles .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a hamas militant on an armored personnel carrier inside abbas ' headquarters the radical islamist group - branded a terrorist organization by israel and the west - overran the territory hours after abbas sacked the government and declared a state of emergency in a bid to avert all-out civil war .
jäger joined the united states in backing abbas , insisting that his decision to dismiss the three-month-old hamas-fatah unity government was " in accordance with the palestinian constitution . "
germany holds the eu presidency until the end of the month .
british foreign secretary margaret beckett stressed it would be wrong for hamas to benefit from its seizure of power in gaza .
" the notion that somehow mounting a coup d 'etat is something that should be rewarded by the international community seems to me to be completely bizarre , " she said .
" this is the fault of people in hamas who want control , not partnership , " she added , stressing that the events of recent days were " not the way forward . "
" extreme concern " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commissioner for external relations benita ferrero waldner eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner also expressed " extreme concern " over the gaza conflict and said in a statement she would hold talks with top quartet officials on friday .
the united states has already given full backing to abbas .
us secretary of state condoleezza rice said : " president abbas has exercised his lawful authority as president of the palestinian authority and leader of the palestinian people , " rice told reporters on wednesday .
" and we fully support him in his decisions to try to end this crisis for the palestinian people and to give them an opportunity to return to peace and a better future , " she said .
russia 's foreign minister sergei lavrov did not take sides in the conflict but said friday no un troops could be sent to gaza unless hamas and fatah agreed to such a deployment .
the palestinians should halt their " fratricidal " conflict , the russian foreign ministry said in a separate statement .
cairo meeting arab foreign ministers brought forward a cairo meeting scheduled originally for saturday to discuss the crisis .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamas militants in front of the security headquarters after they captured it from fatah arab league ambassadors appealed to both hamas and abbas ' secular fatah faction to return to egyptian-sponsored reconciliation talks .
egypt had been trying to broker a face-to-face meeting between the two sides after separate talks , but the breakdown of that effort was swiftly followed by the latest fighting in which at least 113 people have been killed .

turnover rose to a total of 917.8 million euros -lrb- $ 1,221.42 million -rrb- , marking an increase of 4.8 percent over the previous year .
in the case of charitable donations , the group took in a whopping 770 million euros - a rise of 11 percent on last year .
aid contracts from around the world wolfgang schmitt , director of the organization , said the extraordinarily good figures mirrored the high esteem that the gtz is held in for its work not just in germany but around the world .
" there 's been a trend in the past years that others donors , industrialized countries and other developing nations have been increasingly supplying their own funds to engage the gtz , " he said .
" the trend has been continuing and so we can now almost speak of records . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul the gtz 's main employer last year remained the german ministry for economic cooperation and development which handed the aid group more than 700 million euros to realize development projects in africa and other regions .
but even co-financed projects , where third parties supply additional funds for projects that the gtz carries out for the german development ministry , got a huge boost last year by rising 29 percent to 61 million euros .
the un refugee agency , unhcr , was the biggest player here by bankrolling the gtz with 21 million euros .
the gtz also raked in a host of contracts from around the world - the ethiopian government built a network of health care centers with the help of development experts from the gtz and even institutions such as the world bank and the eu commission hired the services of the german aid group .
recipe to success schmitt emphasized that the gtz had become something of a world leader in the field of developmental aid .
the recipe to its success is the gtz 's focus on long-term goals and sustainability as opposed to other aid organizations , schmitt said .
" there 's a tendency in the development industry to score quick successes , " schmitt said .
" but if you look at the problems and responsibilities in the field , then you realize that these are things for which even europe needed centuries to overcome .
that 's why you need to have patience and stamina when it comes to development and cooperation . "
rosy future bernd eisenblätter , another gtz director , said the organization tended to attract skilled and highly qualified applicants around the world . last year , the number of gtz experts sent abroad rose by 4.8 percent to 1,100 persons .
most of them -lrb- 39 percent -rrb- work in africa .
" we get many more applicants than we can hire , even on a limited basis , " eisenblätter said .
" they 're highly-motivated , highly-qualified and 60 to 70 percent of them are women .
that 's why i 'm not worried at all about the future of the gtz .
it shows there 's huge potential and a huge interest in the field of development work and in the gtz . " dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de middle east -pipe- 15.06.2007 opinion : international deployment in gaza would be useless großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli prime minister ehud olmert said that " serious consideration " should be given to deploying international forces along the gaza-egypt border .
dw 's peter philipp does n't think that this is a good idea . it 's intriguing that a call for stationing international troops in gaza should come from israel , the country which in the course of its history always vehemently opposed such operations .
israel , however , did n't change its attitude about the gaza strip because it wants to support a peace-promoting initiative .
the whole purpose of the exercise is to primarily pull the rug from under hamas ' feet by cutting their weapon supplies .
fatah , on the other hand , would keep getting armed , even from israel itself .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it is , therefore , no wonder that hamas rejected the idea of international forces and threatened to treat them as an occupying power .
it would be a mistake for anybody - whether in brussels or washington - to think seriously about acting on israel 's offer .
unlike south lebanon , where a un force -lrb- unifil -rrb- has been trying for years to support the re-assertion of lebanese state sovereignty , the gaza strip is no sovereign state .
it is , instead , an area marked by a struggle for power .
it would be unimaginable for either europeans or americans to have even the remotest interest in trying to maintain order there .
and even as a border patrol , the deployment would be useless .
if the smuggling of weapons to the gaza strip were really to be cut off , then egypt would be in the best position to do it : it controls the southern side of the gaza border and should be able to prevent the smuggling of weapons from its territory .
in general , not only egypt but also other arab countries should get involved : the arab league welcomed the formation of the palestinian unity government ; it has always treated the palestine conflict as its central subject and it should have a strong interest in preventing the escalation of violence in gaza - especially after it presented its own peace plan in beirut and riad .
the arab league can not allow all this to fall through because of the power struggle between hamas and fatah , let alone because no arab leader has an interest in a hamas-controlled unit in gaza .
the arab league should perhaps establish its own deployment force and send it to gaza : its contingent would be in the eyes of hamas and fatah much less suspicious than the europeans or the americans , and the league could prove for the first time in its history that it 's capable of more than making proclamations and passing resolutions .
and if that did happen , one could count on israel rejecting international troops again .
that 's not how olmert 's government imagined the whole affair .

" it 's an act of violence and i feel i 've been completely disregarded , " she fumed to the dpa news agency . the chilean artist 's work , putting white tape crosses on streets , dates back to an illegal art action from 1979 in chile 's capital santiago .
there she created hundreds of crosses - representing death - to protest the brutality of the dictator augusto pinochet . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lotty rosenfeld , in happier days since then she has repeated the work in many countries and cities , including india , berlin and in front of the white house in washington , dc .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de middle east -pipe- 15.06.2007 opinion : international deployment in gaza would be useless großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli prime minister ehud olmert said that " serious consideration " should be given to deploying international forces along the gaza-egypt border .
dw 's peter philipp does n't think that this is a good idea . it 's intriguing that a call for stationing international troops in gaza should come from israel , the country which in the course of its history always vehemently opposed such operations .
israel , however , did n't change its attitude about the gaza strip because it wants to support a peace-promoting initiative .
the whole purpose of the exercise is to primarily pull the rug from under hamas ' feet by cutting their weapon supplies .
fatah , on the other hand , would keep getting armed , even from israel itself .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it is , therefore , no wonder that hamas rejected the idea of international forces and threatened to treat them as an occupying power .
it would be a mistake for anybody - whether in brussels or washington - to think seriously about acting on israel 's offer .
unlike south lebanon , where a un force -lrb- unifil -rrb- has been trying for years to support the re-assertion of lebanese state sovereignty , the gaza strip is no sovereign state .
it is , instead , an area marked by a struggle for power .
it would be unimaginable for either europeans or americans to have even the remotest interest in trying to maintain order there .
and even as a border patrol , the deployment would be useless .
if the smuggling of weapons to the gaza strip were really to be cut off , then egypt would be in the best position to do it : it controls the southern side of the gaza border and should be able to prevent the smuggling of weapons from its territory .
in general , not only egypt but also other arab countries should get involved : the arab league welcomed the formation of the palestinian unity government ; it has always treated the palestine conflict as its central subject and it should have a strong interest in preventing the escalation of violence in gaza - especially after it presented its own peace plan in beirut and riad .
the arab league can not allow all this to fall through because of the power struggle between hamas and fatah , let alone because no arab leader has an interest in a hamas-controlled unit in gaza .
the arab league should perhaps establish its own deployment force and send it to gaza : its contingent would be in the eyes of hamas and fatah much less suspicious than the europeans or the americans , and the league could prove for the first time in its history that it 's capable of more than making proclamations and passing resolutions .
and if that did happen , one could count on israel rejecting international troops again .
that 's not how olmert 's government imagined the whole affair .

the organization , whose primary goal is to improve living conditions of people in developing regions , reached a milestone of a different kind on wednesday as it released financial figures for 2006 .
for the first time , the gtz 's business volume surpassed the one billion euro mark .
turnover rose to a total of 917.8 million euros -lrb- $ 1,221.42 million -rrb- , marking an increase of 4.8 percent over the previous year .
in the case of charitable donations , the group took in a whopping 770 million euros - a rise of 11 percent on last year .
aid contracts from around the world wolfgang schmitt , director of the organization , said the extraordinarily good figures mirrored the high esteem that the gtz is held in for its work not just in germany but around the world .
" there 's been a trend in the past years that others donors , industrialized countries and other developing nations have been increasingly supplying their own funds to engage the gtz , " he said .
" the trend has been continuing and so we can now almost speak of records . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul the gtz 's main employer last year remained the german ministry for economic cooperation and development which handed the aid group more than 700 million euros to realize development projects in africa and other regions .
but even co-financed projects , where third parties supply additional funds for projects that the gtz carries out for the german development ministry , got a huge boost last year by rising 29 percent to 61 million euros .
the un refugee agency , unhcr , was the biggest player here by bankrolling the gtz with 21 million euros .
the gtz also raked in a host of contracts from around the world - the ethiopian government built a network of health care centers with the help of development experts from the gtz and even institutions such as the world bank and the eu commission hired the services of the german aid group .
recipe to success schmitt emphasized that the gtz had become something of a world leader in the field of developmental aid .
the recipe to its success is the gtz 's focus on long-term goals and sustainability as opposed to other aid organizations , schmitt said .
" there 's a tendency in the development industry to score quick successes , " schmitt said .
" but if you look at the problems and responsibilities in the field , then you realize that these are things for which even europe needed centuries to overcome .
that 's why you need to have patience and stamina when it comes to development and cooperation . "
rosy future bernd eisenblätter , another gtz director , said the organization tended to attract skilled and highly qualified applicants around the world . last year , the number of gtz experts sent abroad rose by 4.8 percent to 1,100 persons .
most of them -lrb- 39 percent -rrb- work in africa .
" we get many more applicants than we can hire , even on a limited basis , " eisenblätter said .
" they 're highly-motivated , highly-qualified and 60 to 70 percent of them are women .

the organization , whose primary goal is to improve living conditions of people in developing regions , reached a milestone of a different kind on wednesday as it released financial figures for 2006 .
for the first time , the gtz 's business volume surpassed the one billion euro mark .
turnover rose to a total of 917.8 million euros -lrb- $ 1,221.42 million -rrb- , marking an increase of 4.8 percent over the previous year .
in the case of charitable donations , the group took in a whopping 770 million euros - a rise of 11 percent on last year .
aid contracts from around the world wolfgang schmitt , director of the organization , said the extraordinarily good figures mirrored the high esteem that the gtz is held in for its work not just in germany but around the world .
" there 's been a trend in the past years that others donors , industrialized countries and other developing nations have been increasingly supplying their own funds to engage the gtz , " he said .
" the trend has been continuing and so we can now almost speak of records . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul the gtz 's main employer last year remained the german ministry for economic cooperation and development which handed the aid group more than 700 million euros to realize development projects in africa and other regions .
but even co-financed projects , where third parties supply additional funds for projects that the gtz carries out for the german development ministry , got a huge boost last year by rising 29 percent to 61 million euros .
the un refugee agency , unhcr , was the biggest player here by bankrolling the gtz with 21 million euros .
the gtz also raked in a host of contracts from around the world - the ethiopian government built a network of health care centers with the help of development experts from the gtz and even institutions such as the world bank and the eu commission hired the services of the german aid group .
recipe to success schmitt emphasized that the gtz had become something of a world leader in the field of developmental aid .
the recipe to its success is the gtz 's focus on long-term goals and sustainability as opposed to other aid organizations , schmitt said .
" there 's a tendency in the development industry to score quick successes , " schmitt said .
" but if you look at the problems and responsibilities in the field , then you realize that these are things for which even europe needed centuries to overcome .
that 's why you need to have patience and stamina when it comes to development and cooperation . "
rosy future bernd eisenblätter , another gtz director , said the organization tended to attract skilled and highly qualified applicants around the world . last year , the number of gtz experts sent abroad rose by 4.8 percent to 1,100 persons .
most of them -lrb- 39 percent -rrb- work in africa .
" we get many more applicants than we can hire , even on a limited basis , " eisenblätter said .
" they 're highly-motivated , highly-qualified and 60 to 70 percent of them are women .
that 's why i 'm not worried at all about the future of the gtz .
it shows there 's huge potential and a huge interest in the field of development work and in the gtz . " dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw 's peter philipp does n't think that this is a good idea . it 's intriguing that a call for stationing international troops in gaza should come from israel , the country which in the course of its history always vehemently opposed such operations .
israel , however , did n't change its attitude about the gaza strip because it wants to support a peace-promoting initiative .
the whole purpose of the exercise is to primarily pull the rug from under hamas ' feet by cutting their weapon supplies .
fatah , on the other hand , would keep getting armed , even from israel itself .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it is , therefore , no wonder that hamas rejected the idea of international forces and threatened to treat them as an occupying power .
it would be a mistake for anybody - whether in brussels or washington - to think seriously about acting on israel 's offer .
unlike south lebanon , where a un force -lrb- unifil -rrb- has been trying for years to support the re-assertion of lebanese state sovereignty , the gaza strip is no sovereign state .
it is , instead , an area marked by a struggle for power .
it would be unimaginable for either europeans or americans to have even the remotest interest in trying to maintain order there .
and even as a border patrol , the deployment would be useless .
if the smuggling of weapons to the gaza strip were really to be cut off , then egypt would be in the best position to do it : it controls the southern side of the gaza border and should be able to prevent the smuggling of weapons from its territory .
in general , not only egypt but also other arab countries should get involved : the arab league welcomed the formation of the palestinian unity government ; it has always treated the palestine conflict as its central subject and it should have a strong interest in preventing the escalation of violence in gaza - especially after it presented its own peace plan in beirut and riad .
the arab league can not allow all this to fall through because of the power struggle between hamas and fatah , let alone because no arab leader has an interest in a hamas-controlled unit in gaza .
the arab league should perhaps establish its own deployment force and send it to gaza : its contingent would be in the eyes of hamas and fatah much less suspicious than the europeans or the americans , and the league could prove for the first time in its history that it 's capable of more than making proclamations and passing resolutions .
and if that did happen , one could count on israel rejecting international troops again .
that 's not how olmert 's government imagined the whole affair .

the major powers mediating for middle east peace affirmed friday their " full support " for embattled palestinian leader mahmoud abbas , eu foreign policy chief javier solana 's spokeswoman said .
egypt recalled its diplomatic and security delegations to the gaza strip .
" the presidency of the european union condemns in the strongest terms the violent seizure of power by hamas militia in the gaza strip , " martin jäger , german foreign ministry spokesman , said on behalf of the eu leadership .
" we condemn the killing of innocent civilians and legitimate security forces , " the spokesman said .
hamas in control hamas fighters were in full control of the gaza strip on friday , creating an islamic enclave on israel 's doorstep and further clouding prospects for peace after routing their secular fatah rivals in days of vicious gun battles .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a hamas militant on an armored personnel carrier inside abbas ' headquarters the radical islamist group - branded a terrorist organization by israel and the west - overran the territory hours after abbas sacked the government and declared a state of emergency in a bid to avert all-out civil war .
jäger joined the united states in backing abbas , insisting that his decision to dismiss the three-month-old hamas-fatah unity government was " in accordance with the palestinian constitution . "
germany holds the eu presidency until the end of the month .
british foreign secretary margaret beckett stressed it would be wrong for hamas to benefit from its seizure of power in gaza .
" the notion that somehow mounting a coup d 'etat is something that should be rewarded by the international community seems to me to be completely bizarre , " she said .
" this is the fault of people in hamas who want control , not partnership , " she added , stressing that the events of recent days were " not the way forward . "
" extreme concern " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commissioner for external relations benita ferrero waldner eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner also expressed " extreme concern " over the gaza conflict and said in a statement she would hold talks with top quartet officials on friday .
the united states has already given full backing to abbas .
us secretary of state condoleezza rice said : " president abbas has exercised his lawful authority as president of the palestinian authority and leader of the palestinian people , " rice told reporters on wednesday .
" and we fully support him in his decisions to try to end this crisis for the palestinian people and to give them an opportunity to return to peace and a better future , " she said .
russia 's foreign minister sergei lavrov did not take sides in the conflict but said friday no un troops could be sent to gaza unless hamas and fatah agreed to such a deployment .
the palestinians should halt their " fratricidal " conflict , the russian foreign ministry said in a separate statement .

why does this prestigious event take place in a small town ? four centuries ago , margrave christian established his residence in bayreuth .
later , the prussian margrave wilhelmine , sister of frederick the great and a dedicated patron of the arts , transformed the princely residence into an arts center and a baroque jewel .
the city 's distinctive landmarks include the " new palace " with its courtly gardens , the " eremitage castle park " and the margrave 's opera house , considered europe 's most beautiful baroque theater .
it all began with a dream but the picturesque bavarian city remains best known for its association with the operatic composer richard wagner who lived in bayreuth from 1872 until his death in 1883 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : richard wagner remains bayreuth 's most famous son wagner , composer , playwright and theater director all rolled into one , dreamed of a gesamtkunstwerk , -lrb- a total work of art -rrb- , that is , a perfect blend of poetry , song and drama .
the established theaters in the big cities were completely inadequate for staging plans of that scale .
so wagner considered staging his own festival .
the margrave 's opera house in bayreuth , which then had the biggest stage in the german speaking lands , came to his attention .
in early 1871 , joined by his wife cosima , wagner traveled to bayreuth .
but he soon realized that a baroque theater with balconies would be unsuitable for his festival idea .
" however , the unique charm and the location of the friendly city itself were what i had been wishing for , " he wrote .
" an utterly beautiful and generous plot of land not far from the town was given to me as a gift and for the purpose of building the theater i had in mind . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bayreuth festspielhaus or opera house the cornerstone to wagner 's festspielhaus was laid in 1872 .
in it , wagner enclosed a piece of paper with the inscription : " herein i enclose a secret , may it rest for a hundred years .
as long as it is protected by stone , it will reveal itself to the world . "
the rich and famous the bayreuth festspielhaus is both a world cultural monument and an ultramodern theater reserved exclusively for the works of richard wagner .
in the evenings , the stage is set alight by dramatic scenes from the germanic legends .
but from early morning , the grounds outdoors are populated by ticket seekers .
the official route to festival admission can involve a wait of seven years or longer .
the number of people seeking tickets exceeds that of tickets available by a factor of 10 to one .

why does this prestigious event take place in a small town ? four centuries ago , margrave christian established his residence in bayreuth .
later , the prussian margrave wilhelmine , sister of frederick the great and a dedicated patron of the arts , transformed the princely residence into an arts center and a baroque jewel .
the city 's distinctive landmarks include the " new palace " with its courtly gardens , the " eremitage castle park " and the margrave 's opera house , considered europe 's most beautiful baroque theater .
it all began with a dream but the picturesque bavarian city remains best known for its association with the operatic composer richard wagner who lived in bayreuth from 1872 until his death in 1883 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : richard wagner remains bayreuth 's most famous son wagner , composer , playwright and theater director all rolled into one , dreamed of a gesamtkunstwerk , -lrb- a total work of art -rrb- , that is , a perfect blend of poetry , song and drama .
the established theaters in the big cities were completely inadequate for staging plans of that scale .
so wagner considered staging his own festival .
the margrave 's opera house in bayreuth , which then had the biggest stage in the german speaking lands , came to his attention .
in early 1871 , joined by his wife cosima , wagner traveled to bayreuth .
but he soon realized that a baroque theater with balconies would be unsuitable for his festival idea .
" however , the unique charm and the location of the friendly city itself were what i had been wishing for , " he wrote .
" an utterly beautiful and generous plot of land not far from the town was given to me as a gift and for the purpose of building the theater i had in mind . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bayreuth festspielhaus or opera house the cornerstone to wagner 's festspielhaus was laid in 1872 .
in it , wagner enclosed a piece of paper with the inscription : " herein i enclose a secret , may it rest for a hundred years .
as long as it is protected by stone , it will reveal itself to the world . "
the rich and famous the bayreuth festspielhaus is both a world cultural monument and an ultramodern theater reserved exclusively for the works of richard wagner .
in the evenings , the stage is set alight by dramatic scenes from the germanic legends .
but from early morning , the grounds outdoors are populated by ticket seekers .
the official route to festival admission can involve a wait of seven years or longer .
the number of people seeking tickets exceeds that of tickets available by a factor of 10 to one .

terror suspects bound for guantanamo bay ?
not quite .
the scenario applied to thousands of german-americans during world war ii , whose experience of wartime internment has so far had little publicity , and even less sympathy , in the us .
the story of how the us treated japanese-americans during world war ii is well known .
some 120,000 men , women and children living on the west coast , the majority of them us citizens , were stripped of their property and sent to remote " war relocation camps " in the interior of the country .
bildunterschrift : activities were part of camp life ; here , the sports club but the plight of the 11,000 german resident aliens who were also sent to wartime internment in the us has gotten little attention so far .
earlier this month , us senator russ feingold of wisconsin , whose constituency is heavily german-american , took a step toward changing that .
for the past six years , feingold has been trying to pass a bill to create a commission that would examine the us treatment of interned german-americans - as well as italians and other europeans - during world war ii .
a second commission would look at the treatment of jewish refugees fleeing persecution .
" these people are dying " a stand-alone bill on the " wartime treatment study act " has been blocked repeatedly over the last six years by an anonymous republican senator .
now the legislation - which was passed in the form of an amendment to the controversial immigration bill - is uncertain .
" it is so urgent that we pass this legislation , " the liberal democrat feingold said when he introduced the amendment .
" we can not wait any longer … the people who were affected by these policies are dying . "
congress " did the right thing by recognizing and apologizing for the mistreatment of japanese-americans during world war ii , " feingold said .
" but our work in this area is not done . "
no reparations - just accounting bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of japanese were sent from the coast to the middle of the country unlike surviving japanese americans , who were awarded $ 1.2 billion in reparations in 1988 as part of the modern " redress movement , " feingold 's amendment does not seek reparations for the interned germans or their families .
rather , it would " simply review the facts and circumstances the us government 's treatment of german-americans , italian-americans and other european-americans during world war ii . "
survivors from the era and historians alike have made clear that the situation in the camps was far from dire , and that the detainees were , on the whole , treated humanely .
and many observers have seized the debate as a chance to slam the idea of creating a congressional commission to examine 60-year-old events .
but stephen fox , a historian and the author of " fear itself : inside the fbi roundup of german americans during world war ii : the past as prologue , " argues that it is , indeed , important for the government to own up to past actions - especially in light of the current government 's " war on terror " and the newly casual attitudes toward civil liberties .
parallels with guantanamo ?
in an introduction to his book , which contains oral histories and justice department documentation on 50 internees , fox argues : " the most damning aspects of the american internment experience were decisions to hold persons for indeterminate periods on the basis of their political views , their attitudes toward authority , and their personalities - even after it had been determined they were not dangerous . "
bildunterschrift : in us camps , detainees slept in bunkhouses today , americans are " attuned and sensitive to the issue that guantanamo , abu ghraib , and racial profiling here in the us post 9/11 , where people are rounded up and held indeterminately , are invasions of the bill of rights and the constitution , " fox said .
the fact that japanese-american internees were officially acknowledged in the 1980s angered a lot of the surviving germans , fox claimed .
" because they were in the same camps , they thought they should be treated equally , " he said .
but he noted there are two " core problems " in stirring up public sympathy for german-americans from that era .
the first is hitler and the holocaust , which he called " a hurdle german-americans will have a hard time overcoming . "
the other problem is 9/11 , fox said .
" that made it hard for people to have sympathy for people who attack us … and german-americans were perceived during world war ii as enemies of the country . "
numbers are " not too significant " american historian eric kurlander , currently a research fellow at the university of cologne in germany , also advocates studying the past as a way to avoid repeating mistakes .
but , he argued , " there are certainly more significant examples of authoritarian handling of suspects . "
while careful to say that " every individual who suffered detainment deserves to have their stories told , " kurlander said he could think of other things that warrant more urgent attention from congress .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fort lincoln camp , circa 1943 the problem is , that compared to the huge german-american population in the us at the time , the number of german-americans who were detained is miniscule , kurlander argued .
" you 're in the middle of an extremely destructive war with germany .
there are millions of soldiers on the battlefields , spies , double agents , and 50 million deaths world wide , " kurlander explained .
meanwhile , " tens and hundreds of thousands of people in every country had their lives displaced and disrupted ; they had to flee to the countryside and live in conditions little better than at camps . "
" anyone wrongly put in jail has reason to complain , " kurlander acknowledged .
" but given the scale of crimes committed in that war - by the russian and german governments , and what we ourselves were doing in the pacific to the pows and women and children there … detaining 10 or 11,000 people over a period of three years - we are not talking about anything too significant .

for the past six years , feingold has been trying to pass a bill to create a commission that would examine the us treatment of interned german-americans - as well as italians and other europeans - during world war ii .
a second commission would look at the treatment of jewish refugees fleeing persecution .
" these people are dying " a stand-alone bill on the " wartime treatment study act " has been blocked repeatedly over the last six years by an anonymous republican senator .
now the legislation - which was passed in the form of an amendment to the controversial immigration bill - is uncertain .
" it is so urgent that we pass this legislation , " the liberal democrat feingold said when he introduced the amendment .
" we can not wait any longer … the people who were affected by these policies are dying . "
congress " did the right thing by recognizing and apologizing for the mistreatment of japanese-americans during world war ii , " feingold said .
" but our work in this area is not done . "
no reparations - just accounting bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of japanese were sent from the coast to the middle of the country unlike surviving japanese americans , who were awarded $ 1.2 billion in reparations in 1988 as part of the modern " redress movement , " feingold 's amendment does not seek reparations for the interned germans or their families .
rather , it would " simply review the facts and circumstances the us government 's treatment of german-americans , italian-americans and other european-americans during world war ii . "
survivors from the era and historians alike have made clear that the situation in the camps was far from dire , and that the detainees were , on the whole , treated humanely .
and many observers have seized the debate as a chance to slam the idea of creating a congressional commission to examine 60-year-old events .
but stephen fox , a historian and the author of " fear itself : inside the fbi roundup of german americans during world war ii : the past as prologue , " argues that it is , indeed , important for the government to own up to past actions - especially in light of the current government 's " war on terror " and the newly casual attitudes toward civil liberties .
parallels with guantanamo ?
in an introduction to his book , which contains oral histories and justice department documentation on 50 internees , fox argues : " the most damning aspects of the american internment experience were decisions to hold persons for indeterminate periods on the basis of their political views , their attitudes toward authority , and their personalities - even after it had been determined they were not dangerous . "
bildunterschrift : in us camps , detainees slept in bunkhouses today , americans are " attuned and sensitive to the issue that guantanamo , abu ghraib , and racial profiling here in the us post 9/11 , where people are rounded up and held indeterminately , are invasions of the bill of rights and the constitution , " fox said .
the fact that japanese-american internees were officially acknowledged in the 1980s angered a lot of the surviving germans , fox claimed .
" because they were in the same camps , they thought they should be treated equally , " he said .
but he noted there are two " core problems " in stirring up public sympathy for german-americans from that era .
the first is hitler and the holocaust , which he called " a hurdle german-americans will have a hard time overcoming . "
the other problem is 9/11 , fox said .
" that made it hard for people to have sympathy for people who attack us … and german-americans were perceived during world war ii as enemies of the country . "
numbers are " not too significant " american historian eric kurlander , currently a research fellow at the university of cologne in germany , also advocates studying the past as a way to avoid repeating mistakes .
but , he argued , " there are certainly more significant examples of authoritarian handling of suspects . "
while careful to say that " every individual who suffered detainment deserves to have their stories told , " kurlander said he could think of other things that warrant more urgent attention from congress .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fort lincoln camp , circa 1943 the problem is , that compared to the huge german-american population in the us at the time , the number of german-americans who were detained is miniscule , kurlander argued .
" you 're in the middle of an extremely destructive war with germany .
there are millions of soldiers on the battlefields , spies , double agents , and 50 million deaths world wide , " kurlander explained .
meanwhile , " tens and hundreds of thousands of people in every country had their lives displaced and disrupted ; they had to flee to the countryside and live in conditions little better than at camps . "
" anyone wrongly put in jail has reason to complain , " kurlander acknowledged .
" but given the scale of crimes committed in that war - by the russian and german governments , and what we ourselves were doing in the pacific to the pows and women and children there … detaining 10 or 11,000 people over a period of three years - we are not talking about anything too significant .

german soldiers killed nearly 80 percent of the south west africa tribe during colonial rule more than 100 years ago . in 1904 in the german territory of south west africa , today 's namibia , german troops led by general lothar von trotha mercilessly put down a rebellion of the indigenous herero people .
general von trotha once remarked he wanted to exterminate " the revolting tribes in rivers of blood . "
by the time the conflict ended four years later , between 45,000 to 65,000 herero were killed , many of whom suffered in work camps some consider the forerunners to wwii-era concentration camps .
germany 's development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul publically apologized for the genocide three years ago .
so far , successive german governments have refused to enter into any discussions on possible reparations .
decrying " business as ususal " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : henrik witboi was a herero chief but germany 's left party wants to begin talks between germany and namibia that could lead to monetary compensation .
hüseyin aydin , spokesperson for the left party , said the acknowledgement of a genocide meant no one could continue with business as usual .
members of the ruling coalition made up of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- voiced opposition to the idea of reparations .
anke eimer of the cdu said " isolated views " in favor of reparations did not reflect the general opinion in namibia .
gert weisskirchen of the spd expressed his disgust at the killings but rejected what he called intentions of the left party " to instrumentalize the sufferings " of the herero and nama people .
he also reminded parliament of germany 's generous development aid to namibia .
a request for dialogue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a herero woman wearing the traditional hat chief kuaima riruako , the traditional leader of the herero people , attended the wednesday parliamentary debate with his wife , who was dressed in traditional herero style with the unique broad hat .
earlier wednesday , riruako had thanked the left party for its initiative .
he also expressed satisfaction that munich had changed general von trotha street to herero street .
" more than 100 years after the fateful war against my people i am not here to seek revenge against anybody , " riruako told deutsche welle .
" i have only been appealing to the government of the federal republic of germany for a dialogue so that we can talk about our colonial experience . "
the herero never completely recovered from the conflict and of the around 100,000 that today live in namibia many live in poverty or work on the farms of white landowners .
in 2001 , tribal leaders tried to sue germany for compensation in us courts , but the claim for $ 4 billion -lrb- 3.12 billion euros -rrb- never went very far .
they also want reparations from deutsche bank , which allegedly profited from the forced labor in the camps .
the german parliament 's motion on reparations was referred to some committees of the parliament .
a final vote is not expected until the fall .
observers doubt the ruling coalition will vote in favor of reparations . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german soldiers killed nearly 80 percent of the south west africa tribe during colonial rule more than 100 years ago . in 1904 in the german territory of south west africa , today 's namibia , german troops led by general lothar von trotha mercilessly put down a rebellion of the indigenous herero people .
general von trotha once remarked he wanted to exterminate " the revolting tribes in rivers of blood . "
by the time the conflict ended four years later , between 45,000 to 65,000 herero were killed , many of whom suffered in work camps some consider the forerunners to wwii-era concentration camps .
germany 's development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul publically apologized for the genocide three years ago .
so far , successive german governments have refused to enter into any discussions on possible reparations .
decrying " business as ususal " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : henrik witboi was a herero chief but germany 's left party wants to begin talks between germany and namibia that could lead to monetary compensation .
hüseyin aydin , spokesperson for the left party , said the acknowledgement of a genocide meant no one could continue with business as usual .
members of the ruling coalition made up of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- voiced opposition to the idea of reparations .
anke eimer of the cdu said " isolated views " in favor of reparations did not reflect the general opinion in namibia .
gert weisskirchen of the spd expressed his disgust at the killings but rejected what he called intentions of the left party " to instrumentalize the sufferings " of the herero and nama people .
he also reminded parliament of germany 's generous development aid to namibia .
a request for dialogue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a herero woman wearing the traditional hat chief kuaima riruako , the traditional leader of the herero people , attended the wednesday parliamentary debate with his wife , who was dressed in traditional herero style with the unique broad hat .
earlier wednesday , riruako had thanked the left party for its initiative .
he also expressed satisfaction that munich had changed general von trotha street to herero street .
" more than 100 years after the fateful war against my people i am not here to seek revenge against anybody , " riruako told deutsche welle .
" i have only been appealing to the government of the federal republic of germany for a dialogue so that we can talk about our colonial experience . "
the herero never completely recovered from the conflict and of the around 100,000 that today live in namibia many live in poverty or work on the farms of white landowners .
in 2001 , tribal leaders tried to sue germany for compensation in us courts , but the claim for $ 4 billion -lrb- 3.12 billion euros -rrb- never went very far .
they also want reparations from deutsche bank , which allegedly profited from the forced labor in the camps .
the german parliament 's motion on reparations was referred to some committees of the parliament .
a final vote is not expected until the fall .
observers doubt the ruling coalition will vote in favor of reparations . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

why does this prestigious event take place in a small town ? four centuries ago , margrave christian established his residence in bayreuth .
later , the prussian margrave wilhelmine , sister of frederick the great and a dedicated patron of the arts , transformed the princely residence into an arts center and a baroque jewel .
the city 's distinctive landmarks include the " new palace " with its courtly gardens , the " eremitage castle park " and the margrave 's opera house , considered europe 's most beautiful baroque theater .
it all began with a dream but the picturesque bavarian city remains best known for its association with the operatic composer richard wagner who lived in bayreuth from 1872 until his death in 1883 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : richard wagner remains bayreuth 's most famous son wagner , composer , playwright and theater director all rolled into one , dreamed of a gesamtkunstwerk , -lrb- a total work of art -rrb- , that is , a perfect blend of poetry , song and drama .
the established theaters in the big cities were completely inadequate for staging plans of that scale .
so wagner considered staging his own festival .
the margrave 's opera house in bayreuth , which then had the biggest stage in the german speaking lands , came to his attention .
in early 1871 , joined by his wife cosima , wagner traveled to bayreuth .
but he soon realized that a baroque theater with balconies would be unsuitable for his festival idea .
" however , the unique charm and the location of the friendly city itself were what i had been wishing for , " he wrote .
" an utterly beautiful and generous plot of land not far from the town was given to me as a gift and for the purpose of building the theater i had in mind . "

as long as it is protected by stone , it will reveal itself to the world . "
the rich and famous the bayreuth festspielhaus is both a world cultural monument and an ultramodern theater reserved exclusively for the works of richard wagner .
in the evenings , the stage is set alight by dramatic scenes from the germanic legends .
but from early morning , the grounds outdoors are populated by ticket seekers .
the official route to festival admission can involve a wait of seven years or longer .
the number of people seeking tickets exceeds that of tickets available by a factor of 10 to one .

less sensational are the many music critics on hand , who convey every nuance of the performances inside to the world outside , upholding bayreuth 's status as a musical nerve center of the nation and of the theater world .
since 1876 , the bayreuth festival has accompanied every high and low point of german history .
its current director is a grandson of the composer : 87-year-old wolfgang wagner , who has run the festival since 1951 .

the organization , whose primary goal is to improve living conditions of people in developing regions , reached a milestone of a different kind on wednesday as it released financial figures for 2006 .
for the first time , the gtz 's business volume surpassed the one billion euro mark .
turnover rose to a total of 917.8 million euros -lrb- $ 1,221.42 million -rrb- , marking an increase of 4.8 percent over the previous year .
in the case of charitable donations , the group took in a whopping 770 million euros - a rise of 11 percent on last year .
aid contracts from around the world wolfgang schmitt , director of the organization , said the extraordinarily good figures mirrored the high esteem that the gtz is held in for its work not just in germany but around the world .
" there 's been a trend in the past years that others donors , industrialized countries and other developing nations have been increasingly supplying their own funds to engage the gtz , " he said .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul the gtz 's main employer last year remained the german ministry for economic cooperation and development which handed the aid group more than 700 million euros to realize development projects in africa and other regions .
but even co-financed projects , where third parties supply additional funds for projects that the gtz carries out for the german development ministry , got a huge boost last year by rising 29 percent to 61 million euros .
the un refugee agency , unhcr , was the biggest player here by bankrolling the gtz with 21 million euros .
the gtz also raked in a host of contracts from around the world - the ethiopian government built a network of health care centers with the help of development experts from the gtz and even institutions such as the world bank and the eu commission hired the services of the german aid group .
recipe to success schmitt emphasized that the gtz had become something of a world leader in the field of developmental aid .
the recipe to its success is the gtz 's focus on long-term goals and sustainability as opposed to other aid organizations , schmitt said .
" there 's a tendency in the development industry to score quick successes , " schmitt said .
" but if you look at the problems and responsibilities in the field , then you realize that these are things for which even europe needed centuries to overcome .
that 's why you need to have patience and stamina when it comes to development and cooperation . "
rosy future bernd eisenblätter , another gtz director , said the organization tended to attract skilled and highly qualified applicants around the world . last year , the number of gtz experts sent abroad rose by 4.8 percent to 1,100 persons .
most of them -lrb- 39 percent -rrb- work in africa .
" we get many more applicants than we can hire , even on a limited basis , " eisenblätter said .
" they 're highly-motivated , highly-qualified and 60 to 70 percent of them are women .
that 's why i 'm not worried at all about the future of the gtz .
it shows there 's huge potential and a huge interest in the field of development work and in the gtz . " dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the national audit office -lrb- nao -rrb- said the agency had not met its target of maintaining 63 % of the country 's flood defences in peak condition .
but it said improvements had been made in managing flood risk since 2001 .
mps called on the agency to explain why less than half of england 's high risk defences were found in peak condition .
the watchdog found large regional differences in the proportion of defences in high risk areas which were at peak condition - from 18 % in the south west to 60 % in the south .
there were also big differences in the money spent on maintaining the defences .
the nao report said the agency had taken on greater responsibility for flood risk in england , including the management of important rivers .
' small change ' the agency had protected more people by improving the standard of flood protection for 100,000 homes between 2003/04 and 2005/06 , the watchdog said .
however , it said since 2001 the general condition of defences had not improved significantly .
the all-party committee of mps , the public accounts committee , said more money should go towards " protecting towns and cities , rather than empty fields " .
chairman of the committee , tory mp edward leigh , said : " flood defences are critical to the protection of towns , cities and people 's homes .
" there are significant variations on the amount spent on defences , with only small change going to the north east compared with the midlands and thames .
he said that although flooding was an " ever-present risk to millions of homes and businesses " the agency had not done enough to improve the condition of defences .
" no less than six years have passed since our committee asked for remedial action to be carried out as swiftly as possible , " he added .
the environment agency has estimated that it would need an extra £ 150m a year to bring all flood defence systems up to their peak condition .

the national audit office -lrb- nao -rrb- said the agency had not met its target of maintaining 63 % of the country 's flood defences in peak condition .
but it said improvements had been made in managing flood risk since 2001 .
mps called on the agency to explain why less than half of england 's high risk defences were found in peak condition .
the watchdog found large regional differences in the proportion of defences in high risk areas which were at peak condition - from 18 % in the south west to 60 % in the south .
there were also big differences in the money spent on maintaining the defences .
the nao report said the agency had taken on greater responsibility for flood risk in england , including the management of important rivers .
' small change ' the agency had protected more people by improving the standard of flood protection for 100,000 homes between 2003/04 and 2005/06 , the watchdog said .
however , it said since 2001 the general condition of defences had not improved significantly .
the all-party committee of mps , the public accounts committee , said more money should go towards " protecting towns and cities , rather than empty fields " .
chairman of the committee , tory mp edward leigh , said : " flood defences are critical to the protection of towns , cities and people 's homes .
" there are significant variations on the amount spent on defences , with only small change going to the north east compared with the midlands and thames .
he said that although flooding was an " ever-present risk to millions of homes and businesses " the agency had not done enough to improve the condition of defences .
" no less than six years have passed since our committee asked for remedial action to be carried out as swiftly as possible , " he added .
the environment agency has estimated that it would need an extra £ 150m a year to bring all flood defence systems up to their peak condition .

recently , a bus driver needed hospital treatment after chemicals were thrown at his face through an open window .
gwent police have said that since the increased presence on the buses , fewer incidents have taken place .
uniformed officers have patrolled the city 's buses for the last four years .

but an increase in the levels of patrols on the city 's buses appears to be having a positive effect , say gwent police .
fewer attacks a spokesman for the force said : " gwent pcsos have been patrolling newport buses recently to detect and deter some of the problems which have been occurring on local buses in the maindee area , including attacks on drivers and incidents of criminal damage and anti-social behaviour .

funds should pay tax at the same level as other businesses , say max baucus and charles grassley - the two top members of the senate finance committee .
businesses in the us are taxed at a standard level of 35 % , while partners in investment funds are taxed at 15 % .

" creative new structures for investment vehicles may blur the lines for the tax treatment of income .

the plans are part of a government drive to create affordable housing .
most of the new homes in the county would be built in and around nottingham city - with planners keen to avoid any development on greenbelt areas .
consultants originally suggested around 1,200 new properties a year , but that figure has now been lowered .
the joint plan prepared for both authorities calls for more inner-city housing but adds that the actual construction of the homes will depend on " continued buoyancy of the city centre market " .
the total for the greater nottingham area , including erewash in derbyshire , is more than 50,000 new homes in the period between 2006-2026 .
the plans will be discussed further by councillors before being reviewed by a regional panel .

the plans are part of a government drive to create affordable housing .
most of the new homes in the county would be built in and around nottingham city - with planners keen to avoid any development on greenbelt areas .
consultants originally suggested around 1,200 new properties a year , but that figure has now been lowered .
the joint plan prepared for both authorities calls for more inner-city housing but adds that the actual construction of the homes will depend on " continued buoyancy of the city centre market " .
the total for the greater nottingham area , including erewash in derbyshire , is more than 50,000 new homes in the period between 2006-2026 .
the plans will be discussed further by councillors before being reviewed by a regional panel .

habitats are expected to shift further north as the planet warms , and plants ' inability to move quickly enough has been a cause for concern .
but researchers , writing in the journal science , suggest seeds can be carried vast distances by the wind and sea ice .
the biggest challenge , they added , was likely to be their ability to establish themselves in the new habitat .
researchers from norway and france analysed more than 4,000 samples of nine flowering plant species found on the remote svalbard islands inside the arctic circle .
by analysing the genetic fingerprints of the plants , the team reconstructed past plant colonisation and decline in the area .
they found evidence that seeds from plants from various sources , including russia and greenland , had repeatedly colonised the islands over the past 20,000 years when climatic conditions allowed .
likewise , when the islands cooled , the plants died out because they were unable to survive under blankets of ice .
seeds of hope climatologists project the polar regions are going to experience the largest degree of climate change over the coming century , risking the long-term stability of ecosystems .
" climate change is expected to cause the distribution area of many plant species to shift northwards in the northern hemisphere , " the researchers wrote in their paper .
" the composition of future ecosystems will critically depend on the long-distance dispersal capabilities of individual species . "
it had been assumed that long-distance dispersal of seeds happened rarely and randomly , making the chance of colonisation unlikely .
yet , the team said , the study suggested it was more common than previously thought .
" probable dispersal vectors are wind , drift wood and drifting sea ice , birds and mammals .
" north-western russia and greenland are frequently connected to svalbard by way of sea ice during the winter .
" bank erosion along the russian rivers routinely results in logs and other debris finding their way on to drifting sea ice , which reaches svalbard by means of surface currents . "
they suggested the main limiting factor was the plants ' ability to establish themselves through " germination , survival and local reproduction " .
" this interpretation is supported by our observation that 80-90 % of the most cold-adapted species that occur in the potential source zones are currently present in svalbard , " the team wrote .
whereas , they added , only 40-60 % of the species limited to zones where summer temperatures of 6-7c -lrb- 43-45f -rrb- were found on the islands .
the findings suggest future studies should have greater confidence that seeds can travel long distances , and place more emphasis on whether there is suitable habitat to sustain the plant species .

they found evidence that seeds from plants from various sources , including russia and greenland , had repeatedly colonised the islands over the past 20,000 years when climatic conditions allowed .
likewise , when the islands cooled , the plants died out because they were unable to survive under blankets of ice .
seeds of hope climatologists project the polar regions are going to experience the largest degree of climate change over the coming century , risking the long-term stability of ecosystems .
" climate change is expected to cause the distribution area of many plant species to shift northwards in the northern hemisphere , " the researchers wrote in their paper .
" the composition of future ecosystems will critically depend on the long-distance dispersal capabilities of individual species . "
it had been assumed that long-distance dispersal of seeds happened rarely and randomly , making the chance of colonisation unlikely .
yet , the team said , the study suggested it was more common than previously thought .
" probable dispersal vectors are wind , drift wood and drifting sea ice , birds and mammals .
" north-western russia and greenland are frequently connected to svalbard by way of sea ice during the winter .
" bank erosion along the russian rivers routinely results in logs and other debris finding their way on to drifting sea ice , which reaches svalbard by means of surface currents . "
they suggested the main limiting factor was the plants ' ability to establish themselves through " germination , survival and local reproduction " .
" this interpretation is supported by our observation that 80-90 % of the most cold-adapted species that occur in the potential source zones are currently present in svalbard , " the team wrote .
whereas , they added , only 40-60 % of the species limited to zones where summer temperatures of 6-7c -lrb- 43-45f -rrb- were found on the islands .
the findings suggest future studies should have greater confidence that seeds can travel long distances , and place more emphasis on whether there is suitable habitat to sustain the plant species .
