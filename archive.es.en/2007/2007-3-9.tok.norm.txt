program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 09.03.2007 airbus reports massive losses as franco-german tensions rise großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german airbus or french airbus ?
the row is raging against a backdrop of terrible losses airbus parent company eads had more bad news for its sick aviation subsidiary when the first operating loss in its history was announced .
this was compounded by new , related tensions between germany and france . airbus parent company eads reported on thursday that its ailing aviation subsidiary , currently in turmoil over job cuts and delays to its new flagship a380 superjumbo , suffered its first-ever operating loss of 572 million euros -lrb- $ 752 million -rrb- in 2006 and was expected to suffer further losses in 2007 . the restructuring costs for airbus ' a380 superjumbo have been cited as the main cause for the forecasted " substantial " operating loss for 2007 along with the problems arising from the adaptation of the popular a350 to the upgraded a350xwb jet .
in 2005 , airbus achieved a profit of 2.3 billion euros . eads announced at the presentation of its annual results in munich that net profit for 2006 plunged to 99 million euros from 1.8 billion euros the previous year .
operating profit before interest and tax slumped from 2.9 billion euros in 2005 to 399 million euros last year , the company added . the drop in profits came despite a 15 percent increase in revenue from 34.2 billion euros to 39.4 billion euros . airbus is currently undergoing a restructuring program , which is expected to result in the loss of 10,000 jobs and the selling off of factories . restructuring a priority , say chiefs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : louis gallois eads co-chairmen louis gallois and thomas enders said friday that implementation of the restructuring program had utmost priority despite the horrendous financial report .
they said the company needed to improve its operating performance , regain the confidence of clients and turn itself into a lean , dynamic operation . one of the main aspects eads is looking into in terms of streamlining is the abolition of a two-headed senior management team .
earlier this week , both gallois and enders said in separate statements that the current system was too cumbersome and that the company would benefit from a single president rather than the split role of the two co-chairmen . on friday , the german government announced that it was open to the idea of doing away with the long-standing practice of having twin french and german chief executives at eads . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's thomas enders wants a single eads chief berlin 's coordinator for aeronautics , peter hintze , told members of parliament on thursday that the european aerospace giant could instead distribute posts lower down in the leadership ranks equally between french and german nationals to maintain the power balance . until now the european aeronautic defense and space company has always had a french and a german co-chief executive . simmering row over franco-german ownership if eads were to appoint a single company head , problems would surely arise as to the nationality of the chairman .
if either gallois nor enders were to be appointed sole chief , the simmering animosity between france and germany would surely erupt , with the country losing its chairman also perceivably losing a considerable amount of influence in the company . the current conflict between the two countries over eads bubbled to the surface again on thursday after french finance minister thierry breton said his country should have taken a bigger share in airbus parent eads at the firm 's creation . hintze responded to breton 's claim by saying germany would ensure the even balance between the countries would remain . shift in french power rejected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france allegedly wanted more power at airbus hq " when the french finance minister , breton , ... called on french radio for the 50-50 relationship between germany and france to change to 60-40 in france 's favor , i can reject that emphatically in the name of the german government , " hintze said in a fiery speech to the bundestag . hintze accused breton of seeking to disrupt the delicate balance between the two countries that has existed since eads was formed in july 2000 . the french finance ministry replied to the german outburst hours later , denying that breton had ever called for a rebalancing of the french and german shareholdings .
the ministry said breton had only been referring to the origins of the pact in the radio interview . dw staff / afp / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de airbus crisis deepens as france , germany fight over job cuts troubled european airplane maker airbus faced worsening problems tuesday as germany and france , who jointly control the company , wrangled over the distribution of thousands of job cuts .

" pakistan is the preferred destination of terrorists , " hanning said , referring to one of the factors that went into the decision not to allow kurnaz back into germany . during his own testimony on thursday , current bnd head ernst uhrlau , the former secret services coordinator , supported hanning 's evaluation of kurnaz . peculiar spot for quran study bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uhrlau questioned the location kurnaz chose for his study of the quran " the pakistani-afghan border region is not the right spot for peaceful study of the quran , " uhrlau said .
kurnaz has said he had traveled to pakistan to study the quran . a turkish national born in bremen , kurnaz was released from the us military prison at guantanamo bay in cuba in 2006 without being charged , after chancellor angela merkel raised the issue with us president george w. bush .
kurnaz was taken prisoner by american forces in pakistan in 2001 . hanning did not criticize the chancellor 's decision to intervene for " humanitarian reasons " and told the inquiry panel that the circumstances of kurnaz ' imprisonment could be seen in a different light when merkel intervened . did germany do enough for kurnaz ? as former chancellor gerhard schröder 's chief of staff , steinmeier was ultimately responsible for intelligence matters and the kurnaz case has been a stone around his neck as media have reported that germany refused to accept a us offer to release kurnaz in 2002 .
both steinmeier and kurnaz have said no such offer was ever put on the table . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurnaz was released from guantanamo bay in 2006 hanning told parliamentarians that steinmeier was privy to all pertinent information concerning kurnaz .

" my impression was that the intelligence service 's collected knowledge was presented to him . " steinmeier to testify in march during his testimony hanning also disputed the conclusions reached by intelligence service agents who , after interrogating him at guantanamo bay , said kurnaz was taken prisoner for " being in the wrong place at the wrong time . " hanning called their conclusion " flawed and unprofessional " because it did not take into account information from the bremen state interior ministry the investigatory committee delayed hearing testimony from steinmeier by a week , to march 29 , after bremen 's interior ministry unexpectedly released documents needed for the inquiry .

the row is raging against a backdrop of terrible losses airbus parent company eads had more bad news for its sick aviation subsidiary when the first operating loss in its history was announced .
this was compounded by new , related tensions between germany and france . airbus parent company eads reported on thursday that its ailing aviation subsidiary , currently in turmoil over job cuts and delays to its new flagship a380 superjumbo , suffered its first-ever operating loss of 572 million euros -lrb- $ 752 million -rrb- in 2006 and was expected to suffer further losses in 2007 . the restructuring costs for airbus ' a380 superjumbo have been cited as the main cause for the forecasted " substantial " operating loss for 2007 along with the problems arising from the adaptation of the popular a350 to the upgraded a350xwb jet .
in 2005 , airbus achieved a profit of 2.3 billion euros . eads announced at the presentation of its annual results in munich that net profit for 2006 plunged to 99 million euros from 1.8 billion euros the previous year .
operating profit before interest and tax slumped from 2.9 billion euros in 2005 to 399 million euros last year , the company added . the drop in profits came despite a 15 percent increase in revenue from 34.2 billion euros to 39.4 billion euros . airbus is currently undergoing a restructuring program , which is expected to result in the loss of 10,000 jobs and the selling off of factories . restructuring a priority , say chiefs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : louis gallois eads co-chairmen louis gallois and thomas enders said friday that implementation of the restructuring program had utmost priority despite the horrendous financial report .
they said the company needed to improve its operating performance , regain the confidence of clients and turn itself into a lean , dynamic operation . one of the main aspects eads is looking into in terms of streamlining is the abolition of a two-headed senior management team .
earlier this week , both gallois and enders said in separate statements that the current system was too cumbersome and that the company would benefit from a single president rather than the split role of the two co-chairmen . on friday , the german government announced that it was open to the idea of doing away with the long-standing practice of having twin french and german chief executives at eads . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's thomas enders wants a single eads chief berlin 's coordinator for aeronautics , peter hintze , told members of parliament on thursday that the european aerospace giant could instead distribute posts lower down in the leadership ranks equally between french and german nationals to maintain the power balance . until now the european aeronautic defense and space company has always had a french and a german co-chief executive . simmering row over franco-german ownership if eads were to appoint a single company head , problems would surely arise as to the nationality of the chairman .
if either gallois nor enders were to be appointed sole chief , the simmering animosity between france and germany would surely erupt , with the country losing its chairman also perceivably losing a considerable amount of influence in the company . the current conflict between the two countries over eads bubbled to the surface again on thursday after french finance minister thierry breton said his country should have taken a bigger share in airbus parent eads at the firm 's creation . hintze responded to breton 's claim by saying germany would ensure the even balance between the countries would remain . shift in french power rejected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france allegedly wanted more power at airbus hq " when the french finance minister , breton , ... called on french radio for the 50-50 relationship between germany and france to change to 60-40 in france 's favor , i can reject that emphatically in the name of the german government , " hintze said in a fiery speech to the bundestag . hintze accused breton of seeking to disrupt the delicate balance between the two countries that has existed since eads was formed in july 2000 . the french finance ministry replied to the german outburst hours later , denying that breton had ever called for a rebalancing of the french and german shareholdings .

" there is no agreement as yet .
we 've all got to show a little patience , " german chancellor angela merkel told reporters late thursday after chairing the opening session of the two-day summit . " we need to find common ground .
i 'm not without hope , " she added . the 27 heads of state and government resolved to seek a compromise deal on friday morning . the main sticking point to the plan , which aims to reduce emissions of the greenhouse gases that cause global warming , centered on some member countries ' reluctance to agree to firm goals for the future use of renewable energy . merkel , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency , wants the 27-nation bloc to commit to a binding target that 20 percent of eu energy needs should be met by renewable sources by 2020 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel wants the eu to lead the way on green issues " we talked about specific obligations - increasing energy efficiency , biofuels , renewable energy .
there is a need for further discussion on these three areas , " said merkel .
" some member states were asking : ' are we really going to achieve these goals ? " ' she added . in an effort to limit the rise in average global temperatures to two degrees celsius above pre-industrial era levels , the eu leaders are being asked to commit to cut carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- emissions by 20 percent by 2020 , from 1990 levels .
plenty of haggling ahead to entice the rest of the world to take bigger steps , the eu will offer to slash the emissions by a further 10 percent if nations like the united states , china and india also agree to take concrete steps . if a deal is reached friday there is still plenty of haggling ahead on what measures each eu nation will have to take to achieve the 20 percent average in co2 cuts . the eu member states have some time to make those decisions , as the kyoto protocol on climate change lays down targets until 2012 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : newer eu member states are reliant on carbon-heavy fuels like coal the eu hopes that a strong initiative here will provide impetus for the next g8 summit of industrialized nations in germany in june . before the summit began , merkel warned that the eu 's credibility hung on the bloc 's ability to agree on specific , long term goals for fighting global warming that other nations could emulate . " we can not say we came to a conclusion , " european commission president jose manuel barroso told a press conference after the leaders held talks over dinner , " but i really believe a consensus is emerging . " divergent views but while everyone agreed on the need to cut emissions , views obviously diverged on how to achieve this . some newer eu members like the czech republic , hungary and poland depend heavily on carbon-heavy fuels like coal , and oppose setting a mandatory target for the use of renewable energy sources . " the plans are too ambitious in the years to come for poland , " polish president lech kaczynski said .
" if we have a flexible approach ... then a compromise solution would be possible . " at the other end of the spectrum lay denmark , which claims that its economy has thrived even as it moves to newer , more sustainable energy sources . " i think the european union should go green and to that end we need binding targets , " said danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen . embracing nuclear power ? france has said that it would accept the use of the word " binding , " but in return french president jacques chirac has demanded that nuclear energy be brought into the plan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel appeared ready to give in to chirac on nuclear energy merkel said that atomic power , which meets 40 percent of french energy needs , could be included in the eu 's ambitious scheme to reduce carbon emissions . " this overall reduction of 20 percent will also depend on the question of how to use cleaner coal technology , it could possibly include nuclear energy , " she conceded . german officials were preparing a new draft document for the leaders to consider again early friday , when they gather at european council headquarters from 10:00 cet . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german carmakers rev up effort to enter hybrid market amid increasing consumer awareness of global warming and other environmental issues , german carmakers have had to fight off growing criticism about their apparent lack of will to build environmentally friendly cars .

the jets are expected to be dispatched in april . the bundesrat or the upper house of parliament will likely vote on the deployment this month . opposition deputies claimed the decision would drag german forces into combat in the south of afghanistan where nato this week launched an offensive against the taliban . germany has around 3,000 troops in the landlocked asian nation , mostly working in civilian-military provincial reconstruction teams in the relatively peaceful north . nato has some 35,000 soldiers in afghanistan , which has recently seen an increase in attacks by remnants of the taliban . deployment clouded by killing of aid worker bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's minister for cooperation and development heidemarie wieczorek-zeul the vote was overshadowed by the killing of a german engineer on thursday - the first german aid worker killed in afghanistan since us forces ousted the taliban in 2001 . development assistance minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul said that the assistance provided by aid workers in afghanistan deserved respect and gratitude , and would continue despite thursday 's tragic event . the minister called on the afghan government to discover who was behind the slaying of dieter rübling , 65 , and bring the assailants to justice . afghan police on friday arrested six people on suspicion of involvement in the killing , which took place in the province of sar-e-pul where the engineer was on an inspection tour . an afghan official said that more than 100 additional police were sent to the area to track down the culprits as part of a joint investigation with the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- . ideological motives bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato launched a new offensive in afghanistan this week rübling - who worked for a non-denominational bonn-based aid foundation , deutsche welthungerhilfe , which uses the english name agro action - was traveling with his afghan colleagues .

großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women still need to fight discrimination at work women need to think bigger when it comes to their demands , argues faith dennis on international women 's day .
and they need to stop imitating men and make it their own way . yesterday was march the 8th , international woman ’ s day .
i was my home from having dinner with a friend when i came across a police car with flashing lights blocking off a busy street in kreuzberg , where i live .
an accident was my first thought , until i spotted a riot van , and group of 20 women staging a demonstration , surrounded by an even smaller bunch of , mostly male , onlookers .
i , too , thought i would stop and have a look to see what exactly they were protesting against , although assuming it would be quite obvious , given it was woman ’ s day and their banners all had the female symbol painted on them . where 's the power struggle ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is it time to stop playing by male rules ?
stepping closer , however , i noticed the slogan in big letters across the main fabric banner , which said : “ wir geben die macht nicht auf ! ” which translates as “ we won ’ t give up power . ”
this i didn ’ t quite understand - “ we want more power ” would have made more sense , surely ?
is there a power struggle at the top that i am not aware of ?
germany does have a female chancellor and good equal opportunity initiatives in the realm of business , but as far as i understand , the problems in equality are often glossed over by reports in the media that show rising figures of women in employment , rather than illustrating the difference in salaries between men and woman working in the same jobs .
in germany , women still earn 22 percent less than their male counterparts in the same positions . women struggle to be themselves in business woman in high level management positions are also harder to find and when women do reach the top , it is usually through major sacrifices .
i am not just talking about sacrifices in their family and home lives , but rather sacrifices in their very " being , " to put it philosophically . a prime example of this is a newspaper article i read recently about women taking the male hormone testosterone in order to be able to be more aggressive and " manly " in the workplace to be able to keep hold of their positions of power .
one woman admitted that she knew the drug was having harmful physical side effects , but stated it was the only way she could receive the desired recognition she felt she needed to survive in a male working environment . stop trying to be one of the boys bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hegel has the answers !
hegel , one of the founding fathers of social theory , states that all desires are based on a desire for recognition , and it is only through this experience of recognition that we can become socially viable human beings .
however , in the above case and many others , this recognition is based on being " manly " or having " masculine traits . "
the norm is thus set by homogeneity , excluding not just for women , but also for anyone who falls outside the " manly " category .
until we can find a formula for success in business which is non-gender specific , women should not be concerned with " giving up power , " but pointing out that power can achieved through embracing the differences between men and women as positive attributes and a viable alternative to the current ideal . faith dennis send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de read faith 's earlier columns shop ‘ til you bop faith never was a big fan of buying used knick-knacks and antiques - until she visited a unique night-time flea market in berlin kreuzberg .

" in some countries , there has been a substantial rise , but in terms of the overall eu share , this has been almost cancelled out by a corresponding increase in energy consumption . " to attain 20 percent meant tripling renewables ' present share , which means lowering fossil-fuel use through greater use of rail and water transport for freight and use of biofuels and biomass for heating apartment blocks and offices , he said . antolini also predicted the 2020 target would be a huge job creator .

" it is clear that the targets decided today will only be achieved with solid laws , measures and incentives , " said stephan singer , head of the european climate and energy unit at environmental group wwf . " there are only 13 years for the eu to accomplish the mission defined today .
these years are key to help saving the planet from the dangerous consequences of climate change , " singer said . too timid or too ambitious ? friends of the earth europe -lrb- foee -rrb- derided the 20 percent target as too timid and unlikely to encourage other big polluters to follow suit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the us follow the european example ?
" it will be interesting to see the eu trying to persuade -lrb- us -rrb- president -lrb- george -rrb- bush that he should reduce america 's emissions by 30 percent by 2020 compared to 1990 levels , when eu leaders cowered away from adopting such a target for themselves today , " foee climate campaigner jan kowalzig said in a press release . eliot diringer , director of international strategies at the pew center on global climate change , a us thinktank , said by dangling the offer of a 30-percent cut , the eu faced being accused of grandstanding . " there 's a good deal of skepticism -lrb- in washington -rrb- about whether the eu is on track for meeting its commitments for 2012 , " he said in an interview with afp . " their ambitious 2020 numbers are more credible if the perception is that they are indeed on track to meet their 2012 target .
it 's a big stretch that they 're proposing -lrb- with the 2020 goal -rrb- .
there 's a lot of things that have to happen between now and 2012 to make the -lrb- eu 's kyoto -rrb- commitment a reality , " diringer said . " a real opportunity " the 20-percent renewables target was hailed by the european wind energy association -lrb- ewea -rrb- as a " real opportunity " to switch to clean sources and ease eu dependence on unpredictable sources of foreign energy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu would like to rely less on russian gas imports " such a supply structure would benefit our economy , environment , companies and the welfare of european citizens for decades to come , " ewea 's chief executive officer , christian kjaer said . but , he cautioned , these benefits would only be achieved if eu countries broke up monopoly ownership of electricity transmission and production , so that renewables entering the energy market got fair access to the supply grid . creating jobs along the way andre antolini , president of france 's renewable energies association , said that , at present , renewables had an average share of 6.75 percent of the eu energy market .

but you ca n't say the germans are not trying . placing last in the eurovision song contest is a humiliation that european countries try to avoid like the plague .
germany knows how high the pressure is - especially after its 2005 entry " hide and run " suffered the ignominious fate of placing last with only four sympathy points from monaco and moldova . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jane comerford and texas lightning brought country music to the german charts last year , germany decided to shake things up a bit in europe 's favorite singing contest .
the catchy , though slightly off-the-path , country-western song " no no never " - performed by an aging australian-born singer whose name is not kylie minogue and a band that calls itself texas lightning - was the first grand prix competitor in 50 years that featured an ukulele , a singing lady in pink waving an imaginary lasso and a group of musicians who would eventually be declared honorary citizens of texas by the lonestar state 's own senate . europe was confused .
it voted for lordi - a finnish heavy-metal / horror-film freak show instead .
germany came 15th . healing wounds this is a big year for germany .
with angela merkel heading the eu 's rotating presidency as well as the g8 and fond memories of the world cup success , this would be a perfect time for germany to flex its pop muscles and show some talent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lordi 's song ' ' hard rock hallelujah " won the 2006 eurovision song contest but eurovision is not meant to be enjoyed lightly .
an endless parade of songs followed by an equally never-ending voting process is what makes eurovision a truly unique event - part circus act , part masochism feast . germany , however , organized a national competition in which only three songs were allowed to participate .

but you ca n't say the germans are not trying . placing last in the eurovision song contest is a humiliation that european countries try to avoid like the plague .
germany knows how high the pressure is - especially after its 2005 entry " hide and run " suffered the ignominious fate of placing last with only four sympathy points from monaco and moldova . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jane comerford and texas lightning brought country music to the german charts last year , germany decided to shake things up a bit in europe 's favorite singing contest .
the catchy , though slightly off-the-path , country-western song " no no never " - performed by an aging australian-born singer whose name is not kylie minogue and a band that calls itself texas lightning - was the first grand prix competitor in 50 years that featured an ukulele , a singing lady in pink waving an imaginary lasso and a group of musicians who would eventually be declared honorary citizens of texas by the lonestar state 's own senate . europe was confused .
it voted for lordi - a finnish heavy-metal / horror-film freak show instead .
germany came 15th . healing wounds this is a big year for germany .
with angela merkel heading the eu 's rotating presidency as well as the g8 and fond memories of the world cup success , this would be a perfect time for germany to flex its pop muscles and show some talent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lordi 's song ' ' hard rock hallelujah " won the 2006 eurovision song contest but eurovision is not meant to be enjoyed lightly .
an endless parade of songs followed by an equally never-ending voting process is what makes eurovision a truly unique event - part circus act , part masochism feast . germany , however , organized a national competition in which only three songs were allowed to participate .
putting aside the fact that choosing between three songs on thursday evening resembled elections under a communist dictatorship - put a red star next to the name of the communist party candidate that you think our glorious leader fancies the most - the entire spectacle felt like an one-sentence version of anna karenina : " she was unhappy and jumped under the train .

großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women still need to fight discrimination at work women need to think bigger when it comes to their demands , argues faith dennis on international women 's day .
and they need to stop imitating men and make it their own way . yesterday was march the 8th , international woman ’ s day .
i was my home from having dinner with a friend when i came across a police car with flashing lights blocking off a busy street in kreuzberg , where i live .
an accident was my first thought , until i spotted a riot van , and group of 20 women staging a demonstration , surrounded by an even smaller bunch of , mostly male , onlookers .
i , too , thought i would stop and have a look to see what exactly they were protesting against , although assuming it would be quite obvious , given it was woman ’ s day and their banners all had the female symbol painted on them . where 's the power struggle ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is it time to stop playing by male rules ?
stepping closer , however , i noticed the slogan in big letters across the main fabric banner , which said : “ wir geben die macht nicht auf ! ” which translates as “ we won ’ t give up power . ”
this i didn ’ t quite understand - “ we want more power ” would have made more sense , surely ?
is there a power struggle at the top that i am not aware of ?
germany does have a female chancellor and good equal opportunity initiatives in the realm of business , but as far as i understand , the problems in equality are often glossed over by reports in the media that show rising figures of women in employment , rather than illustrating the difference in salaries between men and woman working in the same jobs .
in germany , women still earn 22 percent less than their male counterparts in the same positions . women struggle to be themselves in business woman in high level management positions are also harder to find and when women do reach the top , it is usually through major sacrifices .
i am not just talking about sacrifices in their family and home lives , but rather sacrifices in their very " being , " to put it philosophically . a prime example of this is a newspaper article i read recently about women taking the male hormone testosterone in order to be able to be more aggressive and " manly " in the workplace to be able to keep hold of their positions of power .
one woman admitted that she knew the drug was having harmful physical side effects , but stated it was the only way she could receive the desired recognition she felt she needed to survive in a male working environment . stop trying to be one of the boys bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hegel has the answers !
hegel , one of the founding fathers of social theory , states that all desires are based on a desire for recognition , and it is only through this experience of recognition that we can become socially viable human beings .
however , in the above case and many others , this recognition is based on being " manly " or having " masculine traits . "
the norm is thus set by homogeneity , excluding not just for women , but also for anyone who falls outside the " manly " category .
until we can find a formula for success in business which is non-gender specific , women should not be concerned with " giving up power , " but pointing out that power can achieved through embracing the differences between men and women as positive attributes and a viable alternative to the current ideal . faith dennis send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de read faith 's earlier columns shop ‘ til you bop faith never was a big fan of buying used knick-knacks and antiques - until she visited a unique night-time flea market in berlin kreuzberg .

" it has been possible to , as it were , open the door to a new dimension of european cooperation for years to come in the area of energy and combating climate change , " merkel said . the accord 's overarching achievement is to commit the 27-country bloc to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 20 percent by 2020 , when compared to 1990 levels . the pact also obliges member countries to make renewable energies , such as solar and wind power , the source of 20 percent of the total energy consumption on average across the eu by 2020 . " these are a set of ground-breaking , bold ambitious targets for the european union , " said british prime minister tony blair , who pushed hard for a climate agreement .
" it gives europe a very clear leadership position on this crucial issue facing the world . " each according to its ability bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said europe needs to stick to the goals it has set itself the talks in brussels had broken up overnight during the two-day conference with divisions over setting a " binding " target for the use of renewable energy sources .
the leaders , however , agreed on a compromise that accords member states some flexibility in meeting national goals . countries like poland and the czech republic are heavily dependent on carbon energy sources such as coal and had complained that the binding renewable energies target was overly ambitious and prohibitively expensive .
france , on the other hand , had insisted on including nuclear energy among the list of environmentally friendly options . to bring the opposing states on board , the agreement stressed that " differentiated national overall targets " would be set , " with due regard to a fair and adequate allocation " taking into account the potential of each member state . thus , those countries whose exploitation of renewable energies is already well advanced would take up the slack left by the others to ensure the overall wide target is met across the bloc . leverage against non-eu polluters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is willing to cut co2 emissions more if other nations do so as well merkel said the pact gave her a mandate to press major world polluters into action , as the eu would offer to reduce emissions of the gases that cause global warming by an additional 10 percent by 2020 if those countries would do so as well . " we are going into negotiations offering 30 percent if international partners are prepared to go along with that , so it is a genuine offer in what is an extremely important topic for the whole of humanity , " she said , adding that it would be " a bad signal " to the rest of the world if europe did not stick to the deal . but tough questions must still be answered in brussels . the european commission has been set the task of working out how much of the renewable energy burden each state will have to bear ; a cumbersome , deeply technical and controversial task that it hopes to complete in the autumn . environmental nitty-gritty bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the safety of nuclear power plants also needs to be taken into account " it will be a huge job , huge job from a legal and a technical point of view , " acknowledged european commission president jose manuel barroso .
" i have assured them that we will do this in all fairness and seeking the acceptance of each member state on these objectives . " swedish foreign minister carl bildt said there was no one-size-fits-all solution . " different nations have different conditions , " he said .
" for instance , we can easily meet the renewable target in sweden - in fact we are above it .
but others are having substantial difficulties . " nuclear power part of pact the accord represents a minor victory for france by having nuclear power - which meets some 40 percent of its total energy needs - recognized as one way to reduce carbon dioxide emissions . the agreement noted the commission 's assessment of the contribution of nuclear energy in " meeting the growing concerns about safety of energy supply and carbon dioxide emissions reductions . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmental protection groups said the agreement was far from ideal however , it also highlighted safety concerns , stating that " nuclear safety and security " should be " paramount in the decision-making process . " barroso said he believed the final agreement comprised " the most ambitious package ever agreed by any institution or any group of countries " to combat climate change . green groups want more it was unclear if the deal would provide for sanctions against nations that fail to meet their climate change targets . environmental protection group wwf said the eu deal set the " right path " to control global warming but warned that the eu must put in place laws and measures so that the goal does not remain " hot air . " " it is clear that the targets decided today will only be achieved with solid laws , measures and incentives , " wwf 's stephan singer said , adding that the targets need to be translated into a shift of investments towards green technologies , rather than to nuclear power stations . dw staff / afp -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu leaders seek to break deadlock on climate change deal eu leaders hope to seal a landmark agreement on tackling climate change on friday , after a row over setting binding targets for renewable energy scuppered their first attempt at a summit in brussels .

" it is clear that the targets decided today will only be achieved with solid laws , measures and incentives , " said stephan singer , head of the european climate and energy unit at environmental group wwf . " there are only 13 years for the eu to accomplish the mission defined today .
these years are key to help saving the planet from the dangerous consequences of climate change , " singer said . too timid or too ambitious ? friends of the earth europe -lrb- foee -rrb- derided the 20 percent target as too timid and unlikely to encourage other big polluters to follow suit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the us follow the european example ?
" it will be interesting to see the eu trying to persuade -lrb- us -rrb- president -lrb- george -rrb- bush that he should reduce america 's emissions by 30 percent by 2020 compared to 1990 levels , when eu leaders cowered away from adopting such a target for themselves today , " foee climate campaigner jan kowalzig said in a press release . eliot diringer , director of international strategies at the pew center on global climate change , a us thinktank , said by dangling the offer of a 30-percent cut , the eu faced being accused of grandstanding . " there 's a good deal of skepticism -lrb- in washington -rrb- about whether the eu is on track for meeting its commitments for 2012 , " he said in an interview with afp . " their ambitious 2020 numbers are more credible if the perception is that they are indeed on track to meet their 2012 target .
it 's a big stretch that they 're proposing -lrb- with the 2020 goal -rrb- .
there 's a lot of things that have to happen between now and 2012 to make the -lrb- eu 's kyoto -rrb- commitment a reality , " diringer said . " a real opportunity " the 20-percent renewables target was hailed by the european wind energy association -lrb- ewea -rrb- as a " real opportunity " to switch to clean sources and ease eu dependence on unpredictable sources of foreign energy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu would like to rely less on russian gas imports " such a supply structure would benefit our economy , environment , companies and the welfare of european citizens for decades to come , " ewea 's chief executive officer , christian kjaer said . but , he cautioned , these benefits would only be achieved if eu countries broke up monopoly ownership of electricity transmission and production , so that renewables entering the energy market got fair access to the supply grid . creating jobs along the way andre antolini , president of france 's renewable energies association , said that , at present , renewables had an average share of 6.75 percent of the eu energy market .
the eu has a non-binding goal of 12 percent by 2010 . " the share has not progressed for years , " antolini said .
" in some countries , there has been a substantial rise , but in terms of the overall eu share , this has been almost cancelled out by a corresponding increase in energy consumption . " to attain 20 percent meant tripling renewables ' present share , which means lowering fossil-fuel use through greater use of rail and water transport for freight and use of biofuels and biomass for heating apartment blocks and offices , he said . antolini also predicted the 2020 target would be a huge job creator .

they want to draw attention to the fates of people like florian blitzer - a 42-year-old roofer who says even the current retirement age of 65 is virtually impossible to achieve . " as a roofer you spend your entire working life standing or kneeling on sloping surfaces , " blitzer says .
" this is bound to damage your knee and hip joints after a number of years making it impossible to work for so long . " however , under the new law , adopted by the bundestag on friday , everyone seeking retirement earlier than 67 will face a monthly pension cut of 0.3 percent . amelie buntenbach , a trade union official , says the measure will not help to solve the pension funding crisis as a result of a rapidly aging population . " there is enormous fear among people here that they will become dependent on welfare payments because they won ’ t be able to work or find a job at that age , " buntenbach said .
" they are afraid of having to use up all their savings before retirement , thus ending up in social hardship . " not enough jobs to go around in germany so far , companies made use of generous state-funded early retirement schemes to shed millions of older staff .
less than half of all germans aged 55 and 64 , still work here compared with 70 percent in sweden . critics of the new law say the government completely ignores the fact that there just aren ’ t enough jobs around for people at 65 , let alone 67 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : older workers fear they may have to depend on government handouts kurt beck , leader of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- which rules in a coalition with chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats , says the government will make sure that such jobs will be created . " we have started a new program to foster employment among older people , " beck said .
" and secondly , the new law also allows people who have worked for 45 years to continue retiring at the age 65 .
manual workers such as roofers and brick layers usually start their professional lives at 16 , so they will have the chance to retire earlier .

" in my company , we ’ ve started this process and older employees say they feel happy and fit enough to be able to work until retirement .

großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women still need to fight discrimination at work women need to think bigger when it comes to their demands , argues faith dennis on international women 's day .
and they need to stop imitating men and make it their own way . yesterday was march the 8th , international woman ’ s day .
i was my home from having dinner with a friend when i came across a police car with flashing lights blocking off a busy street in kreuzberg , where i live .
an accident was my first thought , until i spotted a riot van , and group of 20 women staging a demonstration , surrounded by an even smaller bunch of , mostly male , onlookers .
i , too , thought i would stop and have a look to see what exactly they were protesting against , although assuming it would be quite obvious , given it was woman ’ s day and their banners all had the female symbol painted on them . where 's the power struggle ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is it time to stop playing by male rules ?
stepping closer , however , i noticed the slogan in big letters across the main fabric banner , which said : “ wir geben die macht nicht auf ! ” which translates as “ we won ’ t give up power . ”
this i didn ’ t quite understand - “ we want more power ” would have made more sense , surely ?
is there a power struggle at the top that i am not aware of ?
germany does have a female chancellor and good equal opportunity initiatives in the realm of business , but as far as i understand , the problems in equality are often glossed over by reports in the media that show rising figures of women in employment , rather than illustrating the difference in salaries between men and woman working in the same jobs .
in germany , women still earn 22 percent less than their male counterparts in the same positions . women struggle to be themselves in business woman in high level management positions are also harder to find and when women do reach the top , it is usually through major sacrifices .
i am not just talking about sacrifices in their family and home lives , but rather sacrifices in their very " being , " to put it philosophically . a prime example of this is a newspaper article i read recently about women taking the male hormone testosterone in order to be able to be more aggressive and " manly " in the workplace to be able to keep hold of their positions of power .

hegel , one of the founding fathers of social theory , states that all desires are based on a desire for recognition , and it is only through this experience of recognition that we can become socially viable human beings .
however , in the above case and many others , this recognition is based on being " manly " or having " masculine traits . "
the norm is thus set by homogeneity , excluding not just for women , but also for anyone who falls outside the " manly " category .
until we can find a formula for success in business which is non-gender specific , women should not be concerned with " giving up power , " but pointing out that power can achieved through embracing the differences between men and women as positive attributes and a viable alternative to the current ideal . faith dennis send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de read faith 's earlier columns shop ‘ til you bop faith never was a big fan of buying used knick-knacks and antiques - until she visited a unique night-time flea market in berlin kreuzberg .

großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women still need to fight discrimination at work women need to think bigger when it comes to their demands , argues faith dennis on international women 's day .
and they need to stop imitating men and make it their own way . yesterday was march the 8th , international woman ’ s day .
i was my home from having dinner with a friend when i came across a police car with flashing lights blocking off a busy street in kreuzberg , where i live .
an accident was my first thought , until i spotted a riot van , and group of 20 women staging a demonstration , surrounded by an even smaller bunch of , mostly male , onlookers .
i , too , thought i would stop and have a look to see what exactly they were protesting against , although assuming it would be quite obvious , given it was woman ’ s day and their banners all had the female symbol painted on them . where 's the power struggle ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is it time to stop playing by male rules ?
stepping closer , however , i noticed the slogan in big letters across the main fabric banner , which said : “ wir geben die macht nicht auf ! ” which translates as “ we won ’ t give up power . ”
this i didn ’ t quite understand - “ we want more power ” would have made more sense , surely ?
is there a power struggle at the top that i am not aware of ?
germany does have a female chancellor and good equal opportunity initiatives in the realm of business , but as far as i understand , the problems in equality are often glossed over by reports in the media that show rising figures of women in employment , rather than illustrating the difference in salaries between men and woman working in the same jobs .
in germany , women still earn 22 percent less than their male counterparts in the same positions . women struggle to be themselves in business woman in high level management positions are also harder to find and when women do reach the top , it is usually through major sacrifices .
i am not just talking about sacrifices in their family and home lives , but rather sacrifices in their very " being , " to put it philosophically . a prime example of this is a newspaper article i read recently about women taking the male hormone testosterone in order to be able to be more aggressive and " manly " in the workplace to be able to keep hold of their positions of power .
one woman admitted that she knew the drug was having harmful physical side effects , but stated it was the only way she could receive the desired recognition she felt she needed to survive in a male working environment . stop trying to be one of the boys bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hegel has the answers !
hegel , one of the founding fathers of social theory , states that all desires are based on a desire for recognition , and it is only through this experience of recognition that we can become socially viable human beings .
however , in the above case and many others , this recognition is based on being " manly " or having " masculine traits . "
the norm is thus set by homogeneity , excluding not just for women , but also for anyone who falls outside the " manly " category .

" there is no agreement as yet .
we 've all got to show a little patience , " german chancellor angela merkel told reporters late thursday after chairing the opening session of the two-day summit . " we need to find common ground .
i 'm not without hope , " she added . the 27 heads of state and government resolved to seek a compromise deal on friday morning . the main sticking point to the plan , which aims to reduce emissions of the greenhouse gases that cause global warming , centered on some member countries ' reluctance to agree to firm goals for the future use of renewable energy . merkel , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency , wants the 27-nation bloc to commit to a binding target that 20 percent of eu energy needs should be met by renewable sources by 2020 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel wants the eu to lead the way on green issues " we talked about specific obligations - increasing energy efficiency , biofuels , renewable energy .
there is a need for further discussion on these three areas , " said merkel .
" some member states were asking : ' are we really going to achieve these goals ? " ' she added . in an effort to limit the rise in average global temperatures to two degrees celsius above pre-industrial era levels , the eu leaders are being asked to commit to cut carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- emissions by 20 percent by 2020 , from 1990 levels .
plenty of haggling ahead to entice the rest of the world to take bigger steps , the eu will offer to slash the emissions by a further 10 percent if nations like the united states , china and india also agree to take concrete steps . if a deal is reached friday there is still plenty of haggling ahead on what measures each eu nation will have to take to achieve the 20 percent average in co2 cuts . the eu member states have some time to make those decisions , as the kyoto protocol on climate change lays down targets until 2012 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : newer eu member states are reliant on carbon-heavy fuels like coal the eu hopes that a strong initiative here will provide impetus for the next g8 summit of industrialized nations in germany in june . before the summit began , merkel warned that the eu 's credibility hung on the bloc 's ability to agree on specific , long term goals for fighting global warming that other nations could emulate . " we can not say we came to a conclusion , " european commission president jose manuel barroso told a press conference after the leaders held talks over dinner , " but i really believe a consensus is emerging . " divergent views but while everyone agreed on the need to cut emissions , views obviously diverged on how to achieve this . some newer eu members like the czech republic , hungary and poland depend heavily on carbon-heavy fuels like coal , and oppose setting a mandatory target for the use of renewable energy sources . " the plans are too ambitious in the years to come for poland , " polish president lech kaczynski said .
" if we have a flexible approach ... then a compromise solution would be possible . " at the other end of the spectrum lay denmark , which claims that its economy has thrived even as it moves to newer , more sustainable energy sources . " i think the european union should go green and to that end we need binding targets , " said danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen . embracing nuclear power ? france has said that it would accept the use of the word " binding , " but in return french president jacques chirac has demanded that nuclear energy be brought into the plan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel appeared ready to give in to chirac on nuclear energy merkel said that atomic power , which meets 40 percent of french energy needs , could be included in the eu 's ambitious scheme to reduce carbon emissions . " this overall reduction of 20 percent will also depend on the question of how to use cleaner coal technology , it could possibly include nuclear energy , " she conceded . german officials were preparing a new draft document for the leaders to consider again early friday , when they gather at european council headquarters from 10:00 cet . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german carmakers rev up effort to enter hybrid market amid increasing consumer awareness of global warming and other environmental issues , german carmakers have had to fight off growing criticism about their apparent lack of will to build environmentally friendly cars .

" pakistan is the preferred destination of terrorists , " hanning said , referring to one of the factors that went into the decision not to allow kurnaz back into germany . during his own testimony on thursday , current bnd head ernst uhrlau , the former secret services coordinator , supported hanning 's evaluation of kurnaz . peculiar spot for quran study bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uhrlau questioned the location kurnaz chose for his study of the quran " the pakistani-afghan border region is not the right spot for peaceful study of the quran , " uhrlau said .
kurnaz has said he had traveled to pakistan to study the quran . a turkish national born in bremen , kurnaz was released from the us military prison at guantanamo bay in cuba in 2006 without being charged , after chancellor angela merkel raised the issue with us president george w. bush .
kurnaz was taken prisoner by american forces in pakistan in 2001 . hanning did not criticize the chancellor 's decision to intervene for " humanitarian reasons " and told the inquiry panel that the circumstances of kurnaz ' imprisonment could be seen in a different light when merkel intervened . did germany do enough for kurnaz ? as former chancellor gerhard schröder 's chief of staff , steinmeier was ultimately responsible for intelligence matters and the kurnaz case has been a stone around his neck as media have reported that germany refused to accept a us offer to release kurnaz in 2002 .
both steinmeier and kurnaz have said no such offer was ever put on the table . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurnaz was released from guantanamo bay in 2006 hanning told parliamentarians that steinmeier was privy to all pertinent information concerning kurnaz . " all of the relevant facts were certainly presented , " hanning said of his meetings with steinmeier .
" my impression was that the intelligence service 's collected knowledge was presented to him . " steinmeier to testify in march during his testimony hanning also disputed the conclusions reached by intelligence service agents who , after interrogating him at guantanamo bay , said kurnaz was taken prisoner for " being in the wrong place at the wrong time . " hanning called their conclusion " flawed and unprofessional " because it did not take into account information from the bremen state interior ministry the investigatory committee delayed hearing testimony from steinmeier by a week , to march 29 , after bremen 's interior ministry unexpectedly released documents needed for the inquiry .
the panel will also hear from former interior minister otto schily on the same day . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us official : germany not keen on release of guantanamo inmate contradicting statements made by german foreign minister steinmeier , a high-ranking former us official has said that german government officials did not try to get german-born murat kurnaz released from guantanamo .

the row is raging against a backdrop of terrible losses airbus parent company eads had more bad news for its sick aviation subsidiary when the first operating loss in its history was announced .
this was compounded by new , related tensions between germany and france . airbus parent company eads reported on thursday that its ailing aviation subsidiary , currently in turmoil over job cuts and delays to its new flagship a380 superjumbo , suffered its first-ever operating loss of 572 million euros -lrb- $ 752 million -rrb- in 2006 and was expected to suffer further losses in 2007 . the restructuring costs for airbus ' a380 superjumbo have been cited as the main cause for the forecasted " substantial " operating loss for 2007 along with the problems arising from the adaptation of the popular a350 to the upgraded a350xwb jet .
in 2005 , airbus achieved a profit of 2.3 billion euros . eads announced at the presentation of its annual results in munich that net profit for 2006 plunged to 99 million euros from 1.8 billion euros the previous year .
operating profit before interest and tax slumped from 2.9 billion euros in 2005 to 399 million euros last year , the company added . the drop in profits came despite a 15 percent increase in revenue from 34.2 billion euros to 39.4 billion euros . airbus is currently undergoing a restructuring program , which is expected to result in the loss of 10,000 jobs and the selling off of factories . restructuring a priority , say chiefs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : louis gallois eads co-chairmen louis gallois and thomas enders said friday that implementation of the restructuring program had utmost priority despite the horrendous financial report .
they said the company needed to improve its operating performance , regain the confidence of clients and turn itself into a lean , dynamic operation . one of the main aspects eads is looking into in terms of streamlining is the abolition of a two-headed senior management team .
earlier this week , both gallois and enders said in separate statements that the current system was too cumbersome and that the company would benefit from a single president rather than the split role of the two co-chairmen . on friday , the german government announced that it was open to the idea of doing away with the long-standing practice of having twin french and german chief executives at eads . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's thomas enders wants a single eads chief berlin 's coordinator for aeronautics , peter hintze , told members of parliament on thursday that the european aerospace giant could instead distribute posts lower down in the leadership ranks equally between french and german nationals to maintain the power balance . until now the european aeronautic defense and space company has always had a french and a german co-chief executive . simmering row over franco-german ownership if eads were to appoint a single company head , problems would surely arise as to the nationality of the chairman .
if either gallois nor enders were to be appointed sole chief , the simmering animosity between france and germany would surely erupt , with the country losing its chairman also perceivably losing a considerable amount of influence in the company . the current conflict between the two countries over eads bubbled to the surface again on thursday after french finance minister thierry breton said his country should have taken a bigger share in airbus parent eads at the firm 's creation . hintze responded to breton 's claim by saying germany would ensure the even balance between the countries would remain . shift in french power rejected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france allegedly wanted more power at airbus hq " when the french finance minister , breton , ... called on french radio for the 50-50 relationship between germany and france to change to 60-40 in france 's favor , i can reject that emphatically in the name of the german government , " hintze said in a fiery speech to the bundestag . hintze accused breton of seeking to disrupt the delicate balance between the two countries that has existed since eads was formed in july 2000 . the french finance ministry replied to the german outburst hours later , denying that breton had ever called for a rebalancing of the french and german shareholdings .

the row is raging against a backdrop of terrible losses airbus parent company eads had more bad news for its sick aviation subsidiary when the first operating loss in its history was announced .
this was compounded by new , related tensions between germany and france . airbus parent company eads reported on thursday that its ailing aviation subsidiary , currently in turmoil over job cuts and delays to its new flagship a380 superjumbo , suffered its first-ever operating loss of 572 million euros -lrb- $ 752 million -rrb- in 2006 and was expected to suffer further losses in 2007 . the restructuring costs for airbus ' a380 superjumbo have been cited as the main cause for the forecasted " substantial " operating loss for 2007 along with the problems arising from the adaptation of the popular a350 to the upgraded a350xwb jet .
in 2005 , airbus achieved a profit of 2.3 billion euros . eads announced at the presentation of its annual results in munich that net profit for 2006 plunged to 99 million euros from 1.8 billion euros the previous year .
operating profit before interest and tax slumped from 2.9 billion euros in 2005 to 399 million euros last year , the company added . the drop in profits came despite a 15 percent increase in revenue from 34.2 billion euros to 39.4 billion euros . airbus is currently undergoing a restructuring program , which is expected to result in the loss of 10,000 jobs and the selling off of factories . restructuring a priority , say chiefs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : louis gallois eads co-chairmen louis gallois and thomas enders said friday that implementation of the restructuring program had utmost priority despite the horrendous financial report .
they said the company needed to improve its operating performance , regain the confidence of clients and turn itself into a lean , dynamic operation . one of the main aspects eads is looking into in terms of streamlining is the abolition of a two-headed senior management team .
earlier this week , both gallois and enders said in separate statements that the current system was too cumbersome and that the company would benefit from a single president rather than the split role of the two co-chairmen . on friday , the german government announced that it was open to the idea of doing away with the long-standing practice of having twin french and german chief executives at eads . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's thomas enders wants a single eads chief berlin 's coordinator for aeronautics , peter hintze , told members of parliament on thursday that the european aerospace giant could instead distribute posts lower down in the leadership ranks equally between french and german nationals to maintain the power balance . until now the european aeronautic defense and space company has always had a french and a german co-chief executive . simmering row over franco-german ownership if eads were to appoint a single company head , problems would surely arise as to the nationality of the chairman .
if either gallois nor enders were to be appointed sole chief , the simmering animosity between france and germany would surely erupt , with the country losing its chairman also perceivably losing a considerable amount of influence in the company . the current conflict between the two countries over eads bubbled to the surface again on thursday after french finance minister thierry breton said his country should have taken a bigger share in airbus parent eads at the firm 's creation . hintze responded to breton 's claim by saying germany would ensure the even balance between the countries would remain . shift in french power rejected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france allegedly wanted more power at airbus hq " when the french finance minister , breton , ... called on french radio for the 50-50 relationship between germany and france to change to 60-40 in france 's favor , i can reject that emphatically in the name of the german government , " hintze said in a fiery speech to the bundestag . hintze accused breton of seeking to disrupt the delicate balance between the two countries that has existed since eads was formed in july 2000 . the french finance ministry replied to the german outburst hours later , denying that breton had ever called for a rebalancing of the french and german shareholdings .

they want to draw attention to the fates of people like florian blitzer - a 42-year-old roofer who says even the current retirement age of 65 is virtually impossible to achieve . " as a roofer you spend your entire working life standing or kneeling on sloping surfaces , " blitzer says .
" this is bound to damage your knee and hip joints after a number of years making it impossible to work for so long . " however , under the new law , adopted by the bundestag on friday , everyone seeking retirement earlier than 67 will face a monthly pension cut of 0.3 percent . amelie buntenbach , a trade union official , says the measure will not help to solve the pension funding crisis as a result of a rapidly aging population . " there is enormous fear among people here that they will become dependent on welfare payments because they won ’ t be able to work or find a job at that age , " buntenbach said .
" they are afraid of having to use up all their savings before retirement , thus ending up in social hardship . " not enough jobs to go around in germany so far , companies made use of generous state-funded early retirement schemes to shed millions of older staff .
less than half of all germans aged 55 and 64 , still work here compared with 70 percent in sweden . critics of the new law say the government completely ignores the fact that there just aren ’ t enough jobs around for people at 65 , let alone 67 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : older workers fear they may have to depend on government handouts kurt beck , leader of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- which rules in a coalition with chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats , says the government will make sure that such jobs will be created . " we have started a new program to foster employment among older people , " beck said .
" and secondly , the new law also allows people who have worked for 45 years to continue retiring at the age 65 .
manual workers such as roofers and brick layers usually start their professional lives at 16 , so they will have the chance to retire earlier . " by 2035 , the share of people aged 65 and over in germany is projected to swell to 30 percent of the total population from around 18 percent now . new work model needed carl martin welcker , ceo of the schütte machine tool maker , believes employers must also rethink their former staff policy .
the imminent shortage of skilled labor will make it necessary to keep elderly workers employed , he says . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german workers will no longer be able to sit back and relax at 65 " we need to find ways to make working hours more flexible and seek individual solutions to keep workers employed as long as possible , " welcker said .
" in my company , we ’ ve started this process and older employees say they feel happy and fit enough to be able to work until retirement . " the new retirement age is scheduled to be introduced in a gradual process starting in 2012 and ending in 2029 . the government has pledged to review the legislation over that period to see whether the labor market has really changed to take on more elderly employees . uwe hessler -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu tackles demographic challenges at conference under growing pressure to tackle the challenges of a shrinking workforce and an ageing population , the eu has urged member states to help citizens better unite paid work with family commitments at a special forum .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 09.03.2007 germany lifts retirement age , but fears over jobs remain großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a rare sight - critics say older workers have a tough time finding jobs the german parliament on friday raised the official retirement age from 65 to 67 to deal with a pension funding crisis resulting from germany 's low birth rate and rapidly graying population . germany ’ s trade unions unleashed powerful street protests recently , fighting what they say amounts to pension cutbacks for millions of people .
they want to draw attention to the fates of people like florian blitzer - a 42-year-old roofer who says even the current retirement age of 65 is virtually impossible to achieve . " as a roofer you spend your entire working life standing or kneeling on sloping surfaces , " blitzer says .
" this is bound to damage your knee and hip joints after a number of years making it impossible to work for so long . " however , under the new law , adopted by the bundestag on friday , everyone seeking retirement earlier than 67 will face a monthly pension cut of 0.3 percent . amelie buntenbach , a trade union official , says the measure will not help to solve the pension funding crisis as a result of a rapidly aging population . " there is enormous fear among people here that they will become dependent on welfare payments because they won ’ t be able to work or find a job at that age , " buntenbach said .
" they are afraid of having to use up all their savings before retirement , thus ending up in social hardship . " not enough jobs to go around in germany so far , companies made use of generous state-funded early retirement schemes to shed millions of older staff .
less than half of all germans aged 55 and 64 , still work here compared with 70 percent in sweden . critics of the new law say the government completely ignores the fact that there just aren ’ t enough jobs around for people at 65 , let alone 67 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : older workers fear they may have to depend on government handouts kurt beck , leader of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- which rules in a coalition with chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats , says the government will make sure that such jobs will be created .

" however , under the new law , adopted by the bundestag on friday , everyone seeking retirement earlier than 67 will face a monthly pension cut of 0.3 percent . amelie buntenbach , a trade union official , says the measure will not help to solve the pension funding crisis as a result of a rapidly aging population . " there is enormous fear among people here that they will become dependent on welfare payments because they won ’ t be able to work or find a job at that age , " buntenbach said .
" they are afraid of having to use up all their savings before retirement , thus ending up in social hardship . " not enough jobs to go around in germany so far , companies made use of generous state-funded early retirement schemes to shed millions of older staff .
less than half of all germans aged 55 and 64 , still work here compared with 70 percent in sweden . critics of the new law say the government completely ignores the fact that there just aren ’ t enough jobs around for people at 65 , let alone 67 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : older workers fear they may have to depend on government handouts kurt beck , leader of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- which rules in a coalition with chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats , says the government will make sure that such jobs will be created . " we have started a new program to foster employment among older people , " beck said .
" and secondly , the new law also allows people who have worked for 45 years to continue retiring at the age 65 .
manual workers such as roofers and brick layers usually start their professional lives at 16 , so they will have the chance to retire earlier . " by 2035 , the share of people aged 65 and over in germany is projected to swell to 30 percent of the total population from around 18 percent now . new work model needed carl martin welcker , ceo of the schütte machine tool maker , believes employers must also rethink their former staff policy .
the imminent shortage of skilled labor will make it necessary to keep elderly workers employed , he says . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german workers will no longer be able to sit back and relax at 65 " we need to find ways to make working hours more flexible and seek individual solutions to keep workers employed as long as possible , " welcker said .
" in my company , we ’ ve started this process and older employees say they feel happy and fit enough to be able to work until retirement . " the new retirement age is scheduled to be introduced in a gradual process starting in 2012 and ending in 2029 . the government has pledged to review the legislation over that period to see whether the labor market has really changed to take on more elderly employees . uwe hessler -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu tackles demographic challenges at conference under growing pressure to tackle the challenges of a shrinking workforce and an ageing population , the eu has urged member states to help citizens better unite paid work with family commitments at a special forum .

i am set to meet sponsors of the latest memory trend . pasta and the past richard and elke hoffmann * greet me at one of berlin ’ s thousand cheap italian restaurants , chosen so we could talk at length without worrying someone else will be waiting for our table . the conversation quickly turns from vodka penne to vergangenheitsbewältigung , or " coming to terms with the past . " mr. hoffmann believes in the controversial " collective guilt " theory popularized after a 1981 speech by israeli prime minister menachem begin . the theory holds that all germans as an entire people are guilty for the crimes of nazi germany . a prevailing counter to the " collective guilt " theory runs that german society is not collectively guilty but rather collectively responsible ; as witnesses to the terrible history and heirs to its consequences , they can help ensure it does not happen again . while mr. hoffmann agrees with this responsibility , he nonetheless sees the nation as categorically culpable , a feeling that informed his desire to sponsor a stumbling-stone . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : artist gunter demnig produces the stones " with this stone , i ’ m accepting a small piece of the guilt of our people .
the guilt that i inherited . i take on this guilt in recognition of the terrible crimes we have committed , " he explains to me slowly and carefully , as though describing a logical proof . a shocking bakery visit mrs. hoffmann expands on their reasons , bringing up an incident from their 1974 trip to israel , when they stopped in a bakery for a snack . " i wanted to buy a pastry and the woman behind the counter had blue numbers tattooed here . " mrs. hoffmann points to her arm . " when she heard us speaking german she just gasped and then couldn ’ t breathe . she froze , completely transported by horrible memories . " this encounter with a concentration camp survivor stayed with mrs. hoffmann for decades .
" i had to face what my people did , " she says . " and for me , the stumbling-stone is a way of dealing with this .
it ’ s a small gesture of humanity towards the victims . " the hoffmanns ’ stumbling-stone commemorates an elderly woman deported to theresienstadt and killed in october 1942 .
it lies not far from our restaurant , where the woman resided at the time of deportation . laying more stones " we came upon them the same way you did , " explains mr. hoffmann .
" we noticed them here and there throughout the city , and at some point we thought , ‘ that ’ s something we ’ d like to do . we ’ d like to sponsor a stone . ’ " they were able to turn their desire into action when mrs. hoffmann read a newspaper article with information about the local office that coordinates with the artist . she called to inquire , and ten months later , the stone was set . the hoffmanns would like to do more . after reading about the former jewish neighborhood in venice , where the term " ghetto " originated , the idea of laying a stumbling-stone there appealed to them . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for sponsors , the stones offer a way to acknowledge past horrors mrs. hoffmann takes out a travel guide and opens to a map depicting giudecca island , former home of the giudei , or jews .
the cartographic neutrality of the land mass , shaped like a bread crust lying in a soup of venetian canals , does not betray the cramped conditions under which jews once lived . " i have to research myself if there were jews living there at the time of the second world war , and if they got deported , as well as finding the names and dates , " says mrs. hoffmann . " we ’ re not sure if everything is recorded , either , " mr. hoffmann adds .
" germans like to write everything down , but other countries might not have . " he is referring to the astoundingly precise german documentation of their crimes , right down to careful inventories of homes from which jews were deported . " be sure you know why " despite this tactical obstacle , the hoffmanns believe strongly that in what they are doing , stating emphatically that only by remembering can one avoid repeating past mistakes .
when asked how they would advise someone planning to sponsor a stone , their message is clear , " be sure you know why you are doing it . " interested in sponsoring a stumbling-stone where you live ? many -lrb- german and austrian -rrb- cities have coordination centers ; call the mayor ’ s office or district office -lrb- bezirksamt -rrb- to inquire . * names have been changed at the request of the sponsors , who want more people to know about the stumbling-stones yet prefer not to receive undue attention for simply doing what they consider the right thing . arden pennell send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de read arden pennell 's earlier columns rational disdain for distant relatives americans and europeans are n't quite as different as people think , wrote arden pennell .

" you can " stumble " anytime and anywhere in berlin . whether stepping out to pick up a carton of milk or on the way home from work , you ’ re bound to notice the " stumbling-stones " -lrb- stolpersteine -rrb- , small brass-capped squares laid flush with berlin ’ s stone sidewalks . one stumbles psychologically , not literally , for inscribed into their surface is the name , and - as far as is known - the dates of birth , deportation , and death of a former jewish inhabitant of the dwelling alongside the stone . the brainchild of artist gunter demnig , the miniature memorials must be privately sponsored at a cost of roughly 95 euros -lrb- $ 125 -rrb- and have caught on as an effective way to personalize the enormity of the holocaust . after " stumbling " dozens of times over berlin ’ s roughly 900 miniature memorials , i became eager to talk to individuals who funded the stones , which are created and inlaid by the artist himself . a phone call to my neighborhood ’ s stumbling-stone coordination center puts me in touch with a local couple .
i am set to meet sponsors of the latest memory trend . pasta and the past richard and elke hoffmann * greet me at one of berlin ’ s thousand cheap italian restaurants , chosen so we could talk at length without worrying someone else will be waiting for our table . the conversation quickly turns from vodka penne to vergangenheitsbewältigung , or " coming to terms with the past . " mr. hoffmann believes in the controversial " collective guilt " theory popularized after a 1981 speech by israeli prime minister menachem begin . the theory holds that all germans as an entire people are guilty for the crimes of nazi germany . a prevailing counter to the " collective guilt " theory runs that german society is not collectively guilty but rather collectively responsible ; as witnesses to the terrible history and heirs to its consequences , they can help ensure it does not happen again . while mr. hoffmann agrees with this responsibility , he nonetheless sees the nation as categorically culpable , a feeling that informed his desire to sponsor a stumbling-stone . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : artist gunter demnig produces the stones " with this stone , i ’ m accepting a small piece of the guilt of our people .
the guilt that i inherited . i take on this guilt in recognition of the terrible crimes we have committed , " he explains to me slowly and carefully , as though describing a logical proof . a shocking bakery visit mrs. hoffmann expands on their reasons , bringing up an incident from their 1974 trip to israel , when they stopped in a bakery for a snack . " i wanted to buy a pastry and the woman behind the counter had blue numbers tattooed here . " mrs. hoffmann points to her arm . " when she heard us speaking german she just gasped and then couldn ’ t breathe . she froze , completely transported by horrible memories . " this encounter with a concentration camp survivor stayed with mrs. hoffmann for decades .
" i had to face what my people did , " she says . " and for me , the stumbling-stone is a way of dealing with this .
it ’ s a small gesture of humanity towards the victims . " the hoffmanns ’ stumbling-stone commemorates an elderly woman deported to theresienstadt and killed in october 1942 .
it lies not far from our restaurant , where the woman resided at the time of deportation . laying more stones " we came upon them the same way you did , " explains mr. hoffmann .
" we noticed them here and there throughout the city , and at some point we thought , ‘ that ’ s something we ’ d like to do . we ’ d like to sponsor a stone . ’ " they were able to turn their desire into action when mrs. hoffmann read a newspaper article with information about the local office that coordinates with the artist . she called to inquire , and ten months later , the stone was set . the hoffmanns would like to do more . after reading about the former jewish neighborhood in venice , where the term " ghetto " originated , the idea of laying a stumbling-stone there appealed to them . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for sponsors , the stones offer a way to acknowledge past horrors mrs. hoffmann takes out a travel guide and opens to a map depicting giudecca island , former home of the giudei , or jews .
the cartographic neutrality of the land mass , shaped like a bread crust lying in a soup of venetian canals , does not betray the cramped conditions under which jews once lived . " i have to research myself if there were jews living there at the time of the second world war , and if they got deported , as well as finding the names and dates , " says mrs. hoffmann . " we ’ re not sure if everything is recorded , either , " mr. hoffmann adds .
" germans like to write everything down , but other countries might not have . " he is referring to the astoundingly precise german documentation of their crimes , right down to careful inventories of homes from which jews were deported . " be sure you know why " despite this tactical obstacle , the hoffmanns believe strongly that in what they are doing , stating emphatically that only by remembering can one avoid repeating past mistakes .
when asked how they would advise someone planning to sponsor a stone , their message is clear , " be sure you know why you are doing it . " interested in sponsoring a stumbling-stone where you live ? many -lrb- german and austrian -rrb- cities have coordination centers ; call the mayor ’ s office or district office -lrb- bezirksamt -rrb- to inquire . * names have been changed at the request of the sponsors , who want more people to know about the stumbling-stones yet prefer not to receive undue attention for simply doing what they consider the right thing . arden pennell send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de read arden pennell 's earlier columns rational disdain for distant relatives americans and europeans are n't quite as different as people think , wrote arden pennell .
and although the germans may sometimes complain about their trans-atlantic neighbors , at least they 're rational about it .
-lrb- 02.03.2007 -rrb- two 's company , but three -lrb- million -rrb- is barely a crowd germany 's capital is losing residents , and crowds are becoming harder and hard to find , writes arden pennell .

but you ca n't say the germans are not trying . placing last in the eurovision song contest is a humiliation that european countries try to avoid like the plague .
germany knows how high the pressure is - especially after its 2005 entry " hide and run " suffered the ignominious fate of placing last with only four sympathy points from monaco and moldova . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jane comerford and texas lightning brought country music to the german charts last year , germany decided to shake things up a bit in europe 's favorite singing contest .
the catchy , though slightly off-the-path , country-western song " no no never " - performed by an aging australian-born singer whose name is not kylie minogue and a band that calls itself texas lightning - was the first grand prix competitor in 50 years that featured an ukulele , a singing lady in pink waving an imaginary lasso and a group of musicians who would eventually be declared honorary citizens of texas by the lonestar state 's own senate . europe was confused .
it voted for lordi - a finnish heavy-metal / horror-film freak show instead .
germany came 15th . healing wounds this is a big year for germany .
with angela merkel heading the eu 's rotating presidency as well as the g8 and fond memories of the world cup success , this would be a perfect time for germany to flex its pop muscles and show some talent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lordi 's song ' ' hard rock hallelujah " won the 2006 eurovision song contest but eurovision is not meant to be enjoyed lightly .
an endless parade of songs followed by an equally never-ending voting process is what makes eurovision a truly unique event - part circus act , part masochism feast . germany , however , organized a national competition in which only three songs were allowed to participate .
putting aside the fact that choosing between three songs on thursday evening resembled elections under a communist dictatorship - put a red star next to the name of the communist party candidate that you think our glorious leader fancies the most - the entire spectacle felt like an one-sentence version of anna karenina : " she was unhappy and jumped under the train . " winners and losers in this unusual eins-zwei-drei affair , two candidates - a 50 year-old-rocker called heinz rudolf kunze and this year 's winners of germany 's popular casting show " popstars , " a girlband called " monrose " - came out as losers .

heinz sounds like mayonnaise and rudolf sounds like a reindeer , not exactly the stuff that rock-and-roll rebels are made of . but where were all those thousands of teenagers who overcharged their cell phones by voting repeatedly during the popstars finals ?
german teenagers are either not very-well acquainted with the country 's public broadcaster ard - the german home of eurovision and other quality programs - or they were too busy watching germany 's next top model - a casting show hosted by supermodel heidi klum on a competing private tv channel . locked-up kids ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roger cicero asked german parents to keep their kids away from their cell phones or maybe german parents listened to the third candidate - 36-year-old jazz singer roger cicero - who pleaded with them in his promotional video to keep the children away from their cell phones .

but you ca n't say the germans are not trying . placing last in the eurovision song contest is a humiliation that european countries try to avoid like the plague .
germany knows how high the pressure is - especially after its 2005 entry " hide and run " suffered the ignominious fate of placing last with only four sympathy points from monaco and moldova . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jane comerford and texas lightning brought country music to the german charts last year , germany decided to shake things up a bit in europe 's favorite singing contest .
the catchy , though slightly off-the-path , country-western song " no no never " - performed by an aging australian-born singer whose name is not kylie minogue and a band that calls itself texas lightning - was the first grand prix competitor in 50 years that featured an ukulele , a singing lady in pink waving an imaginary lasso and a group of musicians who would eventually be declared honorary citizens of texas by the lonestar state 's own senate . europe was confused .
it voted for lordi - a finnish heavy-metal / horror-film freak show instead .
germany came 15th . healing wounds this is a big year for germany .
with angela merkel heading the eu 's rotating presidency as well as the g8 and fond memories of the world cup success , this would be a perfect time for germany to flex its pop muscles and show some talent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lordi 's song ' ' hard rock hallelujah " won the 2006 eurovision song contest but eurovision is not meant to be enjoyed lightly .
an endless parade of songs followed by an equally never-ending voting process is what makes eurovision a truly unique event - part circus act , part masochism feast . germany , however , organized a national competition in which only three songs were allowed to participate .
putting aside the fact that choosing between three songs on thursday evening resembled elections under a communist dictatorship - put a red star next to the name of the communist party candidate that you think our glorious leader fancies the most - the entire spectacle felt like an one-sentence version of anna karenina : " she was unhappy and jumped under the train . " winners and losers in this unusual eins-zwei-drei affair , two candidates - a 50 year-old-rocker called heinz rudolf kunze and this year 's winners of germany 's popular casting show " popstars , " a girlband called " monrose " - came out as losers .
surely , nobody stamped a big " l " on their foreheads , but pursed mouths and teary eyes after the viewers ' voting results were announced were telling enough . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the monrose girls were let down by their teenage fans heinz rudolf kunze never stood a chance , because , deep down , germans knew that europe was never going to accept a rocker called heinz rudolf .
heinz sounds like mayonnaise and rudolf sounds like a reindeer , not exactly the stuff that rock-and-roll rebels are made of . but where were all those thousands of teenagers who overcharged their cell phones by voting repeatedly during the popstars finals ?
german teenagers are either not very-well acquainted with the country 's public broadcaster ard - the german home of eurovision and other quality programs - or they were too busy watching germany 's next top model - a casting show hosted by supermodel heidi klum on a competing private tv channel . locked-up kids ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roger cicero asked german parents to keep their kids away from their cell phones or maybe german parents listened to the third candidate - 36-year-old jazz singer roger cicero - who pleaded with them in his promotional video to keep the children away from their cell phones .
he thought - like everybody else - that the girlband 's obsessive-compulsive fan base would be a serious threat . it is not clear whether german teenagers ended up grounded , locked up and deprived of their cellular alter egos .
but roger cicero 's swing hit " frauen regieren die welt " -lrb- women rule the world -rrb- reaped all the bouquets on the eve of the international women 's day - surprisingly , but refreshingly so . so here we go again .
germany is experimenting .
it 's playing with eurovision fire .

the jets are expected to be dispatched in april . the bundesrat or the upper house of parliament will likely vote on the deployment this month . opposition deputies claimed the decision would drag german forces into combat in the south of afghanistan where nato this week launched an offensive against the taliban . germany has around 3,000 troops in the landlocked asian nation , mostly working in civilian-military provincial reconstruction teams in the relatively peaceful north . nato has some 35,000 soldiers in afghanistan , which has recently seen an increase in attacks by remnants of the taliban . deployment clouded by killing of aid worker bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's minister for cooperation and development heidemarie wieczorek-zeul the vote was overshadowed by the killing of a german engineer on thursday - the first german aid worker killed in afghanistan since us forces ousted the taliban in 2001 . development assistance minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul said that the assistance provided by aid workers in afghanistan deserved respect and gratitude , and would continue despite thursday 's tragic event . the minister called on the afghan government to discover who was behind the slaying of dieter rübling , 65 , and bring the assailants to justice . afghan police on friday arrested six people on suspicion of involvement in the killing , which took place in the province of sar-e-pul where the engineer was on an inspection tour . an afghan official said that more than 100 additional police were sent to the area to track down the culprits as part of a joint investigation with the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- . ideological motives bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato launched a new offensive in afghanistan this week rübling - who worked for a non-denominational bonn-based aid foundation , deutsche welthungerhilfe , which uses the english name agro action - was traveling with his afghan colleagues .
their convoy was attacked by a group of armed men , who let the afghans go before shooting the german . agro action secretary general joachim preuss said the engineer was on a three-month tour of duty in afghanistan and had many years of experience in international development aid projects . preuss said it appeared " ideological motives " were behind the murder and not criminal actions . afghan president hamid karzai on friday " strongly condemned " the murder of the german aid worker .

" there is no agreement as yet .
we 've all got to show a little patience , " german chancellor angela merkel told reporters late thursday after chairing the opening session of the two-day summit . " we need to find common ground .
i 'm not without hope , " she added . the 27 heads of state and government resolved to seek a compromise deal on friday morning . the main sticking point to the plan , which aims to reduce emissions of the greenhouse gases that cause global warming , centered on some member countries ' reluctance to agree to firm goals for the future use of renewable energy . merkel , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency , wants the 27-nation bloc to commit to a binding target that 20 percent of eu energy needs should be met by renewable sources by 2020 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel wants the eu to lead the way on green issues " we talked about specific obligations - increasing energy efficiency , biofuels , renewable energy .
there is a need for further discussion on these three areas , " said merkel .
" some member states were asking : ' are we really going to achieve these goals ? " ' she added . in an effort to limit the rise in average global temperatures to two degrees celsius above pre-industrial era levels , the eu leaders are being asked to commit to cut carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- emissions by 20 percent by 2020 , from 1990 levels .
plenty of haggling ahead to entice the rest of the world to take bigger steps , the eu will offer to slash the emissions by a further 10 percent if nations like the united states , china and india also agree to take concrete steps . if a deal is reached friday there is still plenty of haggling ahead on what measures each eu nation will have to take to achieve the 20 percent average in co2 cuts . the eu member states have some time to make those decisions , as the kyoto protocol on climate change lays down targets until 2012 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : newer eu member states are reliant on carbon-heavy fuels like coal the eu hopes that a strong initiative here will provide impetus for the next g8 summit of industrialized nations in germany in june . before the summit began , merkel warned that the eu 's credibility hung on the bloc 's ability to agree on specific , long term goals for fighting global warming that other nations could emulate . " we can not say we came to a conclusion , " european commission president jose manuel barroso told a press conference after the leaders held talks over dinner , " but i really believe a consensus is emerging . " divergent views but while everyone agreed on the need to cut emissions , views obviously diverged on how to achieve this . some newer eu members like the czech republic , hungary and poland depend heavily on carbon-heavy fuels like coal , and oppose setting a mandatory target for the use of renewable energy sources . " the plans are too ambitious in the years to come for poland , " polish president lech kaczynski said .
" if we have a flexible approach ... then a compromise solution would be possible . " at the other end of the spectrum lay denmark , which claims that its economy has thrived even as it moves to newer , more sustainable energy sources . " i think the european union should go green and to that end we need binding targets , " said danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen . embracing nuclear power ? france has said that it would accept the use of the word " binding , " but in return french president jacques chirac has demanded that nuclear energy be brought into the plan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel appeared ready to give in to chirac on nuclear energy merkel said that atomic power , which meets 40 percent of french energy needs , could be included in the eu 's ambitious scheme to reduce carbon emissions . " this overall reduction of 20 percent will also depend on the question of how to use cleaner coal technology , it could possibly include nuclear energy , " she conceded . german officials were preparing a new draft document for the leaders to consider again early friday , when they gather at european council headquarters from 10:00 cet . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german carmakers rev up effort to enter hybrid market amid increasing consumer awareness of global warming and other environmental issues , german carmakers have had to fight off growing criticism about their apparent lack of will to build environmentally friendly cars .

" there is no agreement as yet .
we 've all got to show a little patience , " german chancellor angela merkel told reporters late thursday after chairing the opening session of the two-day summit . " we need to find common ground .
i 'm not without hope , " she added . the 27 heads of state and government resolved to seek a compromise deal on friday morning . the main sticking point to the plan , which aims to reduce emissions of the greenhouse gases that cause global warming , centered on some member countries ' reluctance to agree to firm goals for the future use of renewable energy . merkel , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency , wants the 27-nation bloc to commit to a binding target that 20 percent of eu energy needs should be met by renewable sources by 2020 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel wants the eu to lead the way on green issues " we talked about specific obligations - increasing energy efficiency , biofuels , renewable energy .
there is a need for further discussion on these three areas , " said merkel .
" some member states were asking : ' are we really going to achieve these goals ? " ' she added . in an effort to limit the rise in average global temperatures to two degrees celsius above pre-industrial era levels , the eu leaders are being asked to commit to cut carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- emissions by 20 percent by 2020 , from 1990 levels .
plenty of haggling ahead to entice the rest of the world to take bigger steps , the eu will offer to slash the emissions by a further 10 percent if nations like the united states , china and india also agree to take concrete steps . if a deal is reached friday there is still plenty of haggling ahead on what measures each eu nation will have to take to achieve the 20 percent average in co2 cuts . the eu member states have some time to make those decisions , as the kyoto protocol on climate change lays down targets until 2012 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : newer eu member states are reliant on carbon-heavy fuels like coal the eu hopes that a strong initiative here will provide impetus for the next g8 summit of industrialized nations in germany in june . before the summit began , merkel warned that the eu 's credibility hung on the bloc 's ability to agree on specific , long term goals for fighting global warming that other nations could emulate . " we can not say we came to a conclusion , " european commission president jose manuel barroso told a press conference after the leaders held talks over dinner , " but i really believe a consensus is emerging . " divergent views but while everyone agreed on the need to cut emissions , views obviously diverged on how to achieve this . some newer eu members like the czech republic , hungary and poland depend heavily on carbon-heavy fuels like coal , and oppose setting a mandatory target for the use of renewable energy sources . " the plans are too ambitious in the years to come for poland , " polish president lech kaczynski said .
" if we have a flexible approach ... then a compromise solution would be possible . " at the other end of the spectrum lay denmark , which claims that its economy has thrived even as it moves to newer , more sustainable energy sources . " i think the european union should go green and to that end we need binding targets , " said danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen . embracing nuclear power ? france has said that it would accept the use of the word " binding , " but in return french president jacques chirac has demanded that nuclear energy be brought into the plan .

" there is no agreement as yet .
we 've all got to show a little patience , " german chancellor angela merkel told reporters late thursday after chairing the opening session of the two-day summit . " we need to find common ground .
i 'm not without hope , " she added . the 27 heads of state and government resolved to seek a compromise deal on friday morning . the main sticking point to the plan , which aims to reduce emissions of the greenhouse gases that cause global warming , centered on some member countries ' reluctance to agree to firm goals for the future use of renewable energy . merkel , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency , wants the 27-nation bloc to commit to a binding target that 20 percent of eu energy needs should be met by renewable sources by 2020 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel wants the eu to lead the way on green issues " we talked about specific obligations - increasing energy efficiency , biofuels , renewable energy .
there is a need for further discussion on these three areas , " said merkel .
" some member states were asking : ' are we really going to achieve these goals ? " ' she added . in an effort to limit the rise in average global temperatures to two degrees celsius above pre-industrial era levels , the eu leaders are being asked to commit to cut carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- emissions by 20 percent by 2020 , from 1990 levels .
plenty of haggling ahead to entice the rest of the world to take bigger steps , the eu will offer to slash the emissions by a further 10 percent if nations like the united states , china and india also agree to take concrete steps . if a deal is reached friday there is still plenty of haggling ahead on what measures each eu nation will have to take to achieve the 20 percent average in co2 cuts . the eu member states have some time to make those decisions , as the kyoto protocol on climate change lays down targets until 2012 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : newer eu member states are reliant on carbon-heavy fuels like coal the eu hopes that a strong initiative here will provide impetus for the next g8 summit of industrialized nations in germany in june . before the summit began , merkel warned that the eu 's credibility hung on the bloc 's ability to agree on specific , long term goals for fighting global warming that other nations could emulate . " we can not say we came to a conclusion , " european commission president jose manuel barroso told a press conference after the leaders held talks over dinner , " but i really believe a consensus is emerging . " divergent views but while everyone agreed on the need to cut emissions , views obviously diverged on how to achieve this . some newer eu members like the czech republic , hungary and poland depend heavily on carbon-heavy fuels like coal , and oppose setting a mandatory target for the use of renewable energy sources . " the plans are too ambitious in the years to come for poland , " polish president lech kaczynski said .
" if we have a flexible approach ... then a compromise solution would be possible . " at the other end of the spectrum lay denmark , which claims that its economy has thrived even as it moves to newer , more sustainable energy sources .

the row is raging against a backdrop of terrible losses airbus parent company eads had more bad news for its sick aviation subsidiary when the first operating loss in its history was announced .
this was compounded by new , related tensions between germany and france . airbus parent company eads reported on thursday that its ailing aviation subsidiary , currently in turmoil over job cuts and delays to its new flagship a380 superjumbo , suffered its first-ever operating loss of 572 million euros -lrb- $ 752 million -rrb- in 2006 and was expected to suffer further losses in 2007 . the restructuring costs for airbus ' a380 superjumbo have been cited as the main cause for the forecasted " substantial " operating loss for 2007 along with the problems arising from the adaptation of the popular a350 to the upgraded a350xwb jet .
in 2005 , airbus achieved a profit of 2.3 billion euros . eads announced at the presentation of its annual results in munich that net profit for 2006 plunged to 99 million euros from 1.8 billion euros the previous year .
operating profit before interest and tax slumped from 2.9 billion euros in 2005 to 399 million euros last year , the company added . the drop in profits came despite a 15 percent increase in revenue from 34.2 billion euros to 39.4 billion euros . airbus is currently undergoing a restructuring program , which is expected to result in the loss of 10,000 jobs and the selling off of factories . restructuring a priority , say chiefs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : louis gallois eads co-chairmen louis gallois and thomas enders said friday that implementation of the restructuring program had utmost priority despite the horrendous financial report .
they said the company needed to improve its operating performance , regain the confidence of clients and turn itself into a lean , dynamic operation . one of the main aspects eads is looking into in terms of streamlining is the abolition of a two-headed senior management team .
earlier this week , both gallois and enders said in separate statements that the current system was too cumbersome and that the company would benefit from a single president rather than the split role of the two co-chairmen . on friday , the german government announced that it was open to the idea of doing away with the long-standing practice of having twin french and german chief executives at eads . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's thomas enders wants a single eads chief berlin 's coordinator for aeronautics , peter hintze , told members of parliament on thursday that the european aerospace giant could instead distribute posts lower down in the leadership ranks equally between french and german nationals to maintain the power balance . until now the european aeronautic defense and space company has always had a french and a german co-chief executive . simmering row over franco-german ownership if eads were to appoint a single company head , problems would surely arise as to the nationality of the chairman .
if either gallois nor enders were to be appointed sole chief , the simmering animosity between france and germany would surely erupt , with the country losing its chairman also perceivably losing a considerable amount of influence in the company . the current conflict between the two countries over eads bubbled to the surface again on thursday after french finance minister thierry breton said his country should have taken a bigger share in airbus parent eads at the firm 's creation . hintze responded to breton 's claim by saying germany would ensure the even balance between the countries would remain . shift in french power rejected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france allegedly wanted more power at airbus hq " when the french finance minister , breton , ... called on french radio for the 50-50 relationship between germany and france to change to 60-40 in france 's favor , i can reject that emphatically in the name of the german government , " hintze said in a fiery speech to the bundestag . hintze accused breton of seeking to disrupt the delicate balance between the two countries that has existed since eads was formed in july 2000 . the french finance ministry replied to the german outburst hours later , denying that breton had ever called for a rebalancing of the french and german shareholdings .
the ministry said breton had only been referring to the origins of the pact in the radio interview . dw staff / afp / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de airbus crisis deepens as france , germany fight over job cuts troubled european airplane maker airbus faced worsening problems tuesday as germany and france , who jointly control the company , wrangled over the distribution of thousands of job cuts .

" pakistan is the preferred destination of terrorists , " hanning said , referring to one of the factors that went into the decision not to allow kurnaz back into germany . during his own testimony on thursday , current bnd head ernst uhrlau , the former secret services coordinator , supported hanning 's evaluation of kurnaz . peculiar spot for quran study bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uhrlau questioned the location kurnaz chose for his study of the quran " the pakistani-afghan border region is not the right spot for peaceful study of the quran , " uhrlau said .
kurnaz has said he had traveled to pakistan to study the quran . a turkish national born in bremen , kurnaz was released from the us military prison at guantanamo bay in cuba in 2006 without being charged , after chancellor angela merkel raised the issue with us president george w. bush .
kurnaz was taken prisoner by american forces in pakistan in 2001 . hanning did not criticize the chancellor 's decision to intervene for " humanitarian reasons " and told the inquiry panel that the circumstances of kurnaz ' imprisonment could be seen in a different light when merkel intervened . did germany do enough for kurnaz ? as former chancellor gerhard schröder 's chief of staff , steinmeier was ultimately responsible for intelligence matters and the kurnaz case has been a stone around his neck as media have reported that germany refused to accept a us offer to release kurnaz in 2002 .
both steinmeier and kurnaz have said no such offer was ever put on the table . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurnaz was released from guantanamo bay in 2006 hanning told parliamentarians that steinmeier was privy to all pertinent information concerning kurnaz . " all of the relevant facts were certainly presented , " hanning said of his meetings with steinmeier .
" my impression was that the intelligence service 's collected knowledge was presented to him . " steinmeier to testify in march during his testimony hanning also disputed the conclusions reached by intelligence service agents who , after interrogating him at guantanamo bay , said kurnaz was taken prisoner for " being in the wrong place at the wrong time . " hanning called their conclusion " flawed and unprofessional " because it did not take into account information from the bremen state interior ministry the investigatory committee delayed hearing testimony from steinmeier by a week , to march 29 , after bremen 's interior ministry unexpectedly released documents needed for the inquiry .

they want to draw attention to the fates of people like florian blitzer - a 42-year-old roofer who says even the current retirement age of 65 is virtually impossible to achieve . " as a roofer you spend your entire working life standing or kneeling on sloping surfaces , " blitzer says .
" this is bound to damage your knee and hip joints after a number of years making it impossible to work for so long . " however , under the new law , adopted by the bundestag on friday , everyone seeking retirement earlier than 67 will face a monthly pension cut of 0.3 percent . amelie buntenbach , a trade union official , says the measure will not help to solve the pension funding crisis as a result of a rapidly aging population . " there is enormous fear among people here that they will become dependent on welfare payments because they won ’ t be able to work or find a job at that age , " buntenbach said .
" they are afraid of having to use up all their savings before retirement , thus ending up in social hardship . " not enough jobs to go around in germany so far , companies made use of generous state-funded early retirement schemes to shed millions of older staff .

" in my company , we ’ ve started this process and older employees say they feel happy and fit enough to be able to work until retirement .

großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women still need to fight discrimination at work women need to think bigger when it comes to their demands , argues faith dennis on international women 's day .
and they need to stop imitating men and make it their own way . yesterday was march the 8th , international woman ’ s day .
i was my home from having dinner with a friend when i came across a police car with flashing lights blocking off a busy street in kreuzberg , where i live .
an accident was my first thought , until i spotted a riot van , and group of 20 women staging a demonstration , surrounded by an even smaller bunch of , mostly male , onlookers .
i , too , thought i would stop and have a look to see what exactly they were protesting against , although assuming it would be quite obvious , given it was woman ’ s day and their banners all had the female symbol painted on them . where 's the power struggle ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is it time to stop playing by male rules ?
stepping closer , however , i noticed the slogan in big letters across the main fabric banner , which said : “ wir geben die macht nicht auf ! ” which translates as “ we won ’ t give up power . ”
this i didn ’ t quite understand - “ we want more power ” would have made more sense , surely ?
is there a power struggle at the top that i am not aware of ?
germany does have a female chancellor and good equal opportunity initiatives in the realm of business , but as far as i understand , the problems in equality are often glossed over by reports in the media that show rising figures of women in employment , rather than illustrating the difference in salaries between men and woman working in the same jobs .
in germany , women still earn 22 percent less than their male counterparts in the same positions . women struggle to be themselves in business woman in high level management positions are also harder to find and when women do reach the top , it is usually through major sacrifices .
i am not just talking about sacrifices in their family and home lives , but rather sacrifices in their very " being , " to put it philosophically . a prime example of this is a newspaper article i read recently about women taking the male hormone testosterone in order to be able to be more aggressive and " manly " in the workplace to be able to keep hold of their positions of power .
one woman admitted that she knew the drug was having harmful physical side effects , but stated it was the only way she could receive the desired recognition she felt she needed to survive in a male working environment . stop trying to be one of the boys bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hegel has the answers !
hegel , one of the founding fathers of social theory , states that all desires are based on a desire for recognition , and it is only through this experience of recognition that we can become socially viable human beings .
however , in the above case and many others , this recognition is based on being " manly " or having " masculine traits . "
the norm is thus set by homogeneity , excluding not just for women , but also for anyone who falls outside the " manly " category .
until we can find a formula for success in business which is non-gender specific , women should not be concerned with " giving up power , " but pointing out that power can achieved through embracing the differences between men and women as positive attributes and a viable alternative to the current ideal . faith dennis send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de read faith 's earlier columns shop ‘ til you bop faith never was a big fan of buying used knick-knacks and antiques - until she visited a unique night-time flea market in berlin kreuzberg .

großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women still need to fight discrimination at work women need to think bigger when it comes to their demands , argues faith dennis on international women 's day .
and they need to stop imitating men and make it their own way . yesterday was march the 8th , international woman ’ s day .
i was my home from having dinner with a friend when i came across a police car with flashing lights blocking off a busy street in kreuzberg , where i live .
an accident was my first thought , until i spotted a riot van , and group of 20 women staging a demonstration , surrounded by an even smaller bunch of , mostly male , onlookers .
i , too , thought i would stop and have a look to see what exactly they were protesting against , although assuming it would be quite obvious , given it was woman ’ s day and their banners all had the female symbol painted on them . where 's the power struggle ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is it time to stop playing by male rules ?
stepping closer , however , i noticed the slogan in big letters across the main fabric banner , which said : “ wir geben die macht nicht auf ! ” which translates as “ we won ’ t give up power . ”
this i didn ’ t quite understand - “ we want more power ” would have made more sense , surely ?
is there a power struggle at the top that i am not aware of ?
germany does have a female chancellor and good equal opportunity initiatives in the realm of business , but as far as i understand , the problems in equality are often glossed over by reports in the media that show rising figures of women in employment , rather than illustrating the difference in salaries between men and woman working in the same jobs .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 09.03.2007 eu climate deal gets guarded welcome from greens , industry großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the eu 's biggest success was setting a 20 percent target for renewable energy environmentalists and europe 's renewable energies industry gave a cool reception on friday to plans by eu leaders to step up action against global warming and accelerate the use of clean energy . in a two-day summit in brussels , the 27-nation european union committed itself to reducing its levels of the principal greenhouse gas , carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- , by 20 percent by 2020 compared with 1990 levels . the eu would deepen this cut to 30 percent if " international partners " in global warming negotiations did likewise , said german chancellor angela merkel , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency . member states will also be required to make renewable energies such as solar and wind account for at least 20 percent of the total energy consumption across the eu by 2020 . putting words into action green activists said the 2020 co2 goal was worthy but that the rhetoric had to underpinned by action . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carbon dioxide is a serious threat to the enviornment some noted that the eu was already having big problems meeting its far smaller goals for 2012 under the un 's kyoto protocol pact for curbing co2 and other climate-changing gases . " it is clear that the targets decided today will only be achieved with solid laws , measures and incentives , " said stephan singer , head of the european climate and energy unit at environmental group wwf . " there are only 13 years for the eu to accomplish the mission defined today .
these years are key to help saving the planet from the dangerous consequences of climate change , " singer said . too timid or too ambitious ? friends of the earth europe -lrb- foee -rrb- derided the 20 percent target as too timid and unlikely to encourage other big polluters to follow suit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the us follow the european example ?
" it will be interesting to see the eu trying to persuade -lrb- us -rrb- president -lrb- george -rrb- bush that he should reduce america 's emissions by 30 percent by 2020 compared to 1990 levels , when eu leaders cowered away from adopting such a target for themselves today , " foee climate campaigner jan kowalzig said in a press release . eliot diringer , director of international strategies at the pew center on global climate change , a us thinktank , said by dangling the offer of a 30-percent cut , the eu faced being accused of grandstanding . " there 's a good deal of skepticism -lrb- in washington -rrb- about whether the eu is on track for meeting its commitments for 2012 , " he said in an interview with afp . " their ambitious 2020 numbers are more credible if the perception is that they are indeed on track to meet their 2012 target .
it 's a big stretch that they 're proposing -lrb- with the 2020 goal -rrb- .
there 's a lot of things that have to happen between now and 2012 to make the -lrb- eu 's kyoto -rrb- commitment a reality , " diringer said . " a real opportunity " the 20-percent renewables target was hailed by the european wind energy association -lrb- ewea -rrb- as a " real opportunity " to switch to clean sources and ease eu dependence on unpredictable sources of foreign energy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu would like to rely less on russian gas imports " such a supply structure would benefit our economy , environment , companies and the welfare of european citizens for decades to come , " ewea 's chief executive officer , christian kjaer said . but , he cautioned , these benefits would only be achieved if eu countries broke up monopoly ownership of electricity transmission and production , so that renewables entering the energy market got fair access to the supply grid . creating jobs along the way andre antolini , president of france 's renewable energies association , said that , at present , renewables had an average share of 6.75 percent of the eu energy market .
the eu has a non-binding goal of 12 percent by 2010 . " the share has not progressed for years , " antolini said .
" in some countries , there has been a substantial rise , but in terms of the overall eu share , this has been almost cancelled out by a corresponding increase in energy consumption . " to attain 20 percent meant tripling renewables ' present share , which means lowering fossil-fuel use through greater use of rail and water transport for freight and use of biofuels and biomass for heating apartment blocks and offices , he said . antolini also predicted the 2020 target would be a huge job creator . " renewable energies have already generated 200,000 jobs in the eu , even though their share is below seven percent , " he said . dw staff / afp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu clinches climate deal , but hard work yet to come european union leaders clinched a wide-ranging climate change accord on friday but postponed the thorny task of setting mandatory renewable energy goals for each member country to meet .
-lrb- 09.03.2007 -rrb- eu leaders seek to break deadlock on climate change deal eu leaders hope to seal a landmark agreement on tackling climate change on friday , after a row over setting binding targets for renewable energy scuppered their first attempt at a summit in brussels .
-lrb- 09.03.2007 -rrb- eu urged to take lead on battling climate change at a summit starting thursday , the european union will seek to thrash out a common policy in fighting climate change , with plans to set tough targets for cutting carbon dioxide emissions .

the cartographic neutrality of the land mass , shaped like a bread crust lying in a soup of venetian canals , does not betray the cramped conditions under which jews once lived . " i have to research myself if there were jews living there at the time of the second world war , and if they got deported , as well as finding the names and dates , " says mrs. hoffmann . " we ’ re not sure if everything is recorded , either , " mr. hoffmann adds .
" germans like to write everything down , but other countries might not have . " he is referring to the astoundingly precise german documentation of their crimes , right down to careful inventories of homes from which jews were deported . " be sure you know why " despite this tactical obstacle , the hoffmanns believe strongly that in what they are doing , stating emphatically that only by remembering can one avoid repeating past mistakes .
when asked how they would advise someone planning to sponsor a stone , their message is clear , " be sure you know why you are doing it . " interested in sponsoring a stumbling-stone where you live ? many -lrb- german and austrian -rrb- cities have coordination centers ; call the mayor ’ s office or district office -lrb- bezirksamt -rrb- to inquire . * names have been changed at the request of the sponsors , who want more people to know about the stumbling-stones yet prefer not to receive undue attention for simply doing what they consider the right thing . arden pennell send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de read arden pennell 's earlier columns rational disdain for distant relatives americans and europeans are n't quite as different as people think , wrote arden pennell .

but you ca n't say the germans are not trying . placing last in the eurovision song contest is a humiliation that european countries try to avoid like the plague .
germany knows how high the pressure is - especially after its 2005 entry " hide and run " suffered the ignominious fate of placing last with only four sympathy points from monaco and moldova . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jane comerford and texas lightning brought country music to the german charts last year , germany decided to shake things up a bit in europe 's favorite singing contest .
the catchy , though slightly off-the-path , country-western song " no no never " - performed by an aging australian-born singer whose name is not kylie minogue and a band that calls itself texas lightning - was the first grand prix competitor in 50 years that featured an ukulele , a singing lady in pink waving an imaginary lasso and a group of musicians who would eventually be declared honorary citizens of texas by the lonestar state 's own senate . europe was confused .
it voted for lordi - a finnish heavy-metal / horror-film freak show instead .
germany came 15th . healing wounds this is a big year for germany .
with angela merkel heading the eu 's rotating presidency as well as the g8 and fond memories of the world cup success , this would be a perfect time for germany to flex its pop muscles and show some talent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lordi 's song ' ' hard rock hallelujah " won the 2006 eurovision song contest but eurovision is not meant to be enjoyed lightly .
an endless parade of songs followed by an equally never-ending voting process is what makes eurovision a truly unique event - part circus act , part masochism feast . germany , however , organized a national competition in which only three songs were allowed to participate .
putting aside the fact that choosing between three songs on thursday evening resembled elections under a communist dictatorship - put a red star next to the name of the communist party candidate that you think our glorious leader fancies the most - the entire spectacle felt like an one-sentence version of anna karenina : " she was unhappy and jumped under the train . " winners and losers in this unusual eins-zwei-drei affair , two candidates - a 50 year-old-rocker called heinz rudolf kunze and this year 's winners of germany 's popular casting show " popstars , " a girlband called " monrose " - came out as losers .
surely , nobody stamped a big " l " on their foreheads , but pursed mouths and teary eyes after the viewers ' voting results were announced were telling enough . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the monrose girls were let down by their teenage fans heinz rudolf kunze never stood a chance , because , deep down , germans knew that europe was never going to accept a rocker called heinz rudolf .
heinz sounds like mayonnaise and rudolf sounds like a reindeer , not exactly the stuff that rock-and-roll rebels are made of . but where were all those thousands of teenagers who overcharged their cell phones by voting repeatedly during the popstars finals ?
german teenagers are either not very-well acquainted with the country 's public broadcaster ard - the german home of eurovision and other quality programs - or they were too busy watching germany 's next top model - a casting show hosted by supermodel heidi klum on a competing private tv channel . locked-up kids ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roger cicero asked german parents to keep their kids away from their cell phones or maybe german parents listened to the third candidate - 36-year-old jazz singer roger cicero - who pleaded with them in his promotional video to keep the children away from their cell phones .
he thought - like everybody else - that the girlband 's obsessive-compulsive fan base would be a serious threat . it is not clear whether german teenagers ended up grounded , locked up and deprived of their cellular alter egos .
but roger cicero 's swing hit " frauen regieren die welt " -lrb- women rule the world -rrb- reaped all the bouquets on the eve of the international women 's day - surprisingly , but refreshingly so . so here we go again .
germany is experimenting .
it 's playing with eurovision fire .

but you ca n't say the germans are not trying . placing last in the eurovision song contest is a humiliation that european countries try to avoid like the plague .
germany knows how high the pressure is - especially after its 2005 entry " hide and run " suffered the ignominious fate of placing last with only four sympathy points from monaco and moldova . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jane comerford and texas lightning brought country music to the german charts last year , germany decided to shake things up a bit in europe 's favorite singing contest .
the catchy , though slightly off-the-path , country-western song " no no never " - performed by an aging australian-born singer whose name is not kylie minogue and a band that calls itself texas lightning - was the first grand prix competitor in 50 years that featured an ukulele , a singing lady in pink waving an imaginary lasso and a group of musicians who would eventually be declared honorary citizens of texas by the lonestar state 's own senate . europe was confused .
it voted for lordi - a finnish heavy-metal / horror-film freak show instead .
germany came 15th . healing wounds this is a big year for germany .
with angela merkel heading the eu 's rotating presidency as well as the g8 and fond memories of the world cup success , this would be a perfect time for germany to flex its pop muscles and show some talent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lordi 's song ' ' hard rock hallelujah " won the 2006 eurovision song contest but eurovision is not meant to be enjoyed lightly .
an endless parade of songs followed by an equally never-ending voting process is what makes eurovision a truly unique event - part circus act , part masochism feast . germany , however , organized a national competition in which only three songs were allowed to participate .
putting aside the fact that choosing between three songs on thursday evening resembled elections under a communist dictatorship - put a red star next to the name of the communist party candidate that you think our glorious leader fancies the most - the entire spectacle felt like an one-sentence version of anna karenina : " she was unhappy and jumped under the train . " winners and losers in this unusual eins-zwei-drei affair , two candidates - a 50 year-old-rocker called heinz rudolf kunze and this year 's winners of germany 's popular casting show " popstars , " a girlband called " monrose " - came out as losers .
surely , nobody stamped a big " l " on their foreheads , but pursed mouths and teary eyes after the viewers ' voting results were announced were telling enough . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the monrose girls were let down by their teenage fans heinz rudolf kunze never stood a chance , because , deep down , germans knew that europe was never going to accept a rocker called heinz rudolf .
heinz sounds like mayonnaise and rudolf sounds like a reindeer , not exactly the stuff that rock-and-roll rebels are made of . but where were all those thousands of teenagers who overcharged their cell phones by voting repeatedly during the popstars finals ?
german teenagers are either not very-well acquainted with the country 's public broadcaster ard - the german home of eurovision and other quality programs - or they were too busy watching germany 's next top model - a casting show hosted by supermodel heidi klum on a competing private tv channel . locked-up kids ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roger cicero asked german parents to keep their kids away from their cell phones or maybe german parents listened to the third candidate - 36-year-old jazz singer roger cicero - who pleaded with them in his promotional video to keep the children away from their cell phones .
he thought - like everybody else - that the girlband 's obsessive-compulsive fan base would be a serious threat . it is not clear whether german teenagers ended up grounded , locked up and deprived of their cellular alter egos .
but roger cicero 's swing hit " frauen regieren die welt " -lrb- women rule the world -rrb- reaped all the bouquets on the eve of the international women 's day - surprisingly , but refreshingly so . so here we go again .
germany is experimenting .
it 's playing with eurovision fire .
but who knows ?
swing may end up marching where country music was not allowed to tread .
after all , stranger things have happened in the wacky world of eurotrash glamor .
just look at the finns . toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the best of " from the fringe " germany is certainly facing serious problems , but it 's also important not to forget to laugh once in a while .
read up on a selection on recent articles about funny events in germany .
-lrb- 09.03.2007 -rrb- finnish monster rockers conquer eurovision finnish heavy metal band lordi kept their promise to " bring rock to eurovision " , handing their country its first title in the annual song contest 's 51-year history with an explosive victory in athens early sunday .

they want to draw attention to the fates of people like florian blitzer - a 42-year-old roofer who says even the current retirement age of 65 is virtually impossible to achieve . " as a roofer you spend your entire working life standing or kneeling on sloping surfaces , " blitzer says .
" this is bound to damage your knee and hip joints after a number of years making it impossible to work for so long . " however , under the new law , adopted by the bundestag on friday , everyone seeking retirement earlier than 67 will face a monthly pension cut of 0.3 percent . amelie buntenbach , a trade union official , says the measure will not help to solve the pension funding crisis as a result of a rapidly aging population . " there is enormous fear among people here that they will become dependent on welfare payments because they won ’ t be able to work or find a job at that age , " buntenbach said .
" they are afraid of having to use up all their savings before retirement , thus ending up in social hardship . " not enough jobs to go around in germany so far , companies made use of generous state-funded early retirement schemes to shed millions of older staff .

but you ca n't say the germans are not trying . placing last in the eurovision song contest is a humiliation that european countries try to avoid like the plague .

it voted for lordi - a finnish heavy-metal / horror-film freak show instead .
germany came 15th . healing wounds this is a big year for germany .
with angela merkel heading the eu 's rotating presidency as well as the g8 and fond memories of the world cup success , this would be a perfect time for germany to flex its pop muscles and show some talent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lordi 's song ' ' hard rock hallelujah " won the 2006 eurovision song contest but eurovision is not meant to be enjoyed lightly .
an endless parade of songs followed by an equally never-ending voting process is what makes eurovision a truly unique event - part circus act , part masochism feast . germany , however , organized a national competition in which only three songs were allowed to participate .
putting aside the fact that choosing between three songs on thursday evening resembled elections under a communist dictatorship - put a red star next to the name of the communist party candidate that you think our glorious leader fancies the most - the entire spectacle felt like an one-sentence version of anna karenina : " she was unhappy and jumped under the train .

heinz sounds like mayonnaise and rudolf sounds like a reindeer , not exactly the stuff that rock-and-roll rebels are made of . but where were all those thousands of teenagers who overcharged their cell phones by voting repeatedly during the popstars finals ?
german teenagers are either not very-well acquainted with the country 's public broadcaster ard - the german home of eurovision and other quality programs - or they were too busy watching germany 's next top model - a casting show hosted by supermodel heidi klum on a competing private tv channel . locked-up kids ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roger cicero asked german parents to keep their kids away from their cell phones or maybe german parents listened to the third candidate - 36-year-old jazz singer roger cicero - who pleaded with them in his promotional video to keep the children away from their cell phones .
he thought - like everybody else - that the girlband 's obsessive-compulsive fan base would be a serious threat . it is not clear whether german teenagers ended up grounded , locked up and deprived of their cellular alter egos .
but roger cicero 's swing hit " frauen regieren die welt " -lrb- women rule the world -rrb- reaped all the bouquets on the eve of the international women 's day - surprisingly , but refreshingly so . so here we go again .

" you can " stumble " anytime and anywhere in berlin . whether stepping out to pick up a carton of milk or on the way home from work , you ’ re bound to notice the " stumbling-stones " -lrb- stolpersteine -rrb- , small brass-capped squares laid flush with berlin ’ s stone sidewalks . one stumbles psychologically , not literally , for inscribed into their surface is the name , and - as far as is known - the dates of birth , deportation , and death of a former jewish inhabitant of the dwelling alongside the stone . the brainchild of artist gunter demnig , the miniature memorials must be privately sponsored at a cost of roughly 95 euros -lrb- $ 125 -rrb- and have caught on as an effective way to personalize the enormity of the holocaust . after " stumbling " dozens of times over berlin ’ s roughly 900 miniature memorials , i became eager to talk to individuals who funded the stones , which are created and inlaid by the artist himself . a phone call to my neighborhood ’ s stumbling-stone coordination center puts me in touch with a local couple .
i am set to meet sponsors of the latest memory trend . pasta and the past richard and elke hoffmann * greet me at one of berlin ’ s thousand cheap italian restaurants , chosen so we could talk at length without worrying someone else will be waiting for our table . the conversation quickly turns from vodka penne to vergangenheitsbewältigung , or " coming to terms with the past . " mr. hoffmann believes in the controversial " collective guilt " theory popularized after a 1981 speech by israeli prime minister menachem begin . the theory holds that all germans as an entire people are guilty for the crimes of nazi germany . a prevailing counter to the " collective guilt " theory runs that german society is not collectively guilty but rather collectively responsible ; as witnesses to the terrible history and heirs to its consequences , they can help ensure it does not happen again . while mr. hoffmann agrees with this responsibility , he nonetheless sees the nation as categorically culpable , a feeling that informed his desire to sponsor a stumbling-stone . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : artist gunter demnig produces the stones " with this stone , i ’ m accepting a small piece of the guilt of our people .
the guilt that i inherited . i take on this guilt in recognition of the terrible crimes we have committed , " he explains to me slowly and carefully , as though describing a logical proof . a shocking bakery visit mrs. hoffmann expands on their reasons , bringing up an incident from their 1974 trip to israel , when they stopped in a bakery for a snack . " i wanted to buy a pastry and the woman behind the counter had blue numbers tattooed here . " mrs. hoffmann points to her arm . " when she heard us speaking german she just gasped and then couldn ’ t breathe . she froze , completely transported by horrible memories . " this encounter with a concentration camp survivor stayed with mrs. hoffmann for decades .
" i had to face what my people did , " she says . " and for me , the stumbling-stone is a way of dealing with this .
it ’ s a small gesture of humanity towards the victims . " the hoffmanns ’ stumbling-stone commemorates an elderly woman deported to theresienstadt and killed in october 1942 .
it lies not far from our restaurant , where the woman resided at the time of deportation . laying more stones " we came upon them the same way you did , " explains mr. hoffmann .
" we noticed them here and there throughout the city , and at some point we thought , ‘ that ’ s something we ’ d like to do . we ’ d like to sponsor a stone . ’ " they were able to turn their desire into action when mrs. hoffmann read a newspaper article with information about the local office that coordinates with the artist . she called to inquire , and ten months later , the stone was set . the hoffmanns would like to do more . after reading about the former jewish neighborhood in venice , where the term " ghetto " originated , the idea of laying a stumbling-stone there appealed to them . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for sponsors , the stones offer a way to acknowledge past horrors mrs. hoffmann takes out a travel guide and opens to a map depicting giudecca island , former home of the giudei , or jews .
the cartographic neutrality of the land mass , shaped like a bread crust lying in a soup of venetian canals , does not betray the cramped conditions under which jews once lived . " i have to research myself if there were jews living there at the time of the second world war , and if they got deported , as well as finding the names and dates , " says mrs. hoffmann . " we ’ re not sure if everything is recorded , either , " mr. hoffmann adds .
" germans like to write everything down , but other countries might not have . " he is referring to the astoundingly precise german documentation of their crimes , right down to careful inventories of homes from which jews were deported . " be sure you know why " despite this tactical obstacle , the hoffmanns believe strongly that in what they are doing , stating emphatically that only by remembering can one avoid repeating past mistakes .
when asked how they would advise someone planning to sponsor a stone , their message is clear , " be sure you know why you are doing it . " interested in sponsoring a stumbling-stone where you live ? many -lrb- german and austrian -rrb- cities have coordination centers ; call the mayor ’ s office or district office -lrb- bezirksamt -rrb- to inquire . * names have been changed at the request of the sponsors , who want more people to know about the stumbling-stones yet prefer not to receive undue attention for simply doing what they consider the right thing . arden pennell send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de read arden pennell 's earlier columns rational disdain for distant relatives americans and europeans are n't quite as different as people think , wrote arden pennell .

großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women still need to fight discrimination at work women need to think bigger when it comes to their demands , argues faith dennis on international women 's day .
and they need to stop imitating men and make it their own way . yesterday was march the 8th , international woman ’ s day .
i was my home from having dinner with a friend when i came across a police car with flashing lights blocking off a busy street in kreuzberg , where i live .
an accident was my first thought , until i spotted a riot van , and group of 20 women staging a demonstration , surrounded by an even smaller bunch of , mostly male , onlookers .
i , too , thought i would stop and have a look to see what exactly they were protesting against , although assuming it would be quite obvious , given it was woman ’ s day and their banners all had the female symbol painted on them . where 's the power struggle ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is it time to stop playing by male rules ?
stepping closer , however , i noticed the slogan in big letters across the main fabric banner , which said : “ wir geben die macht nicht auf ! ” which translates as “ we won ’ t give up power . ”
this i didn ’ t quite understand - “ we want more power ” would have made more sense , surely ?
is there a power struggle at the top that i am not aware of ?
germany does have a female chancellor and good equal opportunity initiatives in the realm of business , but as far as i understand , the problems in equality are often glossed over by reports in the media that show rising figures of women in employment , rather than illustrating the difference in salaries between men and woman working in the same jobs .
in germany , women still earn 22 percent less than their male counterparts in the same positions . women struggle to be themselves in business woman in high level management positions are also harder to find and when women do reach the top , it is usually through major sacrifices .
i am not just talking about sacrifices in their family and home lives , but rather sacrifices in their very " being , " to put it philosophically . a prime example of this is a newspaper article i read recently about women taking the male hormone testosterone in order to be able to be more aggressive and " manly " in the workplace to be able to keep hold of their positions of power .
one woman admitted that she knew the drug was having harmful physical side effects , but stated it was the only way she could receive the desired recognition she felt she needed to survive in a male working environment . stop trying to be one of the boys bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hegel has the answers !
hegel , one of the founding fathers of social theory , states that all desires are based on a desire for recognition , and it is only through this experience of recognition that we can become socially viable human beings .
however , in the above case and many others , this recognition is based on being " manly " or having " masculine traits . "
the norm is thus set by homogeneity , excluding not just for women , but also for anyone who falls outside the " manly " category .
until we can find a formula for success in business which is non-gender specific , women should not be concerned with " giving up power , " but pointing out that power can achieved through embracing the differences between men and women as positive attributes and a viable alternative to the current ideal . faith dennis send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de read faith 's earlier columns shop ‘ til you bop faith never was a big fan of buying used knick-knacks and antiques - until she visited a unique night-time flea market in berlin kreuzberg .

i , too , thought i would stop and have a look to see what exactly they were protesting against , although assuming it would be quite obvious , given it was woman ’ s day and their banners all had the female symbol painted on them . where 's the power struggle ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is it time to stop playing by male rules ?
stepping closer , however , i noticed the slogan in big letters across the main fabric banner , which said : “ wir geben die macht nicht auf ! ” which translates as “ we won ’ t give up power . ”
this i didn ’ t quite understand - “ we want more power ” would have made more sense , surely ?
is there a power struggle at the top that i am not aware of ?

the norm is thus set by homogeneity , excluding not just for women , but also for anyone who falls outside the " manly " category .

but you ca n't say the germans are not trying . placing last in the eurovision song contest is a humiliation that european countries try to avoid like the plague .
germany knows how high the pressure is - especially after its 2005 entry " hide and run " suffered the ignominious fate of placing last with only four sympathy points from monaco and moldova . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jane comerford and texas lightning brought country music to the german charts last year , germany decided to shake things up a bit in europe 's favorite singing contest .
the catchy , though slightly off-the-path , country-western song " no no never " - performed by an aging australian-born singer whose name is not kylie minogue and a band that calls itself texas lightning - was the first grand prix competitor in 50 years that featured an ukulele , a singing lady in pink waving an imaginary lasso and a group of musicians who would eventually be declared honorary citizens of texas by the lonestar state 's own senate . europe was confused .
it voted for lordi - a finnish heavy-metal / horror-film freak show instead .
germany came 15th . healing wounds this is a big year for germany .
with angela merkel heading the eu 's rotating presidency as well as the g8 and fond memories of the world cup success , this would be a perfect time for germany to flex its pop muscles and show some talent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lordi 's song ' ' hard rock hallelujah " won the 2006 eurovision song contest but eurovision is not meant to be enjoyed lightly .
an endless parade of songs followed by an equally never-ending voting process is what makes eurovision a truly unique event - part circus act , part masochism feast . germany , however , organized a national competition in which only three songs were allowed to participate .
putting aside the fact that choosing between three songs on thursday evening resembled elections under a communist dictatorship - put a red star next to the name of the communist party candidate that you think our glorious leader fancies the most - the entire spectacle felt like an one-sentence version of anna karenina : " she was unhappy and jumped under the train . " winners and losers in this unusual eins-zwei-drei affair , two candidates - a 50 year-old-rocker called heinz rudolf kunze and this year 's winners of germany 's popular casting show " popstars , " a girlband called " monrose " - came out as losers .
surely , nobody stamped a big " l " on their foreheads , but pursed mouths and teary eyes after the viewers ' voting results were announced were telling enough . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the monrose girls were let down by their teenage fans heinz rudolf kunze never stood a chance , because , deep down , germans knew that europe was never going to accept a rocker called heinz rudolf .
heinz sounds like mayonnaise and rudolf sounds like a reindeer , not exactly the stuff that rock-and-roll rebels are made of . but where were all those thousands of teenagers who overcharged their cell phones by voting repeatedly during the popstars finals ?
german teenagers are either not very-well acquainted with the country 's public broadcaster ard - the german home of eurovision and other quality programs - or they were too busy watching germany 's next top model - a casting show hosted by supermodel heidi klum on a competing private tv channel . locked-up kids ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roger cicero asked german parents to keep their kids away from their cell phones or maybe german parents listened to the third candidate - 36-year-old jazz singer roger cicero - who pleaded with them in his promotional video to keep the children away from their cell phones .
he thought - like everybody else - that the girlband 's obsessive-compulsive fan base would be a serious threat . it is not clear whether german teenagers ended up grounded , locked up and deprived of their cellular alter egos .
but roger cicero 's swing hit " frauen regieren die welt " -lrb- women rule the world -rrb- reaped all the bouquets on the eve of the international women 's day - surprisingly , but refreshingly so . so here we go again .
germany is experimenting .
it 's playing with eurovision fire .
but who knows ?
swing may end up marching where country music was not allowed to tread .
after all , stranger things have happened in the wacky world of eurotrash glamor .
just look at the finns . toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the best of " from the fringe " germany is certainly facing serious problems , but it 's also important not to forget to laugh once in a while .

-lrb- 09.03.2007 -rrb- finnish monster rockers conquer eurovision finnish heavy metal band lordi kept their promise to " bring rock to eurovision " , handing their country its first title in the annual song contest 's 51-year history with an explosive victory in athens early sunday .

the catchy , though slightly off-the-path , country-western song " no no never " - performed by an aging australian-born singer whose name is not kylie minogue and a band that calls itself texas lightning - was the first grand prix competitor in 50 years that featured an ukulele , a singing lady in pink waving an imaginary lasso and a group of musicians who would eventually be declared honorary citizens of texas by the lonestar state 's own senate . europe was confused .
it voted for lordi - a finnish heavy-metal / horror-film freak show instead .
germany came 15th . healing wounds this is a big year for germany .
with angela merkel heading the eu 's rotating presidency as well as the g8 and fond memories of the world cup success , this would be a perfect time for germany to flex its pop muscles and show some talent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lordi 's song ' ' hard rock hallelujah " won the 2006 eurovision song contest but eurovision is not meant to be enjoyed lightly .
an endless parade of songs followed by an equally never-ending voting process is what makes eurovision a truly unique event - part circus act , part masochism feast . germany , however , organized a national competition in which only three songs were allowed to participate .
putting aside the fact that choosing between three songs on thursday evening resembled elections under a communist dictatorship - put a red star next to the name of the communist party candidate that you think our glorious leader fancies the most - the entire spectacle felt like an one-sentence version of anna karenina : " she was unhappy and jumped under the train . " winners and losers in this unusual eins-zwei-drei affair , two candidates - a 50 year-old-rocker called heinz rudolf kunze and this year 's winners of germany 's popular casting show " popstars , " a girlband called " monrose " - came out as losers .
surely , nobody stamped a big " l " on their foreheads , but pursed mouths and teary eyes after the viewers ' voting results were announced were telling enough . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the monrose girls were let down by their teenage fans heinz rudolf kunze never stood a chance , because , deep down , germans knew that europe was never going to accept a rocker called heinz rudolf .
heinz sounds like mayonnaise and rudolf sounds like a reindeer , not exactly the stuff that rock-and-roll rebels are made of . but where were all those thousands of teenagers who overcharged their cell phones by voting repeatedly during the popstars finals ?
german teenagers are either not very-well acquainted with the country 's public broadcaster ard - the german home of eurovision and other quality programs - or they were too busy watching germany 's next top model - a casting show hosted by supermodel heidi klum on a competing private tv channel . locked-up kids ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roger cicero asked german parents to keep their kids away from their cell phones or maybe german parents listened to the third candidate - 36-year-old jazz singer roger cicero - who pleaded with them in his promotional video to keep the children away from their cell phones .
he thought - like everybody else - that the girlband 's obsessive-compulsive fan base would be a serious threat . it is not clear whether german teenagers ended up grounded , locked up and deprived of their cellular alter egos .
but roger cicero 's swing hit " frauen regieren die welt " -lrb- women rule the world -rrb- reaped all the bouquets on the eve of the international women 's day - surprisingly , but refreshingly so . so here we go again .
germany is experimenting .
it 's playing with eurovision fire .
but who knows ?
swing may end up marching where country music was not allowed to tread .
after all , stranger things have happened in the wacky world of eurotrash glamor .
just look at the finns . toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the best of " from the fringe " germany is certainly facing serious problems , but it 's also important not to forget to laugh once in a while .

großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women still need to fight discrimination at work women need to think bigger when it comes to their demands , argues faith dennis on international women 's day .
and they need to stop imitating men and make it their own way . yesterday was march the 8th , international woman ’ s day .
i was my home from having dinner with a friend when i came across a police car with flashing lights blocking off a busy street in kreuzberg , where i live .
an accident was my first thought , until i spotted a riot van , and group of 20 women staging a demonstration , surrounded by an even smaller bunch of , mostly male , onlookers .
i , too , thought i would stop and have a look to see what exactly they were protesting against , although assuming it would be quite obvious , given it was woman ’ s day and their banners all had the female symbol painted on them . where 's the power struggle ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is it time to stop playing by male rules ?
stepping closer , however , i noticed the slogan in big letters across the main fabric banner , which said : “ wir geben die macht nicht auf ! ” which translates as “ we won ’ t give up power . ”
this i didn ’ t quite understand - “ we want more power ” would have made more sense , surely ?
is there a power struggle at the top that i am not aware of ?
germany does have a female chancellor and good equal opportunity initiatives in the realm of business , but as far as i understand , the problems in equality are often glossed over by reports in the media that show rising figures of women in employment , rather than illustrating the difference in salaries between men and woman working in the same jobs .
in germany , women still earn 22 percent less than their male counterparts in the same positions . women struggle to be themselves in business woman in high level management positions are also harder to find and when women do reach the top , it is usually through major sacrifices .
i am not just talking about sacrifices in their family and home lives , but rather sacrifices in their very " being , " to put it philosophically . a prime example of this is a newspaper article i read recently about women taking the male hormone testosterone in order to be able to be more aggressive and " manly " in the workplace to be able to keep hold of their positions of power .
one woman admitted that she knew the drug was having harmful physical side effects , but stated it was the only way she could receive the desired recognition she felt she needed to survive in a male working environment . stop trying to be one of the boys bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hegel has the answers !
hegel , one of the founding fathers of social theory , states that all desires are based on a desire for recognition , and it is only through this experience of recognition that we can become socially viable human beings .
however , in the above case and many others , this recognition is based on being " manly " or having " masculine traits . "
the norm is thus set by homogeneity , excluding not just for women , but also for anyone who falls outside the " manly " category .
until we can find a formula for success in business which is non-gender specific , women should not be concerned with " giving up power , " but pointing out that power can achieved through embracing the differences between men and women as positive attributes and a viable alternative to the current ideal . faith dennis send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de read faith 's earlier columns shop ‘ til you bop faith never was a big fan of buying used knick-knacks and antiques - until she visited a unique night-time flea market in berlin kreuzberg .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de news -pipe- 09.03.2007 germany swings around eurovision in surprising national final großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is sending a swing band to helsinki germany has never fully recovered from its 2005 eurovision debacle when it came last .
but you ca n't say the germans are not trying . placing last in the eurovision song contest is a humiliation that european countries try to avoid like the plague .
germany knows how high the pressure is - especially after its 2005 entry " hide and run " suffered the ignominious fate of placing last with only four sympathy points from monaco and moldova . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jane comerford and texas lightning brought country music to the german charts last year , germany decided to shake things up a bit in europe 's favorite singing contest .
the catchy , though slightly off-the-path , country-western song " no no never " - performed by an aging australian-born singer whose name is not kylie minogue and a band that calls itself texas lightning - was the first grand prix competitor in 50 years that featured an ukulele , a singing lady in pink waving an imaginary lasso and a group of musicians who would eventually be declared honorary citizens of texas by the lonestar state 's own senate . europe was confused .
it voted for lordi - a finnish heavy-metal / horror-film freak show instead .
germany came 15th . healing wounds this is a big year for germany .
with angela merkel heading the eu 's rotating presidency as well as the g8 and fond memories of the world cup success , this would be a perfect time for germany to flex its pop muscles and show some talent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lordi 's song ' ' hard rock hallelujah " won the 2006 eurovision song contest but eurovision is not meant to be enjoyed lightly .
an endless parade of songs followed by an equally never-ending voting process is what makes eurovision a truly unique event - part circus act , part masochism feast . germany , however , organized a national competition in which only three songs were allowed to participate .
putting aside the fact that choosing between three songs on thursday evening resembled elections under a communist dictatorship - put a red star next to the name of the communist party candidate that you think our glorious leader fancies the most - the entire spectacle felt like an one-sentence version of anna karenina : " she was unhappy and jumped under the train . " winners and losers in this unusual eins-zwei-drei affair , two candidates - a 50 year-old-rocker called heinz rudolf kunze and this year 's winners of germany 's popular casting show " popstars , " a girlband called " monrose " - came out as losers .
surely , nobody stamped a big " l " on their foreheads , but pursed mouths and teary eyes after the viewers ' voting results were announced were telling enough . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the monrose girls were let down by their teenage fans heinz rudolf kunze never stood a chance , because , deep down , germans knew that europe was never going to accept a rocker called heinz rudolf .
heinz sounds like mayonnaise and rudolf sounds like a reindeer , not exactly the stuff that rock-and-roll rebels are made of . but where were all those thousands of teenagers who overcharged their cell phones by voting repeatedly during the popstars finals ?
german teenagers are either not very-well acquainted with the country 's public broadcaster ard - the german home of eurovision and other quality programs - or they were too busy watching germany 's next top model - a casting show hosted by supermodel heidi klum on a competing private tv channel . locked-up kids ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roger cicero asked german parents to keep their kids away from their cell phones or maybe german parents listened to the third candidate - 36-year-old jazz singer roger cicero - who pleaded with them in his promotional video to keep the children away from their cell phones .
he thought - like everybody else - that the girlband 's obsessive-compulsive fan base would be a serious threat . it is not clear whether german teenagers ended up grounded , locked up and deprived of their cellular alter egos .
but roger cicero 's swing hit " frauen regieren die welt " -lrb- women rule the world -rrb- reaped all the bouquets on the eve of the international women 's day - surprisingly , but refreshingly so . so here we go again .
germany is experimenting .
it 's playing with eurovision fire .
but who knows ?
swing may end up marching where country music was not allowed to tread .
after all , stranger things have happened in the wacky world of eurotrash glamor .
just look at the finns . toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the best of " from the fringe " germany is certainly facing serious problems , but it 's also important not to forget to laugh once in a while .

" you can " stumble " anytime and anywhere in berlin . whether stepping out to pick up a carton of milk or on the way home from work , you ’ re bound to notice the " stumbling-stones " -lrb- stolpersteine -rrb- , small brass-capped squares laid flush with berlin ’ s stone sidewalks . one stumbles psychologically , not literally , for inscribed into their surface is the name , and - as far as is known - the dates of birth , deportation , and death of a former jewish inhabitant of the dwelling alongside the stone . the brainchild of artist gunter demnig , the miniature memorials must be privately sponsored at a cost of roughly 95 euros -lrb- $ 125 -rrb- and have caught on as an effective way to personalize the enormity of the holocaust . after " stumbling " dozens of times over berlin ’ s roughly 900 miniature memorials , i became eager to talk to individuals who funded the stones , which are created and inlaid by the artist himself . a phone call to my neighborhood ’ s stumbling-stone coordination center puts me in touch with a local couple .
i am set to meet sponsors of the latest memory trend . pasta and the past richard and elke hoffmann * greet me at one of berlin ’ s thousand cheap italian restaurants , chosen so we could talk at length without worrying someone else will be waiting for our table . the conversation quickly turns from vodka penne to vergangenheitsbewältigung , or " coming to terms with the past . " mr. hoffmann believes in the controversial " collective guilt " theory popularized after a 1981 speech by israeli prime minister menachem begin . the theory holds that all germans as an entire people are guilty for the crimes of nazi germany . a prevailing counter to the " collective guilt " theory runs that german society is not collectively guilty but rather collectively responsible ; as witnesses to the terrible history and heirs to its consequences , they can help ensure it does not happen again . while mr. hoffmann agrees with this responsibility , he nonetheless sees the nation as categorically culpable , a feeling that informed his desire to sponsor a stumbling-stone . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : artist gunter demnig produces the stones " with this stone , i ’ m accepting a small piece of the guilt of our people .
the guilt that i inherited . i take on this guilt in recognition of the terrible crimes we have committed , " he explains to me slowly and carefully , as though describing a logical proof . a shocking bakery visit mrs. hoffmann expands on their reasons , bringing up an incident from their 1974 trip to israel , when they stopped in a bakery for a snack . " i wanted to buy a pastry and the woman behind the counter had blue numbers tattooed here . " mrs. hoffmann points to her arm . " when she heard us speaking german she just gasped and then couldn ’ t breathe . she froze , completely transported by horrible memories . " this encounter with a concentration camp survivor stayed with mrs. hoffmann for decades .
" i had to face what my people did , " she says . " and for me , the stumbling-stone is a way of dealing with this .
it ’ s a small gesture of humanity towards the victims . " the hoffmanns ’ stumbling-stone commemorates an elderly woman deported to theresienstadt and killed in october 1942 .
it lies not far from our restaurant , where the woman resided at the time of deportation . laying more stones " we came upon them the same way you did , " explains mr. hoffmann .
" we noticed them here and there throughout the city , and at some point we thought , ‘ that ’ s something we ’ d like to do . we ’ d like to sponsor a stone . ’ " they were able to turn their desire into action when mrs. hoffmann read a newspaper article with information about the local office that coordinates with the artist . she called to inquire , and ten months later , the stone was set . the hoffmanns would like to do more . after reading about the former jewish neighborhood in venice , where the term " ghetto " originated , the idea of laying a stumbling-stone there appealed to them . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for sponsors , the stones offer a way to acknowledge past horrors mrs. hoffmann takes out a travel guide and opens to a map depicting giudecca island , former home of the giudei , or jews .
the cartographic neutrality of the land mass , shaped like a bread crust lying in a soup of venetian canals , does not betray the cramped conditions under which jews once lived . " i have to research myself if there were jews living there at the time of the second world war , and if they got deported , as well as finding the names and dates , " says mrs. hoffmann . " we ’ re not sure if everything is recorded , either , " mr. hoffmann adds .
" germans like to write everything down , but other countries might not have . " he is referring to the astoundingly precise german documentation of their crimes , right down to careful inventories of homes from which jews were deported . " be sure you know why " despite this tactical obstacle , the hoffmanns believe strongly that in what they are doing , stating emphatically that only by remembering can one avoid repeating past mistakes .
when asked how they would advise someone planning to sponsor a stone , their message is clear , " be sure you know why you are doing it . " interested in sponsoring a stumbling-stone where you live ? many -lrb- german and austrian -rrb- cities have coordination centers ; call the mayor ’ s office or district office -lrb- bezirksamt -rrb- to inquire . * names have been changed at the request of the sponsors , who want more people to know about the stumbling-stones yet prefer not to receive undue attention for simply doing what they consider the right thing . arden pennell send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de read arden pennell 's earlier columns rational disdain for distant relatives americans and europeans are n't quite as different as people think , wrote arden pennell .

they want to draw attention to the fates of people like florian blitzer - a 42-year-old roofer who says even the current retirement age of 65 is virtually impossible to achieve . " as a roofer you spend your entire working life standing or kneeling on sloping surfaces , " blitzer says .
" this is bound to damage your knee and hip joints after a number of years making it impossible to work for so long . " however , under the new law , adopted by the bundestag on friday , everyone seeking retirement earlier than 67 will face a monthly pension cut of 0.3 percent . amelie buntenbach , a trade union official , says the measure will not help to solve the pension funding crisis as a result of a rapidly aging population . " there is enormous fear among people here that they will become dependent on welfare payments because they won ’ t be able to work or find a job at that age , " buntenbach said .
" they are afraid of having to use up all their savings before retirement , thus ending up in social hardship . " not enough jobs to go around in germany so far , companies made use of generous state-funded early retirement schemes to shed millions of older staff .
less than half of all germans aged 55 and 64 , still work here compared with 70 percent in sweden . critics of the new law say the government completely ignores the fact that there just aren ’ t enough jobs around for people at 65 , let alone 67 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : older workers fear they may have to depend on government handouts kurt beck , leader of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- which rules in a coalition with chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats , says the government will make sure that such jobs will be created . " we have started a new program to foster employment among older people , " beck said .
" and secondly , the new law also allows people who have worked for 45 years to continue retiring at the age 65 .
manual workers such as roofers and brick layers usually start their professional lives at 16 , so they will have the chance to retire earlier . " by 2035 , the share of people aged 65 and over in germany is projected to swell to 30 percent of the total population from around 18 percent now . new work model needed carl martin welcker , ceo of the schütte machine tool maker , believes employers must also rethink their former staff policy .
the imminent shortage of skilled labor will make it necessary to keep elderly workers employed , he says . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german workers will no longer be able to sit back and relax at 65 " we need to find ways to make working hours more flexible and seek individual solutions to keep workers employed as long as possible , " welcker said .
" in my company , we ’ ve started this process and older employees say they feel happy and fit enough to be able to work until retirement . " the new retirement age is scheduled to be introduced in a gradual process starting in 2012 and ending in 2029 . the government has pledged to review the legislation over that period to see whether the labor market has really changed to take on more elderly employees . uwe hessler -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu tackles demographic challenges at conference under growing pressure to tackle the challenges of a shrinking workforce and an ageing population , the eu has urged member states to help citizens better unite paid work with family commitments at a special forum .

" it has been possible to , as it were , open the door to a new dimension of european cooperation for years to come in the area of energy and combating climate change , " merkel said . the accord 's overarching achievement is to commit the 27-country bloc to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 20 percent by 2020 , when compared to 1990 levels . the pact also obliges member countries to make renewable energies , such as solar and wind power , the source of 20 percent of the total energy consumption on average across the eu by 2020 . " these are a set of ground-breaking , bold ambitious targets for the european union , " said british prime minister tony blair , who pushed hard for a climate agreement .
" it gives europe a very clear leadership position on this crucial issue facing the world . " each according to its ability bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said europe needs to stick to the goals it has set itself the talks in brussels had broken up overnight during the two-day conference with divisions over setting a " binding " target for the use of renewable energy sources .
the leaders , however , agreed on a compromise that accords member states some flexibility in meeting national goals . countries like poland and the czech republic are heavily dependent on carbon energy sources such as coal and had complained that the binding renewable energies target was overly ambitious and prohibitively expensive .
france , on the other hand , had insisted on including nuclear energy among the list of environmentally friendly options . to bring the opposing states on board , the agreement stressed that " differentiated national overall targets " would be set , " with due regard to a fair and adequate allocation " taking into account the potential of each member state . thus , those countries whose exploitation of renewable energies is already well advanced would take up the slack left by the others to ensure the overall wide target is met across the bloc . leverage against non-eu polluters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is willing to cut co2 emissions more if other nations do so as well merkel said the pact gave her a mandate to press major world polluters into action , as the eu would offer to reduce emissions of the gases that cause global warming by an additional 10 percent by 2020 if those countries would do so as well . " we are going into negotiations offering 30 percent if international partners are prepared to go along with that , so it is a genuine offer in what is an extremely important topic for the whole of humanity , " she said , adding that it would be " a bad signal " to the rest of the world if europe did not stick to the deal . but tough questions must still be answered in brussels . the european commission has been set the task of working out how much of the renewable energy burden each state will have to bear ; a cumbersome , deeply technical and controversial task that it hopes to complete in the autumn . environmental nitty-gritty bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the safety of nuclear power plants also needs to be taken into account " it will be a huge job , huge job from a legal and a technical point of view , " acknowledged european commission president jose manuel barroso .
" i have assured them that we will do this in all fairness and seeking the acceptance of each member state on these objectives . " swedish foreign minister carl bildt said there was no one-size-fits-all solution . " different nations have different conditions , " he said .
" for instance , we can easily meet the renewable target in sweden - in fact we are above it .
but others are having substantial difficulties . " nuclear power part of pact the accord represents a minor victory for france by having nuclear power - which meets some 40 percent of its total energy needs - recognized as one way to reduce carbon dioxide emissions . the agreement noted the commission 's assessment of the contribution of nuclear energy in " meeting the growing concerns about safety of energy supply and carbon dioxide emissions reductions . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmental protection groups said the agreement was far from ideal however , it also highlighted safety concerns , stating that " nuclear safety and security " should be " paramount in the decision-making process . " barroso said he believed the final agreement comprised " the most ambitious package ever agreed by any institution or any group of countries " to combat climate change . green groups want more it was unclear if the deal would provide for sanctions against nations that fail to meet their climate change targets . environmental protection group wwf said the eu deal set the " right path " to control global warming but warned that the eu must put in place laws and measures so that the goal does not remain " hot air . " " it is clear that the targets decided today will only be achieved with solid laws , measures and incentives , " wwf 's stephan singer said , adding that the targets need to be translated into a shift of investments towards green technologies , rather than to nuclear power stations . dw staff / afp -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu leaders seek to break deadlock on climate change deal eu leaders hope to seal a landmark agreement on tackling climate change on friday , after a row over setting binding targets for renewable energy scuppered their first attempt at a summit in brussels .

but you ca n't say the germans are not trying . placing last in the eurovision song contest is a humiliation that european countries try to avoid like the plague .
germany knows how high the pressure is - especially after its 2005 entry " hide and run " suffered the ignominious fate of placing last with only four sympathy points from monaco and moldova . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jane comerford and texas lightning brought country music to the german charts last year , germany decided to shake things up a bit in europe 's favorite singing contest .
the catchy , though slightly off-the-path , country-western song " no no never " - performed by an aging australian-born singer whose name is not kylie minogue and a band that calls itself texas lightning - was the first grand prix competitor in 50 years that featured an ukulele , a singing lady in pink waving an imaginary lasso and a group of musicians who would eventually be declared honorary citizens of texas by the lonestar state 's own senate . europe was confused .
it voted for lordi - a finnish heavy-metal / horror-film freak show instead .
germany came 15th . healing wounds this is a big year for germany .
with angela merkel heading the eu 's rotating presidency as well as the g8 and fond memories of the world cup success , this would be a perfect time for germany to flex its pop muscles and show some talent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lordi 's song ' ' hard rock hallelujah " won the 2006 eurovision song contest but eurovision is not meant to be enjoyed lightly .
an endless parade of songs followed by an equally never-ending voting process is what makes eurovision a truly unique event - part circus act , part masochism feast . germany , however , organized a national competition in which only three songs were allowed to participate .
putting aside the fact that choosing between three songs on thursday evening resembled elections under a communist dictatorship - put a red star next to the name of the communist party candidate that you think our glorious leader fancies the most - the entire spectacle felt like an one-sentence version of anna karenina : " she was unhappy and jumped under the train . " winners and losers in this unusual eins-zwei-drei affair , two candidates - a 50 year-old-rocker called heinz rudolf kunze and this year 's winners of germany 's popular casting show " popstars , " a girlband called " monrose " - came out as losers .

heinz sounds like mayonnaise and rudolf sounds like a reindeer , not exactly the stuff that rock-and-roll rebels are made of . but where were all those thousands of teenagers who overcharged their cell phones by voting repeatedly during the popstars finals ?

but you ca n't say the germans are not trying . placing last in the eurovision song contest is a humiliation that european countries try to avoid like the plague .
germany knows how high the pressure is - especially after its 2005 entry " hide and run " suffered the ignominious fate of placing last with only four sympathy points from monaco and moldova . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jane comerford and texas lightning brought country music to the german charts last year , germany decided to shake things up a bit in europe 's favorite singing contest .
the catchy , though slightly off-the-path , country-western song " no no never " - performed by an aging australian-born singer whose name is not kylie minogue and a band that calls itself texas lightning - was the first grand prix competitor in 50 years that featured an ukulele , a singing lady in pink waving an imaginary lasso and a group of musicians who would eventually be declared honorary citizens of texas by the lonestar state 's own senate . europe was confused .
it voted for lordi - a finnish heavy-metal / horror-film freak show instead .
germany came 15th . healing wounds this is a big year for germany .
with angela merkel heading the eu 's rotating presidency as well as the g8 and fond memories of the world cup success , this would be a perfect time for germany to flex its pop muscles and show some talent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lordi 's song ' ' hard rock hallelujah " won the 2006 eurovision song contest but eurovision is not meant to be enjoyed lightly .
an endless parade of songs followed by an equally never-ending voting process is what makes eurovision a truly unique event - part circus act , part masochism feast . germany , however , organized a national competition in which only three songs were allowed to participate .
putting aside the fact that choosing between three songs on thursday evening resembled elections under a communist dictatorship - put a red star next to the name of the communist party candidate that you think our glorious leader fancies the most - the entire spectacle felt like an one-sentence version of anna karenina : " she was unhappy and jumped under the train . " winners and losers in this unusual eins-zwei-drei affair , two candidates - a 50 year-old-rocker called heinz rudolf kunze and this year 's winners of germany 's popular casting show " popstars , " a girlband called " monrose " - came out as losers .

" it is clear that the targets decided today will only be achieved with solid laws , measures and incentives , " said stephan singer , head of the european climate and energy unit at environmental group wwf . " there are only 13 years for the eu to accomplish the mission defined today .
these years are key to help saving the planet from the dangerous consequences of climate change , " singer said . too timid or too ambitious ? friends of the earth europe -lrb- foee -rrb- derided the 20 percent target as too timid and unlikely to encourage other big polluters to follow suit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the us follow the european example ?
" it will be interesting to see the eu trying to persuade -lrb- us -rrb- president -lrb- george -rrb- bush that he should reduce america 's emissions by 30 percent by 2020 compared to 1990 levels , when eu leaders cowered away from adopting such a target for themselves today , " foee climate campaigner jan kowalzig said in a press release . eliot diringer , director of international strategies at the pew center on global climate change , a us thinktank , said by dangling the offer of a 30-percent cut , the eu faced being accused of grandstanding . " there 's a good deal of skepticism -lrb- in washington -rrb- about whether the eu is on track for meeting its commitments for 2012 , " he said in an interview with afp . " their ambitious 2020 numbers are more credible if the perception is that they are indeed on track to meet their 2012 target .
it 's a big stretch that they 're proposing -lrb- with the 2020 goal -rrb- .
there 's a lot of things that have to happen between now and 2012 to make the -lrb- eu 's kyoto -rrb- commitment a reality , " diringer said . " a real opportunity " the 20-percent renewables target was hailed by the european wind energy association -lrb- ewea -rrb- as a " real opportunity " to switch to clean sources and ease eu dependence on unpredictable sources of foreign energy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu would like to rely less on russian gas imports " such a supply structure would benefit our economy , environment , companies and the welfare of european citizens for decades to come , " ewea 's chief executive officer , christian kjaer said . but , he cautioned , these benefits would only be achieved if eu countries broke up monopoly ownership of electricity transmission and production , so that renewables entering the energy market got fair access to the supply grid . creating jobs along the way andre antolini , president of france 's renewable energies association , said that , at present , renewables had an average share of 6.75 percent of the eu energy market .
the eu has a non-binding goal of 12 percent by 2010 . " the share has not progressed for years , " antolini said .
" in some countries , there has been a substantial rise , but in terms of the overall eu share , this has been almost cancelled out by a corresponding increase in energy consumption . " to attain 20 percent meant tripling renewables ' present share , which means lowering fossil-fuel use through greater use of rail and water transport for freight and use of biofuels and biomass for heating apartment blocks and offices , he said . antolini also predicted the 2020 target would be a huge job creator . " renewable energies have already generated 200,000 jobs in the eu , even though their share is below seven percent , " he said . dw staff / afp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu clinches climate deal , but hard work yet to come european union leaders clinched a wide-ranging climate change accord on friday but postponed the thorny task of setting mandatory renewable energy goals for each member country to meet .
-lrb- 09.03.2007 -rrb- eu leaders seek to break deadlock on climate change deal eu leaders hope to seal a landmark agreement on tackling climate change on friday , after a row over setting binding targets for renewable energy scuppered their first attempt at a summit in brussels .

they want to draw attention to the fates of people like florian blitzer - a 42-year-old roofer who says even the current retirement age of 65 is virtually impossible to achieve . " as a roofer you spend your entire working life standing or kneeling on sloping surfaces , " blitzer says .
" this is bound to damage your knee and hip joints after a number of years making it impossible to work for so long . " however , under the new law , adopted by the bundestag on friday , everyone seeking retirement earlier than 67 will face a monthly pension cut of 0.3 percent . amelie buntenbach , a trade union official , says the measure will not help to solve the pension funding crisis as a result of a rapidly aging population . " there is enormous fear among people here that they will become dependent on welfare payments because they won ’ t be able to work or find a job at that age , " buntenbach said .
" they are afraid of having to use up all their savings before retirement , thus ending up in social hardship . " not enough jobs to go around in germany so far , companies made use of generous state-funded early retirement schemes to shed millions of older staff .
less than half of all germans aged 55 and 64 , still work here compared with 70 percent in sweden . critics of the new law say the government completely ignores the fact that there just aren ’ t enough jobs around for people at 65 , let alone 67 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : older workers fear they may have to depend on government handouts kurt beck , leader of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- which rules in a coalition with chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats , says the government will make sure that such jobs will be created . " we have started a new program to foster employment among older people , " beck said .
" and secondly , the new law also allows people who have worked for 45 years to continue retiring at the age 65 .
manual workers such as roofers and brick layers usually start their professional lives at 16 , so they will have the chance to retire earlier . " by 2035 , the share of people aged 65 and over in germany is projected to swell to 30 percent of the total population from around 18 percent now . new work model needed carl martin welcker , ceo of the schütte machine tool maker , believes employers must also rethink their former staff policy .
the imminent shortage of skilled labor will make it necessary to keep elderly workers employed , he says . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german workers will no longer be able to sit back and relax at 65 " we need to find ways to make working hours more flexible and seek individual solutions to keep workers employed as long as possible , " welcker said .
" in my company , we ’ ve started this process and older employees say they feel happy and fit enough to be able to work until retirement . " the new retirement age is scheduled to be introduced in a gradual process starting in 2012 and ending in 2029 . the government has pledged to review the legislation over that period to see whether the labor market has really changed to take on more elderly employees . uwe hessler -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu tackles demographic challenges at conference under growing pressure to tackle the challenges of a shrinking workforce and an ageing population , the eu has urged member states to help citizens better unite paid work with family commitments at a special forum .

" this is bound to damage your knee and hip joints after a number of years making it impossible to work for so long . " however , under the new law , adopted by the bundestag on friday , everyone seeking retirement earlier than 67 will face a monthly pension cut of 0.3 percent . amelie buntenbach , a trade union official , says the measure will not help to solve the pension funding crisis as a result of a rapidly aging population . " there is enormous fear among people here that they will become dependent on welfare payments because they won ’ t be able to work or find a job at that age , " buntenbach said .
" they are afraid of having to use up all their savings before retirement , thus ending up in social hardship . " not enough jobs to go around in germany so far , companies made use of generous state-funded early retirement schemes to shed millions of older staff .
less than half of all germans aged 55 and 64 , still work here compared with 70 percent in sweden . critics of the new law say the government completely ignores the fact that there just aren ’ t enough jobs around for people at 65 , let alone 67 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : older workers fear they may have to depend on government handouts kurt beck , leader of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- which rules in a coalition with chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats , says the government will make sure that such jobs will be created . " we have started a new program to foster employment among older people , " beck said .
" and secondly , the new law also allows people who have worked for 45 years to continue retiring at the age 65 .
manual workers such as roofers and brick layers usually start their professional lives at 16 , so they will have the chance to retire earlier . " by 2035 , the share of people aged 65 and over in germany is projected to swell to 30 percent of the total population from around 18 percent now . new work model needed carl martin welcker , ceo of the schütte machine tool maker , believes employers must also rethink their former staff policy .

" in my company , we ’ ve started this process and older employees say they feel happy and fit enough to be able to work until retirement .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 09.03.2007 eu leaders seek to break deadlock on climate change deal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu leaders may agree on setting binding targets for renewable energy eu leaders hope to seal a landmark agreement on tackling climate change on friday , after a row over setting binding targets for renewable energy scuppered their first attempt at a summit in brussels . " there is no agreement as yet .
we 've all got to show a little patience , " german chancellor angela merkel told reporters late thursday after chairing the opening session of the two-day summit . " we need to find common ground .
i 'm not without hope , " she added . the 27 heads of state and government resolved to seek a compromise deal on friday morning . the main sticking point to the plan , which aims to reduce emissions of the greenhouse gases that cause global warming , centered on some member countries ' reluctance to agree to firm goals for the future use of renewable energy . merkel , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency , wants the 27-nation bloc to commit to a binding target that 20 percent of eu energy needs should be met by renewable sources by 2020 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel wants the eu to lead the way on green issues " we talked about specific obligations - increasing energy efficiency , biofuels , renewable energy .
there is a need for further discussion on these three areas , " said merkel .
" some member states were asking : ' are we really going to achieve these goals ? " ' she added . in an effort to limit the rise in average global temperatures to two degrees celsius above pre-industrial era levels , the eu leaders are being asked to commit to cut carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- emissions by 20 percent by 2020 , from 1990 levels .
plenty of haggling ahead to entice the rest of the world to take bigger steps , the eu will offer to slash the emissions by a further 10 percent if nations like the united states , china and india also agree to take concrete steps . if a deal is reached friday there is still plenty of haggling ahead on what measures each eu nation will have to take to achieve the 20 percent average in co2 cuts . the eu member states have some time to make those decisions , as the kyoto protocol on climate change lays down targets until 2012 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : newer eu member states are reliant on carbon-heavy fuels like coal the eu hopes that a strong initiative here will provide impetus for the next g8 summit of industrialized nations in germany in june . before the summit began , merkel warned that the eu 's credibility hung on the bloc 's ability to agree on specific , long term goals for fighting global warming that other nations could emulate . " we can not say we came to a conclusion , " european commission president jose manuel barroso told a press conference after the leaders held talks over dinner , " but i really believe a consensus is emerging . " divergent views but while everyone agreed on the need to cut emissions , views obviously diverged on how to achieve this . some newer eu members like the czech republic , hungary and poland depend heavily on carbon-heavy fuels like coal , and oppose setting a mandatory target for the use of renewable energy sources . " the plans are too ambitious in the years to come for poland , " polish president lech kaczynski said .
" if we have a flexible approach ... then a compromise solution would be possible . " at the other end of the spectrum lay denmark , which claims that its economy has thrived even as it moves to newer , more sustainable energy sources . " i think the european union should go green and to that end we need binding targets , " said danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen . embracing nuclear power ? france has said that it would accept the use of the word " binding , " but in return french president jacques chirac has demanded that nuclear energy be brought into the plan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel appeared ready to give in to chirac on nuclear energy merkel said that atomic power , which meets 40 percent of french energy needs , could be included in the eu 's ambitious scheme to reduce carbon emissions . " this overall reduction of 20 percent will also depend on the question of how to use cleaner coal technology , it could possibly include nuclear energy , " she conceded . german officials were preparing a new draft document for the leaders to consider again early friday , when they gather at european council headquarters from 10:00 cet . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german carmakers rev up effort to enter hybrid market amid increasing consumer awareness of global warming and other environmental issues , german carmakers have had to fight off growing criticism about their apparent lack of will to build environmentally friendly cars .
-lrb- 08.03.2007 -rrb- eu urged to take lead on battling climate change at a summit starting thursday , the european union will seek to thrash out a common policy in fighting climate change , with plans to set tough targets for cutting carbon dioxide emissions .

the row is raging against a backdrop of terrible losses airbus parent company eads had more bad news for its sick aviation subsidiary when the first operating loss in its history was announced .
this was compounded by new , related tensions between germany and france . airbus parent company eads reported on thursday that its ailing aviation subsidiary , currently in turmoil over job cuts and delays to its new flagship a380 superjumbo , suffered its first-ever operating loss of 572 million euros -lrb- $ 752 million -rrb- in 2006 and was expected to suffer further losses in 2007 . the restructuring costs for airbus ' a380 superjumbo have been cited as the main cause for the forecasted " substantial " operating loss for 2007 along with the problems arising from the adaptation of the popular a350 to the upgraded a350xwb jet .
in 2005 , airbus achieved a profit of 2.3 billion euros . eads announced at the presentation of its annual results in munich that net profit for 2006 plunged to 99 million euros from 1.8 billion euros the previous year .
operating profit before interest and tax slumped from 2.9 billion euros in 2005 to 399 million euros last year , the company added . the drop in profits came despite a 15 percent increase in revenue from 34.2 billion euros to 39.4 billion euros . airbus is currently undergoing a restructuring program , which is expected to result in the loss of 10,000 jobs and the selling off of factories . restructuring a priority , say chiefs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : louis gallois eads co-chairmen louis gallois and thomas enders said friday that implementation of the restructuring program had utmost priority despite the horrendous financial report .
they said the company needed to improve its operating performance , regain the confidence of clients and turn itself into a lean , dynamic operation . one of the main aspects eads is looking into in terms of streamlining is the abolition of a two-headed senior management team .
earlier this week , both gallois and enders said in separate statements that the current system was too cumbersome and that the company would benefit from a single president rather than the split role of the two co-chairmen . on friday , the german government announced that it was open to the idea of doing away with the long-standing practice of having twin french and german chief executives at eads . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's thomas enders wants a single eads chief berlin 's coordinator for aeronautics , peter hintze , told members of parliament on thursday that the european aerospace giant could instead distribute posts lower down in the leadership ranks equally between french and german nationals to maintain the power balance . until now the european aeronautic defense and space company has always had a french and a german co-chief executive . simmering row over franco-german ownership if eads were to appoint a single company head , problems would surely arise as to the nationality of the chairman .
if either gallois nor enders were to be appointed sole chief , the simmering animosity between france and germany would surely erupt , with the country losing its chairman also perceivably losing a considerable amount of influence in the company . the current conflict between the two countries over eads bubbled to the surface again on thursday after french finance minister thierry breton said his country should have taken a bigger share in airbus parent eads at the firm 's creation . hintze responded to breton 's claim by saying germany would ensure the even balance between the countries would remain . shift in french power rejected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france allegedly wanted more power at airbus hq " when the french finance minister , breton , ... called on french radio for the 50-50 relationship between germany and france to change to 60-40 in france 's favor , i can reject that emphatically in the name of the german government , " hintze said in a fiery speech to the bundestag . hintze accused breton of seeking to disrupt the delicate balance between the two countries that has existed since eads was formed in july 2000 . the french finance ministry replied to the german outburst hours later , denying that breton had ever called for a rebalancing of the french and german shareholdings .
the ministry said breton had only been referring to the origins of the pact in the radio interview . dw staff / afp / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de airbus crisis deepens as france , germany fight over job cuts troubled european airplane maker airbus faced worsening problems tuesday as germany and france , who jointly control the company , wrangled over the distribution of thousands of job cuts .

" pakistan is the preferred destination of terrorists , " hanning said , referring to one of the factors that went into the decision not to allow kurnaz back into germany . during his own testimony on thursday , current bnd head ernst uhrlau , the former secret services coordinator , supported hanning 's evaluation of kurnaz . peculiar spot for quran study bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uhrlau questioned the location kurnaz chose for his study of the quran " the pakistani-afghan border region is not the right spot for peaceful study of the quran , " uhrlau said .
kurnaz has said he had traveled to pakistan to study the quran . a turkish national born in bremen , kurnaz was released from the us military prison at guantanamo bay in cuba in 2006 without being charged , after chancellor angela merkel raised the issue with us president george w. bush .
kurnaz was taken prisoner by american forces in pakistan in 2001 . hanning did not criticize the chancellor 's decision to intervene for " humanitarian reasons " and told the inquiry panel that the circumstances of kurnaz ' imprisonment could be seen in a different light when merkel intervened . did germany do enough for kurnaz ? as former chancellor gerhard schröder 's chief of staff , steinmeier was ultimately responsible for intelligence matters and the kurnaz case has been a stone around his neck as media have reported that germany refused to accept a us offer to release kurnaz in 2002 .
both steinmeier and kurnaz have said no such offer was ever put on the table . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurnaz was released from guantanamo bay in 2006 hanning told parliamentarians that steinmeier was privy to all pertinent information concerning kurnaz . " all of the relevant facts were certainly presented , " hanning said of his meetings with steinmeier .
" my impression was that the intelligence service 's collected knowledge was presented to him . " steinmeier to testify in march during his testimony hanning also disputed the conclusions reached by intelligence service agents who , after interrogating him at guantanamo bay , said kurnaz was taken prisoner for " being in the wrong place at the wrong time . " hanning called their conclusion " flawed and unprofessional " because it did not take into account information from the bremen state interior ministry the investigatory committee delayed hearing testimony from steinmeier by a week , to march 29 , after bremen 's interior ministry unexpectedly released documents needed for the inquiry .
the panel will also hear from former interior minister otto schily on the same day . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us official : germany not keen on release of guantanamo inmate contradicting statements made by german foreign minister steinmeier , a high-ranking former us official has said that german government officials did not try to get german-born murat kurnaz released from guantanamo .

the jets are expected to be dispatched in april . the bundesrat or the upper house of parliament will likely vote on the deployment this month . opposition deputies claimed the decision would drag german forces into combat in the south of afghanistan where nato this week launched an offensive against the taliban . germany has around 3,000 troops in the landlocked asian nation , mostly working in civilian-military provincial reconstruction teams in the relatively peaceful north . nato has some 35,000 soldiers in afghanistan , which has recently seen an increase in attacks by remnants of the taliban . deployment clouded by killing of aid worker bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's minister for cooperation and development heidemarie wieczorek-zeul the vote was overshadowed by the killing of a german engineer on thursday - the first german aid worker killed in afghanistan since us forces ousted the taliban in 2001 . development assistance minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul said that the assistance provided by aid workers in afghanistan deserved respect and gratitude , and would continue despite thursday 's tragic event . the minister called on the afghan government to discover who was behind the slaying of dieter rübling , 65 , and bring the assailants to justice . afghan police on friday arrested six people on suspicion of involvement in the killing , which took place in the province of sar-e-pul where the engineer was on an inspection tour . an afghan official said that more than 100 additional police were sent to the area to track down the culprits as part of a joint investigation with the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- . ideological motives bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato launched a new offensive in afghanistan this week rübling - who worked for a non-denominational bonn-based aid foundation , deutsche welthungerhilfe , which uses the english name agro action - was traveling with his afghan colleagues .
their convoy was attacked by a group of armed men , who let the afghans go before shooting the german . agro action secretary general joachim preuss said the engineer was on a three-month tour of duty in afghanistan and had many years of experience in international development aid projects . preuss said it appeared " ideological motives " were behind the murder and not criminal actions . afghan president hamid karzai on friday " strongly condemned " the murder of the german aid worker .

großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women still need to fight discrimination at work women need to think bigger when it comes to their demands , argues faith dennis on international women 's day .
and they need to stop imitating men and make it their own way . yesterday was march the 8th , international woman ’ s day .
i was my home from having dinner with a friend when i came across a police car with flashing lights blocking off a busy street in kreuzberg , where i live .
an accident was my first thought , until i spotted a riot van , and group of 20 women staging a demonstration , surrounded by an even smaller bunch of , mostly male , onlookers .
i , too , thought i would stop and have a look to see what exactly they were protesting against , although assuming it would be quite obvious , given it was woman ’ s day and their banners all had the female symbol painted on them . where 's the power struggle ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is it time to stop playing by male rules ?
stepping closer , however , i noticed the slogan in big letters across the main fabric banner , which said : “ wir geben die macht nicht auf ! ” which translates as “ we won ’ t give up power . ”
this i didn ’ t quite understand - “ we want more power ” would have made more sense , surely ?
is there a power struggle at the top that i am not aware of ?
germany does have a female chancellor and good equal opportunity initiatives in the realm of business , but as far as i understand , the problems in equality are often glossed over by reports in the media that show rising figures of women in employment , rather than illustrating the difference in salaries between men and woman working in the same jobs .

hegel , one of the founding fathers of social theory , states that all desires are based on a desire for recognition , and it is only through this experience of recognition that we can become socially viable human beings .
however , in the above case and many others , this recognition is based on being " manly " or having " masculine traits . "
the norm is thus set by homogeneity , excluding not just for women , but also for anyone who falls outside the " manly " category .
until we can find a formula for success in business which is non-gender specific , women should not be concerned with " giving up power , " but pointing out that power can achieved through embracing the differences between men and women as positive attributes and a viable alternative to the current ideal . faith dennis send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de read faith 's earlier columns shop ‘ til you bop faith never was a big fan of buying used knick-knacks and antiques - until she visited a unique night-time flea market in berlin kreuzberg .

" it has been possible to , as it were , open the door to a new dimension of european cooperation for years to come in the area of energy and combating climate change , " merkel said . the accord 's overarching achievement is to commit the 27-country bloc to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 20 percent by 2020 , when compared to 1990 levels . the pact also obliges member countries to make renewable energies , such as solar and wind power , the source of 20 percent of the total energy consumption on average across the eu by 2020 . " these are a set of ground-breaking , bold ambitious targets for the european union , " said british prime minister tony blair , who pushed hard for a climate agreement .
" it gives europe a very clear leadership position on this crucial issue facing the world . " each according to its ability bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said europe needs to stick to the goals it has set itself the talks in brussels had broken up overnight during the two-day conference with divisions over setting a " binding " target for the use of renewable energy sources .
the leaders , however , agreed on a compromise that accords member states some flexibility in meeting national goals . countries like poland and the czech republic are heavily dependent on carbon energy sources such as coal and had complained that the binding renewable energies target was overly ambitious and prohibitively expensive .
france , on the other hand , had insisted on including nuclear energy among the list of environmentally friendly options . to bring the opposing states on board , the agreement stressed that " differentiated national overall targets " would be set , " with due regard to a fair and adequate allocation " taking into account the potential of each member state . thus , those countries whose exploitation of renewable energies is already well advanced would take up the slack left by the others to ensure the overall wide target is met across the bloc . leverage against non-eu polluters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is willing to cut co2 emissions more if other nations do so as well merkel said the pact gave her a mandate to press major world polluters into action , as the eu would offer to reduce emissions of the gases that cause global warming by an additional 10 percent by 2020 if those countries would do so as well . " we are going into negotiations offering 30 percent if international partners are prepared to go along with that , so it is a genuine offer in what is an extremely important topic for the whole of humanity , " she said , adding that it would be " a bad signal " to the rest of the world if europe did not stick to the deal . but tough questions must still be answered in brussels . the european commission has been set the task of working out how much of the renewable energy burden each state will have to bear ; a cumbersome , deeply technical and controversial task that it hopes to complete in the autumn . environmental nitty-gritty bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the safety of nuclear power plants also needs to be taken into account " it will be a huge job , huge job from a legal and a technical point of view , " acknowledged european commission president jose manuel barroso .
" i have assured them that we will do this in all fairness and seeking the acceptance of each member state on these objectives . " swedish foreign minister carl bildt said there was no one-size-fits-all solution . " different nations have different conditions , " he said .
" for instance , we can easily meet the renewable target in sweden - in fact we are above it .
but others are having substantial difficulties . " nuclear power part of pact the accord represents a minor victory for france by having nuclear power - which meets some 40 percent of its total energy needs - recognized as one way to reduce carbon dioxide emissions . the agreement noted the commission 's assessment of the contribution of nuclear energy in " meeting the growing concerns about safety of energy supply and carbon dioxide emissions reductions . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmental protection groups said the agreement was far from ideal however , it also highlighted safety concerns , stating that " nuclear safety and security " should be " paramount in the decision-making process . " barroso said he believed the final agreement comprised " the most ambitious package ever agreed by any institution or any group of countries " to combat climate change . green groups want more it was unclear if the deal would provide for sanctions against nations that fail to meet their climate change targets . environmental protection group wwf said the eu deal set the " right path " to control global warming but warned that the eu must put in place laws and measures so that the goal does not remain " hot air . " " it is clear that the targets decided today will only be achieved with solid laws , measures and incentives , " wwf 's stephan singer said , adding that the targets need to be translated into a shift of investments towards green technologies , rather than to nuclear power stations . dw staff / afp -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu leaders seek to break deadlock on climate change deal eu leaders hope to seal a landmark agreement on tackling climate change on friday , after a row over setting binding targets for renewable energy scuppered their first attempt at a summit in brussels .

" pakistan is the preferred destination of terrorists , " hanning said , referring to one of the factors that went into the decision not to allow kurnaz back into germany . during his own testimony on thursday , current bnd head ernst uhrlau , the former secret services coordinator , supported hanning 's evaluation of kurnaz . peculiar spot for quran study bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uhrlau questioned the location kurnaz chose for his study of the quran " the pakistani-afghan border region is not the right spot for peaceful study of the quran , " uhrlau said .
kurnaz has said he had traveled to pakistan to study the quran . a turkish national born in bremen , kurnaz was released from the us military prison at guantanamo bay in cuba in 2006 without being charged , after chancellor angela merkel raised the issue with us president george w. bush .
kurnaz was taken prisoner by american forces in pakistan in 2001 . hanning did not criticize the chancellor 's decision to intervene for " humanitarian reasons " and told the inquiry panel that the circumstances of kurnaz ' imprisonment could be seen in a different light when merkel intervened . did germany do enough for kurnaz ? as former chancellor gerhard schröder 's chief of staff , steinmeier was ultimately responsible for intelligence matters and the kurnaz case has been a stone around his neck as media have reported that germany refused to accept a us offer to release kurnaz in 2002 .
both steinmeier and kurnaz have said no such offer was ever put on the table . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurnaz was released from guantanamo bay in 2006 hanning told parliamentarians that steinmeier was privy to all pertinent information concerning kurnaz . " all of the relevant facts were certainly presented , " hanning said of his meetings with steinmeier .
" my impression was that the intelligence service 's collected knowledge was presented to him . " steinmeier to testify in march during his testimony hanning also disputed the conclusions reached by intelligence service agents who , after interrogating him at guantanamo bay , said kurnaz was taken prisoner for " being in the wrong place at the wrong time . " hanning called their conclusion " flawed and unprofessional " because it did not take into account information from the bremen state interior ministry the investigatory committee delayed hearing testimony from steinmeier by a week , to march 29 , after bremen 's interior ministry unexpectedly released documents needed for the inquiry .
the panel will also hear from former interior minister otto schily on the same day . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us official : germany not keen on release of guantanamo inmate contradicting statements made by german foreign minister steinmeier , a high-ranking former us official has said that german government officials did not try to get german-born murat kurnaz released from guantanamo .

the row is raging against a backdrop of terrible losses airbus parent company eads had more bad news for its sick aviation subsidiary when the first operating loss in its history was announced .
this was compounded by new , related tensions between germany and france . airbus parent company eads reported on thursday that its ailing aviation subsidiary , currently in turmoil over job cuts and delays to its new flagship a380 superjumbo , suffered its first-ever operating loss of 572 million euros -lrb- $ 752 million -rrb- in 2006 and was expected to suffer further losses in 2007 . the restructuring costs for airbus ' a380 superjumbo have been cited as the main cause for the forecasted " substantial " operating loss for 2007 along with the problems arising from the adaptation of the popular a350 to the upgraded a350xwb jet .
in 2005 , airbus achieved a profit of 2.3 billion euros . eads announced at the presentation of its annual results in munich that net profit for 2006 plunged to 99 million euros from 1.8 billion euros the previous year .
operating profit before interest and tax slumped from 2.9 billion euros in 2005 to 399 million euros last year , the company added . the drop in profits came despite a 15 percent increase in revenue from 34.2 billion euros to 39.4 billion euros . airbus is currently undergoing a restructuring program , which is expected to result in the loss of 10,000 jobs and the selling off of factories . restructuring a priority , say chiefs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : louis gallois eads co-chairmen louis gallois and thomas enders said friday that implementation of the restructuring program had utmost priority despite the horrendous financial report .
they said the company needed to improve its operating performance , regain the confidence of clients and turn itself into a lean , dynamic operation . one of the main aspects eads is looking into in terms of streamlining is the abolition of a two-headed senior management team .
earlier this week , both gallois and enders said in separate statements that the current system was too cumbersome and that the company would benefit from a single president rather than the split role of the two co-chairmen . on friday , the german government announced that it was open to the idea of doing away with the long-standing practice of having twin french and german chief executives at eads . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's thomas enders wants a single eads chief berlin 's coordinator for aeronautics , peter hintze , told members of parliament on thursday that the european aerospace giant could instead distribute posts lower down in the leadership ranks equally between french and german nationals to maintain the power balance . until now the european aeronautic defense and space company has always had a french and a german co-chief executive . simmering row over franco-german ownership if eads were to appoint a single company head , problems would surely arise as to the nationality of the chairman .
if either gallois nor enders were to be appointed sole chief , the simmering animosity between france and germany would surely erupt , with the country losing its chairman also perceivably losing a considerable amount of influence in the company . the current conflict between the two countries over eads bubbled to the surface again on thursday after french finance minister thierry breton said his country should have taken a bigger share in airbus parent eads at the firm 's creation . hintze responded to breton 's claim by saying germany would ensure the even balance between the countries would remain . shift in french power rejected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france allegedly wanted more power at airbus hq " when the french finance minister , breton , ... called on french radio for the 50-50 relationship between germany and france to change to 60-40 in france 's favor , i can reject that emphatically in the name of the german government , " hintze said in a fiery speech to the bundestag . hintze accused breton of seeking to disrupt the delicate balance between the two countries that has existed since eads was formed in july 2000 . the french finance ministry replied to the german outburst hours later , denying that breton had ever called for a rebalancing of the french and german shareholdings .
the ministry said breton had only been referring to the origins of the pact in the radio interview . dw staff / afp / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de airbus crisis deepens as france , germany fight over job cuts troubled european airplane maker airbus faced worsening problems tuesday as germany and france , who jointly control the company , wrangled over the distribution of thousands of job cuts .

" pakistan is the preferred destination of terrorists , " hanning said , referring to one of the factors that went into the decision not to allow kurnaz back into germany . during his own testimony on thursday , current bnd head ernst uhrlau , the former secret services coordinator , supported hanning 's evaluation of kurnaz . peculiar spot for quran study bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uhrlau questioned the location kurnaz chose for his study of the quran " the pakistani-afghan border region is not the right spot for peaceful study of the quran , " uhrlau said .
kurnaz has said he had traveled to pakistan to study the quran . a turkish national born in bremen , kurnaz was released from the us military prison at guantanamo bay in cuba in 2006 without being charged , after chancellor angela merkel raised the issue with us president george w. bush .
kurnaz was taken prisoner by american forces in pakistan in 2001 . hanning did not criticize the chancellor 's decision to intervene for " humanitarian reasons " and told the inquiry panel that the circumstances of kurnaz ' imprisonment could be seen in a different light when merkel intervened . did germany do enough for kurnaz ? as former chancellor gerhard schröder 's chief of staff , steinmeier was ultimately responsible for intelligence matters and the kurnaz case has been a stone around his neck as media have reported that germany refused to accept a us offer to release kurnaz in 2002 .
both steinmeier and kurnaz have said no such offer was ever put on the table . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurnaz was released from guantanamo bay in 2006 hanning told parliamentarians that steinmeier was privy to all pertinent information concerning kurnaz . " all of the relevant facts were certainly presented , " hanning said of his meetings with steinmeier .
" my impression was that the intelligence service 's collected knowledge was presented to him . " steinmeier to testify in march during his testimony hanning also disputed the conclusions reached by intelligence service agents who , after interrogating him at guantanamo bay , said kurnaz was taken prisoner for " being in the wrong place at the wrong time . " hanning called their conclusion " flawed and unprofessional " because it did not take into account information from the bremen state interior ministry the investigatory committee delayed hearing testimony from steinmeier by a week , to march 29 , after bremen 's interior ministry unexpectedly released documents needed for the inquiry .
the panel will also hear from former interior minister otto schily on the same day . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us official : germany not keen on release of guantanamo inmate contradicting statements made by german foreign minister steinmeier , a high-ranking former us official has said that german government officials did not try to get german-born murat kurnaz released from guantanamo .

" there is no agreement as yet .
we 've all got to show a little patience , " german chancellor angela merkel told reporters late thursday after chairing the opening session of the two-day summit . " we need to find common ground .
i 'm not without hope , " she added . the 27 heads of state and government resolved to seek a compromise deal on friday morning . the main sticking point to the plan , which aims to reduce emissions of the greenhouse gases that cause global warming , centered on some member countries ' reluctance to agree to firm goals for the future use of renewable energy . merkel , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency , wants the 27-nation bloc to commit to a binding target that 20 percent of eu energy needs should be met by renewable sources by 2020 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel wants the eu to lead the way on green issues " we talked about specific obligations - increasing energy efficiency , biofuels , renewable energy .
there is a need for further discussion on these three areas , " said merkel .
" some member states were asking : ' are we really going to achieve these goals ? " ' she added . in an effort to limit the rise in average global temperatures to two degrees celsius above pre-industrial era levels , the eu leaders are being asked to commit to cut carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- emissions by 20 percent by 2020 , from 1990 levels .
plenty of haggling ahead to entice the rest of the world to take bigger steps , the eu will offer to slash the emissions by a further 10 percent if nations like the united states , china and india also agree to take concrete steps . if a deal is reached friday there is still plenty of haggling ahead on what measures each eu nation will have to take to achieve the 20 percent average in co2 cuts . the eu member states have some time to make those decisions , as the kyoto protocol on climate change lays down targets until 2012 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : newer eu member states are reliant on carbon-heavy fuels like coal the eu hopes that a strong initiative here will provide impetus for the next g8 summit of industrialized nations in germany in june . before the summit began , merkel warned that the eu 's credibility hung on the bloc 's ability to agree on specific , long term goals for fighting global warming that other nations could emulate . " we can not say we came to a conclusion , " european commission president jose manuel barroso told a press conference after the leaders held talks over dinner , " but i really believe a consensus is emerging . " divergent views but while everyone agreed on the need to cut emissions , views obviously diverged on how to achieve this . some newer eu members like the czech republic , hungary and poland depend heavily on carbon-heavy fuels like coal , and oppose setting a mandatory target for the use of renewable energy sources . " the plans are too ambitious in the years to come for poland , " polish president lech kaczynski said .

the row is raging against a backdrop of terrible losses airbus parent company eads had more bad news for its sick aviation subsidiary when the first operating loss in its history was announced .
this was compounded by new , related tensions between germany and france . airbus parent company eads reported on thursday that its ailing aviation subsidiary , currently in turmoil over job cuts and delays to its new flagship a380 superjumbo , suffered its first-ever operating loss of 572 million euros -lrb- $ 752 million -rrb- in 2006 and was expected to suffer further losses in 2007 . the restructuring costs for airbus ' a380 superjumbo have been cited as the main cause for the forecasted " substantial " operating loss for 2007 along with the problems arising from the adaptation of the popular a350 to the upgraded a350xwb jet .
in 2005 , airbus achieved a profit of 2.3 billion euros . eads announced at the presentation of its annual results in munich that net profit for 2006 plunged to 99 million euros from 1.8 billion euros the previous year .
operating profit before interest and tax slumped from 2.9 billion euros in 2005 to 399 million euros last year , the company added . the drop in profits came despite a 15 percent increase in revenue from 34.2 billion euros to 39.4 billion euros . airbus is currently undergoing a restructuring program , which is expected to result in the loss of 10,000 jobs and the selling off of factories . restructuring a priority , say chiefs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : louis gallois eads co-chairmen louis gallois and thomas enders said friday that implementation of the restructuring program had utmost priority despite the horrendous financial report .
they said the company needed to improve its operating performance , regain the confidence of clients and turn itself into a lean , dynamic operation . one of the main aspects eads is looking into in terms of streamlining is the abolition of a two-headed senior management team .
earlier this week , both gallois and enders said in separate statements that the current system was too cumbersome and that the company would benefit from a single president rather than the split role of the two co-chairmen . on friday , the german government announced that it was open to the idea of doing away with the long-standing practice of having twin french and german chief executives at eads . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's thomas enders wants a single eads chief berlin 's coordinator for aeronautics , peter hintze , told members of parliament on thursday that the european aerospace giant could instead distribute posts lower down in the leadership ranks equally between french and german nationals to maintain the power balance . until now the european aeronautic defense and space company has always had a french and a german co-chief executive . simmering row over franco-german ownership if eads were to appoint a single company head , problems would surely arise as to the nationality of the chairman .
if either gallois nor enders were to be appointed sole chief , the simmering animosity between france and germany would surely erupt , with the country losing its chairman also perceivably losing a considerable amount of influence in the company . the current conflict between the two countries over eads bubbled to the surface again on thursday after french finance minister thierry breton said his country should have taken a bigger share in airbus parent eads at the firm 's creation . hintze responded to breton 's claim by saying germany would ensure the even balance between the countries would remain . shift in french power rejected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france allegedly wanted more power at airbus hq " when the french finance minister , breton , ... called on french radio for the 50-50 relationship between germany and france to change to 60-40 in france 's favor , i can reject that emphatically in the name of the german government , " hintze said in a fiery speech to the bundestag . hintze accused breton of seeking to disrupt the delicate balance between the two countries that has existed since eads was formed in july 2000 . the french finance ministry replied to the german outburst hours later , denying that breton had ever called for a rebalancing of the french and german shareholdings .

operating profit before interest and tax slumped from 2.9 billion euros in 2005 to 399 million euros last year , the company added . the drop in profits came despite a 15 percent increase in revenue from 34.2 billion euros to 39.4 billion euros . airbus is currently undergoing a restructuring program , which is expected to result in the loss of 10,000 jobs and the selling off of factories . restructuring a priority , say chiefs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : louis gallois eads co-chairmen louis gallois and thomas enders said friday that implementation of the restructuring program had utmost priority despite the horrendous financial report .

earlier this week , both gallois and enders said in separate statements that the current system was too cumbersome and that the company would benefit from a single president rather than the split role of the two co-chairmen . on friday , the german government announced that it was open to the idea of doing away with the long-standing practice of having twin french and german chief executives at eads . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's thomas enders wants a single eads chief berlin 's coordinator for aeronautics , peter hintze , told members of parliament on thursday that the european aerospace giant could instead distribute posts lower down in the leadership ranks equally between french and german nationals to maintain the power balance . until now the european aeronautic defense and space company has always had a french and a german co-chief executive . simmering row over franco-german ownership if eads were to appoint a single company head , problems would surely arise as to the nationality of the chairman .

" there is no agreement as yet .

" we can not say we came to a conclusion , " european commission president jose manuel barroso told a press conference after the leaders held talks over dinner , " but i really believe a consensus is emerging . " divergent views but while everyone agreed on the need to cut emissions , views obviously diverged on how to achieve this . some newer eu members like the czech republic , hungary and poland depend heavily on carbon-heavy fuels like coal , and oppose setting a mandatory target for the use of renewable energy sources . " the plans are too ambitious in the years to come for poland , " polish president lech kaczynski said .

" pakistan is the preferred destination of terrorists , " hanning said , referring to one of the factors that went into the decision not to allow kurnaz back into germany . during his own testimony on thursday , current bnd head ernst uhrlau , the former secret services coordinator , supported hanning 's evaluation of kurnaz . peculiar spot for quran study bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uhrlau questioned the location kurnaz chose for his study of the quran " the pakistani-afghan border region is not the right spot for peaceful study of the quran , " uhrlau said .
kurnaz has said he had traveled to pakistan to study the quran . a turkish national born in bremen , kurnaz was released from the us military prison at guantanamo bay in cuba in 2006 without being charged , after chancellor angela merkel raised the issue with us president george w. bush .
kurnaz was taken prisoner by american forces in pakistan in 2001 . hanning did not criticize the chancellor 's decision to intervene for " humanitarian reasons " and told the inquiry panel that the circumstances of kurnaz ' imprisonment could be seen in a different light when merkel intervened . did germany do enough for kurnaz ? as former chancellor gerhard schröder 's chief of staff , steinmeier was ultimately responsible for intelligence matters and the kurnaz case has been a stone around his neck as media have reported that germany refused to accept a us offer to release kurnaz in 2002 .
both steinmeier and kurnaz have said no such offer was ever put on the table . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurnaz was released from guantanamo bay in 2006 hanning told parliamentarians that steinmeier was privy to all pertinent information concerning kurnaz . " all of the relevant facts were certainly presented , " hanning said of his meetings with steinmeier .
" my impression was that the intelligence service 's collected knowledge was presented to him . " steinmeier to testify in march during his testimony hanning also disputed the conclusions reached by intelligence service agents who , after interrogating him at guantanamo bay , said kurnaz was taken prisoner for " being in the wrong place at the wrong time . " hanning called their conclusion " flawed and unprofessional " because it did not take into account information from the bremen state interior ministry the investigatory committee delayed hearing testimony from steinmeier by a week , to march 29 , after bremen 's interior ministry unexpectedly released documents needed for the inquiry .
the panel will also hear from former interior minister otto schily on the same day . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us official : germany not keen on release of guantanamo inmate contradicting statements made by german foreign minister steinmeier , a high-ranking former us official has said that german government officials did not try to get german-born murat kurnaz released from guantanamo .
-lrb- 01.03.2007 -rrb- " kurnaz was not a run of the mill case " former german foreign minister joschka fisher said monday that his ministry did all it could to secure the release of a german-born turk held in guantanamo but was blocked by the us government .

but you ca n't say the germans are not trying . placing last in the eurovision song contest is a humiliation that european countries try to avoid like the plague .
germany knows how high the pressure is - especially after its 2005 entry " hide and run " suffered the ignominious fate of placing last with only four sympathy points from monaco and moldova . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jane comerford and texas lightning brought country music to the german charts last year , germany decided to shake things up a bit in europe 's favorite singing contest .
the catchy , though slightly off-the-path , country-western song " no no never " - performed by an aging australian-born singer whose name is not kylie minogue and a band that calls itself texas lightning - was the first grand prix competitor in 50 years that featured an ukulele , a singing lady in pink waving an imaginary lasso and a group of musicians who would eventually be declared honorary citizens of texas by the lonestar state 's own senate . europe was confused .
it voted for lordi - a finnish heavy-metal / horror-film freak show instead .
germany came 15th . healing wounds this is a big year for germany .
with angela merkel heading the eu 's rotating presidency as well as the g8 and fond memories of the world cup success , this would be a perfect time for germany to flex its pop muscles and show some talent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lordi 's song ' ' hard rock hallelujah " won the 2006 eurovision song contest but eurovision is not meant to be enjoyed lightly .
an endless parade of songs followed by an equally never-ending voting process is what makes eurovision a truly unique event - part circus act , part masochism feast . germany , however , organized a national competition in which only three songs were allowed to participate .
putting aside the fact that choosing between three songs on thursday evening resembled elections under a communist dictatorship - put a red star next to the name of the communist party candidate that you think our glorious leader fancies the most - the entire spectacle felt like an one-sentence version of anna karenina : " she was unhappy and jumped under the train . " winners and losers in this unusual eins-zwei-drei affair , two candidates - a 50 year-old-rocker called heinz rudolf kunze and this year 's winners of germany 's popular casting show " popstars , " a girlband called " monrose " - came out as losers .
surely , nobody stamped a big " l " on their foreheads , but pursed mouths and teary eyes after the viewers ' voting results were announced were telling enough . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the monrose girls were let down by their teenage fans heinz rudolf kunze never stood a chance , because , deep down , germans knew that europe was never going to accept a rocker called heinz rudolf .
heinz sounds like mayonnaise and rudolf sounds like a reindeer , not exactly the stuff that rock-and-roll rebels are made of . but where were all those thousands of teenagers who overcharged their cell phones by voting repeatedly during the popstars finals ?
german teenagers are either not very-well acquainted with the country 's public broadcaster ard - the german home of eurovision and other quality programs - or they were too busy watching germany 's next top model - a casting show hosted by supermodel heidi klum on a competing private tv channel . locked-up kids ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roger cicero asked german parents to keep their kids away from their cell phones or maybe german parents listened to the third candidate - 36-year-old jazz singer roger cicero - who pleaded with them in his promotional video to keep the children away from their cell phones .
he thought - like everybody else - that the girlband 's obsessive-compulsive fan base would be a serious threat . it is not clear whether german teenagers ended up grounded , locked up and deprived of their cellular alter egos .
but roger cicero 's swing hit " frauen regieren die welt " -lrb- women rule the world -rrb- reaped all the bouquets on the eve of the international women 's day - surprisingly , but refreshingly so . so here we go again .
germany is experimenting .
it 's playing with eurovision fire .
but who knows ?
swing may end up marching where country music was not allowed to tread .
after all , stranger things have happened in the wacky world of eurotrash glamor .
just look at the finns . toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the best of " from the fringe " germany is certainly facing serious problems , but it 's also important not to forget to laugh once in a while .

-lrb- 09.03.2007 -rrb- finnish monster rockers conquer eurovision finnish heavy metal band lordi kept their promise to " bring rock to eurovision " , handing their country its first title in the annual song contest 's 51-year history with an explosive victory in athens early sunday .

" pakistan is the preferred destination of terrorists , " hanning said , referring to one of the factors that went into the decision not to allow kurnaz back into germany . during his own testimony on thursday , current bnd head ernst uhrlau , the former secret services coordinator , supported hanning 's evaluation of kurnaz . peculiar spot for quran study bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uhrlau questioned the location kurnaz chose for his study of the quran " the pakistani-afghan border region is not the right spot for peaceful study of the quran , " uhrlau said .
kurnaz has said he had traveled to pakistan to study the quran . a turkish national born in bremen , kurnaz was released from the us military prison at guantanamo bay in cuba in 2006 without being charged , after chancellor angela merkel raised the issue with us president george w. bush .
kurnaz was taken prisoner by american forces in pakistan in 2001 . hanning did not criticize the chancellor 's decision to intervene for " humanitarian reasons " and told the inquiry panel that the circumstances of kurnaz ' imprisonment could be seen in a different light when merkel intervened . did germany do enough for kurnaz ? as former chancellor gerhard schröder 's chief of staff , steinmeier was ultimately responsible for intelligence matters and the kurnaz case has been a stone around his neck as media have reported that germany refused to accept a us offer to release kurnaz in 2002 .
both steinmeier and kurnaz have said no such offer was ever put on the table . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurnaz was released from guantanamo bay in 2006 hanning told parliamentarians that steinmeier was privy to all pertinent information concerning kurnaz . " all of the relevant facts were certainly presented , " hanning said of his meetings with steinmeier .
" my impression was that the intelligence service 's collected knowledge was presented to him . " steinmeier to testify in march during his testimony hanning also disputed the conclusions reached by intelligence service agents who , after interrogating him at guantanamo bay , said kurnaz was taken prisoner for " being in the wrong place at the wrong time . " hanning called their conclusion " flawed and unprofessional " because it did not take into account information from the bremen state interior ministry the investigatory committee delayed hearing testimony from steinmeier by a week , to march 29 , after bremen 's interior ministry unexpectedly released documents needed for the inquiry .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de news -pipe- 09.03.2007 germany swings around eurovision in surprising national final großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is sending a swing band to helsinki germany has never fully recovered from its 2005 eurovision debacle when it came last .
but you ca n't say the germans are not trying . placing last in the eurovision song contest is a humiliation that european countries try to avoid like the plague .
germany knows how high the pressure is - especially after its 2005 entry " hide and run " suffered the ignominious fate of placing last with only four sympathy points from monaco and moldova . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jane comerford and texas lightning brought country music to the german charts last year , germany decided to shake things up a bit in europe 's favorite singing contest .
the catchy , though slightly off-the-path , country-western song " no no never " - performed by an aging australian-born singer whose name is not kylie minogue and a band that calls itself texas lightning - was the first grand prix competitor in 50 years that featured an ukulele , a singing lady in pink waving an imaginary lasso and a group of musicians who would eventually be declared honorary citizens of texas by the lonestar state 's own senate . europe was confused .
it voted for lordi - a finnish heavy-metal / horror-film freak show instead .
germany came 15th . healing wounds this is a big year for germany .
with angela merkel heading the eu 's rotating presidency as well as the g8 and fond memories of the world cup success , this would be a perfect time for germany to flex its pop muscles and show some talent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lordi 's song ' ' hard rock hallelujah " won the 2006 eurovision song contest but eurovision is not meant to be enjoyed lightly .
an endless parade of songs followed by an equally never-ending voting process is what makes eurovision a truly unique event - part circus act , part masochism feast . germany , however , organized a national competition in which only three songs were allowed to participate .
putting aside the fact that choosing between three songs on thursday evening resembled elections under a communist dictatorship - put a red star next to the name of the communist party candidate that you think our glorious leader fancies the most - the entire spectacle felt like an one-sentence version of anna karenina : " she was unhappy and jumped under the train . " winners and losers in this unusual eins-zwei-drei affair , two candidates - a 50 year-old-rocker called heinz rudolf kunze and this year 's winners of germany 's popular casting show " popstars , " a girlband called " monrose " - came out as losers .
surely , nobody stamped a big " l " on their foreheads , but pursed mouths and teary eyes after the viewers ' voting results were announced were telling enough . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the monrose girls were let down by their teenage fans heinz rudolf kunze never stood a chance , because , deep down , germans knew that europe was never going to accept a rocker called heinz rudolf .
heinz sounds like mayonnaise and rudolf sounds like a reindeer , not exactly the stuff that rock-and-roll rebels are made of . but where were all those thousands of teenagers who overcharged their cell phones by voting repeatedly during the popstars finals ?
german teenagers are either not very-well acquainted with the country 's public broadcaster ard - the german home of eurovision and other quality programs - or they were too busy watching germany 's next top model - a casting show hosted by supermodel heidi klum on a competing private tv channel . locked-up kids ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roger cicero asked german parents to keep their kids away from their cell phones or maybe german parents listened to the third candidate - 36-year-old jazz singer roger cicero - who pleaded with them in his promotional video to keep the children away from their cell phones .
he thought - like everybody else - that the girlband 's obsessive-compulsive fan base would be a serious threat . it is not clear whether german teenagers ended up grounded , locked up and deprived of their cellular alter egos .
but roger cicero 's swing hit " frauen regieren die welt " -lrb- women rule the world -rrb- reaped all the bouquets on the eve of the international women 's day - surprisingly , but refreshingly so . so here we go again .
germany is experimenting .
it 's playing with eurovision fire .
but who knows ?
swing may end up marching where country music was not allowed to tread .
after all , stranger things have happened in the wacky world of eurotrash glamor .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de news -pipe- 09.03.2007 germany swings around eurovision in surprising national final großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is sending a swing band to helsinki germany has never fully recovered from its 2005 eurovision debacle when it came last .
but you ca n't say the germans are not trying . placing last in the eurovision song contest is a humiliation that european countries try to avoid like the plague .
germany knows how high the pressure is - especially after its 2005 entry " hide and run " suffered the ignominious fate of placing last with only four sympathy points from monaco and moldova . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jane comerford and texas lightning brought country music to the german charts last year , germany decided to shake things up a bit in europe 's favorite singing contest .
the catchy , though slightly off-the-path , country-western song " no no never " - performed by an aging australian-born singer whose name is not kylie minogue and a band that calls itself texas lightning - was the first grand prix competitor in 50 years that featured an ukulele , a singing lady in pink waving an imaginary lasso and a group of musicians who would eventually be declared honorary citizens of texas by the lonestar state 's own senate . europe was confused .
it voted for lordi - a finnish heavy-metal / horror-film freak show instead .
germany came 15th . healing wounds this is a big year for germany .
with angela merkel heading the eu 's rotating presidency as well as the g8 and fond memories of the world cup success , this would be a perfect time for germany to flex its pop muscles and show some talent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lordi 's song ' ' hard rock hallelujah " won the 2006 eurovision song contest but eurovision is not meant to be enjoyed lightly .
an endless parade of songs followed by an equally never-ending voting process is what makes eurovision a truly unique event - part circus act , part masochism feast . germany , however , organized a national competition in which only three songs were allowed to participate .
putting aside the fact that choosing between three songs on thursday evening resembled elections under a communist dictatorship - put a red star next to the name of the communist party candidate that you think our glorious leader fancies the most - the entire spectacle felt like an one-sentence version of anna karenina : " she was unhappy and jumped under the train . " winners and losers in this unusual eins-zwei-drei affair , two candidates - a 50 year-old-rocker called heinz rudolf kunze and this year 's winners of germany 's popular casting show " popstars , " a girlband called " monrose " - came out as losers .
surely , nobody stamped a big " l " on their foreheads , but pursed mouths and teary eyes after the viewers ' voting results were announced were telling enough . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the monrose girls were let down by their teenage fans heinz rudolf kunze never stood a chance , because , deep down , germans knew that europe was never going to accept a rocker called heinz rudolf .
heinz sounds like mayonnaise and rudolf sounds like a reindeer , not exactly the stuff that rock-and-roll rebels are made of . but where were all those thousands of teenagers who overcharged their cell phones by voting repeatedly during the popstars finals ?
german teenagers are either not very-well acquainted with the country 's public broadcaster ard - the german home of eurovision and other quality programs - or they were too busy watching germany 's next top model - a casting show hosted by supermodel heidi klum on a competing private tv channel . locked-up kids ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roger cicero asked german parents to keep their kids away from their cell phones or maybe german parents listened to the third candidate - 36-year-old jazz singer roger cicero - who pleaded with them in his promotional video to keep the children away from their cell phones .
he thought - like everybody else - that the girlband 's obsessive-compulsive fan base would be a serious threat . it is not clear whether german teenagers ended up grounded , locked up and deprived of their cellular alter egos .
but roger cicero 's swing hit " frauen regieren die welt " -lrb- women rule the world -rrb- reaped all the bouquets on the eve of the international women 's day - surprisingly , but refreshingly so . so here we go again .
germany is experimenting .
it 's playing with eurovision fire .
but who knows ?
swing may end up marching where country music was not allowed to tread .
after all , stranger things have happened in the wacky world of eurotrash glamor .

" pakistan is the preferred destination of terrorists , " hanning said , referring to one of the factors that went into the decision not to allow kurnaz back into germany . during his own testimony on thursday , current bnd head ernst uhrlau , the former secret services coordinator , supported hanning 's evaluation of kurnaz . peculiar spot for quran study bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uhrlau questioned the location kurnaz chose for his study of the quran " the pakistani-afghan border region is not the right spot for peaceful study of the quran , " uhrlau said .
kurnaz has said he had traveled to pakistan to study the quran . a turkish national born in bremen , kurnaz was released from the us military prison at guantanamo bay in cuba in 2006 without being charged , after chancellor angela merkel raised the issue with us president george w. bush .
kurnaz was taken prisoner by american forces in pakistan in 2001 . hanning did not criticize the chancellor 's decision to intervene for " humanitarian reasons " and told the inquiry panel that the circumstances of kurnaz ' imprisonment could be seen in a different light when merkel intervened . did germany do enough for kurnaz ? as former chancellor gerhard schröder 's chief of staff , steinmeier was ultimately responsible for intelligence matters and the kurnaz case has been a stone around his neck as media have reported that germany refused to accept a us offer to release kurnaz in 2002 .
both steinmeier and kurnaz have said no such offer was ever put on the table . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurnaz was released from guantanamo bay in 2006 hanning told parliamentarians that steinmeier was privy to all pertinent information concerning kurnaz . " all of the relevant facts were certainly presented , " hanning said of his meetings with steinmeier .
" my impression was that the intelligence service 's collected knowledge was presented to him . " steinmeier to testify in march during his testimony hanning also disputed the conclusions reached by intelligence service agents who , after interrogating him at guantanamo bay , said kurnaz was taken prisoner for " being in the wrong place at the wrong time . " hanning called their conclusion " flawed and unprofessional " because it did not take into account information from the bremen state interior ministry the investigatory committee delayed hearing testimony from steinmeier by a week , to march 29 , after bremen 's interior ministry unexpectedly released documents needed for the inquiry .

it voted for lordi - a finnish heavy-metal / horror-film freak show instead .
germany came 15th . healing wounds this is a big year for germany .
with angela merkel heading the eu 's rotating presidency as well as the g8 and fond memories of the world cup success , this would be a perfect time for germany to flex its pop muscles and show some talent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lordi 's song ' ' hard rock hallelujah " won the 2006 eurovision song contest but eurovision is not meant to be enjoyed lightly .

surely , nobody stamped a big " l " on their foreheads , but pursed mouths and teary eyes after the viewers ' voting results were announced were telling enough . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the monrose girls were let down by their teenage fans heinz rudolf kunze never stood a chance , because , deep down , germans knew that europe was never going to accept a rocker called heinz rudolf .
heinz sounds like mayonnaise and rudolf sounds like a reindeer , not exactly the stuff that rock-and-roll rebels are made of . but where were all those thousands of teenagers who overcharged their cell phones by voting repeatedly during the popstars finals ?
german teenagers are either not very-well acquainted with the country 's public broadcaster ard - the german home of eurovision and other quality programs - or they were too busy watching germany 's next top model - a casting show hosted by supermodel heidi klum on a competing private tv channel . locked-up kids ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roger cicero asked german parents to keep their kids away from their cell phones or maybe german parents listened to the third candidate - 36-year-old jazz singer roger cicero - who pleaded with them in his promotional video to keep the children away from their cell phones .
he thought - like everybody else - that the girlband 's obsessive-compulsive fan base would be a serious threat . it is not clear whether german teenagers ended up grounded , locked up and deprived of their cellular alter egos .
but roger cicero 's swing hit " frauen regieren die welt " -lrb- women rule the world -rrb- reaped all the bouquets on the eve of the international women 's day - surprisingly , but refreshingly so . so here we go again .

surely , nobody stamped a big " l " on their foreheads , but pursed mouths and teary eyes after the viewers ' voting results were announced were telling enough . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the monrose girls were let down by their teenage fans heinz rudolf kunze never stood a chance , because , deep down , germans knew that europe was never going to accept a rocker called heinz rudolf .
heinz sounds like mayonnaise and rudolf sounds like a reindeer , not exactly the stuff that rock-and-roll rebels are made of . but where were all those thousands of teenagers who overcharged their cell phones by voting repeatedly during the popstars finals ?
german teenagers are either not very-well acquainted with the country 's public broadcaster ard - the german home of eurovision and other quality programs - or they were too busy watching germany 's next top model - a casting show hosted by supermodel heidi klum on a competing private tv channel . locked-up kids ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roger cicero asked german parents to keep their kids away from their cell phones or maybe german parents listened to the third candidate - 36-year-old jazz singer roger cicero - who pleaded with them in his promotional video to keep the children away from their cell phones .
he thought - like everybody else - that the girlband 's obsessive-compulsive fan base would be a serious threat . it is not clear whether german teenagers ended up grounded , locked up and deprived of their cellular alter egos .
but roger cicero 's swing hit " frauen regieren die welt " -lrb- women rule the world -rrb- reaped all the bouquets on the eve of the international women 's day - surprisingly , but refreshingly so . so here we go again .
germany is experimenting .
it 's playing with eurovision fire .
but who knows ?
swing may end up marching where country music was not allowed to tread .
after all , stranger things have happened in the wacky world of eurotrash glamor .

großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women still need to fight discrimination at work women need to think bigger when it comes to their demands , argues faith dennis on international women 's day .
and they need to stop imitating men and make it their own way . yesterday was march the 8th , international woman ’ s day .
i was my home from having dinner with a friend when i came across a police car with flashing lights blocking off a busy street in kreuzberg , where i live .
an accident was my first thought , until i spotted a riot van , and group of 20 women staging a demonstration , surrounded by an even smaller bunch of , mostly male , onlookers .
i , too , thought i would stop and have a look to see what exactly they were protesting against , although assuming it would be quite obvious , given it was woman ’ s day and their banners all had the female symbol painted on them . where 's the power struggle ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is it time to stop playing by male rules ?
stepping closer , however , i noticed the slogan in big letters across the main fabric banner , which said : “ wir geben die macht nicht auf ! ” which translates as “ we won ’ t give up power . ”
this i didn ’ t quite understand - “ we want more power ” would have made more sense , surely ?
is there a power struggle at the top that i am not aware of ?
germany does have a female chancellor and good equal opportunity initiatives in the realm of business , but as far as i understand , the problems in equality are often glossed over by reports in the media that show rising figures of women in employment , rather than illustrating the difference in salaries between men and woman working in the same jobs .
in germany , women still earn 22 percent less than their male counterparts in the same positions . women struggle to be themselves in business woman in high level management positions are also harder to find and when women do reach the top , it is usually through major sacrifices .
i am not just talking about sacrifices in their family and home lives , but rather sacrifices in their very " being , " to put it philosophically . a prime example of this is a newspaper article i read recently about women taking the male hormone testosterone in order to be able to be more aggressive and " manly " in the workplace to be able to keep hold of their positions of power .
one woman admitted that she knew the drug was having harmful physical side effects , but stated it was the only way she could receive the desired recognition she felt she needed to survive in a male working environment . stop trying to be one of the boys bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hegel has the answers !
hegel , one of the founding fathers of social theory , states that all desires are based on a desire for recognition , and it is only through this experience of recognition that we can become socially viable human beings .
however , in the above case and many others , this recognition is based on being " manly " or having " masculine traits . "
the norm is thus set by homogeneity , excluding not just for women , but also for anyone who falls outside the " manly " category .
until we can find a formula for success in business which is non-gender specific , women should not be concerned with " giving up power , " but pointing out that power can achieved through embracing the differences between men and women as positive attributes and a viable alternative to the current ideal . faith dennis send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de read faith 's earlier columns shop ‘ til you bop faith never was a big fan of buying used knick-knacks and antiques - until she visited a unique night-time flea market in berlin kreuzberg .

the row is raging against a backdrop of terrible losses airbus parent company eads had more bad news for its sick aviation subsidiary when the first operating loss in its history was announced .
this was compounded by new , related tensions between germany and france . airbus parent company eads reported on thursday that its ailing aviation subsidiary , currently in turmoil over job cuts and delays to its new flagship a380 superjumbo , suffered its first-ever operating loss of 572 million euros -lrb- $ 752 million -rrb- in 2006 and was expected to suffer further losses in 2007 . the restructuring costs for airbus ' a380 superjumbo have been cited as the main cause for the forecasted " substantial " operating loss for 2007 along with the problems arising from the adaptation of the popular a350 to the upgraded a350xwb jet .
in 2005 , airbus achieved a profit of 2.3 billion euros . eads announced at the presentation of its annual results in munich that net profit for 2006 plunged to 99 million euros from 1.8 billion euros the previous year .
operating profit before interest and tax slumped from 2.9 billion euros in 2005 to 399 million euros last year , the company added . the drop in profits came despite a 15 percent increase in revenue from 34.2 billion euros to 39.4 billion euros . airbus is currently undergoing a restructuring program , which is expected to result in the loss of 10,000 jobs and the selling off of factories . restructuring a priority , say chiefs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : louis gallois eads co-chairmen louis gallois and thomas enders said friday that implementation of the restructuring program had utmost priority despite the horrendous financial report .
they said the company needed to improve its operating performance , regain the confidence of clients and turn itself into a lean , dynamic operation . one of the main aspects eads is looking into in terms of streamlining is the abolition of a two-headed senior management team .
earlier this week , both gallois and enders said in separate statements that the current system was too cumbersome and that the company would benefit from a single president rather than the split role of the two co-chairmen . on friday , the german government announced that it was open to the idea of doing away with the long-standing practice of having twin french and german chief executives at eads . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's thomas enders wants a single eads chief berlin 's coordinator for aeronautics , peter hintze , told members of parliament on thursday that the european aerospace giant could instead distribute posts lower down in the leadership ranks equally between french and german nationals to maintain the power balance . until now the european aeronautic defense and space company has always had a french and a german co-chief executive . simmering row over franco-german ownership if eads were to appoint a single company head , problems would surely arise as to the nationality of the chairman .
if either gallois nor enders were to be appointed sole chief , the simmering animosity between france and germany would surely erupt , with the country losing its chairman also perceivably losing a considerable amount of influence in the company . the current conflict between the two countries over eads bubbled to the surface again on thursday after french finance minister thierry breton said his country should have taken a bigger share in airbus parent eads at the firm 's creation . hintze responded to breton 's claim by saying germany would ensure the even balance between the countries would remain . shift in french power rejected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france allegedly wanted more power at airbus hq " when the french finance minister , breton , ... called on french radio for the 50-50 relationship between germany and france to change to 60-40 in france 's favor , i can reject that emphatically in the name of the german government , " hintze said in a fiery speech to the bundestag . hintze accused breton of seeking to disrupt the delicate balance between the two countries that has existed since eads was formed in july 2000 . the french finance ministry replied to the german outburst hours later , denying that breton had ever called for a rebalancing of the french and german shareholdings .

i 'm not without hope , " she added . the 27 heads of state and government resolved to seek a compromise deal on friday morning . the main sticking point to the plan , which aims to reduce emissions of the greenhouse gases that cause global warming , centered on some member countries ' reluctance to agree to firm goals for the future use of renewable energy . merkel , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency , wants the 27-nation bloc to commit to a binding target that 20 percent of eu energy needs should be met by renewable sources by 2020 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel wants the eu to lead the way on green issues " we talked about specific obligations - increasing energy efficiency , biofuels , renewable energy .
there is a need for further discussion on these three areas , " said merkel .
" some member states were asking : ' are we really going to achieve these goals ? " ' she added . in an effort to limit the rise in average global temperatures to two degrees celsius above pre-industrial era levels , the eu leaders are being asked to commit to cut carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- emissions by 20 percent by 2020 , from 1990 levels .
plenty of haggling ahead to entice the rest of the world to take bigger steps , the eu will offer to slash the emissions by a further 10 percent if nations like the united states , china and india also agree to take concrete steps . if a deal is reached friday there is still plenty of haggling ahead on what measures each eu nation will have to take to achieve the 20 percent average in co2 cuts . the eu member states have some time to make those decisions , as the kyoto protocol on climate change lays down targets until 2012 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : newer eu member states are reliant on carbon-heavy fuels like coal the eu hopes that a strong initiative here will provide impetus for the next g8 summit of industrialized nations in germany in june . before the summit began , merkel warned that the eu 's credibility hung on the bloc 's ability to agree on specific , long term goals for fighting global warming that other nations could emulate . " we can not say we came to a conclusion , " european commission president jose manuel barroso told a press conference after the leaders held talks over dinner , " but i really believe a consensus is emerging . " divergent views but while everyone agreed on the need to cut emissions , views obviously diverged on how to achieve this . some newer eu members like the czech republic , hungary and poland depend heavily on carbon-heavy fuels like coal , and oppose setting a mandatory target for the use of renewable energy sources . " the plans are too ambitious in the years to come for poland , " polish president lech kaczynski said .
" if we have a flexible approach ... then a compromise solution would be possible . " at the other end of the spectrum lay denmark , which claims that its economy has thrived even as it moves to newer , more sustainable energy sources . " i think the european union should go green and to that end we need binding targets , " said danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen . embracing nuclear power ? france has said that it would accept the use of the word " binding , " but in return french president jacques chirac has demanded that nuclear energy be brought into the plan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel appeared ready to give in to chirac on nuclear energy merkel said that atomic power , which meets 40 percent of french energy needs , could be included in the eu 's ambitious scheme to reduce carbon emissions . " this overall reduction of 20 percent will also depend on the question of how to use cleaner coal technology , it could possibly include nuclear energy , " she conceded . german officials were preparing a new draft document for the leaders to consider again early friday , when they gather at european council headquarters from 10:00 cet . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german carmakers rev up effort to enter hybrid market amid increasing consumer awareness of global warming and other environmental issues , german carmakers have had to fight off growing criticism about their apparent lack of will to build environmentally friendly cars .

großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women still need to fight discrimination at work women need to think bigger when it comes to their demands , argues faith dennis on international women 's day .
and they need to stop imitating men and make it their own way . yesterday was march the 8th , international woman ’ s day .
i was my home from having dinner with a friend when i came across a police car with flashing lights blocking off a busy street in kreuzberg , where i live .
an accident was my first thought , until i spotted a riot van , and group of 20 women staging a demonstration , surrounded by an even smaller bunch of , mostly male , onlookers .
i , too , thought i would stop and have a look to see what exactly they were protesting against , although assuming it would be quite obvious , given it was woman ’ s day and their banners all had the female symbol painted on them . where 's the power struggle ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is it time to stop playing by male rules ?
stepping closer , however , i noticed the slogan in big letters across the main fabric banner , which said : “ wir geben die macht nicht auf ! ” which translates as “ we won ’ t give up power . ”
this i didn ’ t quite understand - “ we want more power ” would have made more sense , surely ?
is there a power struggle at the top that i am not aware of ?
germany does have a female chancellor and good equal opportunity initiatives in the realm of business , but as far as i understand , the problems in equality are often glossed over by reports in the media that show rising figures of women in employment , rather than illustrating the difference in salaries between men and woman working in the same jobs .
in germany , women still earn 22 percent less than their male counterparts in the same positions . women struggle to be themselves in business woman in high level management positions are also harder to find and when women do reach the top , it is usually through major sacrifices .
i am not just talking about sacrifices in their family and home lives , but rather sacrifices in their very " being , " to put it philosophically . a prime example of this is a newspaper article i read recently about women taking the male hormone testosterone in order to be able to be more aggressive and " manly " in the workplace to be able to keep hold of their positions of power .
one woman admitted that she knew the drug was having harmful physical side effects , but stated it was the only way she could receive the desired recognition she felt she needed to survive in a male working environment . stop trying to be one of the boys bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hegel has the answers !
hegel , one of the founding fathers of social theory , states that all desires are based on a desire for recognition , and it is only through this experience of recognition that we can become socially viable human beings .
however , in the above case and many others , this recognition is based on being " manly " or having " masculine traits . "
the norm is thus set by homogeneity , excluding not just for women , but also for anyone who falls outside the " manly " category .
until we can find a formula for success in business which is non-gender specific , women should not be concerned with " giving up power , " but pointing out that power can achieved through embracing the differences between men and women as positive attributes and a viable alternative to the current ideal . faith dennis send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de read faith 's earlier columns shop ‘ til you bop faith never was a big fan of buying used knick-knacks and antiques - until she visited a unique night-time flea market in berlin kreuzberg .

the jets are expected to be dispatched in april . the bundesrat or the upper house of parliament will likely vote on the deployment this month . opposition deputies claimed the decision would drag german forces into combat in the south of afghanistan where nato this week launched an offensive against the taliban . germany has around 3,000 troops in the landlocked asian nation , mostly working in civilian-military provincial reconstruction teams in the relatively peaceful north . nato has some 35,000 soldiers in afghanistan , which has recently seen an increase in attacks by remnants of the taliban . deployment clouded by killing of aid worker bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's minister for cooperation and development heidemarie wieczorek-zeul the vote was overshadowed by the killing of a german engineer on thursday - the first german aid worker killed in afghanistan since us forces ousted the taliban in 2001 . development assistance minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul said that the assistance provided by aid workers in afghanistan deserved respect and gratitude , and would continue despite thursday 's tragic event . the minister called on the afghan government to discover who was behind the slaying of dieter rübling , 65 , and bring the assailants to justice . afghan police on friday arrested six people on suspicion of involvement in the killing , which took place in the province of sar-e-pul where the engineer was on an inspection tour . an afghan official said that more than 100 additional police were sent to the area to track down the culprits as part of a joint investigation with the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- . ideological motives bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato launched a new offensive in afghanistan this week rübling - who worked for a non-denominational bonn-based aid foundation , deutsche welthungerhilfe , which uses the english name agro action - was traveling with his afghan colleagues .
their convoy was attacked by a group of armed men , who let the afghans go before shooting the german . agro action secretary general joachim preuss said the engineer was on a three-month tour of duty in afghanistan and had many years of experience in international development aid projects . preuss said it appeared " ideological motives " were behind the murder and not criminal actions . afghan president hamid karzai on friday " strongly condemned " the murder of the german aid worker .

großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women still need to fight discrimination at work women need to think bigger when it comes to their demands , argues faith dennis on international women 's day .
and they need to stop imitating men and make it their own way . yesterday was march the 8th , international woman ’ s day .
i was my home from having dinner with a friend when i came across a police car with flashing lights blocking off a busy street in kreuzberg , where i live .
an accident was my first thought , until i spotted a riot van , and group of 20 women staging a demonstration , surrounded by an even smaller bunch of , mostly male , onlookers .
i , too , thought i would stop and have a look to see what exactly they were protesting against , although assuming it would be quite obvious , given it was woman ’ s day and their banners all had the female symbol painted on them . where 's the power struggle ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is it time to stop playing by male rules ?
stepping closer , however , i noticed the slogan in big letters across the main fabric banner , which said : “ wir geben die macht nicht auf ! ” which translates as “ we won ’ t give up power . ”
this i didn ’ t quite understand - “ we want more power ” would have made more sense , surely ?
is there a power struggle at the top that i am not aware of ?
germany does have a female chancellor and good equal opportunity initiatives in the realm of business , but as far as i understand , the problems in equality are often glossed over by reports in the media that show rising figures of women in employment , rather than illustrating the difference in salaries between men and woman working in the same jobs .
in germany , women still earn 22 percent less than their male counterparts in the same positions . women struggle to be themselves in business woman in high level management positions are also harder to find and when women do reach the top , it is usually through major sacrifices .
i am not just talking about sacrifices in their family and home lives , but rather sacrifices in their very " being , " to put it philosophically . a prime example of this is a newspaper article i read recently about women taking the male hormone testosterone in order to be able to be more aggressive and " manly " in the workplace to be able to keep hold of their positions of power .
one woman admitted that she knew the drug was having harmful physical side effects , but stated it was the only way she could receive the desired recognition she felt she needed to survive in a male working environment . stop trying to be one of the boys bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hegel has the answers !
hegel , one of the founding fathers of social theory , states that all desires are based on a desire for recognition , and it is only through this experience of recognition that we can become socially viable human beings .
however , in the above case and many others , this recognition is based on being " manly " or having " masculine traits . "
the norm is thus set by homogeneity , excluding not just for women , but also for anyone who falls outside the " manly " category .
until we can find a formula for success in business which is non-gender specific , women should not be concerned with " giving up power , " but pointing out that power can achieved through embracing the differences between men and women as positive attributes and a viable alternative to the current ideal . faith dennis send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de read faith 's earlier columns shop ‘ til you bop faith never was a big fan of buying used knick-knacks and antiques - until she visited a unique night-time flea market in berlin kreuzberg .

i , too , thought i would stop and have a look to see what exactly they were protesting against , although assuming it would be quite obvious , given it was woman ’ s day and their banners all had the female symbol painted on them . where 's the power struggle ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is it time to stop playing by male rules ?
stepping closer , however , i noticed the slogan in big letters across the main fabric banner , which said : “ wir geben die macht nicht auf ! ” which translates as “ we won ’ t give up power . ”
this i didn ’ t quite understand - “ we want more power ” would have made more sense , surely ?
is there a power struggle at the top that i am not aware of ?
germany does have a female chancellor and good equal opportunity initiatives in the realm of business , but as far as i understand , the problems in equality are often glossed over by reports in the media that show rising figures of women in employment , rather than illustrating the difference in salaries between men and woman working in the same jobs .
in germany , women still earn 22 percent less than their male counterparts in the same positions . women struggle to be themselves in business woman in high level management positions are also harder to find and when women do reach the top , it is usually through major sacrifices .
i am not just talking about sacrifices in their family and home lives , but rather sacrifices in their very " being , " to put it philosophically . a prime example of this is a newspaper article i read recently about women taking the male hormone testosterone in order to be able to be more aggressive and " manly " in the workplace to be able to keep hold of their positions of power .
one woman admitted that she knew the drug was having harmful physical side effects , but stated it was the only way she could receive the desired recognition she felt she needed to survive in a male working environment . stop trying to be one of the boys bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hegel has the answers !
hegel , one of the founding fathers of social theory , states that all desires are based on a desire for recognition , and it is only through this experience of recognition that we can become socially viable human beings .
however , in the above case and many others , this recognition is based on being " manly " or having " masculine traits . "
the norm is thus set by homogeneity , excluding not just for women , but also for anyone who falls outside the " manly " category .
until we can find a formula for success in business which is non-gender specific , women should not be concerned with " giving up power , " but pointing out that power can achieved through embracing the differences between men and women as positive attributes and a viable alternative to the current ideal . faith dennis send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de read faith 's earlier columns shop ‘ til you bop faith never was a big fan of buying used knick-knacks and antiques - until she visited a unique night-time flea market in berlin kreuzberg .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 09.03.2007 eu leaders seek to break deadlock on climate change deal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu leaders may agree on setting binding targets for renewable energy eu leaders hope to seal a landmark agreement on tackling climate change on friday , after a row over setting binding targets for renewable energy scuppered their first attempt at a summit in brussels . " there is no agreement as yet .
we 've all got to show a little patience , " german chancellor angela merkel told reporters late thursday after chairing the opening session of the two-day summit . " we need to find common ground .
i 'm not without hope , " she added . the 27 heads of state and government resolved to seek a compromise deal on friday morning . the main sticking point to the plan , which aims to reduce emissions of the greenhouse gases that cause global warming , centered on some member countries ' reluctance to agree to firm goals for the future use of renewable energy . merkel , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency , wants the 27-nation bloc to commit to a binding target that 20 percent of eu energy needs should be met by renewable sources by 2020 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel wants the eu to lead the way on green issues " we talked about specific obligations - increasing energy efficiency , biofuels , renewable energy .
there is a need for further discussion on these three areas , " said merkel .
" some member states were asking : ' are we really going to achieve these goals ? " ' she added . in an effort to limit the rise in average global temperatures to two degrees celsius above pre-industrial era levels , the eu leaders are being asked to commit to cut carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- emissions by 20 percent by 2020 , from 1990 levels .
plenty of haggling ahead to entice the rest of the world to take bigger steps , the eu will offer to slash the emissions by a further 10 percent if nations like the united states , china and india also agree to take concrete steps . if a deal is reached friday there is still plenty of haggling ahead on what measures each eu nation will have to take to achieve the 20 percent average in co2 cuts . the eu member states have some time to make those decisions , as the kyoto protocol on climate change lays down targets until 2012 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : newer eu member states are reliant on carbon-heavy fuels like coal the eu hopes that a strong initiative here will provide impetus for the next g8 summit of industrialized nations in germany in june . before the summit began , merkel warned that the eu 's credibility hung on the bloc 's ability to agree on specific , long term goals for fighting global warming that other nations could emulate . " we can not say we came to a conclusion , " european commission president jose manuel barroso told a press conference after the leaders held talks over dinner , " but i really believe a consensus is emerging . " divergent views but while everyone agreed on the need to cut emissions , views obviously diverged on how to achieve this . some newer eu members like the czech republic , hungary and poland depend heavily on carbon-heavy fuels like coal , and oppose setting a mandatory target for the use of renewable energy sources . " the plans are too ambitious in the years to come for poland , " polish president lech kaczynski said .
" if we have a flexible approach ... then a compromise solution would be possible . " at the other end of the spectrum lay denmark , which claims that its economy has thrived even as it moves to newer , more sustainable energy sources .

" you can " stumble " anytime and anywhere in berlin . whether stepping out to pick up a carton of milk or on the way home from work , you ’ re bound to notice the " stumbling-stones " -lrb- stolpersteine -rrb- , small brass-capped squares laid flush with berlin ’ s stone sidewalks . one stumbles psychologically , not literally , for inscribed into their surface is the name , and - as far as is known - the dates of birth , deportation , and death of a former jewish inhabitant of the dwelling alongside the stone . the brainchild of artist gunter demnig , the miniature memorials must be privately sponsored at a cost of roughly 95 euros -lrb- $ 125 -rrb- and have caught on as an effective way to personalize the enormity of the holocaust . after " stumbling " dozens of times over berlin ’ s roughly 900 miniature memorials , i became eager to talk to individuals who funded the stones , which are created and inlaid by the artist himself . a phone call to my neighborhood ’ s stumbling-stone coordination center puts me in touch with a local couple .
i am set to meet sponsors of the latest memory trend . pasta and the past richard and elke hoffmann * greet me at one of berlin ’ s thousand cheap italian restaurants , chosen so we could talk at length without worrying someone else will be waiting for our table . the conversation quickly turns from vodka penne to vergangenheitsbewältigung , or " coming to terms with the past . " mr. hoffmann believes in the controversial " collective guilt " theory popularized after a 1981 speech by israeli prime minister menachem begin . the theory holds that all germans as an entire people are guilty for the crimes of nazi germany . a prevailing counter to the " collective guilt " theory runs that german society is not collectively guilty but rather collectively responsible ; as witnesses to the terrible history and heirs to its consequences , they can help ensure it does not happen again . while mr. hoffmann agrees with this responsibility , he nonetheless sees the nation as categorically culpable , a feeling that informed his desire to sponsor a stumbling-stone . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : artist gunter demnig produces the stones " with this stone , i ’ m accepting a small piece of the guilt of our people .
the guilt that i inherited . i take on this guilt in recognition of the terrible crimes we have committed , " he explains to me slowly and carefully , as though describing a logical proof . a shocking bakery visit mrs. hoffmann expands on their reasons , bringing up an incident from their 1974 trip to israel , when they stopped in a bakery for a snack . " i wanted to buy a pastry and the woman behind the counter had blue numbers tattooed here . " mrs. hoffmann points to her arm . " when she heard us speaking german she just gasped and then couldn ’ t breathe . she froze , completely transported by horrible memories . " this encounter with a concentration camp survivor stayed with mrs. hoffmann for decades .
" i had to face what my people did , " she says . " and for me , the stumbling-stone is a way of dealing with this .
it ’ s a small gesture of humanity towards the victims . " the hoffmanns ’ stumbling-stone commemorates an elderly woman deported to theresienstadt and killed in october 1942 .
it lies not far from our restaurant , where the woman resided at the time of deportation . laying more stones " we came upon them the same way you did , " explains mr. hoffmann .
" we noticed them here and there throughout the city , and at some point we thought , ‘ that ’ s something we ’ d like to do . we ’ d like to sponsor a stone . ’ " they were able to turn their desire into action when mrs. hoffmann read a newspaper article with information about the local office that coordinates with the artist . she called to inquire , and ten months later , the stone was set . the hoffmanns would like to do more . after reading about the former jewish neighborhood in venice , where the term " ghetto " originated , the idea of laying a stumbling-stone there appealed to them . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for sponsors , the stones offer a way to acknowledge past horrors mrs. hoffmann takes out a travel guide and opens to a map depicting giudecca island , former home of the giudei , or jews .
the cartographic neutrality of the land mass , shaped like a bread crust lying in a soup of venetian canals , does not betray the cramped conditions under which jews once lived . " i have to research myself if there were jews living there at the time of the second world war , and if they got deported , as well as finding the names and dates , " says mrs. hoffmann . " we ’ re not sure if everything is recorded , either , " mr. hoffmann adds .
" germans like to write everything down , but other countries might not have . " he is referring to the astoundingly precise german documentation of their crimes , right down to careful inventories of homes from which jews were deported . " be sure you know why " despite this tactical obstacle , the hoffmanns believe strongly that in what they are doing , stating emphatically that only by remembering can one avoid repeating past mistakes .

" it has been possible to , as it were , open the door to a new dimension of european cooperation for years to come in the area of energy and combating climate change , " merkel said . the accord 's overarching achievement is to commit the 27-country bloc to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 20 percent by 2020 , when compared to 1990 levels . the pact also obliges member countries to make renewable energies , such as solar and wind power , the source of 20 percent of the total energy consumption on average across the eu by 2020 . " these are a set of ground-breaking , bold ambitious targets for the european union , " said british prime minister tony blair , who pushed hard for a climate agreement .
" it gives europe a very clear leadership position on this crucial issue facing the world . " each according to its ability bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said europe needs to stick to the goals it has set itself the talks in brussels had broken up overnight during the two-day conference with divisions over setting a " binding " target for the use of renewable energy sources .
the leaders , however , agreed on a compromise that accords member states some flexibility in meeting national goals . countries like poland and the czech republic are heavily dependent on carbon energy sources such as coal and had complained that the binding renewable energies target was overly ambitious and prohibitively expensive .
france , on the other hand , had insisted on including nuclear energy among the list of environmentally friendly options . to bring the opposing states on board , the agreement stressed that " differentiated national overall targets " would be set , " with due regard to a fair and adequate allocation " taking into account the potential of each member state . thus , those countries whose exploitation of renewable energies is already well advanced would take up the slack left by the others to ensure the overall wide target is met across the bloc . leverage against non-eu polluters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is willing to cut co2 emissions more if other nations do so as well merkel said the pact gave her a mandate to press major world polluters into action , as the eu would offer to reduce emissions of the gases that cause global warming by an additional 10 percent by 2020 if those countries would do so as well .

i am set to meet sponsors of the latest memory trend . pasta and the past richard and elke hoffmann * greet me at one of berlin ’ s thousand cheap italian restaurants , chosen so we could talk at length without worrying someone else will be waiting for our table . the conversation quickly turns from vodka penne to vergangenheitsbewältigung , or " coming to terms with the past . " mr. hoffmann believes in the controversial " collective guilt " theory popularized after a 1981 speech by israeli prime minister menachem begin . the theory holds that all germans as an entire people are guilty for the crimes of nazi germany . a prevailing counter to the " collective guilt " theory runs that german society is not collectively guilty but rather collectively responsible ; as witnesses to the terrible history and heirs to its consequences , they can help ensure it does not happen again . while mr. hoffmann agrees with this responsibility , he nonetheless sees the nation as categorically culpable , a feeling that informed his desire to sponsor a stumbling-stone . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : artist gunter demnig produces the stones " with this stone , i ’ m accepting a small piece of the guilt of our people .

it ’ s a small gesture of humanity towards the victims . " the hoffmanns ’ stumbling-stone commemorates an elderly woman deported to theresienstadt and killed in october 1942 .
it lies not far from our restaurant , where the woman resided at the time of deportation . laying more stones " we came upon them the same way you did , " explains mr. hoffmann .
" we noticed them here and there throughout the city , and at some point we thought , ‘ that ’ s something we ’ d like to do . we ’ d like to sponsor a stone . ’ " they were able to turn their desire into action when mrs. hoffmann read a newspaper article with information about the local office that coordinates with the artist . she called to inquire , and ten months later , the stone was set . the hoffmanns would like to do more . after reading about the former jewish neighborhood in venice , where the term " ghetto " originated , the idea of laying a stumbling-stone there appealed to them . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for sponsors , the stones offer a way to acknowledge past horrors mrs. hoffmann takes out a travel guide and opens to a map depicting giudecca island , former home of the giudei , or jews .
the cartographic neutrality of the land mass , shaped like a bread crust lying in a soup of venetian canals , does not betray the cramped conditions under which jews once lived . " i have to research myself if there were jews living there at the time of the second world war , and if they got deported , as well as finding the names and dates , " says mrs. hoffmann . " we ’ re not sure if everything is recorded , either , " mr. hoffmann adds .

they want to draw attention to the fates of people like florian blitzer - a 42-year-old roofer who says even the current retirement age of 65 is virtually impossible to achieve . " as a roofer you spend your entire working life standing or kneeling on sloping surfaces , " blitzer says .
" this is bound to damage your knee and hip joints after a number of years making it impossible to work for so long . " however , under the new law , adopted by the bundestag on friday , everyone seeking retirement earlier than 67 will face a monthly pension cut of 0.3 percent . amelie buntenbach , a trade union official , says the measure will not help to solve the pension funding crisis as a result of a rapidly aging population . " there is enormous fear among people here that they will become dependent on welfare payments because they won ’ t be able to work or find a job at that age , " buntenbach said .
" they are afraid of having to use up all their savings before retirement , thus ending up in social hardship . " not enough jobs to go around in germany so far , companies made use of generous state-funded early retirement schemes to shed millions of older staff .
less than half of all germans aged 55 and 64 , still work here compared with 70 percent in sweden . critics of the new law say the government completely ignores the fact that there just aren ’ t enough jobs around for people at 65 , let alone 67 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : older workers fear they may have to depend on government handouts kurt beck , leader of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- which rules in a coalition with chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats , says the government will make sure that such jobs will be created . " we have started a new program to foster employment among older people , " beck said .
" and secondly , the new law also allows people who have worked for 45 years to continue retiring at the age 65 .
manual workers such as roofers and brick layers usually start their professional lives at 16 , so they will have the chance to retire earlier . " by 2035 , the share of people aged 65 and over in germany is projected to swell to 30 percent of the total population from around 18 percent now . new work model needed carl martin welcker , ceo of the schütte machine tool maker , believes employers must also rethink their former staff policy .
the imminent shortage of skilled labor will make it necessary to keep elderly workers employed , he says . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german workers will no longer be able to sit back and relax at 65 " we need to find ways to make working hours more flexible and seek individual solutions to keep workers employed as long as possible , " welcker said .
" in my company , we ’ ve started this process and older employees say they feel happy and fit enough to be able to work until retirement . " the new retirement age is scheduled to be introduced in a gradual process starting in 2012 and ending in 2029 . the government has pledged to review the legislation over that period to see whether the labor market has really changed to take on more elderly employees . uwe hessler -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu tackles demographic challenges at conference under growing pressure to tackle the challenges of a shrinking workforce and an ageing population , the eu has urged member states to help citizens better unite paid work with family commitments at a special forum .

they want to draw attention to the fates of people like florian blitzer - a 42-year-old roofer who says even the current retirement age of 65 is virtually impossible to achieve . " as a roofer you spend your entire working life standing or kneeling on sloping surfaces , " blitzer says .
" this is bound to damage your knee and hip joints after a number of years making it impossible to work for so long . " however , under the new law , adopted by the bundestag on friday , everyone seeking retirement earlier than 67 will face a monthly pension cut of 0.3 percent . amelie buntenbach , a trade union official , says the measure will not help to solve the pension funding crisis as a result of a rapidly aging population .

they want to draw attention to the fates of people like florian blitzer - a 42-year-old roofer who says even the current retirement age of 65 is virtually impossible to achieve . " as a roofer you spend your entire working life standing or kneeling on sloping surfaces , " blitzer says .
" this is bound to damage your knee and hip joints after a number of years making it impossible to work for so long . " however , under the new law , adopted by the bundestag on friday , everyone seeking retirement earlier than 67 will face a monthly pension cut of 0.3 percent . amelie buntenbach , a trade union official , says the measure will not help to solve the pension funding crisis as a result of a rapidly aging population . " there is enormous fear among people here that they will become dependent on welfare payments because they won ’ t be able to work or find a job at that age , " buntenbach said .
" they are afraid of having to use up all their savings before retirement , thus ending up in social hardship . " not enough jobs to go around in germany so far , companies made use of generous state-funded early retirement schemes to shed millions of older staff .
less than half of all germans aged 55 and 64 , still work here compared with 70 percent in sweden . critics of the new law say the government completely ignores the fact that there just aren ’ t enough jobs around for people at 65 , let alone 67 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : older workers fear they may have to depend on government handouts kurt beck , leader of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- which rules in a coalition with chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats , says the government will make sure that such jobs will be created . " we have started a new program to foster employment among older people , " beck said .
" and secondly , the new law also allows people who have worked for 45 years to continue retiring at the age 65 .
manual workers such as roofers and brick layers usually start their professional lives at 16 , so they will have the chance to retire earlier . " by 2035 , the share of people aged 65 and over in germany is projected to swell to 30 percent of the total population from around 18 percent now . new work model needed carl martin welcker , ceo of the schütte machine tool maker , believes employers must also rethink their former staff policy .
the imminent shortage of skilled labor will make it necessary to keep elderly workers employed , he says . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german workers will no longer be able to sit back and relax at 65 " we need to find ways to make working hours more flexible and seek individual solutions to keep workers employed as long as possible , " welcker said .
" in my company , we ’ ve started this process and older employees say they feel happy and fit enough to be able to work until retirement . " the new retirement age is scheduled to be introduced in a gradual process starting in 2012 and ending in 2029 . the government has pledged to review the legislation over that period to see whether the labor market has really changed to take on more elderly employees . uwe hessler -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu tackles demographic challenges at conference under growing pressure to tackle the challenges of a shrinking workforce and an ageing population , the eu has urged member states to help citizens better unite paid work with family commitments at a special forum .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de news -pipe- 09.03.2007 germany swings around eurovision in surprising national final großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is sending a swing band to helsinki germany has never fully recovered from its 2005 eurovision debacle when it came last .
but you ca n't say the germans are not trying . placing last in the eurovision song contest is a humiliation that european countries try to avoid like the plague .
germany knows how high the pressure is - especially after its 2005 entry " hide and run " suffered the ignominious fate of placing last with only four sympathy points from monaco and moldova . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jane comerford and texas lightning brought country music to the german charts last year , germany decided to shake things up a bit in europe 's favorite singing contest .
the catchy , though slightly off-the-path , country-western song " no no never " - performed by an aging australian-born singer whose name is not kylie minogue and a band that calls itself texas lightning - was the first grand prix competitor in 50 years that featured an ukulele , a singing lady in pink waving an imaginary lasso and a group of musicians who would eventually be declared honorary citizens of texas by the lonestar state 's own senate . europe was confused .
it voted for lordi - a finnish heavy-metal / horror-film freak show instead .
germany came 15th . healing wounds this is a big year for germany .
with angela merkel heading the eu 's rotating presidency as well as the g8 and fond memories of the world cup success , this would be a perfect time for germany to flex its pop muscles and show some talent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lordi 's song ' ' hard rock hallelujah " won the 2006 eurovision song contest but eurovision is not meant to be enjoyed lightly .
an endless parade of songs followed by an equally never-ending voting process is what makes eurovision a truly unique event - part circus act , part masochism feast . germany , however , organized a national competition in which only three songs were allowed to participate .
putting aside the fact that choosing between three songs on thursday evening resembled elections under a communist dictatorship - put a red star next to the name of the communist party candidate that you think our glorious leader fancies the most - the entire spectacle felt like an one-sentence version of anna karenina : " she was unhappy and jumped under the train . " winners and losers in this unusual eins-zwei-drei affair , two candidates - a 50 year-old-rocker called heinz rudolf kunze and this year 's winners of germany 's popular casting show " popstars , " a girlband called " monrose " - came out as losers .
surely , nobody stamped a big " l " on their foreheads , but pursed mouths and teary eyes after the viewers ' voting results were announced were telling enough . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the monrose girls were let down by their teenage fans heinz rudolf kunze never stood a chance , because , deep down , germans knew that europe was never going to accept a rocker called heinz rudolf .
heinz sounds like mayonnaise and rudolf sounds like a reindeer , not exactly the stuff that rock-and-roll rebels are made of . but where were all those thousands of teenagers who overcharged their cell phones by voting repeatedly during the popstars finals ?
german teenagers are either not very-well acquainted with the country 's public broadcaster ard - the german home of eurovision and other quality programs - or they were too busy watching germany 's next top model - a casting show hosted by supermodel heidi klum on a competing private tv channel . locked-up kids ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roger cicero asked german parents to keep their kids away from their cell phones or maybe german parents listened to the third candidate - 36-year-old jazz singer roger cicero - who pleaded with them in his promotional video to keep the children away from their cell phones .
he thought - like everybody else - that the girlband 's obsessive-compulsive fan base would be a serious threat . it is not clear whether german teenagers ended up grounded , locked up and deprived of their cellular alter egos .
but roger cicero 's swing hit " frauen regieren die welt " -lrb- women rule the world -rrb- reaped all the bouquets on the eve of the international women 's day - surprisingly , but refreshingly so . so here we go again .
germany is experimenting .
it 's playing with eurovision fire .
but who knows ?
swing may end up marching where country music was not allowed to tread .
after all , stranger things have happened in the wacky world of eurotrash glamor .
just look at the finns . toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the best of " from the fringe " germany is certainly facing serious problems , but it 's also important not to forget to laugh once in a while .

" there is no agreement as yet .
we 've all got to show a little patience , " german chancellor angela merkel told reporters late thursday after chairing the opening session of the two-day summit . " we need to find common ground .
i 'm not without hope , " she added . the 27 heads of state and government resolved to seek a compromise deal on friday morning . the main sticking point to the plan , which aims to reduce emissions of the greenhouse gases that cause global warming , centered on some member countries ' reluctance to agree to firm goals for the future use of renewable energy . merkel , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency , wants the 27-nation bloc to commit to a binding target that 20 percent of eu energy needs should be met by renewable sources by 2020 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel wants the eu to lead the way on green issues " we talked about specific obligations - increasing energy efficiency , biofuels , renewable energy .
there is a need for further discussion on these three areas , " said merkel .
" some member states were asking : ' are we really going to achieve these goals ? " ' she added . in an effort to limit the rise in average global temperatures to two degrees celsius above pre-industrial era levels , the eu leaders are being asked to commit to cut carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- emissions by 20 percent by 2020 , from 1990 levels .
plenty of haggling ahead to entice the rest of the world to take bigger steps , the eu will offer to slash the emissions by a further 10 percent if nations like the united states , china and india also agree to take concrete steps . if a deal is reached friday there is still plenty of haggling ahead on what measures each eu nation will have to take to achieve the 20 percent average in co2 cuts . the eu member states have some time to make those decisions , as the kyoto protocol on climate change lays down targets until 2012 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : newer eu member states are reliant on carbon-heavy fuels like coal the eu hopes that a strong initiative here will provide impetus for the next g8 summit of industrialized nations in germany in june . before the summit began , merkel warned that the eu 's credibility hung on the bloc 's ability to agree on specific , long term goals for fighting global warming that other nations could emulate . " we can not say we came to a conclusion , " european commission president jose manuel barroso told a press conference after the leaders held talks over dinner , " but i really believe a consensus is emerging . " divergent views but while everyone agreed on the need to cut emissions , views obviously diverged on how to achieve this . some newer eu members like the czech republic , hungary and poland depend heavily on carbon-heavy fuels like coal , and oppose setting a mandatory target for the use of renewable energy sources . " the plans are too ambitious in the years to come for poland , " polish president lech kaczynski said .
" if we have a flexible approach ... then a compromise solution would be possible . " at the other end of the spectrum lay denmark , which claims that its economy has thrived even as it moves to newer , more sustainable energy sources . " i think the european union should go green and to that end we need binding targets , " said danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen . embracing nuclear power ? france has said that it would accept the use of the word " binding , " but in return french president jacques chirac has demanded that nuclear energy be brought into the plan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel appeared ready to give in to chirac on nuclear energy merkel said that atomic power , which meets 40 percent of french energy needs , could be included in the eu 's ambitious scheme to reduce carbon emissions . " this overall reduction of 20 percent will also depend on the question of how to use cleaner coal technology , it could possibly include nuclear energy , " she conceded . german officials were preparing a new draft document for the leaders to consider again early friday , when they gather at european council headquarters from 10:00 cet . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german carmakers rev up effort to enter hybrid market amid increasing consumer awareness of global warming and other environmental issues , german carmakers have had to fight off growing criticism about their apparent lack of will to build environmentally friendly cars .

the row is raging against a backdrop of terrible losses airbus parent company eads had more bad news for its sick aviation subsidiary when the first operating loss in its history was announced .
this was compounded by new , related tensions between germany and france . airbus parent company eads reported on thursday that its ailing aviation subsidiary , currently in turmoil over job cuts and delays to its new flagship a380 superjumbo , suffered its first-ever operating loss of 572 million euros -lrb- $ 752 million -rrb- in 2006 and was expected to suffer further losses in 2007 . the restructuring costs for airbus ' a380 superjumbo have been cited as the main cause for the forecasted " substantial " operating loss for 2007 along with the problems arising from the adaptation of the popular a350 to the upgraded a350xwb jet .
in 2005 , airbus achieved a profit of 2.3 billion euros . eads announced at the presentation of its annual results in munich that net profit for 2006 plunged to 99 million euros from 1.8 billion euros the previous year .
operating profit before interest and tax slumped from 2.9 billion euros in 2005 to 399 million euros last year , the company added . the drop in profits came despite a 15 percent increase in revenue from 34.2 billion euros to 39.4 billion euros . airbus is currently undergoing a restructuring program , which is expected to result in the loss of 10,000 jobs and the selling off of factories . restructuring a priority , say chiefs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : louis gallois eads co-chairmen louis gallois and thomas enders said friday that implementation of the restructuring program had utmost priority despite the horrendous financial report .
they said the company needed to improve its operating performance , regain the confidence of clients and turn itself into a lean , dynamic operation . one of the main aspects eads is looking into in terms of streamlining is the abolition of a two-headed senior management team .

the row is raging against a backdrop of terrible losses airbus parent company eads had more bad news for its sick aviation subsidiary when the first operating loss in its history was announced .
this was compounded by new , related tensions between germany and france . airbus parent company eads reported on thursday that its ailing aviation subsidiary , currently in turmoil over job cuts and delays to its new flagship a380 superjumbo , suffered its first-ever operating loss of 572 million euros -lrb- $ 752 million -rrb- in 2006 and was expected to suffer further losses in 2007 . the restructuring costs for airbus ' a380 superjumbo have been cited as the main cause for the forecasted " substantial " operating loss for 2007 along with the problems arising from the adaptation of the popular a350 to the upgraded a350xwb jet .
in 2005 , airbus achieved a profit of 2.3 billion euros . eads announced at the presentation of its annual results in munich that net profit for 2006 plunged to 99 million euros from 1.8 billion euros the previous year .
operating profit before interest and tax slumped from 2.9 billion euros in 2005 to 399 million euros last year , the company added . the drop in profits came despite a 15 percent increase in revenue from 34.2 billion euros to 39.4 billion euros . airbus is currently undergoing a restructuring program , which is expected to result in the loss of 10,000 jobs and the selling off of factories . restructuring a priority , say chiefs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : louis gallois eads co-chairmen louis gallois and thomas enders said friday that implementation of the restructuring program had utmost priority despite the horrendous financial report .
they said the company needed to improve its operating performance , regain the confidence of clients and turn itself into a lean , dynamic operation . one of the main aspects eads is looking into in terms of streamlining is the abolition of a two-headed senior management team .

" you can " stumble " anytime and anywhere in berlin . whether stepping out to pick up a carton of milk or on the way home from work , you ’ re bound to notice the " stumbling-stones " -lrb- stolpersteine -rrb- , small brass-capped squares laid flush with berlin ’ s stone sidewalks . one stumbles psychologically , not literally , for inscribed into their surface is the name , and - as far as is known - the dates of birth , deportation , and death of a former jewish inhabitant of the dwelling alongside the stone . the brainchild of artist gunter demnig , the miniature memorials must be privately sponsored at a cost of roughly 95 euros -lrb- $ 125 -rrb- and have caught on as an effective way to personalize the enormity of the holocaust . after " stumbling " dozens of times over berlin ’ s roughly 900 miniature memorials , i became eager to talk to individuals who funded the stones , which are created and inlaid by the artist himself . a phone call to my neighborhood ’ s stumbling-stone coordination center puts me in touch with a local couple .
i am set to meet sponsors of the latest memory trend . pasta and the past richard and elke hoffmann * greet me at one of berlin ’ s thousand cheap italian restaurants , chosen so we could talk at length without worrying someone else will be waiting for our table . the conversation quickly turns from vodka penne to vergangenheitsbewältigung , or " coming to terms with the past . " mr. hoffmann believes in the controversial " collective guilt " theory popularized after a 1981 speech by israeli prime minister menachem begin . the theory holds that all germans as an entire people are guilty for the crimes of nazi germany . a prevailing counter to the " collective guilt " theory runs that german society is not collectively guilty but rather collectively responsible ; as witnesses to the terrible history and heirs to its consequences , they can help ensure it does not happen again . while mr. hoffmann agrees with this responsibility , he nonetheless sees the nation as categorically culpable , a feeling that informed his desire to sponsor a stumbling-stone . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : artist gunter demnig produces the stones " with this stone , i ’ m accepting a small piece of the guilt of our people .
the guilt that i inherited . i take on this guilt in recognition of the terrible crimes we have committed , " he explains to me slowly and carefully , as though describing a logical proof . a shocking bakery visit mrs. hoffmann expands on their reasons , bringing up an incident from their 1974 trip to israel , when they stopped in a bakery for a snack . " i wanted to buy a pastry and the woman behind the counter had blue numbers tattooed here . " mrs. hoffmann points to her arm . " when she heard us speaking german she just gasped and then couldn ’ t breathe . she froze , completely transported by horrible memories . " this encounter with a concentration camp survivor stayed with mrs. hoffmann for decades .
" i had to face what my people did , " she says . " and for me , the stumbling-stone is a way of dealing with this .
it ’ s a small gesture of humanity towards the victims . " the hoffmanns ’ stumbling-stone commemorates an elderly woman deported to theresienstadt and killed in october 1942 .
it lies not far from our restaurant , where the woman resided at the time of deportation . laying more stones " we came upon them the same way you did , " explains mr. hoffmann .
" we noticed them here and there throughout the city , and at some point we thought , ‘ that ’ s something we ’ d like to do . we ’ d like to sponsor a stone . ’ " they were able to turn their desire into action when mrs. hoffmann read a newspaper article with information about the local office that coordinates with the artist . she called to inquire , and ten months later , the stone was set . the hoffmanns would like to do more . after reading about the former jewish neighborhood in venice , where the term " ghetto " originated , the idea of laying a stumbling-stone there appealed to them . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for sponsors , the stones offer a way to acknowledge past horrors mrs. hoffmann takes out a travel guide and opens to a map depicting giudecca island , former home of the giudei , or jews .
the cartographic neutrality of the land mass , shaped like a bread crust lying in a soup of venetian canals , does not betray the cramped conditions under which jews once lived . " i have to research myself if there were jews living there at the time of the second world war , and if they got deported , as well as finding the names and dates , " says mrs. hoffmann . " we ’ re not sure if everything is recorded , either , " mr. hoffmann adds .
" germans like to write everything down , but other countries might not have . " he is referring to the astoundingly precise german documentation of their crimes , right down to careful inventories of homes from which jews were deported . " be sure you know why " despite this tactical obstacle , the hoffmanns believe strongly that in what they are doing , stating emphatically that only by remembering can one avoid repeating past mistakes .
when asked how they would advise someone planning to sponsor a stone , their message is clear , " be sure you know why you are doing it . " interested in sponsoring a stumbling-stone where you live ? many -lrb- german and austrian -rrb- cities have coordination centers ; call the mayor ’ s office or district office -lrb- bezirksamt -rrb- to inquire . * names have been changed at the request of the sponsors , who want more people to know about the stumbling-stones yet prefer not to receive undue attention for simply doing what they consider the right thing . arden pennell send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de read arden pennell 's earlier columns dw-world : rational disdain for distant relatives americans and europeans are n't quite as different as people think , wrote arden pennell .

they want to draw attention to the fates of people like florian blitzer - a 42-year-old roofer who says even the current retirement age of 65 is virtually impossible to achieve . " as a roofer you spend your entire working life standing or kneeling on sloping surfaces , " blitzer says .
" this is bound to damage your knee and hip joints after a number of years making it impossible to work for so long . " however , under the new law , adopted by the bundestag on friday , everyone seeking retirement earlier than 67 will face a monthly pension cut of 0.3 percent . amelie buntenbach , a trade union official , says the measure will not help to solve the pension funding crisis as a result of a rapidly aging population . " there is enormous fear among people here that they will become dependent on welfare payments because they won ’ t be able to work or find a job at that age , " buntenbach said .
" they are afraid of having to use up all their savings before retirement , thus ending up in social hardship . " not enough jobs to go around in germany so far , companies made use of generous state-funded early retirement schemes to shed millions of older staff .
less than half of all germans aged 55 and 64 , still work here compared with 70 percent in sweden . critics of the new law say the government completely ignores the fact that there just aren ’ t enough jobs around for people at 65 , let alone 67 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : older workers fear they may have to depend on government handouts kurt beck , leader of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- which rules in a coalition with chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats , says the government will make sure that such jobs will be created . " we have started a new program to foster employment among older people , " beck said .
" and secondly , the new law also allows people who have worked for 45 years to continue retiring at the age 65 .
manual workers such as roofers and brick layers usually start their professional lives at 16 , so they will have the chance to retire earlier . " by 2035 , the share of people aged 65 and over in germany is projected to swell to 30 percent of the total population from around 18 percent now . new work model needed carl martin welcker , ceo of the schütte machine tool maker , believes employers must also rethink their former staff policy .
the imminent shortage of skilled labor will make it necessary to keep elderly workers employed , he says . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german workers will no longer be able to sit back and relax at 65 " we need to find ways to make working hours more flexible and seek individual solutions to keep workers employed as long as possible , " welcker said .

the project , involving six boys and six girls , was aimed at reducing teenage pregnancies and educating youngsters about relationship pressures .
the vale of glamorgan romance academy , which ran groups in penarth and dinas powys , described it as " life-changing " .
the graduates , aged 14-18 , will receive certificates in barry on friday night .
the romance academy project began in london in 2005 .
but co-ordinator naomi roberts was inspired to bring it to wales after seeing the scheme featured last year on bbc2 documentary " no sex please we 're teenagers " .
she said : " from my own experience of being a mother it would have been invaluable if i could have sent my daughter to something like the romance academy .
" people do seem to feel that if you do not have sex on the third date you are flawed or not a normal person naomi roberts , project co-ordinator " she suffered some difficulties in her teenage years and my experience in dealing with this made me think that i could help others face similar sorts of problems and pressures .
" we want to reduce teenage pregnancies and reduce the amount of teenagers having casual sex .
it reduces peoples ' self esteem . "
the 12 youngsters were selected via auditions in the vale of glamorgan with the permission of their parents .
mrs roberts said : " we made sure we picked people from a range of backgrounds .
some were outgoing , some were shy , some had had sex , some had n't . "
before joining the academies , run by a male and female youth worker , the teenagers committed to refrain from sexual activity for the duration of the project .
nathan scott-cook and chloe roberts ran the penarth academy they had talks with teenage mothers and also took home realistic baby dolls to experience being a young parent .
mrs roberts added : " people do seem to feel that if you do not have sex on the third date you are flawed or not a normal person .
" we get them to discuss what they really want to happen in the course of their relationships and help them to go about achieving this .
" we are finding that the pupils are n't so quick to jump into bed with someone after discussing relationships in this way . "
youth worker nathan scott-cook , 35 , who ran the penarth group , said taking the pledge helped the teenagers to " really question their value of sex and what the culture around them dishes out . "
he said many of the teenagers changed their views on sex , adding : " the boys have said ' i would treat girls differently now and not view them as an object . "
the graduation ceremony will be held at barry memorial hall at 1930 gmt .

navarra is poor in mineral resources , but windy and sunny at the moment , less than 7 % of europe 's needs are covered by wind power , biofuels or solar energy .
but in the navarra region , in north-eastern spain , almost 70 % of the electricity comes from the wind and the sun .
you do not have to look far in navarra to see a windmill .
not the sort that don quixote fought , but the hi-tech turbines that provide much of the electricity here .
with no coal , oil or gas of its own , this mountainous region deliberately went for renewable energy in the late 1980s .
the first wind farm was built in full view of the regional capital pamplona , so that people could get used to it .
now , with some 1,100 windmills dotted all over navarra , this tiny region is capable of generating more electricity from renewable sources than big eu countries like france or poland .
pioneering role i had a privileged view from the top of one , 80 metres -lrb- 250 feet -rrb- above ground .
going up in a cramped elevator in full security gear , you can feel the windmill swaying gently in the wind as you reach the full height .
close up , the blades emerge slowly like huge white whales , revealing more rows of windmills on the horizon .
wind turbines are computer-controlled from a control centre outside pamplona , a team of young operators can turn most mills on and off at the click of a mouse , not just in spain , but as far as south korea .
when it comes to renewable energy , companies based in navarra , like acciona energia , are world leaders .
company spokesman jose arieta says the company is looking to increase its exports to the united states , australia , india and china .
" we are going to invest a lot of money in renewables in the world because we are convinced this is a very relevant sector for the future , " mr arieta says .
some 100,000 people work in the green energy sector in spain , with 4,000 new jobs created in navarra in the last decade .
as many people are now employed making turbines or solar panels as in car manufacturing , navarra 's traditional industry .
growth sector the regional industry secretary , jose javier armendariz , says clean energy is overtaking cars as a source of growth .
schools in pamplona have their own solar panels " i do n't know how many people will be employed in the car industry in the future , but i ca n't imagine our future without it , " mr armendariz says .
" however , right now our focus is the development of the renewable energy sector . "
the regional government has been supporting wind and solar power for years , as do most people in navarra .
but environmental activists from a local group called gurelur , " our land " in the basque language , are concerned .
one of their members , amparo lazaro , says gurelur favours renewable energy , but not at any price .
" the wind parks they have built have n't been put in the right places , so they cause environmental damage , and there are too many for the environmental capacity of navarra .
we do n't even recognise the landscape of our region any more , " ms lazaro complains .
and the landscape keeps changing , although navarra 's focus is shifting from wind power , where national government subsidies are set to fall , to solar energy .
cheap energy an hour 's drive from pamplona , next to a village called milagro , i went to see one of the biggest solar parks in europe .
on sunny days , the sun does n't cost us anything esteban garijo , mayor of milagro on a field as vast as 50 football pitches , stand row upon row of huge solar panels , tilted to capture as much light as possible .
in a growing trend in spain , the solar park is a co-operative , with 750 individual owners .
the cost of a panel starts at 50,000 euros , but with a tax break from the regional government and a guaranteed annual income there is a long waiting list of willing buyers .
milagro 's mayor esteban garijo thinks it is a brilliant investment .
" on sunny days , the sun does n't cost us anything .
so not only are we generating clean energy , but we 're also making money . "
many in navarra call it their " solar pension fund " , mr garijo explains .
" they buy a solar panel or two and hope to retire on the profits . "
every generation is playing along .
most schools in pamplona have their own solar panel , provided by the local town hall .
every day , the children can learn how much electricity they have fed into the grid and how to save more energy .
" we 're looking after the earth " , says suyapa eguaras , aged 11 .
" we are reducing carbon dioxide emissions .
at home , i 'm also doing other things , like recycling or saving water . "
it is the sort of determination and clarity of purpose that europe 's leaders will require in plentiful supply , if they are to take the bold steps needed to fight climate change .

now , with some 1,100 windmills dotted all over navarra , this tiny region is capable of generating more electricity from renewable sources than big eu countries like france or poland .
pioneering role i had a privileged view from the top of one , 80 metres -lrb- 250 feet -rrb- above ground .
going up in a cramped elevator in full security gear , you can feel the windmill swaying gently in the wind as you reach the full height .
close up , the blades emerge slowly like huge white whales , revealing more rows of windmills on the horizon .
wind turbines are computer-controlled from a control centre outside pamplona , a team of young operators can turn most mills on and off at the click of a mouse , not just in spain , but as far as south korea .
when it comes to renewable energy , companies based in navarra , like acciona energia , are world leaders .
company spokesman jose arieta says the company is looking to increase its exports to the united states , australia , india and china .
" we are going to invest a lot of money in renewables in the world because we are convinced this is a very relevant sector for the future , " mr arieta says .
some 100,000 people work in the green energy sector in spain , with 4,000 new jobs created in navarra in the last decade .
as many people are now employed making turbines or solar panels as in car manufacturing , navarra 's traditional industry .
growth sector the regional industry secretary , jose javier armendariz , says clean energy is overtaking cars as a source of growth .
schools in pamplona have their own solar panels " i do n't know how many people will be employed in the car industry in the future , but i ca n't imagine our future without it , " mr armendariz says .
" however , right now our focus is the development of the renewable energy sector . "
the regional government has been supporting wind and solar power for years , as do most people in navarra .
but environmental activists from a local group called gurelur , " our land " in the basque language , are concerned .
one of their members , amparo lazaro , says gurelur favours renewable energy , but not at any price .
" the wind parks they have built have n't been put in the right places , so they cause environmental damage , and there are too many for the environmental capacity of navarra .
we do n't even recognise the landscape of our region any more , " ms lazaro complains .
and the landscape keeps changing , although navarra 's focus is shifting from wind power , where national government subsidies are set to fall , to solar energy .
cheap energy an hour 's drive from pamplona , next to a village called milagro , i went to see one of the biggest solar parks in europe .
on sunny days , the sun does n't cost us anything esteban garijo , mayor of milagro on a field as vast as 50 football pitches , stand row upon row of huge solar panels , tilted to capture as much light as possible .
in a growing trend in spain , the solar park is a co-operative , with 750 individual owners .
the cost of a panel starts at 50,000 euros , but with a tax break from the regional government and a guaranteed annual income there is a long waiting list of willing buyers .
milagro 's mayor esteban garijo thinks it is a brilliant investment .
" on sunny days , the sun does n't cost us anything .
so not only are we generating clean energy , but we 're also making money . "
many in navarra call it their " solar pension fund " , mr garijo explains .
" they buy a solar panel or two and hope to retire on the profits . "
every generation is playing along .
most schools in pamplona have their own solar panel , provided by the local town hall .
every day , the children can learn how much electricity they have fed into the grid and how to save more energy .
" we 're looking after the earth " , says suyapa eguaras , aged 11 .
" we are reducing carbon dioxide emissions .
at home , i 'm also doing other things , like recycling or saving water . "
it is the sort of determination and clarity of purpose that europe 's leaders will require in plentiful supply , if they are to take the bold steps needed to fight climate change .

navarra is poor in mineral resources , but windy and sunny at the moment , less than 7 % of europe 's needs are covered by wind power , biofuels or solar energy .
but in the navarra region , in north-eastern spain , almost 70 % of the electricity comes from the wind and the sun .
you do not have to look far in navarra to see a windmill .
not the sort that don quixote fought , but the hi-tech turbines that provide much of the electricity here .

more than 130,000 have been helped into work since 1997 and the uk government said wales now had a higher employment rate than germany , france and japan .
but more needs to be done to get even more back into work - particularly in the south wales valleys , it is claimed .
uk work and pensions minister john hutton and first minister rhodri morgan will discuss the issue on friday .
the uk government report said almost 72 % of people are now employed , but places which have had long- term unemployment problems still face difficulties .
in merthyr tydfil less than 62 % are in employment .
compelling framework the government wants to increase employment levels in the south wales valleys and right across wales to 80 % of the working age population .
that would mean the equivalent of more than 150,000 older workers , lone parents and incapacity benefit claimants who at the moment do not have jobs , returning to the workforce .
mr hutton said the new report " set out a compelling framework for the next stage of welfare reform which the government must now carefully consider " .
" but we must go further and find new ways to support the hardest to help into work , " he added .
specific challenges mr hutton said there were also areas in wales " which have n't shared in the growing prosperity of the rest of the country " .
" the valleys in particular deserve specific attention , where employment is still low and benefit receipt still high , " he said .
mr morgan added : " partnership between two administrations has given wales the opportunity to focus on challenges specific to wales .
" initiatives covering welfare to work , childcare and skills can boost employment through benefiting both the claimant and the welsh economy .
mr hutton will also visit an initiative in swansea which supports people with disabilities in the workplace .

the united nations office on drugs and crime -lrb- unodc -rrb- says the north african country , which was the biggest supplier of hashish in the world , has now cut production of the crop by almost 50 % over the past three years .
the moroccan government says it plans to completely eradicate cannabis by 2008 .
we drove into morocco 's cannabis country : the rif mountains , where they have been growing cannabis , or " kif " as it is called , since the 15th century .
the landscape is imposing - craggy peaks and ridges look down onto luminous green valleys .
' well adapted ' i was travelling with alessandro boccoli , an agricultural advisor to the provincial government . "
i used to grow cannabis but i was put in jail because of it , for eight months " mohamed garrouj local farmer i asked him how difficult it was to police this area .
" yes of course access is very difficult , not only for the police , for everybody , you have to know all the routes , " he said .
" the cannabis plant is well adapted to the environment here , to the climate , the conditions and even to the agricultural ways of the people . "
we came to a ridge where there were some scattered fields and where the odd cannabis plant was poking out through the rocks .
here men were pruning olive trees , which are being grown as an alternative to the cannabis crop .
clamping down local farmer mohamed garrouj is keen to try it because he 's already suffered the consequences of growing the illegal crop : " i used to grow cannabis but i was put in jail because of it , for eight months .
" now that 's all over , i do n't grow it anymore .
it 's not just me , whole villages have been put in jail for it ! "
as well as more stringent policing , the authorities have improved their security measures along the coast .
for example they have installed the latest hi-tech scanners at the ports .
it is thought that the urgency with which they are now acting stems from international pressure to address the drug problem .
some intelligence experts believe the militant group which bombed trains in madrid in 2004 was largely funded by cannabis trafficking .
khalid zerouali from the moroccan interior ministry says it has not been easy clamping down on cannabis production .
" it 's very difficult exercise , but what we do is we eradicate .
we destroy the crop in the field , involving with us , the civil society , the local population , and we try to give them help , so they can immediately start growing something else , " he told me .
' very worried ' walking in another even more remote part of the rif mountains , i could see some fields where the seeds of cannabis were being sown .
despite the government crackdown , it was quite easy to find people who admitted growing cannabis .
" the gendarmerie come here and tell us not to grow cannabis , but how can we live ? " asked mohammed , another local farmer .
" ever since we started growing cannabis we have been afraid , but what can we do , we 're just trying to earn a living , for us and for our children .
" if the government catch us with just a little bit they arrest us .
we are very worried . "
the unodc says the biggest challenge is finding other ways farmers like mohammed can survive .
" there have been lots of past attempts to find alternative crops , but they have n't always worked , because cannabis is a crop that commands such an inflated price , " explained abdeslam dahmane from development agency targa which works closely with the unodc .
" there have been attempts at introducing apples , vines and things like that but they have n't really addressed the problem .
" it 's not a question of replacing cannabis with apples , vines or avocados .
the question is replacing the incredibly dynamic economy of cannabis , with an equally dynamic economy - that is also legal . "
hippy haunt chefchaouen lies in the heart of the rif mountains .
in the medina , people sell all sorts of vegetables and fruits amid the narrow cobbled alleyways of whitewashed walls and blue doors .
chefchaouen has been a favourite haunt of hippy travellers and backpackers for years , as hashish is easier to buy here than in much of europe .
khalid zerouali from the moroccan interior ministry says europe 's seemingly insatiable demand for cannabis is still the main obstacle to eradicating it completely .
" in terms of supply i think morocco has done a lot .
" but we need also to master the demand .
last year about 22m people consumed cannabis in europe .
that makes it very difficult .
" in terms of making the psychological costs so high for the traffickers i think the seizures - last year 88 tonnes of cannabis - are very important .
the component that is very difficult for us because we do n't master it , is demand .
" i think in europe there has to be an awareness of how to tackle that demand . "
but demand is not about to drop away , so the successes of the moroccan government in reducing supply may be hard to sustain .
it looks as if it will take more than olive trees to persuade some of the most impoverished farmers in this region to give up their most lucrative crop .

olive trees are being grown as an alternative to cannabis the united nations office on drugs and crime -lrb- unodc -rrb- says the north african country , which was the biggest supplier of hashish in the world , has now cut production of the crop by almost 50 % over the past three years .
the moroccan government says it plans to completely eradicate cannabis by 2008 .
we drove into morocco 's cannabis country : the rif mountains , where they have been growing cannabis , or " kif " as it is called , since the 15th century .
the landscape is imposing - craggy peaks and ridges look down onto luminous green valleys .
' well adapted ' i was travelling with alessandro boccoli , an agricultural advisor to the provincial government .
i used to grow cannabis but i was put in jail because of it , for eight months mohamed garrouj local farmer i asked him how difficult it was to police this area .
" yes of course access is very difficult , not only for the police , for everybody , you have to know all the routes , " he said .
" the cannabis plant is well adapted to the environment here , to the climate , the conditions and even to the agricultural ways of the people . "
we came to a ridge where there were some scattered fields and where the odd cannabis plant was poking out through the rocks .
here men were pruning olive trees , which are being grown as an alternative to the cannabis crop .
clamping down local farmer mohamed garrouj is keen to try it because he 's already suffered the consequences of growing the illegal crop : " i used to grow cannabis but i was put in jail because of it , for eight months .
" now that 's all over , i do n't grow it anymore .
it 's not just me , whole villages have been put in jail for it ! "
clamping down on cannabis production is not easy in morocco as well as more stringent policing , the authorities have improved their security measures along the coast .
for example they have installed the latest hi-tech scanners at the ports .
it is thought that the urgency with which they are now acting stems from international pressure to address the drug problem .
some intelligence experts believe the militant group which bombed trains in madrid in 2004 was largely funded by cannabis trafficking .
khalid zerouali from the moroccan interior ministry says it has not been easy clamping down on cannabis production .
" it 's very difficult exercise , but what we do is we eradicate .
we destroy the crop in the field , involving with us , the civil society , the local population , and we try to give them help , so they can immediately start growing something else , " he told me .
' very worried ' walking in another even more remote part of the rif mountains , i could see some fields where the seeds of cannabis were being sown .
despite the government crackdown , it was quite easy to find people who admitted growing cannabis .
" the gendarmerie come here and tell us not to grow cannabis , but how can we live ? " asked mohammed , another local farmer .
" ever since we started growing cannabis we have been afraid , but what can we do , we 're just trying to earn a living , for us and for our children .
" if the government catch us with just a little bit they arrest us .
we are very worried . "
the unodc says the biggest challenge is finding other ways farmers like mohammed can survive .
" there have been lots of past attempts to find alternative crops , but they have n't always worked , because cannabis is a crop that commands such an inflated price , " explained abdeslam dahmane from development agency targa which works closely with the unodc .
" there have been attempts at introducing apples , vines and things like that but they have n't really addressed the problem .
" it 's not a question of replacing cannabis with apples , vines or avocados .
the question is replacing the incredibly dynamic economy of cannabis , with an equally dynamic economy - that is also legal . "
hippy haunt chefchaouen lies in the heart of the rif mountains .
hashish is easy to come by in the hippy haunt of chefchaouen in the medina , people sell all sorts of vegetables and fruits amid the narrow cobbled alleyways of whitewashed walls and blue doors .
chefchaouen has been a favourite haunt of hippy travellers and backpackers for years , as hashish is easier to buy here than in much of europe .
khalid zerouali from the moroccan interior ministry says europe 's seemingly insatiable demand for cannabis is still the main obstacle to eradicating it completely .
" in terms of supply i think morocco has done a lot .
" but we need also to master the demand .
last year about 22m people consumed cannabis in europe .
that makes it very difficult .
" in terms of making the psychological costs so high for the traffickers i think the seizures - last year 88 tonnes of cannabis - are very important .
the component that is very difficult for us because we do n't master it , is demand .
" i think in europe there has to be an awareness of how to tackle that demand . "
but demand is not about to drop away , so the successes of the moroccan government in reducing supply may be hard to sustain .
it looks as if it will take more than olive trees to persuade some of the most impoverished farmers in this region to give up their most lucrative crop .
