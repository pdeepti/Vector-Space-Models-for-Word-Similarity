us-backed projects by christian alvart , sandra nettelbeck , florian baxmeyer and joseph rusnak are still in the pipeline - and the list goes on .
still basking in the afterglow of florian von donnersmarck 's " the lives of others " oscar triumph in february , germany could n't be prouder of its young directors suddenly swarming the dream factory .
young , gifted and cheap they certainly look like they 've started running with the big guys .
but they 're succeeding by going native and mainstream - what they 're not doing is adding any quintessentially german artistic vision to the hollywood mix .
instead , they 've learnt how to beat the americans at their own game .
taking their cues from germany 's only long-standing hollywood heavyweights , roland emmerich and wolfgang petersen , the new crop of directors is making solid commercial fare expertly pitched at the us market .
the appeal of german directors in hollywood is n't any unique artistic agenda , says andrea dittgen from the association of german film critics .
it 's purely practical .
" they 're hired because they 're cheaper than their american peers , " she said .
crucially , this latest generation - with the exception of hirschbiegel - is also very young , and can still be " steered . "
" they 're willing to work for less , because hollywood is where they want to be .
and these directors are very open-minded about giving the studios what they want , " she said .
hollywood getting its money 's worth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " premonition " is a classic psycho-thriller " premonition , " a supernatural thriller made by mennan yapo for sony , is a case in point .
the turkish-german director was snapped up by the entertainment capital on the strength of just one feature-length movie in germany , which was released in the us as " soundless . "
hollywood knew what it was doing .
garnering sandra bullock the highest-grossing opening weekend of her career , " premonition " ticks all the right hollywood boxes .
" when the studios hire germans they know they 're going to get more out of the budget , " said yapo .
" they 're punctual and they 're basically good workers who are very well trained . "
" german directors come highly skilled , " said german producer and visual effects supervisor volker engel , who won an oscar in 1997 for his work on " independence day . "
the movie , which still ranks among the top 10 all-time box-office smashes , was one of the first to prove that german directors - in this case , roland emmerich - were adept at delivering classic american blockbusters with maximum efficiency .
" they 're used to shooting fast , because german films are done with smaller budgets and have less shooting days than us productions , " he adds .
but mennan yapo feels a bit of european flair should n't be underestimated .
" hollywood also knows it 's going to get some edge from german directors , " he says .
" it 's basically an industry , and it 's aware that now and then , it needs fresh blood .
a couple of years ago the mexicans came along and brought in some new flavor .
now it 's the germans ' turn .
especially when they 're doing genre films , they deliver a different point of view on americana . "
taking the rough with the smooth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : emmerich can make disaster movies with the best of them even so , old-school " auteur " filmmakers are less likely to find themselves clasped to the tinseltown bosom .
like yapo , volker engel is aware that hollywood is always on the lookout for the new " it " people , but that an invitation to the party does come with strings attached .
" it can be difficult for a german director to do his first project here , because on the one hand they make you feel like the ' king ' , but on the other hand you 're spending their money .
so they will say : " hey , ' king , ' you can do whatever you want , but only as long as we 're happy with it . "
but this is n't necessarily a problem for german directors , who have a natural affinity for us-style movie-making .
" germany is very america-friendly , " said film critic andrea dittgen .
" most young directors grew up with us movies and they 're heavily influenced by them . "
germany 's part in the history of cinema in fact , the affinity is mutual .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the producer of " capote " was born in düsseldorf " there has been a long-standing tradition of german emigres working -lsb- in hollywood -rsb- , from the classical era to the present day , " explained german producer michael ohoven , whose movie " capote " was nominated as best motion picture of the year in 2005 .
he points out that germans have been instrumental in defining the hollywood cinema since its early days .
" the most skilled and influential directors from the golden age of hollywood were german , including fritz lang , f. w. murnau , billy wilder , ernst lubitsch , and douglas sirk , " he said .
" the stylistic tendencies of american film noir , which produced some of hollywood ’ s greatest titles of all time , are largely indebted to the german expressionist films of the 1920s . "
" perhaps because germany has a popular cinema with a strong genre sensibility , germans are uniquely suited to succeed within the hollywood system , " he added .
as mennan yapo observed , their sudden prominence in hollywood after decades of absence is basically an organic progression .
" let 's not forget that after the second world war , well up to the ' 70s , there were not many german directors anywhere at all , not even in germany , " he explains .
" no one who emigrated to the us during the nazi regime came back .
the years from ' 33 to ' 45 emptied germany artistically , so the country took a while to get back on track . "
but then it began gaining new artistic self-confidence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rainer werner fassbinder , a very european director " in the 1970s , werner herzog , rainer werner fassbinder and volker schlöndorff came along , " said yapo .
" initially , they leaned more towards the french directors and the new wave .
but then schlöndorff , for example , started making films in english , and they started leaning towards hollywood .
we began to see the fruits of all the film schools that had started up in the 60s and 70s . "
the next step , however , was to strike out for american shores .
and it still is .
" film still is n't an industry here , " says yapo .
" at some point , german directors have to make a decision about where they 're going to work , " said andrea dittgen .
" if they stay in germany , most of them will end up working for television , which ultimately spoils them for hollywood because they become unable to adapt .
whereas if they head to hollywood they 'll broaden their horizons , which is always a good thing .
and they do n't necessarily have to stay - they can always come back and use what they 've learned in germany . "
volker engel is similarly optimistic that germany does n't need to worry about a brain drain .

but does the westwards exodus of film professionals mean the home-grown industry loses out ? hitting german cinema screens in october are " premonition " by mennan yapo , " trade " by marco kreuzpaintner and oliver hirschbiegel ’ s " the invasion , " a remake of the 1955 classic " the body snatchers , " starring nicole kidman .
us-backed projects by christian alvart , sandra nettelbeck , florian baxmeyer and joseph rusnak are still in the pipeline - and the list goes on .
still basking in the afterglow of florian von donnersmarck 's " the lives of others " oscar triumph in february , germany could n't be prouder of its young directors suddenly swarming the dream factory .
young , gifted and cheap they certainly look like they 've started running with the big guys .
but they 're succeeding by going native and mainstream - what they 're not doing is adding any quintessentially german artistic vision to the hollywood mix .
instead , they 've learnt how to beat the americans at their own game .
taking their cues from germany 's only long-standing hollywood heavyweights , roland emmerich and wolfgang petersen , the new crop of directors is making solid commercial fare expertly pitched at the us market .
the appeal of german directors in hollywood is n't any unique artistic agenda , says andrea dittgen from the association of german film critics .
it 's purely practical .
" they 're hired because they 're cheaper than their american peers , " she said .
crucially , this latest generation - with the exception of hirschbiegel - is also very young , and can still be " steered . "
" they 're willing to work for less , because hollywood is where they want to be .
and these directors are very open-minded about giving the studios what they want , " she said .
hollywood getting its money 's worth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " premonition " is a classic psycho-thriller " premonition , " a supernatural thriller made by mennan yapo for sony , is a case in point .
the turkish-german director was snapped up by the entertainment capital on the strength of just one feature-length movie in germany , which was released in the us as " soundless . "
hollywood knew what it was doing .
garnering sandra bullock the highest-grossing opening weekend of her career , " premonition " ticks all the right hollywood boxes .
" when the studios hire germans they know they 're going to get more out of the budget , " said yapo .
" they 're punctual and they 're basically good workers who are very well trained . "
" german directors come highly skilled , " said german producer and visual effects supervisor volker engel , who won an oscar in 1997 for his work on " independence day . "
the movie , which still ranks among the top 10 all-time box-office smashes , was one of the first to prove that german directors - in this case , roland emmerich - were adept at delivering classic american blockbusters with maximum efficiency .
" they 're used to shooting fast , because german films are done with smaller budgets and have less shooting days than us productions , " he adds .
but mennan yapo feels a bit of european flair should n't be underestimated .
" hollywood also knows it 's going to get some edge from german directors , " he says .
" it 's basically an industry , and it 's aware that now and then , it needs fresh blood .
a couple of years ago the mexicans came along and brought in some new flavor .
now it 's the germans ' turn .
especially when they 're doing genre films , they deliver a different point of view on americana . "
taking the rough with the smooth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : emmerich can make disaster movies with the best of them even so , old-school " auteur " filmmakers are less likely to find themselves clasped to the tinseltown bosom .
like yapo , volker engel is aware that hollywood is always on the lookout for the new " it " people , but that an invitation to the party does come with strings attached .
" it can be difficult for a german director to do his first project here , because on the one hand they make you feel like the ' king ' , but on the other hand you 're spending their money .
so they will say : " hey , ' king , ' you can do whatever you want , but only as long as we 're happy with it . "
but this is n't necessarily a problem for german directors , who have a natural affinity for us-style movie-making .
" germany is very america-friendly , " said film critic andrea dittgen .
" most young directors grew up with us movies and they 're heavily influenced by them . "
germany 's part in the history of cinema in fact , the affinity is mutual .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the producer of " capote " was born in düsseldorf " there has been a long-standing tradition of german emigres working -lsb- in hollywood -rsb- , from the classical era to the present day , " explained german producer michael ohoven , whose movie " capote " was nominated as best motion picture of the year in 2005 .
he points out that germans have been instrumental in defining the hollywood cinema since its early days .
" the most skilled and influential directors from the golden age of hollywood were german , including fritz lang , f. w. murnau , billy wilder , ernst lubitsch , and douglas sirk , " he said .
" the stylistic tendencies of american film noir , which produced some of hollywood ’ s greatest titles of all time , are largely indebted to the german expressionist films of the 1920s . "
" perhaps because germany has a popular cinema with a strong genre sensibility , germans are uniquely suited to succeed within the hollywood system , " he added .
as mennan yapo observed , their sudden prominence in hollywood after decades of absence is basically an organic progression .
" let 's not forget that after the second world war , well up to the ' 70s , there were not many german directors anywhere at all , not even in germany , " he explains .
" no one who emigrated to the us during the nazi regime came back .
the years from ' 33 to ' 45 emptied germany artistically , so the country took a while to get back on track . "
but then it began gaining new artistic self-confidence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rainer werner fassbinder , a very european director " in the 1970s , werner herzog , rainer werner fassbinder and volker schlöndorff came along , " said yapo .
" initially , they leaned more towards the french directors and the new wave .
but then schlöndorff , for example , started making films in english , and they started leaning towards hollywood .
we began to see the fruits of all the film schools that had started up in the 60s and 70s . "
the next step , however , was to strike out for american shores .
and it still is .
" film still is n't an industry here , " says yapo .
" at some point , german directors have to make a decision about where they 're going to work , " said andrea dittgen .
" if they stay in germany , most of them will end up working for television , which ultimately spoils them for hollywood because they become unable to adapt .
whereas if they head to hollywood they 'll broaden their horizons , which is always a good thing .
and they do n't necessarily have to stay - they can always come back and use what they 've learned in germany . "
volker engel is similarly optimistic that germany does n't need to worry about a brain drain .
" i see a future for more german directors making movies both in hollywood and in germany , and moving back and forth between two very different worlds , " he said . jane paulick send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

poland , despite its opposition to many aspects of the treaty , is confident of success . eu leaders are meeting on monday , oct .
15 , in luxembourg hoping that polish calls for last-minute changes to the bloc 's reform treaty will not prove fatal .
they 're also crossing their fingers that poland 's stated optimism about the treaty 's chances is on the mark .
the eu 's future treaty received an optimistic boost last week when polish president lech kaczynski , leader of a country with many reservations about the text , said that there was a " 95-98 percent " chance of an agreement on the treaty at the forthcoming lisbon summit being held on oct .

kaczynski told reporters that " all we had considered as the problems of the treaty belong more to the past than the present . "
" i am convinced that we will be able to come to an agreement , " he added polish reservations date back to june the progress of the treaty has been hindered since it was first hammered into shape at a european union summit in brussels in june during germany 's presidency of the 27-country bloc .

despite his confidence over an agreement in lisbon this week , kaczynski hinted that legislative elections in his country , due to take place two days after the eu summit , would not make his task in negotiating on an eu level any easier .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de film -pipe- 15.10.2007 german directors the new toast of hollywood großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mennan yapo , rubbing shoulders with sandra bullock in la with a spate of new hollywood movies boasting german directors , tinseltown 's latest love affair is with talent from germany .
but does the westwards exodus of film professionals mean the home-grown industry loses out ? hitting german cinema screens in october are " premonition " by mennan yapo , " trade " by marco kreuzpaintner and oliver hirschbiegel ’ s " the invasion , " a remake of the 1955 classic " the body snatchers , " starring nicole kidman .
us-backed projects by christian alvart , sandra nettelbeck , florian baxmeyer and joseph rusnak are still in the pipeline - and the list goes on .
still basking in the afterglow of florian von donnersmarck 's " the lives of others " oscar triumph in february , germany could n't be prouder of its young directors suddenly swarming the dream factory .
young , gifted and cheap they certainly look like they 've started running with the big guys .
but they 're succeeding by going native and mainstream - what they 're not doing is adding any quintessentially german artistic vision to the hollywood mix .
instead , they 've learnt how to beat the americans at their own game .
taking their cues from germany 's only long-standing hollywood heavyweights , roland emmerich and wolfgang petersen , the new crop of directors is making solid commercial fare expertly pitched at the us market .
the appeal of german directors in hollywood is n't any unique artistic agenda , says andrea dittgen from the association of german film critics .
it 's purely practical .
" they 're hired because they 're cheaper than their american peers , " she said .
crucially , this latest generation - with the exception of hirschbiegel - is also very young , and can still be " steered . "
" they 're willing to work for less , because hollywood is where they want to be .
and these directors are very open-minded about giving the studios what they want , " she said .
hollywood getting its money 's worth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " premonition " is a classic psycho-thriller " premonition , " a supernatural thriller made by mennan yapo for sony , is a case in point .
the turkish-german director was snapped up by the entertainment capital on the strength of just one feature-length movie in germany , which was released in the us as " soundless . "
hollywood knew what it was doing .
garnering sandra bullock the highest-grossing opening weekend of her career , " premonition " ticks all the right hollywood boxes .
" when the studios hire germans they know they 're going to get more out of the budget , " said yapo .
" they 're punctual and they 're basically good workers who are very well trained . "
" german directors come highly skilled , " said german producer and visual effects supervisor volker engel , who won an oscar in 1997 for his work on " independence day . "
the movie , which still ranks among the top 10 all-time box-office smashes , was one of the first to prove that german directors - in this case , roland emmerich - were adept at delivering classic american blockbusters with maximum efficiency .
" they 're used to shooting fast , because german films are done with smaller budgets and have less shooting days than us productions , " he adds .
but mennan yapo feels a bit of european flair should n't be underestimated .
" hollywood also knows it 's going to get some edge from german directors , " he says .
" it 's basically an industry , and it 's aware that now and then , it needs fresh blood .
a couple of years ago the mexicans came along and brought in some new flavor .
now it 's the germans ' turn .
especially when they 're doing genre films , they deliver a different point of view on americana . "
taking the rough with the smooth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : emmerich can make disaster movies with the best of them even so , old-school " auteur " filmmakers are less likely to find themselves clasped to the tinseltown bosom .
like yapo , volker engel is aware that hollywood is always on the lookout for the new " it " people , but that an invitation to the party does come with strings attached .
" it can be difficult for a german director to do his first project here , because on the one hand they make you feel like the ' king ' , but on the other hand you 're spending their money .
so they will say : " hey , ' king , ' you can do whatever you want , but only as long as we 're happy with it . "
but this is n't necessarily a problem for german directors , who have a natural affinity for us-style movie-making .
" germany is very america-friendly , " said film critic andrea dittgen .
" most young directors grew up with us movies and they 're heavily influenced by them . "
germany 's part in the history of cinema in fact , the affinity is mutual .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the producer of " capote " was born in düsseldorf " there has been a long-standing tradition of german emigres working -lsb- in hollywood -rsb- , from the classical era to the present day , " explained german producer michael ohoven , whose movie " capote " was nominated as best motion picture of the year in 2005 .
he points out that germans have been instrumental in defining the hollywood cinema since its early days .
" the most skilled and influential directors from the golden age of hollywood were german , including fritz lang , f. w. murnau , billy wilder , ernst lubitsch , and douglas sirk , " he said .
" the stylistic tendencies of american film noir , which produced some of hollywood ’ s greatest titles of all time , are largely indebted to the german expressionist films of the 1920s . "
" perhaps because germany has a popular cinema with a strong genre sensibility , germans are uniquely suited to succeed within the hollywood system , " he added .
as mennan yapo observed , their sudden prominence in hollywood after decades of absence is basically an organic progression .
" let 's not forget that after the second world war , well up to the ' 70s , there were not many german directors anywhere at all , not even in germany , " he explains .
" no one who emigrated to the us during the nazi regime came back .
the years from ' 33 to ' 45 emptied germany artistically , so the country took a while to get back on track . "
but then it began gaining new artistic self-confidence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rainer werner fassbinder , a very european director " in the 1970s , werner herzog , rainer werner fassbinder and volker schlöndorff came along , " said yapo .
" initially , they leaned more towards the french directors and the new wave .
but then schlöndorff , for example , started making films in english , and they started leaning towards hollywood .
we began to see the fruits of all the film schools that had started up in the 60s and 70s . "
the next step , however , was to strike out for american shores .
and it still is .
" film still is n't an industry here , " says yapo .
" at some point , german directors have to make a decision about where they 're going to work , " said andrea dittgen .
" if they stay in germany , most of them will end up working for television , which ultimately spoils them for hollywood because they become unable to adapt .
whereas if they head to hollywood they 'll broaden their horizons , which is always a good thing .
and they do n't necessarily have to stay - they can always come back and use what they 've learned in germany . "
volker engel is similarly optimistic that germany does n't need to worry about a brain drain .
" i see a future for more german directors making movies both in hollywood and in germany , and moving back and forth between two very different worlds , " he said . jane paulick send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

poland , despite its opposition to many aspects of the treaty , is confident of success . eu leaders are meeting on monday , oct .
15 , in luxembourg hoping that polish calls for last-minute changes to the bloc 's reform treaty will not prove fatal .
they 're also crossing their fingers that poland 's stated optimism about the treaty 's chances is on the mark .
the eu 's future treaty received an optimistic boost last week when polish president lech kaczynski , leader of a country with many reservations about the text , said that there was a " 95-98 percent " chance of an agreement on the treaty at the forthcoming lisbon summit being held on oct .
18-19 .
kaczynski told reporters that " all we had considered as the problems of the treaty belong more to the past than the present . "
" i am convinced that we will be able to come to an agreement , " he added polish reservations date back to june the progress of the treaty has been hindered since it was first hammered into shape at a european union summit in brussels in june during germany 's presidency of the 27-country bloc .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's job in june was made difficult by kaczynski poland 's strong opposition to the system under which voting rights are distributed throughout the eu according to the treaty led to marathon negotiations overseen by german chancellor angela merkel .
the poles succeeded in delaying the introduction of the double majority voting system - which warsaw opposes for fear it will give big countries too much decision-making power - until 2014 , after which it would be phased in over three years .
fundamental rights charter also a problem kaczynski acknowledged that poland had reservations about voting rights and a charter of fundamental rights but said that these objections could be dealt with in " a separate declaration . "
but he maintained that poland would oppose the current plan for a european charter of fundamental rights , saying " poland 's point of view culturally is different from the majority of other european countries . "
he said the overwhelmingly roman catholic nation could not " for example accept marriages of people of the same sex . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland hopes france can help cure its eu headaches kaczynski added that warsaw 's demand for a permanent post at the european court also remained " a considerable problem " but underlined that this could be " resolved " with the help of other countries , notably france .
despite his confidence over an agreement in lisbon this week , kaczynski hinted that legislative elections in his country , due to take place two days after the eu summit , would not make his task in negotiating on an eu level any easier .
" it would have been better if the summit took place after the elections , " he said .
poland called new legislative elections for oct .
21 after the collapse of prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski 's fractious coalition with a far-right party and a rural populist movement .
eu hopeful bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what started in berlin is hoped to be completed in lisbon portugal , the current holder of the six-month eu rotating presidency , is confident the final version of the treaty will be approved at the summit in lisbon before being ratified in all member states in 2008 and coming into force on jan .
1 , 2009 .
eu leaders want the treaty to come into force by the jan .
1 deadline so that public confidence in the european project is not undermined during elections to the european parliament that year .
the new treaty , the compromise text which replaces the much-maligned and doomed eu constitution , is seen as vital to streamlining the workings of a union which has expanded from 15 to 27 member states since 2004 . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but does the westwards exodus of film professionals mean the home-grown industry loses out ? hitting german cinema screens in october are " premonition " by mennan yapo , " trade " by marco kreuzpaintner and oliver hirschbiegel ’ s " the invasion , " a remake of the 1955 classic " the body snatchers , " starring nicole kidman .
us-backed projects by christian alvart , sandra nettelbeck , florian baxmeyer and joseph rusnak are still in the pipeline - and the list goes on .
still basking in the afterglow of florian von donnersmarck 's " the lives of others " oscar triumph in february , germany could n't be prouder of its young directors suddenly swarming the dream factory .
young , gifted and cheap they certainly look like they 've started running with the big guys .
but they 're succeeding by going native and mainstream - what they 're not doing is adding any quintessentially german artistic vision to the hollywood mix .
instead , they 've learnt how to beat the americans at their own game .
taking their cues from germany 's only long-standing hollywood heavyweights , roland emmerich and wolfgang petersen , the new crop of directors is making solid commercial fare expertly pitched at the us market .
the appeal of german directors in hollywood is n't any unique artistic agenda , says andrea dittgen from the association of german film critics .
it 's purely practical .
" they 're hired because they 're cheaper than their american peers , " she said .
crucially , this latest generation - with the exception of hirschbiegel - is also very young , and can still be " steered . "
" they 're willing to work for less , because hollywood is where they want to be .
and these directors are very open-minded about giving the studios what they want , " she said .
hollywood getting its money 's worth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " premonition " is a classic psycho-thriller " premonition , " a supernatural thriller made by mennan yapo for sony , is a case in point .
the turkish-german director was snapped up by the entertainment capital on the strength of just one feature-length movie in germany , which was released in the us as " soundless . "
hollywood knew what it was doing .
garnering sandra bullock the highest-grossing opening weekend of her career , " premonition " ticks all the right hollywood boxes .
" when the studios hire germans they know they 're going to get more out of the budget , " said yapo .
" they 're punctual and they 're basically good workers who are very well trained . "
" german directors come highly skilled , " said german producer and visual effects supervisor volker engel , who won an oscar in 1997 for his work on " independence day . "
the movie , which still ranks among the top 10 all-time box-office smashes , was one of the first to prove that german directors - in this case , roland emmerich - were adept at delivering classic american blockbusters with maximum efficiency .
" they 're used to shooting fast , because german films are done with smaller budgets and have less shooting days than us productions , " he adds .
but mennan yapo feels a bit of european flair should n't be underestimated .
" hollywood also knows it 's going to get some edge from german directors , " he says .
" it 's basically an industry , and it 's aware that now and then , it needs fresh blood .
a couple of years ago the mexicans came along and brought in some new flavor .
now it 's the germans ' turn .
especially when they 're doing genre films , they deliver a different point of view on americana . "
taking the rough with the smooth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : emmerich can make disaster movies with the best of them even so , old-school " auteur " filmmakers are less likely to find themselves clasped to the tinseltown bosom .
like yapo , volker engel is aware that hollywood is always on the lookout for the new " it " people , but that an invitation to the party does come with strings attached .
" it can be difficult for a german director to do his first project here , because on the one hand they make you feel like the ' king ' , but on the other hand you 're spending their money .
so they will say : " hey , ' king , ' you can do whatever you want , but only as long as we 're happy with it . "
but this is n't necessarily a problem for german directors , who have a natural affinity for us-style movie-making .
" germany is very america-friendly , " said film critic andrea dittgen .
" most young directors grew up with us movies and they 're heavily influenced by them . "
germany 's part in the history of cinema in fact , the affinity is mutual .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the producer of " capote " was born in düsseldorf " there has been a long-standing tradition of german emigres working -lsb- in hollywood -rsb- , from the classical era to the present day , " explained german producer michael ohoven , whose movie " capote " was nominated as best motion picture of the year in 2005 .
he points out that germans have been instrumental in defining the hollywood cinema since its early days .
" the most skilled and influential directors from the golden age of hollywood were german , including fritz lang , f. w. murnau , billy wilder , ernst lubitsch , and douglas sirk , " he said .
" the stylistic tendencies of american film noir , which produced some of hollywood ’ s greatest titles of all time , are largely indebted to the german expressionist films of the 1920s . "
" perhaps because germany has a popular cinema with a strong genre sensibility , germans are uniquely suited to succeed within the hollywood system , " he added .
as mennan yapo observed , their sudden prominence in hollywood after decades of absence is basically an organic progression .
" let 's not forget that after the second world war , well up to the ' 70s , there were not many german directors anywhere at all , not even in germany , " he explains .
" no one who emigrated to the us during the nazi regime came back .
the years from ' 33 to ' 45 emptied germany artistically , so the country took a while to get back on track . "
but then it began gaining new artistic self-confidence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rainer werner fassbinder , a very european director " in the 1970s , werner herzog , rainer werner fassbinder and volker schlöndorff came along , " said yapo .
" initially , they leaned more towards the french directors and the new wave .
but then schlöndorff , for example , started making films in english , and they started leaning towards hollywood .
we began to see the fruits of all the film schools that had started up in the 60s and 70s . "
the next step , however , was to strike out for american shores .
and it still is .
" film still is n't an industry here , " says yapo .
" at some point , german directors have to make a decision about where they 're going to work , " said andrea dittgen .
" if they stay in germany , most of them will end up working for television , which ultimately spoils them for hollywood because they become unable to adapt .
whereas if they head to hollywood they 'll broaden their horizons , which is always a good thing .
and they do n't necessarily have to stay - they can always come back and use what they 've learned in germany . "
volker engel is similarly optimistic that germany does n't need to worry about a brain drain .

poland , despite its opposition to many aspects of the treaty , is confident of success . eu leaders are meeting on monday , oct .
15 , in luxembourg hoping that polish calls for last-minute changes to the bloc 's reform treaty will not prove fatal .
they 're also crossing their fingers that poland 's stated optimism about the treaty 's chances is on the mark .
the eu 's future treaty received an optimistic boost last week when polish president lech kaczynski , leader of a country with many reservations about the text , said that there was a " 95-98 percent " chance of an agreement on the treaty at the forthcoming lisbon summit being held on oct .

kaczynski told reporters that " all we had considered as the problems of the treaty belong more to the past than the present . "
" i am convinced that we will be able to come to an agreement , " he added polish reservations date back to june the progress of the treaty has been hindered since it was first hammered into shape at a european union summit in brussels in june during germany 's presidency of the 27-country bloc .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's job in june was made difficult by kaczynski poland 's strong opposition to the system under which voting rights are distributed throughout the eu according to the treaty led to marathon negotiations overseen by german chancellor angela merkel .
the poles succeeded in delaying the introduction of the double majority voting system - which warsaw opposes for fear it will give big countries too much decision-making power - until 2014 , after which it would be phased in over three years .
fundamental rights charter also a problem kaczynski acknowledged that poland had reservations about voting rights and a charter of fundamental rights but said that these objections could be dealt with in " a separate declaration . "
but he maintained that poland would oppose the current plan for a european charter of fundamental rights , saying " poland 's point of view culturally is different from the majority of other european countries . "
he said the overwhelmingly roman catholic nation could not " for example accept marriages of people of the same sex . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland hopes france can help cure its eu headaches kaczynski added that warsaw 's demand for a permanent post at the european court also remained " a considerable problem " but underlined that this could be " resolved " with the help of other countries , notably france .
despite his confidence over an agreement in lisbon this week , kaczynski hinted that legislative elections in his country , due to take place two days after the eu summit , would not make his task in negotiating on an eu level any easier .
" it would have been better if the summit took place after the elections , " he said .

poland , despite its opposition to many aspects of the treaty , is confident of success . eu leaders are meeting on monday , oct .
15 , in luxembourg hoping that polish calls for last-minute changes to the bloc 's reform treaty will not prove fatal .
they 're also crossing their fingers that poland 's stated optimism about the treaty 's chances is on the mark .
the eu 's future treaty received an optimistic boost last week when polish president lech kaczynski , leader of a country with many reservations about the text , said that there was a " 95-98 percent " chance of an agreement on the treaty at the forthcoming lisbon summit being held on oct .
18-19 .
kaczynski told reporters that " all we had considered as the problems of the treaty belong more to the past than the present . "
" i am convinced that we will be able to come to an agreement , " he added polish reservations date back to june the progress of the treaty has been hindered since it was first hammered into shape at a european union summit in brussels in june during germany 's presidency of the 27-country bloc .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's job in june was made difficult by kaczynski poland 's strong opposition to the system under which voting rights are distributed throughout the eu according to the treaty led to marathon negotiations overseen by german chancellor angela merkel .
the poles succeeded in delaying the introduction of the double majority voting system - which warsaw opposes for fear it will give big countries too much decision-making power - until 2014 , after which it would be phased in over three years .
fundamental rights charter also a problem kaczynski acknowledged that poland had reservations about voting rights and a charter of fundamental rights but said that these objections could be dealt with in " a separate declaration . "
but he maintained that poland would oppose the current plan for a european charter of fundamental rights , saying " poland 's point of view culturally is different from the majority of other european countries . "
he said the overwhelmingly roman catholic nation could not " for example accept marriages of people of the same sex . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland hopes france can help cure its eu headaches kaczynski added that warsaw 's demand for a permanent post at the european court also remained " a considerable problem " but underlined that this could be " resolved " with the help of other countries , notably france .
despite his confidence over an agreement in lisbon this week , kaczynski hinted that legislative elections in his country , due to take place two days after the eu summit , would not make his task in negotiating on an eu level any easier .
" it would have been better if the summit took place after the elections , " he said .
poland called new legislative elections for oct .
21 after the collapse of prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski 's fractious coalition with a far-right party and a rural populist movement .
eu hopeful bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what started in berlin is hoped to be completed in lisbon portugal , the current holder of the six-month eu rotating presidency , is confident the final version of the treaty will be approved at the summit in lisbon before being ratified in all member states in 2008 and coming into force on jan .
1 , 2009 .
eu leaders want the treaty to come into force by the jan .
1 deadline so that public confidence in the european project is not undermined during elections to the european parliament that year .
the new treaty , the compromise text which replaces the much-maligned and doomed eu constitution , is seen as vital to streamlining the workings of a union which has expanded from 15 to 27 member states since 2004 . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

15 , germany 's chancellor said that the international community needs to be ready to impose further sanctions on tehran should leaders there refuse to cooperate in the nuclear row . speaking ahead of monday 's meeting with russian president vladimir putin in the central german town of wiesbaden , merkel said that the international community continued to worry about the iranian nuclear crisis as tehran had ignored binding resolutions by the un security council and demands of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- .
" together with our partners france , england , america , russia and china , we 've searched for ways again and again to bring iran back to the negotiating table , " merkel told the web site of german daily die welt in response to a question on whether germany had become too dependent on us foreign policy .
" since iran did n't accept - even though we made constructive offers - and since it still does n't fulfill the demands of the international community , we had to choose the path of sanctions in the un security council , " the chancellor said , adding that china and russia supported the sanctions " we can not close our eyes to the dangers , " she said .
" i strongly support finding a diplomatic solution , but we also need to be ready to impose further sanctions if iran does not budge .
it threatens israel 's security , which is non-negotiable for me as german chancellor .
it threatens the region , europe , and the world .
we have to prevent that . "
putin goes ahead with iran visit the topic was also expected to dominate merkel 's talks with putin on monday ahead of a joint attendance of an annual russian-german forum , the st. petersburg dialogue .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 15.10.2007 polish leader confident of eu treaty success großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president lech kaczynski , right , has become more positive about the eu treaty eu leaders hope to sign off on the eu treaty , the compromise text that replaces the bloc 's failed constitution , in lisbon this week .
poland , despite its opposition to many aspects of the treaty , is confident of success . eu leaders are meeting on monday , oct .
15 , in luxembourg hoping that polish calls for last-minute changes to the bloc 's reform treaty will not prove fatal .
they 're also crossing their fingers that poland 's stated optimism about the treaty 's chances is on the mark .
the eu 's future treaty received an optimistic boost last week when polish president lech kaczynski , leader of a country with many reservations about the text , said that there was a " 95-98 percent " chance of an agreement on the treaty at the forthcoming lisbon summit being held on oct .
18-19 .
kaczynski told reporters that " all we had considered as the problems of the treaty belong more to the past than the present . "
" i am convinced that we will be able to come to an agreement , " he added polish reservations date back to june the progress of the treaty has been hindered since it was first hammered into shape at a european union summit in brussels in june during germany 's presidency of the 27-country bloc .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's job in june was made difficult by kaczynski poland 's strong opposition to the system under which voting rights are distributed throughout the eu according to the treaty led to marathon negotiations overseen by german chancellor angela merkel .
the poles succeeded in delaying the introduction of the double majority voting system - which warsaw opposes for fear it will give big countries too much decision-making power - until 2014 , after which it would be phased in over three years .
fundamental rights charter also a problem kaczynski acknowledged that poland had reservations about voting rights and a charter of fundamental rights but said that these objections could be dealt with in " a separate declaration . "
but he maintained that poland would oppose the current plan for a european charter of fundamental rights , saying " poland 's point of view culturally is different from the majority of other european countries . "
he said the overwhelmingly roman catholic nation could not " for example accept marriages of people of the same sex . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland hopes france can help cure its eu headaches kaczynski added that warsaw 's demand for a permanent post at the european court also remained " a considerable problem " but underlined that this could be " resolved " with the help of other countries , notably france .
despite his confidence over an agreement in lisbon this week , kaczynski hinted that legislative elections in his country , due to take place two days after the eu summit , would not make his task in negotiating on an eu level any easier .
" it would have been better if the summit took place after the elections , " he said .
poland called new legislative elections for oct .
21 after the collapse of prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski 's fractious coalition with a far-right party and a rural populist movement .
eu hopeful bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what started in berlin is hoped to be completed in lisbon portugal , the current holder of the six-month eu rotating presidency , is confident the final version of the treaty will be approved at the summit in lisbon before being ratified in all member states in 2008 and coming into force on jan .
1 , 2009 .
eu leaders want the treaty to come into force by the jan .
1 deadline so that public confidence in the european project is not undermined during elections to the european parliament that year .
the new treaty , the compromise text which replaces the much-maligned and doomed eu constitution , is seen as vital to streamlining the workings of a union which has expanded from 15 to 27 member states since 2004 . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

15 , germany 's chancellor said that the international community needs to be ready to impose further sanctions on tehran should leaders there refuse to cooperate in the nuclear row . speaking ahead of monday 's meeting with russian president vladimir putin in the central german town of wiesbaden , merkel said that the international community continued to worry about the iranian nuclear crisis as tehran had ignored binding resolutions by the un security council and demands of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- .
" together with our partners france , england , america , russia and china , we 've searched for ways again and again to bring iran back to the negotiating table , " merkel told the web site of german daily die welt in response to a question on whether germany had become too dependent on us foreign policy .
" since iran did n't accept - even though we made constructive offers - and since it still does n't fulfill the demands of the international community , we had to choose the path of sanctions in the un security council , " the chancellor said , adding that china and russia supported the sanctions " we can not close our eyes to the dangers , " she said .
" i strongly support finding a diplomatic solution , but we also need to be ready to impose further sanctions if iran does not budge .
it threatens israel 's security , which is non-negotiable for me as german chancellor .
it threatens the region , europe , and the world .
we have to prevent that . "
putin goes ahead with iran visit the topic was also expected to dominate merkel 's talks with putin on monday ahead of a joint attendance of an annual russian-german forum , the st. petersburg dialogue .

15 , germany 's chancellor said that the international community needs to be ready to impose further sanctions on tehran should leaders there refuse to cooperate in the nuclear row . speaking ahead of monday 's meeting with russian president vladimir putin in the central german town of wiesbaden , merkel said that the international community continued to worry about the iranian nuclear crisis as tehran had ignored binding resolutions by the un security council and demands of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- .
" together with our partners france , england , america , russia and china , we 've searched for ways again and again to bring iran back to the negotiating table , " merkel told the web site of german daily die welt in response to a question on whether germany had become too dependent on us foreign policy .
" since iran did n't accept - even though we made constructive offers - and since it still does n't fulfill the demands of the international community , we had to choose the path of sanctions in the un security council , " the chancellor said , adding that china and russia supported the sanctions " we can not close our eyes to the dangers , " she said .
" i strongly support finding a diplomatic solution , but we also need to be ready to impose further sanctions if iran does not budge .
it threatens israel 's security , which is non-negotiable for me as german chancellor .
it threatens the region , europe , and the world .
we have to prevent that . "
putin goes ahead with iran visit the topic was also expected to dominate merkel 's talks with putin on monday ahead of a joint attendance of an annual russian-german forum , the st. petersburg dialogue .

but does the westwards exodus of film professionals mean the home-grown industry loses out ? hitting german cinema screens in october are " premonition " by mennan yapo , " trade " by marco kreuzpaintner and oliver hirschbiegel ’ s " the invasion , " a remake of the 1955 classic " the body snatchers , " starring nicole kidman .
us-backed projects by christian alvart , sandra nettelbeck , florian baxmeyer and joseph rusnak are still in the pipeline - and the list goes on .
still basking in the afterglow of florian von donnersmarck 's " the lives of others " oscar triumph in february , germany could n't be prouder of its young directors suddenly swarming the dream factory .
young , gifted and cheap they certainly look like they 've started running with the big guys .
but they 're succeeding by going native and mainstream - what they 're not doing is adding any quintessentially german artistic vision to the hollywood mix .
instead , they 've learnt how to beat the americans at their own game .
taking their cues from germany 's only long-standing hollywood heavyweights , roland emmerich and wolfgang petersen , the new crop of directors is making solid commercial fare expertly pitched at the us market .
the appeal of german directors in hollywood is n't any unique artistic agenda , says andrea dittgen from the association of german film critics .
it 's purely practical .
" they 're hired because they 're cheaper than their american peers , " she said .
crucially , this latest generation - with the exception of hirschbiegel - is also very young , and can still be " steered . "
" they 're willing to work for less , because hollywood is where they want to be .
and these directors are very open-minded about giving the studios what they want , " she said .
hollywood getting its money 's worth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " premonition " is a classic psycho-thriller " premonition , " a supernatural thriller made by mennan yapo for sony , is a case in point .
the turkish-german director was snapped up by the entertainment capital on the strength of just one feature-length movie in germany , which was released in the us as " soundless . "
hollywood knew what it was doing .
garnering sandra bullock the highest-grossing opening weekend of her career , " premonition " ticks all the right hollywood boxes .
" when the studios hire germans they know they 're going to get more out of the budget , " said yapo .
" they 're punctual and they 're basically good workers who are very well trained . "
" german directors come highly skilled , " said german producer and visual effects supervisor volker engel , who won an oscar in 1997 for his work on " independence day . "
the movie , which still ranks among the top 10 all-time box-office smashes , was one of the first to prove that german directors - in this case , roland emmerich - were adept at delivering classic american blockbusters with maximum efficiency .
" they 're used to shooting fast , because german films are done with smaller budgets and have less shooting days than us productions , " he adds .
but mennan yapo feels a bit of european flair should n't be underestimated .
" hollywood also knows it 's going to get some edge from german directors , " he says .
" it 's basically an industry , and it 's aware that now and then , it needs fresh blood .
a couple of years ago the mexicans came along and brought in some new flavor .
now it 's the germans ' turn .
especially when they 're doing genre films , they deliver a different point of view on americana . "
taking the rough with the smooth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : emmerich can make disaster movies with the best of them even so , old-school " auteur " filmmakers are less likely to find themselves clasped to the tinseltown bosom .
like yapo , volker engel is aware that hollywood is always on the lookout for the new " it " people , but that an invitation to the party does come with strings attached .
" it can be difficult for a german director to do his first project here , because on the one hand they make you feel like the ' king ' , but on the other hand you 're spending their money .
so they will say : " hey , ' king , ' you can do whatever you want , but only as long as we 're happy with it . "
but this is n't necessarily a problem for german directors , who have a natural affinity for us-style movie-making .
" germany is very america-friendly , " said film critic andrea dittgen .
" most young directors grew up with us movies and they 're heavily influenced by them . "
germany 's part in the history of cinema in fact , the affinity is mutual .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the producer of " capote " was born in düsseldorf " there has been a long-standing tradition of german emigres working -lsb- in hollywood -rsb- , from the classical era to the present day , " explained german producer michael ohoven , whose movie " capote " was nominated as best motion picture of the year in 2005 .
he points out that germans have been instrumental in defining the hollywood cinema since its early days .
" the most skilled and influential directors from the golden age of hollywood were german , including fritz lang , f. w. murnau , billy wilder , ernst lubitsch , and douglas sirk , " he said .
" the stylistic tendencies of american film noir , which produced some of hollywood ’ s greatest titles of all time , are largely indebted to the german expressionist films of the 1920s . "
" perhaps because germany has a popular cinema with a strong genre sensibility , germans are uniquely suited to succeed within the hollywood system , " he added .
as mennan yapo observed , their sudden prominence in hollywood after decades of absence is basically an organic progression .
" let 's not forget that after the second world war , well up to the ' 70s , there were not many german directors anywhere at all , not even in germany , " he explains .
" no one who emigrated to the us during the nazi regime came back .
the years from ' 33 to ' 45 emptied germany artistically , so the country took a while to get back on track . "
but then it began gaining new artistic self-confidence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rainer werner fassbinder , a very european director " in the 1970s , werner herzog , rainer werner fassbinder and volker schlöndorff came along , " said yapo .
" initially , they leaned more towards the french directors and the new wave .
but then schlöndorff , for example , started making films in english , and they started leaning towards hollywood .
we began to see the fruits of all the film schools that had started up in the 60s and 70s . "
the next step , however , was to strike out for american shores .
and it still is .
" film still is n't an industry here , " says yapo .
" at some point , german directors have to make a decision about where they 're going to work , " said andrea dittgen .
" if they stay in germany , most of them will end up working for television , which ultimately spoils them for hollywood because they become unable to adapt .
whereas if they head to hollywood they 'll broaden their horizons , which is always a good thing .
and they do n't necessarily have to stay - they can always come back and use what they 've learned in germany . "
volker engel is similarly optimistic that germany does n't need to worry about a brain drain .
" i see a future for more german directors making movies both in hollywood and in germany , and moving back and forth between two very different worlds , " he said . jane paulick send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

taking their cues from germany 's only long-standing hollywood heavyweights , roland emmerich and wolfgang petersen , the new crop of directors is making solid commercial fare expertly pitched at the us market .
the appeal of german directors in hollywood is n't any unique artistic agenda , says andrea dittgen from the association of german film critics .
it 's purely practical .
" they 're hired because they 're cheaper than their american peers , " she said .
crucially , this latest generation - with the exception of hirschbiegel - is also very young , and can still be " steered . "
" they 're willing to work for less , because hollywood is where they want to be .
and these directors are very open-minded about giving the studios what they want , " she said .
hollywood getting its money 's worth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " premonition " is a classic psycho-thriller " premonition , " a supernatural thriller made by mennan yapo for sony , is a case in point .
the turkish-german director was snapped up by the entertainment capital on the strength of just one feature-length movie in germany , which was released in the us as " soundless . "
hollywood knew what it was doing .
garnering sandra bullock the highest-grossing opening weekend of her career , " premonition " ticks all the right hollywood boxes .
" when the studios hire germans they know they 're going to get more out of the budget , " said yapo .
" they 're punctual and they 're basically good workers who are very well trained . "
" german directors come highly skilled , " said german producer and visual effects supervisor volker engel , who won an oscar in 1997 for his work on " independence day . "
the movie , which still ranks among the top 10 all-time box-office smashes , was one of the first to prove that german directors - in this case , roland emmerich - were adept at delivering classic american blockbusters with maximum efficiency .
" they 're used to shooting fast , because german films are done with smaller budgets and have less shooting days than us productions , " he adds .
but mennan yapo feels a bit of european flair should n't be underestimated .
" hollywood also knows it 's going to get some edge from german directors , " he says .
" it 's basically an industry , and it 's aware that now and then , it needs fresh blood .
a couple of years ago the mexicans came along and brought in some new flavor .
now it 's the germans ' turn .
especially when they 're doing genre films , they deliver a different point of view on americana . "
taking the rough with the smooth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : emmerich can make disaster movies with the best of them even so , old-school " auteur " filmmakers are less likely to find themselves clasped to the tinseltown bosom .
like yapo , volker engel is aware that hollywood is always on the lookout for the new " it " people , but that an invitation to the party does come with strings attached .
" it can be difficult for a german director to do his first project here , because on the one hand they make you feel like the ' king ' , but on the other hand you 're spending their money .
so they will say : " hey , ' king , ' you can do whatever you want , but only as long as we 're happy with it . "
but this is n't necessarily a problem for german directors , who have a natural affinity for us-style movie-making .
" germany is very america-friendly , " said film critic andrea dittgen .
" most young directors grew up with us movies and they 're heavily influenced by them . "
germany 's part in the history of cinema in fact , the affinity is mutual .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the producer of " capote " was born in düsseldorf " there has been a long-standing tradition of german emigres working -lsb- in hollywood -rsb- , from the classical era to the present day , " explained german producer michael ohoven , whose movie " capote " was nominated as best motion picture of the year in 2005 .
he points out that germans have been instrumental in defining the hollywood cinema since its early days .
" the most skilled and influential directors from the golden age of hollywood were german , including fritz lang , f. w. murnau , billy wilder , ernst lubitsch , and douglas sirk , " he said .
" the stylistic tendencies of american film noir , which produced some of hollywood ’ s greatest titles of all time , are largely indebted to the german expressionist films of the 1920s . "
" perhaps because germany has a popular cinema with a strong genre sensibility , germans are uniquely suited to succeed within the hollywood system , " he added .
as mennan yapo observed , their sudden prominence in hollywood after decades of absence is basically an organic progression .
" let 's not forget that after the second world war , well up to the ' 70s , there were not many german directors anywhere at all , not even in germany , " he explains .
" no one who emigrated to the us during the nazi regime came back .
the years from ' 33 to ' 45 emptied germany artistically , so the country took a while to get back on track . "
but then it began gaining new artistic self-confidence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rainer werner fassbinder , a very european director " in the 1970s , werner herzog , rainer werner fassbinder and volker schlöndorff came along , " said yapo .
" initially , they leaned more towards the french directors and the new wave .
but then schlöndorff , for example , started making films in english , and they started leaning towards hollywood .
we began to see the fruits of all the film schools that had started up in the 60s and 70s . "
the next step , however , was to strike out for american shores .
and it still is .
" film still is n't an industry here , " says yapo .
" at some point , german directors have to make a decision about where they 're going to work , " said andrea dittgen .
" if they stay in germany , most of them will end up working for television , which ultimately spoils them for hollywood because they become unable to adapt .
whereas if they head to hollywood they 'll broaden their horizons , which is always a good thing .
and they do n't necessarily have to stay - they can always come back and use what they 've learned in germany . "
volker engel is similarly optimistic that germany does n't need to worry about a brain drain .

still basking in the afterglow of florian von donnersmarck 's " the lives of others " oscar triumph in february , germany could n't be prouder of its young directors suddenly swarming the dream factory .
young , gifted and cheap they certainly look like they 've started running with the big guys .
but they 're succeeding by going native and mainstream - what they 're not doing is adding any quintessentially german artistic vision to the hollywood mix .
instead , they 've learnt how to beat the americans at their own game .
taking their cues from germany 's only long-standing hollywood heavyweights , roland emmerich and wolfgang petersen , the new crop of directors is making solid commercial fare expertly pitched at the us market .
the appeal of german directors in hollywood is n't any unique artistic agenda , says andrea dittgen from the association of german film critics .
it 's purely practical .
" they 're hired because they 're cheaper than their american peers , " she said .
crucially , this latest generation - with the exception of hirschbiegel - is also very young , and can still be " steered . "
" they 're willing to work for less , because hollywood is where they want to be .
and these directors are very open-minded about giving the studios what they want , " she said .
hollywood getting its money 's worth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " premonition " is a classic psycho-thriller " premonition , " a supernatural thriller made by mennan yapo for sony , is a case in point .
the turkish-german director was snapped up by the entertainment capital on the strength of just one feature-length movie in germany , which was released in the us as " soundless . "
hollywood knew what it was doing .
garnering sandra bullock the highest-grossing opening weekend of her career , " premonition " ticks all the right hollywood boxes .
" when the studios hire germans they know they 're going to get more out of the budget , " said yapo .
" they 're punctual and they 're basically good workers who are very well trained . "
" german directors come highly skilled , " said german producer and visual effects supervisor volker engel , who won an oscar in 1997 for his work on " independence day . "
the movie , which still ranks among the top 10 all-time box-office smashes , was one of the first to prove that german directors - in this case , roland emmerich - were adept at delivering classic american blockbusters with maximum efficiency .
" they 're used to shooting fast , because german films are done with smaller budgets and have less shooting days than us productions , " he adds .
but mennan yapo feels a bit of european flair should n't be underestimated .
" hollywood also knows it 's going to get some edge from german directors , " he says .
" it 's basically an industry , and it 's aware that now and then , it needs fresh blood .
a couple of years ago the mexicans came along and brought in some new flavor .
now it 's the germans ' turn .
especially when they 're doing genre films , they deliver a different point of view on americana . "
taking the rough with the smooth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : emmerich can make disaster movies with the best of them even so , old-school " auteur " filmmakers are less likely to find themselves clasped to the tinseltown bosom .
like yapo , volker engel is aware that hollywood is always on the lookout for the new " it " people , but that an invitation to the party does come with strings attached .
" it can be difficult for a german director to do his first project here , because on the one hand they make you feel like the ' king ' , but on the other hand you 're spending their money .
so they will say : " hey , ' king , ' you can do whatever you want , but only as long as we 're happy with it . "
but this is n't necessarily a problem for german directors , who have a natural affinity for us-style movie-making .
" germany is very america-friendly , " said film critic andrea dittgen .
" most young directors grew up with us movies and they 're heavily influenced by them . "
germany 's part in the history of cinema in fact , the affinity is mutual .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the producer of " capote " was born in düsseldorf " there has been a long-standing tradition of german emigres working -lsb- in hollywood -rsb- , from the classical era to the present day , " explained german producer michael ohoven , whose movie " capote " was nominated as best motion picture of the year in 2005 .
he points out that germans have been instrumental in defining the hollywood cinema since its early days .
" the most skilled and influential directors from the golden age of hollywood were german , including fritz lang , f. w. murnau , billy wilder , ernst lubitsch , and douglas sirk , " he said .
" the stylistic tendencies of american film noir , which produced some of hollywood ’ s greatest titles of all time , are largely indebted to the german expressionist films of the 1920s . "
" perhaps because germany has a popular cinema with a strong genre sensibility , germans are uniquely suited to succeed within the hollywood system , " he added .
as mennan yapo observed , their sudden prominence in hollywood after decades of absence is basically an organic progression .
" let 's not forget that after the second world war , well up to the ' 70s , there were not many german directors anywhere at all , not even in germany , " he explains .
" no one who emigrated to the us during the nazi regime came back .
the years from ' 33 to ' 45 emptied germany artistically , so the country took a while to get back on track . "
but then it began gaining new artistic self-confidence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rainer werner fassbinder , a very european director " in the 1970s , werner herzog , rainer werner fassbinder and volker schlöndorff came along , " said yapo .
" initially , they leaned more towards the french directors and the new wave .
but then schlöndorff , for example , started making films in english , and they started leaning towards hollywood .
we began to see the fruits of all the film schools that had started up in the 60s and 70s . "
the next step , however , was to strike out for american shores .
and it still is .
" film still is n't an industry here , " says yapo .
" at some point , german directors have to make a decision about where they 're going to work , " said andrea dittgen .
" if they stay in germany , most of them will end up working for television , which ultimately spoils them for hollywood because they become unable to adapt .
whereas if they head to hollywood they 'll broaden their horizons , which is always a good thing .
and they do n't necessarily have to stay - they can always come back and use what they 've learned in germany . "
volker engel is similarly optimistic that germany does n't need to worry about a brain drain .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 15.10.2007 polish leader confident of eu treaty success großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president lech kaczynski , right , has become more positive about the eu treaty eu leaders hope to sign off on the eu treaty , the compromise text that replaces the bloc 's failed constitution , in lisbon this week .
poland , despite its opposition to many aspects of the treaty , is confident of success . eu leaders are meeting on monday , oct .
15 , in luxembourg hoping that polish calls for last-minute changes to the bloc 's reform treaty will not prove fatal .
they 're also crossing their fingers that poland 's stated optimism about the treaty 's chances is on the mark .
the eu 's future treaty received an optimistic boost last week when polish president lech kaczynski , leader of a country with many reservations about the text , said that there was a " 95-98 percent " chance of an agreement on the treaty at the forthcoming lisbon summit being held on oct .
18-19 .
kaczynski told reporters that " all we had considered as the problems of the treaty belong more to the past than the present . "
" i am convinced that we will be able to come to an agreement , " he added polish reservations date back to june the progress of the treaty has been hindered since it was first hammered into shape at a european union summit in brussels in june during germany 's presidency of the 27-country bloc .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's job in june was made difficult by kaczynski poland 's strong opposition to the system under which voting rights are distributed throughout the eu according to the treaty led to marathon negotiations overseen by german chancellor angela merkel .
the poles succeeded in delaying the introduction of the double majority voting system - which warsaw opposes for fear it will give big countries too much decision-making power - until 2014 , after which it would be phased in over three years .
fundamental rights charter also a problem kaczynski acknowledged that poland had reservations about voting rights and a charter of fundamental rights but said that these objections could be dealt with in " a separate declaration . "
but he maintained that poland would oppose the current plan for a european charter of fundamental rights , saying " poland 's point of view culturally is different from the majority of other european countries . "
he said the overwhelmingly roman catholic nation could not " for example accept marriages of people of the same sex . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland hopes france can help cure its eu headaches kaczynski added that warsaw 's demand for a permanent post at the european court also remained " a considerable problem " but underlined that this could be " resolved " with the help of other countries , notably france .
despite his confidence over an agreement in lisbon this week , kaczynski hinted that legislative elections in his country , due to take place two days after the eu summit , would not make his task in negotiating on an eu level any easier .
" it would have been better if the summit took place after the elections , " he said .
poland called new legislative elections for oct .
21 after the collapse of prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski 's fractious coalition with a far-right party and a rural populist movement .
eu hopeful bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what started in berlin is hoped to be completed in lisbon portugal , the current holder of the six-month eu rotating presidency , is confident the final version of the treaty will be approved at the summit in lisbon before being ratified in all member states in 2008 and coming into force on jan .
1 , 2009 .
eu leaders want the treaty to come into force by the jan .
1 deadline so that public confidence in the european project is not undermined during elections to the european parliament that year .
the new treaty , the compromise text which replaces the much-maligned and doomed eu constitution , is seen as vital to streamlining the workings of a union which has expanded from 15 to 27 member states since 2004 . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

15 , germany 's chancellor said that the international community needs to be ready to impose further sanctions on tehran should leaders there refuse to cooperate in the nuclear row . speaking ahead of monday 's meeting with russian president vladimir putin in the central german town of wiesbaden , merkel said that the international community continued to worry about the iranian nuclear crisis as tehran had ignored binding resolutions by the un security council and demands of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- .
" together with our partners france , england , america , russia and china , we 've searched for ways again and again to bring iran back to the negotiating table , " merkel told the web site of german daily die welt in response to a question on whether germany had become too dependent on us foreign policy .
" since iran did n't accept - even though we made constructive offers - and since it still does n't fulfill the demands of the international community , we had to choose the path of sanctions in the un security council , " the chancellor said , adding that china and russia supported the sanctions " we can not close our eyes to the dangers , " she said .
" i strongly support finding a diplomatic solution , but we also need to be ready to impose further sanctions if iran does not budge .
it threatens israel 's security , which is non-negotiable for me as german chancellor .

but does the westwards exodus of film professionals mean the home-grown industry loses out ? hitting german cinema screens in october are " premonition " by mennan yapo , " trade " by marco kreuzpaintner and oliver hirschbiegel ’ s " the invasion , " a remake of the 1955 classic " the body snatchers , " starring nicole kidman .
us-backed projects by christian alvart , sandra nettelbeck , florian baxmeyer and joseph rusnak are still in the pipeline - and the list goes on .
still basking in the afterglow of florian von donnersmarck 's " the lives of others " oscar triumph in february , germany could n't be prouder of its young directors suddenly swarming the dream factory .
young , gifted and cheap they certainly look like they 've started running with the big guys .
but they 're succeeding by going native and mainstream - what they 're not doing is adding any quintessentially german artistic vision to the hollywood mix .
instead , they 've learnt how to beat the americans at their own game .
taking their cues from germany 's only long-standing hollywood heavyweights , roland emmerich and wolfgang petersen , the new crop of directors is making solid commercial fare expertly pitched at the us market .
the appeal of german directors in hollywood is n't any unique artistic agenda , says andrea dittgen from the association of german film critics .
it 's purely practical .
" they 're hired because they 're cheaper than their american peers , " she said .
crucially , this latest generation - with the exception of hirschbiegel - is also very young , and can still be " steered . "
" they 're willing to work for less , because hollywood is where they want to be .
and these directors are very open-minded about giving the studios what they want , " she said .
hollywood getting its money 's worth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " premonition " is a classic psycho-thriller " premonition , " a supernatural thriller made by mennan yapo for sony , is a case in point .
the turkish-german director was snapped up by the entertainment capital on the strength of just one feature-length movie in germany , which was released in the us as " soundless . "
hollywood knew what it was doing .
garnering sandra bullock the highest-grossing opening weekend of her career , " premonition " ticks all the right hollywood boxes .
" when the studios hire germans they know they 're going to get more out of the budget , " said yapo .
" they 're punctual and they 're basically good workers who are very well trained . "
" german directors come highly skilled , " said german producer and visual effects supervisor volker engel , who won an oscar in 1997 for his work on " independence day . "
the movie , which still ranks among the top 10 all-time box-office smashes , was one of the first to prove that german directors - in this case , roland emmerich - were adept at delivering classic american blockbusters with maximum efficiency .
" they 're used to shooting fast , because german films are done with smaller budgets and have less shooting days than us productions , " he adds .
but mennan yapo feels a bit of european flair should n't be underestimated .
" hollywood also knows it 's going to get some edge from german directors , " he says .
" it 's basically an industry , and it 's aware that now and then , it needs fresh blood .
a couple of years ago the mexicans came along and brought in some new flavor .
now it 's the germans ' turn .
especially when they 're doing genre films , they deliver a different point of view on americana . "
taking the rough with the smooth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : emmerich can make disaster movies with the best of them even so , old-school " auteur " filmmakers are less likely to find themselves clasped to the tinseltown bosom .
like yapo , volker engel is aware that hollywood is always on the lookout for the new " it " people , but that an invitation to the party does come with strings attached .
" it can be difficult for a german director to do his first project here , because on the one hand they make you feel like the ' king ' , but on the other hand you 're spending their money .
so they will say : " hey , ' king , ' you can do whatever you want , but only as long as we 're happy with it . "
but this is n't necessarily a problem for german directors , who have a natural affinity for us-style movie-making .
" germany is very america-friendly , " said film critic andrea dittgen .
" most young directors grew up with us movies and they 're heavily influenced by them . "
germany 's part in the history of cinema in fact , the affinity is mutual .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the producer of " capote " was born in düsseldorf " there has been a long-standing tradition of german emigres working -lsb- in hollywood -rsb- , from the classical era to the present day , " explained german producer michael ohoven , whose movie " capote " was nominated as best motion picture of the year in 2005 .
he points out that germans have been instrumental in defining the hollywood cinema since its early days .
" the most skilled and influential directors from the golden age of hollywood were german , including fritz lang , f. w. murnau , billy wilder , ernst lubitsch , and douglas sirk , " he said .
" the stylistic tendencies of american film noir , which produced some of hollywood ’ s greatest titles of all time , are largely indebted to the german expressionist films of the 1920s . "
" perhaps because germany has a popular cinema with a strong genre sensibility , germans are uniquely suited to succeed within the hollywood system , " he added .
as mennan yapo observed , their sudden prominence in hollywood after decades of absence is basically an organic progression .
" let 's not forget that after the second world war , well up to the ' 70s , there were not many german directors anywhere at all , not even in germany , " he explains .
" no one who emigrated to the us during the nazi regime came back .
the years from ' 33 to ' 45 emptied germany artistically , so the country took a while to get back on track . "
but then it began gaining new artistic self-confidence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rainer werner fassbinder , a very european director " in the 1970s , werner herzog , rainer werner fassbinder and volker schlöndorff came along , " said yapo .
" initially , they leaned more towards the french directors and the new wave .
but then schlöndorff , for example , started making films in english , and they started leaning towards hollywood .
we began to see the fruits of all the film schools that had started up in the 60s and 70s . "
the next step , however , was to strike out for american shores .
and it still is .
" film still is n't an industry here , " says yapo .
" at some point , german directors have to make a decision about where they 're going to work , " said andrea dittgen .
" if they stay in germany , most of them will end up working for television , which ultimately spoils them for hollywood because they become unable to adapt .
whereas if they head to hollywood they 'll broaden their horizons , which is always a good thing .
and they do n't necessarily have to stay - they can always come back and use what they 've learned in germany . "
volker engel is similarly optimistic that germany does n't need to worry about a brain drain .
" i see a future for more german directors making movies both in hollywood and in germany , and moving back and forth between two very different worlds , " he said . jane paulick send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

poland , despite its opposition to many aspects of the treaty , is confident of success . eu leaders are meeting on monday , oct .
15 , in luxembourg hoping that polish calls for last-minute changes to the bloc 's reform treaty will not prove fatal .
they 're also crossing their fingers that poland 's stated optimism about the treaty 's chances is on the mark .
the eu 's future treaty received an optimistic boost last week when polish president lech kaczynski , leader of a country with many reservations about the text , said that there was a " 95-98 percent " chance of an agreement on the treaty at the forthcoming lisbon summit being held on oct .
18-19 .
kaczynski told reporters that " all we had considered as the problems of the treaty belong more to the past than the present . "
" i am convinced that we will be able to come to an agreement , " he added polish reservations date back to june the progress of the treaty has been hindered since it was first hammered into shape at a european union summit in brussels in june during germany 's presidency of the 27-country bloc .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's job in june was made difficult by kaczynski poland 's strong opposition to the system under which voting rights are distributed throughout the eu according to the treaty led to marathon negotiations overseen by german chancellor angela merkel .
the poles succeeded in delaying the introduction of the double majority voting system - which warsaw opposes for fear it will give big countries too much decision-making power - until 2014 , after which it would be phased in over three years .
fundamental rights charter also a problem kaczynski acknowledged that poland had reservations about voting rights and a charter of fundamental rights but said that these objections could be dealt with in " a separate declaration . "
but he maintained that poland would oppose the current plan for a european charter of fundamental rights , saying " poland 's point of view culturally is different from the majority of other european countries . "
he said the overwhelmingly roman catholic nation could not " for example accept marriages of people of the same sex . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland hopes france can help cure its eu headaches kaczynski added that warsaw 's demand for a permanent post at the european court also remained " a considerable problem " but underlined that this could be " resolved " with the help of other countries , notably france .
despite his confidence over an agreement in lisbon this week , kaczynski hinted that legislative elections in his country , due to take place two days after the eu summit , would not make his task in negotiating on an eu level any easier .
" it would have been better if the summit took place after the elections , " he said .
poland called new legislative elections for oct .

eu leaders want the treaty to come into force by the jan .
1 deadline so that public confidence in the european project is not undermined during elections to the european parliament that year .

but does the westwards exodus of film professionals mean the home-grown industry loses out ? hitting german cinema screens in october are " premonition " by mennan yapo , " trade " by marco kreuzpaintner and oliver hirschbiegel ’ s " the invasion , " a remake of the 1955 classic " the body snatchers , " starring nicole kidman .
us-backed projects by christian alvart , sandra nettelbeck , florian baxmeyer and joseph rusnak are still in the pipeline - and the list goes on .
still basking in the afterglow of florian von donnersmarck 's " the lives of others " oscar triumph in february , germany could n't be prouder of its young directors suddenly swarming the dream factory .
young , gifted and cheap they certainly look like they 've started running with the big guys .
but they 're succeeding by going native and mainstream - what they 're not doing is adding any quintessentially german artistic vision to the hollywood mix .
instead , they 've learnt how to beat the americans at their own game .
taking their cues from germany 's only long-standing hollywood heavyweights , roland emmerich and wolfgang petersen , the new crop of directors is making solid commercial fare expertly pitched at the us market .
the appeal of german directors in hollywood is n't any unique artistic agenda , says andrea dittgen from the association of german film critics .
it 's purely practical .
" they 're hired because they 're cheaper than their american peers , " she said .
crucially , this latest generation - with the exception of hirschbiegel - is also very young , and can still be " steered . "
" they 're willing to work for less , because hollywood is where they want to be .
and these directors are very open-minded about giving the studios what they want , " she said .
hollywood getting its money 's worth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " premonition " is a classic psycho-thriller " premonition , " a supernatural thriller made by mennan yapo for sony , is a case in point .
the turkish-german director was snapped up by the entertainment capital on the strength of just one feature-length movie in germany , which was released in the us as " soundless . "
hollywood knew what it was doing .
garnering sandra bullock the highest-grossing opening weekend of her career , " premonition " ticks all the right hollywood boxes .
" when the studios hire germans they know they 're going to get more out of the budget , " said yapo .
" they 're punctual and they 're basically good workers who are very well trained . "
" german directors come highly skilled , " said german producer and visual effects supervisor volker engel , who won an oscar in 1997 for his work on " independence day . "
the movie , which still ranks among the top 10 all-time box-office smashes , was one of the first to prove that german directors - in this case , roland emmerich - were adept at delivering classic american blockbusters with maximum efficiency .
" they 're used to shooting fast , because german films are done with smaller budgets and have less shooting days than us productions , " he adds .
but mennan yapo feels a bit of european flair should n't be underestimated .
" hollywood also knows it 's going to get some edge from german directors , " he says .
" it 's basically an industry , and it 's aware that now and then , it needs fresh blood .
a couple of years ago the mexicans came along and brought in some new flavor .
now it 's the germans ' turn .
especially when they 're doing genre films , they deliver a different point of view on americana . "
taking the rough with the smooth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : emmerich can make disaster movies with the best of them even so , old-school " auteur " filmmakers are less likely to find themselves clasped to the tinseltown bosom .
like yapo , volker engel is aware that hollywood is always on the lookout for the new " it " people , but that an invitation to the party does come with strings attached .
" it can be difficult for a german director to do his first project here , because on the one hand they make you feel like the ' king ' , but on the other hand you 're spending their money .
so they will say : " hey , ' king , ' you can do whatever you want , but only as long as we 're happy with it . "
but this is n't necessarily a problem for german directors , who have a natural affinity for us-style movie-making .
" germany is very america-friendly , " said film critic andrea dittgen .
" most young directors grew up with us movies and they 're heavily influenced by them . "
germany 's part in the history of cinema in fact , the affinity is mutual .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the producer of " capote " was born in düsseldorf " there has been a long-standing tradition of german emigres working -lsb- in hollywood -rsb- , from the classical era to the present day , " explained german producer michael ohoven , whose movie " capote " was nominated as best motion picture of the year in 2005 .
he points out that germans have been instrumental in defining the hollywood cinema since its early days .
" the most skilled and influential directors from the golden age of hollywood were german , including fritz lang , f. w. murnau , billy wilder , ernst lubitsch , and douglas sirk , " he said .
" the stylistic tendencies of american film noir , which produced some of hollywood ’ s greatest titles of all time , are largely indebted to the german expressionist films of the 1920s . "
" perhaps because germany has a popular cinema with a strong genre sensibility , germans are uniquely suited to succeed within the hollywood system , " he added .
as mennan yapo observed , their sudden prominence in hollywood after decades of absence is basically an organic progression .
" let 's not forget that after the second world war , well up to the ' 70s , there were not many german directors anywhere at all , not even in germany , " he explains .
" no one who emigrated to the us during the nazi regime came back .
the years from ' 33 to ' 45 emptied germany artistically , so the country took a while to get back on track . "
but then it began gaining new artistic self-confidence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rainer werner fassbinder , a very european director " in the 1970s , werner herzog , rainer werner fassbinder and volker schlöndorff came along , " said yapo .
" initially , they leaned more towards the french directors and the new wave .
but then schlöndorff , for example , started making films in english , and they started leaning towards hollywood .
we began to see the fruits of all the film schools that had started up in the 60s and 70s . "
the next step , however , was to strike out for american shores .
and it still is .
" film still is n't an industry here , " says yapo .
" at some point , german directors have to make a decision about where they 're going to work , " said andrea dittgen .
" if they stay in germany , most of them will end up working for television , which ultimately spoils them for hollywood because they become unable to adapt .
whereas if they head to hollywood they 'll broaden their horizons , which is always a good thing .
and they do n't necessarily have to stay - they can always come back and use what they 've learned in germany . "
volker engel is similarly optimistic that germany does n't need to worry about a brain drain .
" i see a future for more german directors making movies both in hollywood and in germany , and moving back and forth between two very different worlds , " he said . jane paulick send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

as mennan yapo observed , their sudden prominence in hollywood after decades of absence is basically an organic progression .
" let 's not forget that after the second world war , well up to the ' 70s , there were not many german directors anywhere at all , not even in germany , " he explains .
" no one who emigrated to the us during the nazi regime came back .
the years from ' 33 to ' 45 emptied germany artistically , so the country took a while to get back on track . "
but then it began gaining new artistic self-confidence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rainer werner fassbinder , a very european director " in the 1970s , werner herzog , rainer werner fassbinder and volker schlöndorff came along , " said yapo .
" initially , they leaned more towards the french directors and the new wave .
but then schlöndorff , for example , started making films in english , and they started leaning towards hollywood .
we began to see the fruits of all the film schools that had started up in the 60s and 70s . "
the next step , however , was to strike out for american shores .
and it still is .
" film still is n't an industry here , " says yapo .
" at some point , german directors have to make a decision about where they 're going to work , " said andrea dittgen .
" if they stay in germany , most of them will end up working for television , which ultimately spoils them for hollywood because they become unable to adapt .
whereas if they head to hollywood they 'll broaden their horizons , which is always a good thing .
and they do n't necessarily have to stay - they can always come back and use what they 've learned in germany . "
volker engel is similarly optimistic that germany does n't need to worry about a brain drain .
" i see a future for more german directors making movies both in hollywood and in germany , and moving back and forth between two very different worlds , " he said . jane paulick send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de film -pipe- 15.10.2007 german directors the new toast of hollywood großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mennan yapo , rubbing shoulders with sandra bullock in la with a spate of new hollywood movies boasting german directors , tinseltown 's latest love affair is with talent from germany .
but does the westwards exodus of film professionals mean the home-grown industry loses out ? hitting german cinema screens in october are " premonition " by mennan yapo , " trade " by marco kreuzpaintner and oliver hirschbiegel ’ s " the invasion , " a remake of the 1955 classic " the body snatchers , " starring nicole kidman .
us-backed projects by christian alvart , sandra nettelbeck , florian baxmeyer and joseph rusnak are still in the pipeline - and the list goes on .
still basking in the afterglow of florian von donnersmarck 's " the lives of others " oscar triumph in february , germany could n't be prouder of its young directors suddenly swarming the dream factory .
young , gifted and cheap they certainly look like they 've started running with the big guys .
but they 're succeeding by going native and mainstream - what they 're not doing is adding any quintessentially german artistic vision to the hollywood mix .
instead , they 've learnt how to beat the americans at their own game .
taking their cues from germany 's only long-standing hollywood heavyweights , roland emmerich and wolfgang petersen , the new crop of directors is making solid commercial fare expertly pitched at the us market .
the appeal of german directors in hollywood is n't any unique artistic agenda , says andrea dittgen from the association of german film critics .
it 's purely practical .
" they 're hired because they 're cheaper than their american peers , " she said .
crucially , this latest generation - with the exception of hirschbiegel - is also very young , and can still be " steered . "
" they 're willing to work for less , because hollywood is where they want to be .
and these directors are very open-minded about giving the studios what they want , " she said .
hollywood getting its money 's worth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " premonition " is a classic psycho-thriller " premonition , " a supernatural thriller made by mennan yapo for sony , is a case in point .
the turkish-german director was snapped up by the entertainment capital on the strength of just one feature-length movie in germany , which was released in the us as " soundless . "
hollywood knew what it was doing .
garnering sandra bullock the highest-grossing opening weekend of her career , " premonition " ticks all the right hollywood boxes .
" when the studios hire germans they know they 're going to get more out of the budget , " said yapo .
" they 're punctual and they 're basically good workers who are very well trained . "
" german directors come highly skilled , " said german producer and visual effects supervisor volker engel , who won an oscar in 1997 for his work on " independence day . "
the movie , which still ranks among the top 10 all-time box-office smashes , was one of the first to prove that german directors - in this case , roland emmerich - were adept at delivering classic american blockbusters with maximum efficiency .
" they 're used to shooting fast , because german films are done with smaller budgets and have less shooting days than us productions , " he adds .
but mennan yapo feels a bit of european flair should n't be underestimated .
" hollywood also knows it 's going to get some edge from german directors , " he says .
" it 's basically an industry , and it 's aware that now and then , it needs fresh blood .
a couple of years ago the mexicans came along and brought in some new flavor .
now it 's the germans ' turn .
especially when they 're doing genre films , they deliver a different point of view on americana . "
taking the rough with the smooth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : emmerich can make disaster movies with the best of them even so , old-school " auteur " filmmakers are less likely to find themselves clasped to the tinseltown bosom .
like yapo , volker engel is aware that hollywood is always on the lookout for the new " it " people , but that an invitation to the party does come with strings attached .
" it can be difficult for a german director to do his first project here , because on the one hand they make you feel like the ' king ' , but on the other hand you 're spending their money .
so they will say : " hey , ' king , ' you can do whatever you want , but only as long as we 're happy with it . "
but this is n't necessarily a problem for german directors , who have a natural affinity for us-style movie-making .
" germany is very america-friendly , " said film critic andrea dittgen .
" most young directors grew up with us movies and they 're heavily influenced by them . "
germany 's part in the history of cinema in fact , the affinity is mutual .

but does the westwards exodus of film professionals mean the home-grown industry loses out ? hitting german cinema screens in october are " premonition " by mennan yapo , " trade " by marco kreuzpaintner and oliver hirschbiegel ’ s " the invasion , " a remake of the 1955 classic " the body snatchers , " starring nicole kidman .
us-backed projects by christian alvart , sandra nettelbeck , florian baxmeyer and joseph rusnak are still in the pipeline - and the list goes on .
still basking in the afterglow of florian von donnersmarck 's " the lives of others " oscar triumph in february , germany could n't be prouder of its young directors suddenly swarming the dream factory .
young , gifted and cheap they certainly look like they 've started running with the big guys .
but they 're succeeding by going native and mainstream - what they 're not doing is adding any quintessentially german artistic vision to the hollywood mix .
instead , they 've learnt how to beat the americans at their own game .
taking their cues from germany 's only long-standing hollywood heavyweights , roland emmerich and wolfgang petersen , the new crop of directors is making solid commercial fare expertly pitched at the us market .
the appeal of german directors in hollywood is n't any unique artistic agenda , says andrea dittgen from the association of german film critics .
it 's purely practical .
" they 're hired because they 're cheaper than their american peers , " she said .
crucially , this latest generation - with the exception of hirschbiegel - is also very young , and can still be " steered . "
" they 're willing to work for less , because hollywood is where they want to be .
and these directors are very open-minded about giving the studios what they want , " she said .
hollywood getting its money 's worth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " premonition " is a classic psycho-thriller " premonition , " a supernatural thriller made by mennan yapo for sony , is a case in point .
the turkish-german director was snapped up by the entertainment capital on the strength of just one feature-length movie in germany , which was released in the us as " soundless . "
hollywood knew what it was doing .
garnering sandra bullock the highest-grossing opening weekend of her career , " premonition " ticks all the right hollywood boxes .
" when the studios hire germans they know they 're going to get more out of the budget , " said yapo .
" they 're punctual and they 're basically good workers who are very well trained . "
" german directors come highly skilled , " said german producer and visual effects supervisor volker engel , who won an oscar in 1997 for his work on " independence day . "
the movie , which still ranks among the top 10 all-time box-office smashes , was one of the first to prove that german directors - in this case , roland emmerich - were adept at delivering classic american blockbusters with maximum efficiency .
" they 're used to shooting fast , because german films are done with smaller budgets and have less shooting days than us productions , " he adds .
but mennan yapo feels a bit of european flair should n't be underestimated .
" hollywood also knows it 's going to get some edge from german directors , " he says .
" it 's basically an industry , and it 's aware that now and then , it needs fresh blood .
a couple of years ago the mexicans came along and brought in some new flavor .
now it 's the germans ' turn .
especially when they 're doing genre films , they deliver a different point of view on americana . "
taking the rough with the smooth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : emmerich can make disaster movies with the best of them even so , old-school " auteur " filmmakers are less likely to find themselves clasped to the tinseltown bosom .
like yapo , volker engel is aware that hollywood is always on the lookout for the new " it " people , but that an invitation to the party does come with strings attached .
" it can be difficult for a german director to do his first project here , because on the one hand they make you feel like the ' king ' , but on the other hand you 're spending their money .
so they will say : " hey , ' king , ' you can do whatever you want , but only as long as we 're happy with it . "
but this is n't necessarily a problem for german directors , who have a natural affinity for us-style movie-making .
" germany is very america-friendly , " said film critic andrea dittgen .
" most young directors grew up with us movies and they 're heavily influenced by them . "
germany 's part in the history of cinema in fact , the affinity is mutual .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 15.10.2007 polish leader confident of eu treaty success großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president lech kaczynski , right , has become more positive about the eu treaty eu leaders hope to sign off on the eu treaty , the compromise text that replaces the bloc 's failed constitution , in lisbon this week .
poland , despite its opposition to many aspects of the treaty , is confident of success . eu leaders are meeting on monday , oct .
15 , in luxembourg hoping that polish calls for last-minute changes to the bloc 's reform treaty will not prove fatal .
they 're also crossing their fingers that poland 's stated optimism about the treaty 's chances is on the mark .
the eu 's future treaty received an optimistic boost last week when polish president lech kaczynski , leader of a country with many reservations about the text , said that there was a " 95-98 percent " chance of an agreement on the treaty at the forthcoming lisbon summit being held on oct .
18-19 .
kaczynski told reporters that " all we had considered as the problems of the treaty belong more to the past than the present . "
" i am convinced that we will be able to come to an agreement , " he added polish reservations date back to june the progress of the treaty has been hindered since it was first hammered into shape at a european union summit in brussels in june during germany 's presidency of the 27-country bloc .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's job in june was made difficult by kaczynski poland 's strong opposition to the system under which voting rights are distributed throughout the eu according to the treaty led to marathon negotiations overseen by german chancellor angela merkel .
the poles succeeded in delaying the introduction of the double majority voting system - which warsaw opposes for fear it will give big countries too much decision-making power - until 2014 , after which it would be phased in over three years .
fundamental rights charter also a problem kaczynski acknowledged that poland had reservations about voting rights and a charter of fundamental rights but said that these objections could be dealt with in " a separate declaration . "
but he maintained that poland would oppose the current plan for a european charter of fundamental rights , saying " poland 's point of view culturally is different from the majority of other european countries . "
he said the overwhelmingly roman catholic nation could not " for example accept marriages of people of the same sex . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland hopes france can help cure its eu headaches kaczynski added that warsaw 's demand for a permanent post at the european court also remained " a considerable problem " but underlined that this could be " resolved " with the help of other countries , notably france .
despite his confidence over an agreement in lisbon this week , kaczynski hinted that legislative elections in his country , due to take place two days after the eu summit , would not make his task in negotiating on an eu level any easier .
" it would have been better if the summit took place after the elections , " he said .
poland called new legislative elections for oct .
21 after the collapse of prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski 's fractious coalition with a far-right party and a rural populist movement .
eu hopeful bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what started in berlin is hoped to be completed in lisbon portugal , the current holder of the six-month eu rotating presidency , is confident the final version of the treaty will be approved at the summit in lisbon before being ratified in all member states in 2008 and coming into force on jan .
1 , 2009 .
eu leaders want the treaty to come into force by the jan .
1 deadline so that public confidence in the european project is not undermined during elections to the european parliament that year .
the new treaty , the compromise text which replaces the much-maligned and doomed eu constitution , is seen as vital to streamlining the workings of a union which has expanded from 15 to 27 member states since 2004 . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" since iran did n't accept - even though we made constructive offers - and since it still does n't fulfill the demands of the international community , we had to choose the path of sanctions in the un security council , " the chancellor said , adding that china and russia supported the sanctions " we can not close our eyes to the dangers , " she said .
" i strongly support finding a diplomatic solution , but we also need to be ready to impose further sanctions if iran does not budge .
it threatens israel 's security , which is non-negotiable for me as german chancellor .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de from the fringe -pipe- 15.10.2007 bus driver sacked after toilet paper " theft " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : big brother is watching - even when you go to the toilet the health and safety of both the driver of a bus and the passengers must be the priority of all transport companies .
however , one firm may have put both at risk in an unprecedented crackdown of diarrhea sufferers . germany continues to debate whether increased numbers of security cameras will help reduce the risk of terror attacks .
the german interior ministry is particularly keen on rolling out more surveillance systems and while there is a certain amount of concern among civil liberty groups and a percentage of the population , many germans equate more security with more protection and seem to have few problems with the idea .
one section of the population who may start to have a problem with more cctv is the nation 's bus drivers .
while a strategically placed camera may be used to identify a person of specific threat from ending hundreds of people 's lives , a single device can also be used to ruin just one person 's life and put his career on the skids .
stomach cramps lead to employment pain this is exactly what happened to german bus driver jochen lorenz .
the 58-year-old driver from the central town of ilmenau - with no known affiliations with any terrorist group - was sacked after being spotted taking a roll of toilet paper from the bus depot lavatory .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some thought the security measures went too far lorenz had arrived at work for his shift at 5:30 a.m. , feeling a little under the weather with stomach cramps .
he made an emergency visit to the loo shortly before taking his seat at the helm of his bus and , fearing he may be caught short on the route , took a roll from the cubicle just in case .
" i was feeling ill when i arrived at the bus depot .
stomach problems , " lorenz told the bild zeitung newspaper .
" so i went to the lavatory .
things did n't get better so i took a roll of toilet paper and put it in the bus .
i wanted to have some during the drive in case of an emergency . "
bus driver unaware of strict paper controls the eye-in-the-sky , however , did not look favorably on this .
the surveillance cameras had been installed by the powers that be to monitor strict control of toilet paper usage , among other things .
this fact , unbeknownst to lorenz at the time , was made glaringly and painfully obvious when he received his marching orders .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans showed their solidarity for the sacked driver the letter of dismissal stated that the quantity of toilet paper was strictly monitored and that a fresh roll of paper had disappeared .
“ after the surveillance data was analyzed , it was found that you , herr lorenz , were the only user to use the facilities , at 05:49 hours , " the letter from the bus company said .
lorenz protested against the sacking and told his boss that the roll was still in the bus , but to no avail .
so lorenz took the company to court and managed to secure a pay-off settlement totaling € 7,500 -lrb- $ 10,625 -rrb- . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

15 , although merkel warned of further sanctions . the russian leader , who leaves office in the spring after completing two terms , drew a parallel between iran 's contentious uranium enrichment program and north korea 's nuclear weapons program . " remember , only recently we just as emotionally discussed the north korean nuclear program , and now we are seeing positive moves on the korean peninsula , " putin said , adding that patience and continued negotiations would be keys to a breakthrough with tehran .
" we can and must be patient and look for a way out .
can we do it without having a dialogue with the iranian leadership and people ?
i think that 's impossible . "
merkel warned that if tehran did not comply with demands for transparency on its nuclear program " a new round of sanctions must be initiated . "
the chancellor nevertheless made clear germany , like russia , was banking on a negotiated end to the impasse .
bilateral relations , trade good bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin took questions on his and russia 's political future on the topic of bilateral relations , both leaders said cooperation in internal and external security was good .
they noted rapidly growing trade , which rose 38 percent last year to a total of 53 billion euros -lrb- $ 75 billion -rrb- .
russia provides around a third of germany 's crude oil and gas needs and the trade balance is in its favor by close to 6 billion euros .
putin said the two economies complemented each other , with russia providing reliable energy resources and opportunities for german business in technology and construction .
merkel also announced that the two countries hoped to build the nord stream trans-baltic gas pipeline and were keen to allay the concerns of transit states over the project . nord stream goes ahead , assures merkel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nord stream pipeline will be completed on time , the leaders said " where there are problems implementing it economically , we can help - if political talks help , " the project is politically desired .
" if investment conditions need clearing up , that must ensue at a company level . "
the pipeline - a project run by a consortium consisting of russia 's gas export monopoly gazprom and germany 's basf and e.on - will run from russia to germany under the baltic sea .
some countries through which the pipeline will run have raised concerns about the environmental safety aspects .
" we see no need to act at the moment , so i can only say that in my view the project will go ahead , " merkel said .
" as far as germany is concerned , we want to see this project completed and economically implemented , " she added .
russians willing to meet transit states in debate russian energy minister viktor khristenko told reporters at a separate meeting that berlin and moscow would continue to hold discussions with the transit states . " the project is going according to plan , but there is a situation where questions about the route need to be discussed with baltic sea littoral states , " he said .
" we are in a position to ensure a high level of environmental security on the route of this pipeline . "

" of course i 'm going to iran , " he said in response to a question .
putin also fielded awkward questions about the ongoing probe into the murder a year ago of journalist anna politkovskaya .
the president said investigations were entering the final stage and the outstanding issue was to find who was behind the killing .
asked about his political future , putin pledged that the russian constitution , which allows only two consecutive presidential terms , would be implemented in letter and spirit , but this did not mean that he could not continue to be politically active .

they noted rapidly growing trade , which rose 38 percent last year to a total of 53 billion euros -lrb- $ 75 billion -rrb- .
russia provides around a third of germany 's crude oil and gas needs and the trade balance is in its favor by close to 6 billion euros .
putin said the two economies complemented each other , with russia providing reliable energy resources and opportunities for german business in technology and construction .
merkel also announced that the two countries hoped to build the nord stream trans-baltic gas pipeline and were keen to allay the concerns of transit states over the project . nord stream goes ahead , assures merkel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nord stream pipeline will be completed on time , the leaders said " where there are problems implementing it economically , we can help - if political talks help , " the project is politically desired .
" if investment conditions need clearing up , that must ensue at a company level . "
the pipeline - a project run by a consortium consisting of russia 's gas export monopoly gazprom and germany 's basf and e.on - will run from russia to germany under the baltic sea .
some countries through which the pipeline will run have raised concerns about the environmental safety aspects .
" we see no need to act at the moment , so i can only say that in my view the project will go ahead , " merkel said .
" as far as germany is concerned , we want to see this project completed and economically implemented , " she added .
russians willing to meet transit states in debate russian energy minister viktor khristenko told reporters at a separate meeting that berlin and moscow would continue to hold discussions with the transit states . " the project is going according to plan , but there is a situation where questions about the route need to be discussed with baltic sea littoral states , " he said .
" we are in a position to ensure a high level of environmental security on the route of this pipeline . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters demanded answers in the case of murdered russian journalist politkovskaya putin took the opportunity of his visit to germany to reiterate his plan to visit iran after it an alleged assassination plot had been uncovered .
" of course i 'm going to iran , " he said in response to a question .
putin also fielded awkward questions about the ongoing probe into the murder a year ago of journalist anna politkovskaya .
the president said investigations were entering the final stage and the outstanding issue was to find who was behind the killing .
asked about his political future , putin pledged that the russian constitution , which allows only two consecutive presidential terms , would be implemented in letter and spirit , but this did not mean that he could not continue to be politically active .

poland , despite its opposition to many aspects of the treaty , is confident of success . eu leaders are meeting on monday , oct .
15 , in luxembourg hoping that polish calls for last-minute changes to the bloc 's reform treaty will not prove fatal .
they 're also crossing their fingers that poland 's stated optimism about the treaty 's chances is on the mark .
the eu 's future treaty received an optimistic boost last week when polish president lech kaczynski , leader of a country with many reservations about the text , said that there was a " 95-98 percent " chance of an agreement on the treaty at the forthcoming lisbon summit being held on oct .
18-19 .
kaczynski told reporters that " all we had considered as the problems of the treaty belong more to the past than the present . "
" i am convinced that we will be able to come to an agreement , " he added polish reservations date back to june the progress of the treaty has been hindered since it was first hammered into shape at a european union summit in brussels in june during germany 's presidency of the 27-country bloc .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's job in june was made difficult by kaczynski poland 's strong opposition to the system under which voting rights are distributed throughout the eu according to the treaty led to marathon negotiations overseen by german chancellor angela merkel .
the poles succeeded in delaying the introduction of the double majority voting system - which warsaw opposes for fear it will give big countries too much decision-making power - until 2014 , after which it would be phased in over three years .
fundamental rights charter also a problem kaczynski acknowledged that poland had reservations about voting rights and a charter of fundamental rights but said that these objections could be dealt with in " a separate declaration . "
but he maintained that poland would oppose the current plan for a european charter of fundamental rights , saying " poland 's point of view culturally is different from the majority of other european countries . "
he said the overwhelmingly roman catholic nation could not " for example accept marriages of people of the same sex . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland hopes france can help cure its eu headaches kaczynski added that warsaw 's demand for a permanent post at the european court also remained " a considerable problem " but underlined that this could be " resolved " with the help of other countries , notably france .
despite his confidence over an agreement in lisbon this week , kaczynski hinted that legislative elections in his country , due to take place two days after the eu summit , would not make his task in negotiating on an eu level any easier .
" it would have been better if the summit took place after the elections , " he said .
poland called new legislative elections for oct .
21 after the collapse of prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski 's fractious coalition with a far-right party and a rural populist movement .
eu hopeful bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what started in berlin is hoped to be completed in lisbon portugal , the current holder of the six-month eu rotating presidency , is confident the final version of the treaty will be approved at the summit in lisbon before being ratified in all member states in 2008 and coming into force on jan .

poland , despite its opposition to many aspects of the treaty , is confident of success . eu leaders are meeting on monday , oct .
15 , in luxembourg hoping that polish calls for last-minute changes to the bloc 's reform treaty will not prove fatal .
they 're also crossing their fingers that poland 's stated optimism about the treaty 's chances is on the mark .
the eu 's future treaty received an optimistic boost last week when polish president lech kaczynski , leader of a country with many reservations about the text , said that there was a " 95-98 percent " chance of an agreement on the treaty at the forthcoming lisbon summit being held on oct .
18-19 .
kaczynski told reporters that " all we had considered as the problems of the treaty belong more to the past than the present . "
" i am convinced that we will be able to come to an agreement , " he added polish reservations date back to june the progress of the treaty has been hindered since it was first hammered into shape at a european union summit in brussels in june during germany 's presidency of the 27-country bloc .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's job in june was made difficult by kaczynski poland 's strong opposition to the system under which voting rights are distributed throughout the eu according to the treaty led to marathon negotiations overseen by german chancellor angela merkel .
the poles succeeded in delaying the introduction of the double majority voting system - which warsaw opposes for fear it will give big countries too much decision-making power - until 2014 , after which it would be phased in over three years .
fundamental rights charter also a problem kaczynski acknowledged that poland had reservations about voting rights and a charter of fundamental rights but said that these objections could be dealt with in " a separate declaration . "
but he maintained that poland would oppose the current plan for a european charter of fundamental rights , saying " poland 's point of view culturally is different from the majority of other european countries . "
he said the overwhelmingly roman catholic nation could not " for example accept marriages of people of the same sex . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland hopes france can help cure its eu headaches kaczynski added that warsaw 's demand for a permanent post at the european court also remained " a considerable problem " but underlined that this could be " resolved " with the help of other countries , notably france .
despite his confidence over an agreement in lisbon this week , kaczynski hinted that legislative elections in his country , due to take place two days after the eu summit , would not make his task in negotiating on an eu level any easier .
" it would have been better if the summit took place after the elections , " he said .
poland called new legislative elections for oct .

the bloc also agreed to send an eu security force to chad . after a meeting of the eu 's foreign ministers on monday , oct .
15 , a decision was made to broaden existing sanctions that include visa bans and asset freezes on myanmar 's military and government officials as well as their relatives , and new steps targeting the country 's key timber , metals and gemstone sectors .
" the eu deems it necessary to increase direct pressure on the regime , " the ministers said in a statement issued after talks in luxembourg .
" it will therefore adopt a package of measures that do not harm the general population but that target those responsible for the violent crackdown and the overall political stalemate in the country . "
eu sanctions on hold while mission planned bildunterschrift : tougher eu sanctions are a negotiation stick for the un envoy french foreign minister bernard kouchner told reporters the sanctions would not be immediately implemented .
kouchner added that the eu was also considering sending a mission to myanmar , formerly named burma , to hold talks with the military rulers on reconciliation with the country 's domestic political opponents .
eu external relations commission benita ferrero-walder said she backed a delay in the imposition of the additional sanctions to support the mission of un envoy to myanmar ibrahim gambarai .
" he is the only one who has a chance for leverage at the moment , " she said .
" i think he should have sticks and carrots in order to be able to work . "
she said the eu wanted to see the release of political prisoners and the start of a process of dialogue with opponents .
the foreign ministers also gave their final approval during the meeting to deploy a 3,000-strong eu peacekeeping force to help refugees and the displaced along darfur 's borders with chad and the central african republic .
mostly french peacekeeping force set for chad kouchner said that the eu force - around half of which would be made up of french troops - would be involved in improving security and making it easier for aid groups to do their work in the camps that border sudan 's darfur region .
" it is a reconstruction mission , a development mission and a humanitarian one , " the french foreign minister said .
he added that security needed to be assured for the refugees but the mission would not include action to secure the border areas .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the conflicts in the region have led to a refugee crisis united nations estimates show that almost 3 million people have been uprooted by conflicts in the region , including the fighting in darfur and unrelated rebellions in chad and the central african republic .
some 2.25 million former darfur residents are currently displaced within their own country .
the eu foreign ministers also appealed to northern and southern sudanese political factions to stick to a 2005 peace pact , fearing that a collapse of the delicate treaty in that unrelated sudanese conflict could lead to new civil war complicating international efforts to end the darfur crisis . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

15 , although merkel warned of further sanctions . the russian leader , who leaves office in the spring after completing two terms , drew a parallel between iran 's contentious uranium enrichment program and north korea 's nuclear weapons program . " remember , only recently we just as emotionally discussed the north korean nuclear program , and now we are seeing positive moves on the korean peninsula , " putin said , adding that patience and continued negotiations would be keys to a breakthrough with tehran .
" we can and must be patient and look for a way out .
can we do it without having a dialogue with the iranian leadership and people ?
i think that 's impossible . "
merkel warned that if tehran did not comply with demands for transparency on its nuclear program " a new round of sanctions must be initiated . "
the chancellor nevertheless made clear germany , like russia , was banking on a negotiated end to the impasse .
bilateral relations , trade good bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin took questions on his and russia 's political future on the topic of bilateral relations , both leaders said cooperation in internal and external security was good .
they noted rapidly growing trade , which rose 38 percent last year to a total of 53 billion euros -lrb- $ 75 billion -rrb- .
russia provides around a third of germany 's crude oil and gas needs and the trade balance is in its favor by close to 6 billion euros .
putin said the two economies complemented each other , with russia providing reliable energy resources and opportunities for german business in technology and construction .
merkel also announced that the two countries hoped to build the nord stream trans-baltic gas pipeline and were keen to allay the concerns of transit states over the project . nord stream goes ahead , assures merkel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nord stream pipeline will be completed on time , the leaders said " where there are problems implementing it economically , we can help - if political talks help , " the project is politically desired .
" if investment conditions need clearing up , that must ensue at a company level . "
the pipeline - a project run by a consortium consisting of russia 's gas export monopoly gazprom and germany 's basf and e.on - will run from russia to germany under the baltic sea .
some countries through which the pipeline will run have raised concerns about the environmental safety aspects .
" we see no need to act at the moment , so i can only say that in my view the project will go ahead , " merkel said .
" as far as germany is concerned , we want to see this project completed and economically implemented , " she added .
russians willing to meet transit states in debate russian energy minister viktor khristenko told reporters at a separate meeting that berlin and moscow would continue to hold discussions with the transit states . " the project is going according to plan , but there is a situation where questions about the route need to be discussed with baltic sea littoral states , " he said .
" we are in a position to ensure a high level of environmental security on the route of this pipeline . "

" of course i 'm going to iran , " he said in response to a question .
putin also fielded awkward questions about the ongoing probe into the murder a year ago of journalist anna politkovskaya .
the president said investigations were entering the final stage and the outstanding issue was to find who was behind the killing .
asked about his political future , putin pledged that the russian constitution , which allows only two consecutive presidential terms , would be implemented in letter and spirit , but this did not mean that he could not continue to be politically active .

putin said the two economies complemented each other , with russia providing reliable energy resources and opportunities for german business in technology and construction .
merkel also announced that the two countries hoped to build the nord stream trans-baltic gas pipeline and were keen to allay the concerns of transit states over the project . nord stream goes ahead , assures merkel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nord stream pipeline will be completed on time , the leaders said " where there are problems implementing it economically , we can help - if political talks help , " the project is politically desired .
" if investment conditions need clearing up , that must ensue at a company level . "
the pipeline - a project run by a consortium consisting of russia 's gas export monopoly gazprom and germany 's basf and e.on - will run from russia to germany under the baltic sea .
some countries through which the pipeline will run have raised concerns about the environmental safety aspects .
" we see no need to act at the moment , so i can only say that in my view the project will go ahead , " merkel said .
" as far as germany is concerned , we want to see this project completed and economically implemented , " she added .
russians willing to meet transit states in debate russian energy minister viktor khristenko told reporters at a separate meeting that berlin and moscow would continue to hold discussions with the transit states . " the project is going according to plan , but there is a situation where questions about the route need to be discussed with baltic sea littoral states , " he said .
" we are in a position to ensure a high level of environmental security on the route of this pipeline . "

" of course i 'm going to iran , " he said in response to a question .
putin also fielded awkward questions about the ongoing probe into the murder a year ago of journalist anna politkovskaya .
the president said investigations were entering the final stage and the outstanding issue was to find who was behind the killing .
asked about his political future , putin pledged that the russian constitution , which allows only two consecutive presidential terms , would be implemented in letter and spirit , but this did not mean that he could not continue to be politically active .
putin 's recent suggestion that he could become prime minister , has raised concerns that he could be seeking to undermine russia 's democratic institutions . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

one section of the population who may start to have a problem with more cctv is the nation 's bus drivers .

stomach cramps lead to employment pain this is exactly what happened to german bus driver jochen lorenz .
the 58-year-old driver from the central town of ilmenau - with no known affiliations with any terrorist group - was sacked after being spotted taking a roll of toilet paper from the bus depot lavatory .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some thought the security measures went too far lorenz had arrived at work for his shift at 5:30 a.m. , feeling a little under the weather with stomach cramps .
he made an emergency visit to the loo shortly before taking his seat at the helm of his bus and , fearing he may be caught short on the route , took a roll from the cubicle just in case .
" i was feeling ill when i arrived at the bus depot .
stomach problems , " lorenz told the bild zeitung newspaper .
" so i went to the lavatory .
things did n't get better so i took a roll of toilet paper and put it in the bus .
i wanted to have some during the drive in case of an emergency . "
bus driver unaware of strict paper controls the eye-in-the-sky , however , did not look favorably on this .
the surveillance cameras had been installed by the powers that be to monitor strict control of toilet paper usage , among other things .
this fact , unbeknownst to lorenz at the time , was made glaringly and painfully obvious when he received his marching orders .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans showed their solidarity for the sacked driver the letter of dismissal stated that the quantity of toilet paper was strictly monitored and that a fresh roll of paper had disappeared .

lorenz protested against the sacking and told his boss that the roll was still in the bus , but to no avail .

" together with our partners france , england , america , russia and china , we 've searched for ways again and again to bring iran back to the negotiating table , " merkel told the web site of german daily die welt in response to a question on whether germany had become too dependent on us foreign policy .
" since iran did n't accept - even though we made constructive offers - and since it still does n't fulfill the demands of the international community , we had to choose the path of sanctions in the un security council , " the chancellor said , adding that china and russia supported the sanctions " we can not close our eyes to the dangers , " she said .
" i strongly support finding a diplomatic solution , but we also need to be ready to impose further sanctions if iran does not budge .
it threatens israel 's security , which is non-negotiable for me as german chancellor .
it threatens the region , europe , and the world .
we have to prevent that . "

stomach cramps lead to employment pain this is exactly what happened to german bus driver jochen lorenz .

he made an emergency visit to the loo shortly before taking his seat at the helm of his bus and , fearing he may be caught short on the route , took a roll from the cubicle just in case .
" i was feeling ill when i arrived at the bus depot .

" so i went to the lavatory .
things did n't get better so i took a roll of toilet paper and put it in the bus .
i wanted to have some during the drive in case of an emergency . "
bus driver unaware of strict paper controls the eye-in-the-sky , however , did not look favorably on this .
the surveillance cameras had been installed by the powers that be to monitor strict control of toilet paper usage , among other things .
this fact , unbeknownst to lorenz at the time , was made glaringly and painfully obvious when he received his marching orders .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans showed their solidarity for the sacked driver the letter of dismissal stated that the quantity of toilet paper was strictly monitored and that a fresh roll of paper had disappeared .
“ after the surveillance data was analyzed , it was found that you , herr lorenz , were the only user to use the facilities , at 05:49 hours , " the letter from the bus company said .
lorenz protested against the sacking and told his boss that the roll was still in the bus , but to no avail .

the bloc also agreed to send an eu security force to chad . after a meeting of the eu 's foreign ministers on monday , oct .
15 , a decision was made to broaden existing sanctions that include visa bans and asset freezes on myanmar 's military and government officials as well as their relatives , and new steps targeting the country 's key timber , metals and gemstone sectors .
" the eu deems it necessary to increase direct pressure on the regime , " the ministers said in a statement issued after talks in luxembourg .
" it will therefore adopt a package of measures that do not harm the general population but that target those responsible for the violent crackdown and the overall political stalemate in the country . "
eu sanctions on hold while mission planned bildunterschrift : tougher eu sanctions are a negotiation stick for the un envoy french foreign minister bernard kouchner told reporters the sanctions would not be immediately implemented .
kouchner added that the eu was also considering sending a mission to myanmar , formerly named burma , to hold talks with the military rulers on reconciliation with the country 's domestic political opponents .
eu external relations commission benita ferrero-walder said she backed a delay in the imposition of the additional sanctions to support the mission of un envoy to myanmar ibrahim gambarai .
" he is the only one who has a chance for leverage at the moment , " she said .
" i think he should have sticks and carrots in order to be able to work . "
she said the eu wanted to see the release of political prisoners and the start of a process of dialogue with opponents .
the foreign ministers also gave their final approval during the meeting to deploy a 3,000-strong eu peacekeeping force to help refugees and the displaced along darfur 's borders with chad and the central african republic .
mostly french peacekeeping force set for chad kouchner said that the eu force - around half of which would be made up of french troops - would be involved in improving security and making it easier for aid groups to do their work in the camps that border sudan 's darfur region .
" it is a reconstruction mission , a development mission and a humanitarian one , " the french foreign minister said .
he added that security needed to be assured for the refugees but the mission would not include action to secure the border areas .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the conflicts in the region have led to a refugee crisis united nations estimates show that almost 3 million people have been uprooted by conflicts in the region , including the fighting in darfur and unrelated rebellions in chad and the central african republic .
some 2.25 million former darfur residents are currently displaced within their own country .
the eu foreign ministers also appealed to northern and southern sudanese political factions to stick to a 2005 peace pact , fearing that a collapse of the delicate treaty in that unrelated sudanese conflict could lead to new civil war complicating international efforts to end the darfur crisis . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

15 , although merkel warned of further sanctions . the russian leader , who leaves office in the spring after completing two terms , drew a parallel between iran 's contentious uranium enrichment program and north korea 's nuclear weapons program . " remember , only recently we just as emotionally discussed the north korean nuclear program , and now we are seeing positive moves on the korean peninsula , " putin said , adding that patience and continued negotiations would be keys to a breakthrough with tehran .
" we can and must be patient and look for a way out .
can we do it without having a dialogue with the iranian leadership and people ?
i think that 's impossible . "
merkel warned that if tehran did not comply with demands for transparency on its nuclear program " a new round of sanctions must be initiated . "
the chancellor nevertheless made clear germany , like russia , was banking on a negotiated end to the impasse .
bilateral relations , trade good bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin took questions on his and russia 's political future on the topic of bilateral relations , both leaders said cooperation in internal and external security was good .
they noted rapidly growing trade , which rose 38 percent last year to a total of 53 billion euros -lrb- $ 75 billion -rrb- .
russia provides around a third of germany 's crude oil and gas needs and the trade balance is in its favor by close to 6 billion euros .
putin said the two economies complemented each other , with russia providing reliable energy resources and opportunities for german business in technology and construction .
merkel also announced that the two countries hoped to build the nord stream trans-baltic gas pipeline and were keen to allay the concerns of transit states over the project . nord stream goes ahead , assures merkel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nord stream pipeline will be completed on time , the leaders said " where there are problems implementing it economically , we can help - if political talks help , " the project is politically desired .
" if investment conditions need clearing up , that must ensue at a company level . "
the pipeline - a project run by a consortium consisting of russia 's gas export monopoly gazprom and germany 's basf and e.on - will run from russia to germany under the baltic sea .
some countries through which the pipeline will run have raised concerns about the environmental safety aspects .
" we see no need to act at the moment , so i can only say that in my view the project will go ahead , " merkel said .
" as far as germany is concerned , we want to see this project completed and economically implemented , " she added .
russians willing to meet transit states in debate russian energy minister viktor khristenko told reporters at a separate meeting that berlin and moscow would continue to hold discussions with the transit states . " the project is going according to plan , but there is a situation where questions about the route need to be discussed with baltic sea littoral states , " he said .
" we are in a position to ensure a high level of environmental security on the route of this pipeline . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters demanded answers in the case of murdered russian journalist politkovskaya putin took the opportunity of his visit to germany to reiterate his plan to visit iran after it an alleged assassination plot had been uncovered .
" of course i 'm going to iran , " he said in response to a question .
putin also fielded awkward questions about the ongoing probe into the murder a year ago of journalist anna politkovskaya .
the president said investigations were entering the final stage and the outstanding issue was to find who was behind the killing .
asked about his political future , putin pledged that the russian constitution , which allows only two consecutive presidential terms , would be implemented in letter and spirit , but this did not mean that he could not continue to be politically active .
putin 's recent suggestion that he could become prime minister , has raised concerns that he could be seeking to undermine russia 's democratic institutions . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

merkel warned that if tehran did not comply with demands for transparency on its nuclear program " a new round of sanctions must be initiated . "
the chancellor nevertheless made clear germany , like russia , was banking on a negotiated end to the impasse .
bilateral relations , trade good bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin took questions on his and russia 's political future on the topic of bilateral relations , both leaders said cooperation in internal and external security was good .
they noted rapidly growing trade , which rose 38 percent last year to a total of 53 billion euros -lrb- $ 75 billion -rrb- .
russia provides around a third of germany 's crude oil and gas needs and the trade balance is in its favor by close to 6 billion euros .
putin said the two economies complemented each other , with russia providing reliable energy resources and opportunities for german business in technology and construction .
merkel also announced that the two countries hoped to build the nord stream trans-baltic gas pipeline and were keen to allay the concerns of transit states over the project . nord stream goes ahead , assures merkel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nord stream pipeline will be completed on time , the leaders said " where there are problems implementing it economically , we can help - if political talks help , " the project is politically desired .
" if investment conditions need clearing up , that must ensue at a company level . "
the pipeline - a project run by a consortium consisting of russia 's gas export monopoly gazprom and germany 's basf and e.on - will run from russia to germany under the baltic sea .
some countries through which the pipeline will run have raised concerns about the environmental safety aspects .
" we see no need to act at the moment , so i can only say that in my view the project will go ahead , " merkel said .
" as far as germany is concerned , we want to see this project completed and economically implemented , " she added .
russians willing to meet transit states in debate russian energy minister viktor khristenko told reporters at a separate meeting that berlin and moscow would continue to hold discussions with the transit states . " the project is going according to plan , but there is a situation where questions about the route need to be discussed with baltic sea littoral states , " he said .
" we are in a position to ensure a high level of environmental security on the route of this pipeline . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters demanded answers in the case of murdered russian journalist politkovskaya putin took the opportunity of his visit to germany to reiterate his plan to visit iran after it an alleged assassination plot had been uncovered .
" of course i 'm going to iran , " he said in response to a question .
putin also fielded awkward questions about the ongoing probe into the murder a year ago of journalist anna politkovskaya .
the president said investigations were entering the final stage and the outstanding issue was to find who was behind the killing .
asked about his political future , putin pledged that the russian constitution , which allows only two consecutive presidential terms , would be implemented in letter and spirit , but this did not mean that he could not continue to be politically active .
putin 's recent suggestion that he could become prime minister , has raised concerns that he could be seeking to undermine russia 's democratic institutions . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

however , one firm may have put both at risk in an unprecedented crackdown of diarrhea sufferers . germany continues to debate whether increased numbers of security cameras will help reduce the risk of terror attacks .
the german interior ministry is particularly keen on rolling out more surveillance systems and while there is a certain amount of concern among civil liberty groups and a percentage of the population , many germans equate more security with more protection and seem to have few problems with the idea .
one section of the population who may start to have a problem with more cctv is the nation 's bus drivers .
while a strategically placed camera may be used to identify a person of specific threat from ending hundreds of people 's lives , a single device can also be used to ruin just one person 's life and put his career on the skids .
stomach cramps lead to employment pain this is exactly what happened to german bus driver jochen lorenz .
the 58-year-old driver from the central town of ilmenau - with no known affiliations with any terrorist group - was sacked after being spotted taking a roll of toilet paper from the bus depot lavatory .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some thought the security measures went too far lorenz had arrived at work for his shift at 5:30 a.m. , feeling a little under the weather with stomach cramps .
he made an emergency visit to the loo shortly before taking his seat at the helm of his bus and , fearing he may be caught short on the route , took a roll from the cubicle just in case .
" i was feeling ill when i arrived at the bus depot .
stomach problems , " lorenz told the bild zeitung newspaper .
" so i went to the lavatory .
things did n't get better so i took a roll of toilet paper and put it in the bus .
i wanted to have some during the drive in case of an emergency . "
bus driver unaware of strict paper controls the eye-in-the-sky , however , did not look favorably on this .
the surveillance cameras had been installed by the powers that be to monitor strict control of toilet paper usage , among other things .
this fact , unbeknownst to lorenz at the time , was made glaringly and painfully obvious when he received his marching orders .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans showed their solidarity for the sacked driver the letter of dismissal stated that the quantity of toilet paper was strictly monitored and that a fresh roll of paper had disappeared .
“ after the surveillance data was analyzed , it was found that you , herr lorenz , were the only user to use the facilities , at 05:49 hours , " the letter from the bus company said .
lorenz protested against the sacking and told his boss that the roll was still in the bus , but to no avail .
so lorenz took the company to court and managed to secure a pay-off settlement totaling € 7,500 -lrb- $ 10,625 -rrb- . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

15 , although merkel warned of further sanctions . the russian leader , who leaves office in the spring after completing two terms , drew a parallel between iran 's contentious uranium enrichment program and north korea 's nuclear weapons program . " remember , only recently we just as emotionally discussed the north korean nuclear program , and now we are seeing positive moves on the korean peninsula , " putin said , adding that patience and continued negotiations would be keys to a breakthrough with tehran .
" we can and must be patient and look for a way out .
can we do it without having a dialogue with the iranian leadership and people ?
i think that 's impossible . "
merkel warned that if tehran did not comply with demands for transparency on its nuclear program " a new round of sanctions must be initiated . "
the chancellor nevertheless made clear germany , like russia , was banking on a negotiated end to the impasse .
bilateral relations , trade good bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin took questions on his and russia 's political future on the topic of bilateral relations , both leaders said cooperation in internal and external security was good .
they noted rapidly growing trade , which rose 38 percent last year to a total of 53 billion euros -lrb- $ 75 billion -rrb- .
russia provides around a third of germany 's crude oil and gas needs and the trade balance is in its favor by close to 6 billion euros .
putin said the two economies complemented each other , with russia providing reliable energy resources and opportunities for german business in technology and construction .
merkel also announced that the two countries hoped to build the nord stream trans-baltic gas pipeline and were keen to allay the concerns of transit states over the project . nord stream goes ahead , assures merkel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nord stream pipeline will be completed on time , the leaders said " where there are problems implementing it economically , we can help - if political talks help , " the project is politically desired .
" if investment conditions need clearing up , that must ensue at a company level . "
the pipeline - a project run by a consortium consisting of russia 's gas export monopoly gazprom and germany 's basf and e.on - will run from russia to germany under the baltic sea .
some countries through which the pipeline will run have raised concerns about the environmental safety aspects .
" we see no need to act at the moment , so i can only say that in my view the project will go ahead , " merkel said .
" as far as germany is concerned , we want to see this project completed and economically implemented , " she added .
russians willing to meet transit states in debate russian energy minister viktor khristenko told reporters at a separate meeting that berlin and moscow would continue to hold discussions with the transit states . " the project is going according to plan , but there is a situation where questions about the route need to be discussed with baltic sea littoral states , " he said .
" we are in a position to ensure a high level of environmental security on the route of this pipeline . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters demanded answers in the case of murdered russian journalist politkovskaya putin took the opportunity of his visit to germany to reiterate his plan to visit iran after it an alleged assassination plot had been uncovered .
" of course i 'm going to iran , " he said in response to a question .
putin also fielded awkward questions about the ongoing probe into the murder a year ago of journalist anna politkovskaya .
the president said investigations were entering the final stage and the outstanding issue was to find who was behind the killing .
asked about his political future , putin pledged that the russian constitution , which allows only two consecutive presidential terms , would be implemented in letter and spirit , but this did not mean that he could not continue to be politically active .

" together with our partners france , england , america , russia and china , we 've searched for ways again and again to bring iran back to the negotiating table , " merkel told the web site of german daily die welt in response to a question on whether germany had become too dependent on us foreign policy .
" since iran did n't accept - even though we made constructive offers - and since it still does n't fulfill the demands of the international community , we had to choose the path of sanctions in the un security council , " the chancellor said , adding that china and russia supported the sanctions " we can not close our eyes to the dangers , " she said .
" i strongly support finding a diplomatic solution , but we also need to be ready to impose further sanctions if iran does not budge .

15 , germany 's chancellor said that the international community needs to be ready to impose further sanctions on tehran should leaders there refuse to cooperate in the nuclear row . speaking ahead of monday 's meeting with russian president vladimir putin in the central german town of wiesbaden , merkel said that the international community continued to worry about the iranian nuclear crisis as tehran had ignored binding resolutions by the un security council and demands of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- .
" together with our partners france , england , america , russia and china , we 've searched for ways again and again to bring iran back to the negotiating table , " merkel told the web site of german daily die welt in response to a question on whether germany had become too dependent on us foreign policy .
" since iran did n't accept - even though we made constructive offers - and since it still does n't fulfill the demands of the international community , we had to choose the path of sanctions in the un security council , " the chancellor said , adding that china and russia supported the sanctions " we can not close our eyes to the dangers , " she said .
" i strongly support finding a diplomatic solution , but we also need to be ready to impose further sanctions if iran does not budge .
it threatens israel 's security , which is non-negotiable for me as german chancellor .
it threatens the region , europe , and the world .
we have to prevent that . "
putin goes ahead with iran visit the topic was also expected to dominate merkel 's talks with putin on monday ahead of a joint attendance of an annual russian-german forum , the st. petersburg dialogue .

15 , although merkel warned of further sanctions . the russian leader , who leaves office in the spring after completing two terms , drew a parallel between iran 's contentious uranium enrichment program and north korea 's nuclear weapons program . " remember , only recently we just as emotionally discussed the north korean nuclear program , and now we are seeing positive moves on the korean peninsula , " putin said , adding that patience and continued negotiations would be keys to a breakthrough with tehran .
" we can and must be patient and look for a way out .
can we do it without having a dialogue with the iranian leadership and people ?
i think that 's impossible . "
merkel warned that if tehran did not comply with demands for transparency on its nuclear program " a new round of sanctions must be initiated . "
the chancellor nevertheless made clear germany , like russia , was banking on a negotiated end to the impasse .
bilateral relations , trade good bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin took questions on his and russia 's political future on the topic of bilateral relations , both leaders said cooperation in internal and external security was good .
they noted rapidly growing trade , which rose 38 percent last year to a total of 53 billion euros -lrb- $ 75 billion -rrb- .
russia provides around a third of germany 's crude oil and gas needs and the trade balance is in its favor by close to 6 billion euros .
putin said the two economies complemented each other , with russia providing reliable energy resources and opportunities for german business in technology and construction .
merkel also announced that the two countries hoped to build the nord stream trans-baltic gas pipeline and were keen to allay the concerns of transit states over the project . nord stream goes ahead , assures merkel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nord stream pipeline will be completed on time , the leaders said " where there are problems implementing it economically , we can help - if political talks help , " the project is politically desired .
" if investment conditions need clearing up , that must ensue at a company level . "
the pipeline - a project run by a consortium consisting of russia 's gas export monopoly gazprom and germany 's basf and e.on - will run from russia to germany under the baltic sea .
some countries through which the pipeline will run have raised concerns about the environmental safety aspects .
" we see no need to act at the moment , so i can only say that in my view the project will go ahead , " merkel said .
" as far as germany is concerned , we want to see this project completed and economically implemented , " she added .
russians willing to meet transit states in debate russian energy minister viktor khristenko told reporters at a separate meeting that berlin and moscow would continue to hold discussions with the transit states . " the project is going according to plan , but there is a situation where questions about the route need to be discussed with baltic sea littoral states , " he said .
" we are in a position to ensure a high level of environmental security on the route of this pipeline . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters demanded answers in the case of murdered russian journalist politkovskaya putin took the opportunity of his visit to germany to reiterate his plan to visit iran after it an alleged assassination plot had been uncovered .
" of course i 'm going to iran , " he said in response to a question .
putin also fielded awkward questions about the ongoing probe into the murder a year ago of journalist anna politkovskaya .
the president said investigations were entering the final stage and the outstanding issue was to find who was behind the killing .
asked about his political future , putin pledged that the russian constitution , which allows only two consecutive presidential terms , would be implemented in letter and spirit , but this did not mean that he could not continue to be politically active .
putin 's recent suggestion that he could become prime minister , has raised concerns that he could be seeking to undermine russia 's democratic institutions . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but does the westwards exodus of film professionals mean the home-grown industry loses out ? hitting german cinema screens in october are " premonition " by mennan yapo , " trade " by marco kreuzpaintner and oliver hirschbiegel ’ s " the invasion , " a remake of the 1955 classic " the body snatchers , " starring nicole kidman .
us-backed projects by christian alvart , sandra nettelbeck , florian baxmeyer and joseph rusnak are still in the pipeline - and the list goes on .
still basking in the afterglow of florian von donnersmarck 's " the lives of others " oscar triumph in february , germany could n't be prouder of its young directors suddenly swarming the dream factory .
young , gifted and cheap they certainly look like they 've started running with the big guys .
but they 're succeeding by going native and mainstream - what they 're not doing is adding any quintessentially german artistic vision to the hollywood mix .
instead , they 've learnt how to beat the americans at their own game .
taking their cues from germany 's only long-standing hollywood heavyweights , roland emmerich and wolfgang petersen , the new crop of directors is making solid commercial fare expertly pitched at the us market .
the appeal of german directors in hollywood is n't any unique artistic agenda , says andrea dittgen from the association of german film critics .
it 's purely practical .
" they 're hired because they 're cheaper than their american peers , " she said .
crucially , this latest generation - with the exception of hirschbiegel - is also very young , and can still be " steered . "
" they 're willing to work for less , because hollywood is where they want to be .
and these directors are very open-minded about giving the studios what they want , " she said .
hollywood getting its money 's worth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " premonition " is a classic psycho-thriller " premonition , " a supernatural thriller made by mennan yapo for sony , is a case in point .
the turkish-german director was snapped up by the entertainment capital on the strength of just one feature-length movie in germany , which was released in the us as " soundless . "
hollywood knew what it was doing .
garnering sandra bullock the highest-grossing opening weekend of her career , " premonition " ticks all the right hollywood boxes .
" when the studios hire germans they know they 're going to get more out of the budget , " said yapo .
" they 're punctual and they 're basically good workers who are very well trained . "
" german directors come highly skilled , " said german producer and visual effects supervisor volker engel , who won an oscar in 1997 for his work on " independence day . "
the movie , which still ranks among the top 10 all-time box-office smashes , was one of the first to prove that german directors - in this case , roland emmerich - were adept at delivering classic american blockbusters with maximum efficiency .
" they 're used to shooting fast , because german films are done with smaller budgets and have less shooting days than us productions , " he adds .
but mennan yapo feels a bit of european flair should n't be underestimated .
" hollywood also knows it 's going to get some edge from german directors , " he says .
" it 's basically an industry , and it 's aware that now and then , it needs fresh blood .
a couple of years ago the mexicans came along and brought in some new flavor .
now it 's the germans ' turn .
especially when they 're doing genre films , they deliver a different point of view on americana . "
taking the rough with the smooth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : emmerich can make disaster movies with the best of them even so , old-school " auteur " filmmakers are less likely to find themselves clasped to the tinseltown bosom .
like yapo , volker engel is aware that hollywood is always on the lookout for the new " it " people , but that an invitation to the party does come with strings attached .
" it can be difficult for a german director to do his first project here , because on the one hand they make you feel like the ' king ' , but on the other hand you 're spending their money .
so they will say : " hey , ' king , ' you can do whatever you want , but only as long as we 're happy with it . "
but this is n't necessarily a problem for german directors , who have a natural affinity for us-style movie-making .
" germany is very america-friendly , " said film critic andrea dittgen .
" most young directors grew up with us movies and they 're heavily influenced by them . "
germany 's part in the history of cinema in fact , the affinity is mutual .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the producer of " capote " was born in düsseldorf " there has been a long-standing tradition of german emigres working -lsb- in hollywood -rsb- , from the classical era to the present day , " explained german producer michael ohoven , whose movie " capote " was nominated as best motion picture of the year in 2005 .
he points out that germans have been instrumental in defining the hollywood cinema since its early days .
" the most skilled and influential directors from the golden age of hollywood were german , including fritz lang , f. w. murnau , billy wilder , ernst lubitsch , and douglas sirk , " he said .
" the stylistic tendencies of american film noir , which produced some of hollywood ’ s greatest titles of all time , are largely indebted to the german expressionist films of the 1920s . "
" perhaps because germany has a popular cinema with a strong genre sensibility , germans are uniquely suited to succeed within the hollywood system , " he added .
as mennan yapo observed , their sudden prominence in hollywood after decades of absence is basically an organic progression .
" let 's not forget that after the second world war , well up to the ' 70s , there were not many german directors anywhere at all , not even in germany , " he explains .
" no one who emigrated to the us during the nazi regime came back .
the years from ' 33 to ' 45 emptied germany artistically , so the country took a while to get back on track . "
but then it began gaining new artistic self-confidence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rainer werner fassbinder , a very european director " in the 1970s , werner herzog , rainer werner fassbinder and volker schlöndorff came along , " said yapo .
" initially , they leaned more towards the french directors and the new wave .
but then schlöndorff , for example , started making films in english , and they started leaning towards hollywood .
we began to see the fruits of all the film schools that had started up in the 60s and 70s . "
the next step , however , was to strike out for american shores .
and it still is .
" film still is n't an industry here , " says yapo .
" at some point , german directors have to make a decision about where they 're going to work , " said andrea dittgen .
" if they stay in germany , most of them will end up working for television , which ultimately spoils them for hollywood because they become unable to adapt .
whereas if they head to hollywood they 'll broaden their horizons , which is always a good thing .
and they do n't necessarily have to stay - they can always come back and use what they 've learned in germany . "
volker engel is similarly optimistic that germany does n't need to worry about a brain drain .

but does the westwards exodus of film professionals mean the home-grown industry loses out ? hitting german cinema screens in october are " premonition " by mennan yapo , " trade " by marco kreuzpaintner and oliver hirschbiegel ’ s " the invasion , " a remake of the 1955 classic " the body snatchers , " starring nicole kidman .
us-backed projects by christian alvart , sandra nettelbeck , florian baxmeyer and joseph rusnak are still in the pipeline - and the list goes on .
still basking in the afterglow of florian von donnersmarck 's " the lives of others " oscar triumph in february , germany could n't be prouder of its young directors suddenly swarming the dream factory .
young , gifted and cheap they certainly look like they 've started running with the big guys .
but they 're succeeding by going native and mainstream - what they 're not doing is adding any quintessentially german artistic vision to the hollywood mix .
instead , they 've learnt how to beat the americans at their own game .
taking their cues from germany 's only long-standing hollywood heavyweights , roland emmerich and wolfgang petersen , the new crop of directors is making solid commercial fare expertly pitched at the us market .
the appeal of german directors in hollywood is n't any unique artistic agenda , says andrea dittgen from the association of german film critics .
it 's purely practical .
" they 're hired because they 're cheaper than their american peers , " she said .
crucially , this latest generation - with the exception of hirschbiegel - is also very young , and can still be " steered . "
" they 're willing to work for less , because hollywood is where they want to be .
and these directors are very open-minded about giving the studios what they want , " she said .
hollywood getting its money 's worth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " premonition " is a classic psycho-thriller " premonition , " a supernatural thriller made by mennan yapo for sony , is a case in point .
the turkish-german director was snapped up by the entertainment capital on the strength of just one feature-length movie in germany , which was released in the us as " soundless . "
hollywood knew what it was doing .
garnering sandra bullock the highest-grossing opening weekend of her career , " premonition " ticks all the right hollywood boxes .
" when the studios hire germans they know they 're going to get more out of the budget , " said yapo .
" they 're punctual and they 're basically good workers who are very well trained . "
" german directors come highly skilled , " said german producer and visual effects supervisor volker engel , who won an oscar in 1997 for his work on " independence day . "
the movie , which still ranks among the top 10 all-time box-office smashes , was one of the first to prove that german directors - in this case , roland emmerich - were adept at delivering classic american blockbusters with maximum efficiency .
" they 're used to shooting fast , because german films are done with smaller budgets and have less shooting days than us productions , " he adds .
but mennan yapo feels a bit of european flair should n't be underestimated .
" hollywood also knows it 's going to get some edge from german directors , " he says .
" it 's basically an industry , and it 's aware that now and then , it needs fresh blood .
a couple of years ago the mexicans came along and brought in some new flavor .
now it 's the germans ' turn .
especially when they 're doing genre films , they deliver a different point of view on americana . "
taking the rough with the smooth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : emmerich can make disaster movies with the best of them even so , old-school " auteur " filmmakers are less likely to find themselves clasped to the tinseltown bosom .
like yapo , volker engel is aware that hollywood is always on the lookout for the new " it " people , but that an invitation to the party does come with strings attached .
" it can be difficult for a german director to do his first project here , because on the one hand they make you feel like the ' king ' , but on the other hand you 're spending their money .
so they will say : " hey , ' king , ' you can do whatever you want , but only as long as we 're happy with it . "
but this is n't necessarily a problem for german directors , who have a natural affinity for us-style movie-making .
" germany is very america-friendly , " said film critic andrea dittgen .
" most young directors grew up with us movies and they 're heavily influenced by them . "
germany 's part in the history of cinema in fact , the affinity is mutual .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the producer of " capote " was born in düsseldorf " there has been a long-standing tradition of german emigres working -lsb- in hollywood -rsb- , from the classical era to the present day , " explained german producer michael ohoven , whose movie " capote " was nominated as best motion picture of the year in 2005 .
he points out that germans have been instrumental in defining the hollywood cinema since its early days .
" the most skilled and influential directors from the golden age of hollywood were german , including fritz lang , f. w. murnau , billy wilder , ernst lubitsch , and douglas sirk , " he said .
" the stylistic tendencies of american film noir , which produced some of hollywood ’ s greatest titles of all time , are largely indebted to the german expressionist films of the 1920s . "
" perhaps because germany has a popular cinema with a strong genre sensibility , germans are uniquely suited to succeed within the hollywood system , " he added .
as mennan yapo observed , their sudden prominence in hollywood after decades of absence is basically an organic progression .
" let 's not forget that after the second world war , well up to the ' 70s , there were not many german directors anywhere at all , not even in germany , " he explains .
" no one who emigrated to the us during the nazi regime came back .
the years from ' 33 to ' 45 emptied germany artistically , so the country took a while to get back on track . "
but then it began gaining new artistic self-confidence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rainer werner fassbinder , a very european director " in the 1970s , werner herzog , rainer werner fassbinder and volker schlöndorff came along , " said yapo .
" initially , they leaned more towards the french directors and the new wave .
but then schlöndorff , for example , started making films in english , and they started leaning towards hollywood .
we began to see the fruits of all the film schools that had started up in the 60s and 70s . "
the next step , however , was to strike out for american shores .
and it still is .
" film still is n't an industry here , " says yapo .
" at some point , german directors have to make a decision about where they 're going to work , " said andrea dittgen .
" if they stay in germany , most of them will end up working for television , which ultimately spoils them for hollywood because they become unable to adapt .
whereas if they head to hollywood they 'll broaden their horizons , which is always a good thing .

he points out that germans have been instrumental in defining the hollywood cinema since its early days .
" the most skilled and influential directors from the golden age of hollywood were german , including fritz lang , f. w. murnau , billy wilder , ernst lubitsch , and douglas sirk , " he said .
" the stylistic tendencies of american film noir , which produced some of hollywood ’ s greatest titles of all time , are largely indebted to the german expressionist films of the 1920s . "
" perhaps because germany has a popular cinema with a strong genre sensibility , germans are uniquely suited to succeed within the hollywood system , " he added .
as mennan yapo observed , their sudden prominence in hollywood after decades of absence is basically an organic progression .
" let 's not forget that after the second world war , well up to the ' 70s , there were not many german directors anywhere at all , not even in germany , " he explains .
" no one who emigrated to the us during the nazi regime came back .
the years from ' 33 to ' 45 emptied germany artistically , so the country took a while to get back on track . "
but then it began gaining new artistic self-confidence .

" initially , they leaned more towards the french directors and the new wave .
but then schlöndorff , for example , started making films in english , and they started leaning towards hollywood .
we began to see the fruits of all the film schools that had started up in the 60s and 70s . "
the next step , however , was to strike out for american shores .
and it still is .
" film still is n't an industry here , " says yapo .
" at some point , german directors have to make a decision about where they 're going to work , " said andrea dittgen .
" if they stay in germany , most of them will end up working for television , which ultimately spoils them for hollywood because they become unable to adapt .
whereas if they head to hollywood they 'll broaden their horizons , which is always a good thing .
and they do n't necessarily have to stay - they can always come back and use what they 've learned in germany . "
volker engel is similarly optimistic that germany does n't need to worry about a brain drain .

but does the westwards exodus of film professionals mean the home-grown industry loses out ? hitting german cinema screens in october are " premonition " by mennan yapo , " trade " by marco kreuzpaintner and oliver hirschbiegel ’ s " the invasion , " a remake of the 1955 classic " the body snatchers , " starring nicole kidman .
us-backed projects by christian alvart , sandra nettelbeck , florian baxmeyer and joseph rusnak are still in the pipeline - and the list goes on .
still basking in the afterglow of florian von donnersmarck 's " the lives of others " oscar triumph in february , germany could n't be prouder of its young directors suddenly swarming the dream factory .
young , gifted and cheap they certainly look like they 've started running with the big guys .
but they 're succeeding by going native and mainstream - what they 're not doing is adding any quintessentially german artistic vision to the hollywood mix .
instead , they 've learnt how to beat the americans at their own game .
taking their cues from germany 's only long-standing hollywood heavyweights , roland emmerich and wolfgang petersen , the new crop of directors is making solid commercial fare expertly pitched at the us market .
the appeal of german directors in hollywood is n't any unique artistic agenda , says andrea dittgen from the association of german film critics .
it 's purely practical .
" they 're hired because they 're cheaper than their american peers , " she said .
crucially , this latest generation - with the exception of hirschbiegel - is also very young , and can still be " steered . "
" they 're willing to work for less , because hollywood is where they want to be .
and these directors are very open-minded about giving the studios what they want , " she said .
hollywood getting its money 's worth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " premonition " is a classic psycho-thriller " premonition , " a supernatural thriller made by mennan yapo for sony , is a case in point .
the turkish-german director was snapped up by the entertainment capital on the strength of just one feature-length movie in germany , which was released in the us as " soundless . "
hollywood knew what it was doing .
garnering sandra bullock the highest-grossing opening weekend of her career , " premonition " ticks all the right hollywood boxes .
" when the studios hire germans they know they 're going to get more out of the budget , " said yapo .
" they 're punctual and they 're basically good workers who are very well trained . "
" german directors come highly skilled , " said german producer and visual effects supervisor volker engel , who won an oscar in 1997 for his work on " independence day . "
the movie , which still ranks among the top 10 all-time box-office smashes , was one of the first to prove that german directors - in this case , roland emmerich - were adept at delivering classic american blockbusters with maximum efficiency .
" they 're used to shooting fast , because german films are done with smaller budgets and have less shooting days than us productions , " he adds .
but mennan yapo feels a bit of european flair should n't be underestimated .
" hollywood also knows it 's going to get some edge from german directors , " he says .
" it 's basically an industry , and it 's aware that now and then , it needs fresh blood .
a couple of years ago the mexicans came along and brought in some new flavor .
now it 's the germans ' turn .
especially when they 're doing genre films , they deliver a different point of view on americana . "
taking the rough with the smooth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : emmerich can make disaster movies with the best of them even so , old-school " auteur " filmmakers are less likely to find themselves clasped to the tinseltown bosom .
like yapo , volker engel is aware that hollywood is always on the lookout for the new " it " people , but that an invitation to the party does come with strings attached .
" it can be difficult for a german director to do his first project here , because on the one hand they make you feel like the ' king ' , but on the other hand you 're spending their money .
so they will say : " hey , ' king , ' you can do whatever you want , but only as long as we 're happy with it . "
but this is n't necessarily a problem for german directors , who have a natural affinity for us-style movie-making .
" germany is very america-friendly , " said film critic andrea dittgen .
" most young directors grew up with us movies and they 're heavily influenced by them . "
germany 's part in the history of cinema in fact , the affinity is mutual .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the producer of " capote " was born in düsseldorf " there has been a long-standing tradition of german emigres working -lsb- in hollywood -rsb- , from the classical era to the present day , " explained german producer michael ohoven , whose movie " capote " was nominated as best motion picture of the year in 2005 .

15 , although merkel warned of further sanctions . the russian leader , who leaves office in the spring after completing two terms , drew a parallel between iran 's contentious uranium enrichment program and north korea 's nuclear weapons program . " remember , only recently we just as emotionally discussed the north korean nuclear program , and now we are seeing positive moves on the korean peninsula , " putin said , adding that patience and continued negotiations would be keys to a breakthrough with tehran .
" we can and must be patient and look for a way out .
can we do it without having a dialogue with the iranian leadership and people ?
i think that 's impossible . "
merkel warned that if tehran did not comply with demands for transparency on its nuclear program " a new round of sanctions must be initiated . "
the chancellor nevertheless made clear germany , like russia , was banking on a negotiated end to the impasse .
bilateral relations , trade good bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin took questions on his and russia 's political future on the topic of bilateral relations , both leaders said cooperation in internal and external security was good .
they noted rapidly growing trade , which rose 38 percent last year to a total of 53 billion euros -lrb- $ 75 billion -rrb- .
russia provides around a third of germany 's crude oil and gas needs and the trade balance is in its favor by close to 6 billion euros .
putin said the two economies complemented each other , with russia providing reliable energy resources and opportunities for german business in technology and construction .
merkel also announced that the two countries hoped to build the nord stream trans-baltic gas pipeline and were keen to allay the concerns of transit states over the project . nord stream goes ahead , assures merkel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nord stream pipeline will be completed on time , the leaders said " where there are problems implementing it economically , we can help - if political talks help , " the project is politically desired .
" if investment conditions need clearing up , that must ensue at a company level . "
the pipeline - a project run by a consortium consisting of russia 's gas export monopoly gazprom and germany 's basf and e.on - will run from russia to germany under the baltic sea .
some countries through which the pipeline will run have raised concerns about the environmental safety aspects .
" we see no need to act at the moment , so i can only say that in my view the project will go ahead , " merkel said .
" as far as germany is concerned , we want to see this project completed and economically implemented , " she added .
russians willing to meet transit states in debate russian energy minister viktor khristenko told reporters at a separate meeting that berlin and moscow would continue to hold discussions with the transit states . " the project is going according to plan , but there is a situation where questions about the route need to be discussed with baltic sea littoral states , " he said .

15 , although merkel warned of further sanctions . the russian leader , who leaves office in the spring after completing two terms , drew a parallel between iran 's contentious uranium enrichment program and north korea 's nuclear weapons program . " remember , only recently we just as emotionally discussed the north korean nuclear program , and now we are seeing positive moves on the korean peninsula , " putin said , adding that patience and continued negotiations would be keys to a breakthrough with tehran .
" we can and must be patient and look for a way out .
can we do it without having a dialogue with the iranian leadership and people ?
i think that 's impossible . "
merkel warned that if tehran did not comply with demands for transparency on its nuclear program " a new round of sanctions must be initiated . "
the chancellor nevertheless made clear germany , like russia , was banking on a negotiated end to the impasse .
bilateral relations , trade good bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin took questions on his and russia 's political future on the topic of bilateral relations , both leaders said cooperation in internal and external security was good .
they noted rapidly growing trade , which rose 38 percent last year to a total of 53 billion euros -lrb- $ 75 billion -rrb- .
russia provides around a third of germany 's crude oil and gas needs and the trade balance is in its favor by close to 6 billion euros .
putin said the two economies complemented each other , with russia providing reliable energy resources and opportunities for german business in technology and construction .
merkel also announced that the two countries hoped to build the nord stream trans-baltic gas pipeline and were keen to allay the concerns of transit states over the project . nord stream goes ahead , assures merkel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nord stream pipeline will be completed on time , the leaders said " where there are problems implementing it economically , we can help - if political talks help , " the project is politically desired .
" if investment conditions need clearing up , that must ensue at a company level . "
the pipeline - a project run by a consortium consisting of russia 's gas export monopoly gazprom and germany 's basf and e.on - will run from russia to germany under the baltic sea .
some countries through which the pipeline will run have raised concerns about the environmental safety aspects .
" we see no need to act at the moment , so i can only say that in my view the project will go ahead , " merkel said .
" as far as germany is concerned , we want to see this project completed and economically implemented , " she added .
russians willing to meet transit states in debate russian energy minister viktor khristenko told reporters at a separate meeting that berlin and moscow would continue to hold discussions with the transit states . " the project is going according to plan , but there is a situation where questions about the route need to be discussed with baltic sea littoral states , " he said .
" we are in a position to ensure a high level of environmental security on the route of this pipeline . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters demanded answers in the case of murdered russian journalist politkovskaya putin took the opportunity of his visit to germany to reiterate his plan to visit iran after it an alleged assassination plot had been uncovered .
" of course i 'm going to iran , " he said in response to a question .
putin also fielded awkward questions about the ongoing probe into the murder a year ago of journalist anna politkovskaya .
the president said investigations were entering the final stage and the outstanding issue was to find who was behind the killing .
asked about his political future , putin pledged that the russian constitution , which allows only two consecutive presidential terms , would be implemented in letter and spirit , but this did not mean that he could not continue to be politically active .
putin 's recent suggestion that he could become prime minister , has raised concerns that he could be seeking to undermine russia 's democratic institutions . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the eu deems it necessary to increase direct pressure on the regime , " the ministers said in a statement issued after talks in luxembourg .
" it will therefore adopt a package of measures that do not harm the general population but that target those responsible for the violent crackdown and the overall political stalemate in the country . "
eu sanctions on hold while mission planned bildunterschrift : tougher eu sanctions are a negotiation stick for the un envoy french foreign minister bernard kouchner told reporters the sanctions would not be immediately implemented .

he added that security needed to be assured for the refugees but the mission would not include action to secure the border areas .

the eu foreign ministers also appealed to northern and southern sudanese political factions to stick to a 2005 peace pact , fearing that a collapse of the delicate treaty in that unrelated sudanese conflict could lead to new civil war complicating international efforts to end the darfur crisis . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

eu external relations commission benita ferrero-walder said she backed a delay in the imposition of the additional sanctions to support the mission of un envoy to myanmar ibrahim gambarai .
" he is the only one who has a chance for leverage at the moment , " she said .
" i think he should have sticks and carrots in order to be able to work . "
she said the eu wanted to see the release of political prisoners and the start of a process of dialogue with opponents .
the foreign ministers also gave their final approval during the meeting to deploy a 3,000-strong eu peacekeeping force to help refugees and the displaced along darfur 's borders with chad and the central african republic .
mostly french peacekeeping force set for chad kouchner said that the eu force - around half of which would be made up of french troops - would be involved in improving security and making it easier for aid groups to do their work in the camps that border sudan 's darfur region .
" it is a reconstruction mission , a development mission and a humanitarian one , " the french foreign minister said .
he added that security needed to be assured for the refugees but the mission would not include action to secure the border areas .

however , one firm may have put both at risk in an unprecedented crackdown of diarrhea sufferers . germany continues to debate whether increased numbers of security cameras will help reduce the risk of terror attacks .
the german interior ministry is particularly keen on rolling out more surveillance systems and while there is a certain amount of concern among civil liberty groups and a percentage of the population , many germans equate more security with more protection and seem to have few problems with the idea .
one section of the population who may start to have a problem with more cctv is the nation 's bus drivers .
while a strategically placed camera may be used to identify a person of specific threat from ending hundreds of people 's lives , a single device can also be used to ruin just one person 's life and put his career on the skids .
stomach cramps lead to employment pain this is exactly what happened to german bus driver jochen lorenz .
the 58-year-old driver from the central town of ilmenau - with no known affiliations with any terrorist group - was sacked after being spotted taking a roll of toilet paper from the bus depot lavatory .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some thought the security measures went too far lorenz had arrived at work for his shift at 5:30 a.m. , feeling a little under the weather with stomach cramps .
he made an emergency visit to the loo shortly before taking his seat at the helm of his bus and , fearing he may be caught short on the route , took a roll from the cubicle just in case .
" i was feeling ill when i arrived at the bus depot .
stomach problems , " lorenz told the bild zeitung newspaper .
" so i went to the lavatory .
things did n't get better so i took a roll of toilet paper and put it in the bus .
i wanted to have some during the drive in case of an emergency . "

15 , although merkel warned of further sanctions . the russian leader , who leaves office in the spring after completing two terms , drew a parallel between iran 's contentious uranium enrichment program and north korea 's nuclear weapons program . " remember , only recently we just as emotionally discussed the north korean nuclear program , and now we are seeing positive moves on the korean peninsula , " putin said , adding that patience and continued negotiations would be keys to a breakthrough with tehran .
" we can and must be patient and look for a way out .
can we do it without having a dialogue with the iranian leadership and people ?
i think that 's impossible . "
merkel warned that if tehran did not comply with demands for transparency on its nuclear program " a new round of sanctions must be initiated . "
the chancellor nevertheless made clear germany , like russia , was banking on a negotiated end to the impasse .
bilateral relations , trade good bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin took questions on his and russia 's political future on the topic of bilateral relations , both leaders said cooperation in internal and external security was good .
they noted rapidly growing trade , which rose 38 percent last year to a total of 53 billion euros -lrb- $ 75 billion -rrb- .
russia provides around a third of germany 's crude oil and gas needs and the trade balance is in its favor by close to 6 billion euros .
putin said the two economies complemented each other , with russia providing reliable energy resources and opportunities for german business in technology and construction .
merkel also announced that the two countries hoped to build the nord stream trans-baltic gas pipeline and were keen to allay the concerns of transit states over the project . nord stream goes ahead , assures merkel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nord stream pipeline will be completed on time , the leaders said " where there are problems implementing it economically , we can help - if political talks help , " the project is politically desired .
" if investment conditions need clearing up , that must ensue at a company level . "
the pipeline - a project run by a consortium consisting of russia 's gas export monopoly gazprom and germany 's basf and e.on - will run from russia to germany under the baltic sea .
some countries through which the pipeline will run have raised concerns about the environmental safety aspects .
" we see no need to act at the moment , so i can only say that in my view the project will go ahead , " merkel said .
" as far as germany is concerned , we want to see this project completed and economically implemented , " she added .
russians willing to meet transit states in debate russian energy minister viktor khristenko told reporters at a separate meeting that berlin and moscow would continue to hold discussions with the transit states . " the project is going according to plan , but there is a situation where questions about the route need to be discussed with baltic sea littoral states , " he said .
" we are in a position to ensure a high level of environmental security on the route of this pipeline . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters demanded answers in the case of murdered russian journalist politkovskaya putin took the opportunity of his visit to germany to reiterate his plan to visit iran after it an alleged assassination plot had been uncovered .
" of course i 'm going to iran , " he said in response to a question .
putin also fielded awkward questions about the ongoing probe into the murder a year ago of journalist anna politkovskaya .
the president said investigations were entering the final stage and the outstanding issue was to find who was behind the killing .
asked about his political future , putin pledged that the russian constitution , which allows only two consecutive presidential terms , would be implemented in letter and spirit , but this did not mean that he could not continue to be politically active .
putin 's recent suggestion that he could become prime minister , has raised concerns that he could be seeking to undermine russia 's democratic institutions . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

however , one firm may have put both at risk in an unprecedented crackdown of diarrhea sufferers . germany continues to debate whether increased numbers of security cameras will help reduce the risk of terror attacks .
the german interior ministry is particularly keen on rolling out more surveillance systems and while there is a certain amount of concern among civil liberty groups and a percentage of the population , many germans equate more security with more protection and seem to have few problems with the idea .
one section of the population who may start to have a problem with more cctv is the nation 's bus drivers .
while a strategically placed camera may be used to identify a person of specific threat from ending hundreds of people 's lives , a single device can also be used to ruin just one person 's life and put his career on the skids .

15 , although merkel warned of further sanctions . the russian leader , who leaves office in the spring after completing two terms , drew a parallel between iran 's contentious uranium enrichment program and north korea 's nuclear weapons program . " remember , only recently we just as emotionally discussed the north korean nuclear program , and now we are seeing positive moves on the korean peninsula , " putin said , adding that patience and continued negotiations would be keys to a breakthrough with tehran .
" we can and must be patient and look for a way out .
can we do it without having a dialogue with the iranian leadership and people ?
i think that 's impossible . "
merkel warned that if tehran did not comply with demands for transparency on its nuclear program " a new round of sanctions must be initiated . "
the chancellor nevertheless made clear germany , like russia , was banking on a negotiated end to the impasse .
bilateral relations , trade good bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin took questions on his and russia 's political future on the topic of bilateral relations , both leaders said cooperation in internal and external security was good .
they noted rapidly growing trade , which rose 38 percent last year to a total of 53 billion euros -lrb- $ 75 billion -rrb- .
russia provides around a third of germany 's crude oil and gas needs and the trade balance is in its favor by close to 6 billion euros .
putin said the two economies complemented each other , with russia providing reliable energy resources and opportunities for german business in technology and construction .
merkel also announced that the two countries hoped to build the nord stream trans-baltic gas pipeline and were keen to allay the concerns of transit states over the project . nord stream goes ahead , assures merkel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nord stream pipeline will be completed on time , the leaders said " where there are problems implementing it economically , we can help - if political talks help , " the project is politically desired .
" if investment conditions need clearing up , that must ensue at a company level . "
the pipeline - a project run by a consortium consisting of russia 's gas export monopoly gazprom and germany 's basf and e.on - will run from russia to germany under the baltic sea .
some countries through which the pipeline will run have raised concerns about the environmental safety aspects .
" we see no need to act at the moment , so i can only say that in my view the project will go ahead , " merkel said .
" as far as germany is concerned , we want to see this project completed and economically implemented , " she added .
russians willing to meet transit states in debate russian energy minister viktor khristenko told reporters at a separate meeting that berlin and moscow would continue to hold discussions with the transit states . " the project is going according to plan , but there is a situation where questions about the route need to be discussed with baltic sea littoral states , " he said .
" we are in a position to ensure a high level of environmental security on the route of this pipeline . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters demanded answers in the case of murdered russian journalist politkovskaya putin took the opportunity of his visit to germany to reiterate his plan to visit iran after it an alleged assassination plot had been uncovered .
" of course i 'm going to iran , " he said in response to a question .
putin also fielded awkward questions about the ongoing probe into the murder a year ago of journalist anna politkovskaya .
the president said investigations were entering the final stage and the outstanding issue was to find who was behind the killing .
asked about his political future , putin pledged that the russian constitution , which allows only two consecutive presidential terms , would be implemented in letter and spirit , but this did not mean that he could not continue to be politically active .
putin 's recent suggestion that he could become prime minister , has raised concerns that he could be seeking to undermine russia 's democratic institutions . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but does the westwards exodus of film professionals mean the home-grown industry loses out ? hitting german cinema screens in october are " premonition " by mennan yapo , " trade " by marco kreuzpaintner and oliver hirschbiegel ’ s " the invasion , " a remake of the 1955 classic " the body snatchers , " starring nicole kidman .
us-backed projects by christian alvart , sandra nettelbeck , florian baxmeyer and joseph rusnak are still in the pipeline - and the list goes on .
still basking in the afterglow of florian von donnersmarck 's " the lives of others " oscar triumph in february , germany could n't be prouder of its young directors suddenly swarming the dream factory .
young , gifted and cheap they certainly look like they 've started running with the big guys .
but they 're succeeding by going native and mainstream - what they 're not doing is adding any quintessentially german artistic vision to the hollywood mix .
instead , they 've learnt how to beat the americans at their own game .
taking their cues from germany 's only long-standing hollywood heavyweights , roland emmerich and wolfgang petersen , the new crop of directors is making solid commercial fare expertly pitched at the us market .
the appeal of german directors in hollywood is n't any unique artistic agenda , says andrea dittgen from the association of german film critics .
it 's purely practical .
" they 're hired because they 're cheaper than their american peers , " she said .
crucially , this latest generation - with the exception of hirschbiegel - is also very young , and can still be " steered . "
" they 're willing to work for less , because hollywood is where they want to be .
and these directors are very open-minded about giving the studios what they want , " she said .
hollywood getting its money 's worth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " premonition " is a classic psycho-thriller " premonition , " a supernatural thriller made by mennan yapo for sony , is a case in point .
the turkish-german director was snapped up by the entertainment capital on the strength of just one feature-length movie in germany , which was released in the us as " soundless . "
hollywood knew what it was doing .
garnering sandra bullock the highest-grossing opening weekend of her career , " premonition " ticks all the right hollywood boxes .
" when the studios hire germans they know they 're going to get more out of the budget , " said yapo .
" they 're punctual and they 're basically good workers who are very well trained . "
" german directors come highly skilled , " said german producer and visual effects supervisor volker engel , who won an oscar in 1997 for his work on " independence day . "
the movie , which still ranks among the top 10 all-time box-office smashes , was one of the first to prove that german directors - in this case , roland emmerich - were adept at delivering classic american blockbusters with maximum efficiency .
" they 're used to shooting fast , because german films are done with smaller budgets and have less shooting days than us productions , " he adds .
but mennan yapo feels a bit of european flair should n't be underestimated .
" hollywood also knows it 's going to get some edge from german directors , " he says .
" it 's basically an industry , and it 's aware that now and then , it needs fresh blood .
a couple of years ago the mexicans came along and brought in some new flavor .
now it 's the germans ' turn .
especially when they 're doing genre films , they deliver a different point of view on americana . "
taking the rough with the smooth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : emmerich can make disaster movies with the best of them even so , old-school " auteur " filmmakers are less likely to find themselves clasped to the tinseltown bosom .
like yapo , volker engel is aware that hollywood is always on the lookout for the new " it " people , but that an invitation to the party does come with strings attached .
" it can be difficult for a german director to do his first project here , because on the one hand they make you feel like the ' king ' , but on the other hand you 're spending their money .
so they will say : " hey , ' king , ' you can do whatever you want , but only as long as we 're happy with it . "
but this is n't necessarily a problem for german directors , who have a natural affinity for us-style movie-making .
" germany is very america-friendly , " said film critic andrea dittgen .
" most young directors grew up with us movies and they 're heavily influenced by them . "
germany 's part in the history of cinema in fact , the affinity is mutual .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the producer of " capote " was born in düsseldorf " there has been a long-standing tradition of german emigres working -lsb- in hollywood -rsb- , from the classical era to the present day , " explained german producer michael ohoven , whose movie " capote " was nominated as best motion picture of the year in 2005 .
he points out that germans have been instrumental in defining the hollywood cinema since its early days .
" the most skilled and influential directors from the golden age of hollywood were german , including fritz lang , f. w. murnau , billy wilder , ernst lubitsch , and douglas sirk , " he said .
" the stylistic tendencies of american film noir , which produced some of hollywood ’ s greatest titles of all time , are largely indebted to the german expressionist films of the 1920s . "
" perhaps because germany has a popular cinema with a strong genre sensibility , germans are uniquely suited to succeed within the hollywood system , " he added .
as mennan yapo observed , their sudden prominence in hollywood after decades of absence is basically an organic progression .
" let 's not forget that after the second world war , well up to the ' 70s , there were not many german directors anywhere at all , not even in germany , " he explains .
" no one who emigrated to the us during the nazi regime came back .
the years from ' 33 to ' 45 emptied germany artistically , so the country took a while to get back on track . "
but then it began gaining new artistic self-confidence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rainer werner fassbinder , a very european director " in the 1970s , werner herzog , rainer werner fassbinder and volker schlöndorff came along , " said yapo .
" initially , they leaned more towards the french directors and the new wave .
but then schlöndorff , for example , started making films in english , and they started leaning towards hollywood .
we began to see the fruits of all the film schools that had started up in the 60s and 70s . "
the next step , however , was to strike out for american shores .
and it still is .
" film still is n't an industry here , " says yapo .
" at some point , german directors have to make a decision about where they 're going to work , " said andrea dittgen .
" if they stay in germany , most of them will end up working for television , which ultimately spoils them for hollywood because they become unable to adapt .
whereas if they head to hollywood they 'll broaden their horizons , which is always a good thing .
and they do n't necessarily have to stay - they can always come back and use what they 've learned in germany . "
volker engel is similarly optimistic that germany does n't need to worry about a brain drain .

15 , germany 's chancellor said that the international community needs to be ready to impose further sanctions on tehran should leaders there refuse to cooperate in the nuclear row . speaking ahead of monday 's meeting with russian president vladimir putin in the central german town of wiesbaden , merkel said that the international community continued to worry about the iranian nuclear crisis as tehran had ignored binding resolutions by the un security council and demands of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- .
" together with our partners france , england , america , russia and china , we 've searched for ways again and again to bring iran back to the negotiating table , " merkel told the web site of german daily die welt in response to a question on whether germany had become too dependent on us foreign policy .
" since iran did n't accept - even though we made constructive offers - and since it still does n't fulfill the demands of the international community , we had to choose the path of sanctions in the un security council , " the chancellor said , adding that china and russia supported the sanctions " we can not close our eyes to the dangers , " she said .
" i strongly support finding a diplomatic solution , but we also need to be ready to impose further sanctions if iran does not budge .
it threatens israel 's security , which is non-negotiable for me as german chancellor .
it threatens the region , europe , and the world .
we have to prevent that . "

15 , germany 's chancellor said that the international community needs to be ready to impose further sanctions on tehran should leaders there refuse to cooperate in the nuclear row . speaking ahead of monday 's meeting with russian president vladimir putin in the central german town of wiesbaden , merkel said that the international community continued to worry about the iranian nuclear crisis as tehran had ignored binding resolutions by the un security council and demands of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- .
" together with our partners france , england , america , russia and china , we 've searched for ways again and again to bring iran back to the negotiating table , " merkel told the web site of german daily die welt in response to a question on whether germany had become too dependent on us foreign policy .
" since iran did n't accept - even though we made constructive offers - and since it still does n't fulfill the demands of the international community , we had to choose the path of sanctions in the un security council , " the chancellor said , adding that china and russia supported the sanctions " we can not close our eyes to the dangers , " she said .
" i strongly support finding a diplomatic solution , but we also need to be ready to impose further sanctions if iran does not budge .
it threatens israel 's security , which is non-negotiable for me as german chancellor .
it threatens the region , europe , and the world .
we have to prevent that . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de from the fringe -pipe- 15.10.2007 bus driver sacked after toilet paper " theft " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : big brother is watching - even when you go to the toilet the health and safety of both the driver of a bus and the passengers must be the priority of all transport companies .
however , one firm may have put both at risk in an unprecedented crackdown of diarrhea sufferers . germany continues to debate whether increased numbers of security cameras will help reduce the risk of terror attacks .
the german interior ministry is particularly keen on rolling out more surveillance systems and while there is a certain amount of concern among civil liberty groups and a percentage of the population , many germans equate more security with more protection and seem to have few problems with the idea .
one section of the population who may start to have a problem with more cctv is the nation 's bus drivers .
while a strategically placed camera may be used to identify a person of specific threat from ending hundreds of people 's lives , a single device can also be used to ruin just one person 's life and put his career on the skids .
stomach cramps lead to employment pain this is exactly what happened to german bus driver jochen lorenz .
the 58-year-old driver from the central town of ilmenau - with no known affiliations with any terrorist group - was sacked after being spotted taking a roll of toilet paper from the bus depot lavatory .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some thought the security measures went too far lorenz had arrived at work for his shift at 5:30 a.m. , feeling a little under the weather with stomach cramps .
he made an emergency visit to the loo shortly before taking his seat at the helm of his bus and , fearing he may be caught short on the route , took a roll from the cubicle just in case .
" i was feeling ill when i arrived at the bus depot .
stomach problems , " lorenz told the bild zeitung newspaper .
" so i went to the lavatory .
things did n't get better so i took a roll of toilet paper and put it in the bus .
i wanted to have some during the drive in case of an emergency . "
bus driver unaware of strict paper controls the eye-in-the-sky , however , did not look favorably on this .
the surveillance cameras had been installed by the powers that be to monitor strict control of toilet paper usage , among other things .
this fact , unbeknownst to lorenz at the time , was made glaringly and painfully obvious when he received his marching orders .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans showed their solidarity for the sacked driver the letter of dismissal stated that the quantity of toilet paper was strictly monitored and that a fresh roll of paper had disappeared .
“ after the surveillance data was analyzed , it was found that you , herr lorenz , were the only user to use the facilities , at 05:49 hours , " the letter from the bus company said .
lorenz protested against the sacking and told his boss that the roll was still in the bus , but to no avail .
so lorenz took the company to court and managed to secure a pay-off settlement totaling € 7,500 -lrb- $ 10,625 -rrb- . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the bloc also agreed to send an eu security force to chad . after a meeting of the eu 's foreign ministers on monday , oct .
15 , a decision was made to broaden existing sanctions that include visa bans and asset freezes on myanmar 's military and government officials as well as their relatives , and new steps targeting the country 's key timber , metals and gemstone sectors .
" the eu deems it necessary to increase direct pressure on the regime , " the ministers said in a statement issued after talks in luxembourg .
" it will therefore adopt a package of measures that do not harm the general population but that target those responsible for the violent crackdown and the overall political stalemate in the country . "
eu sanctions on hold while mission planned bildunterschrift : tougher eu sanctions are a negotiation stick for the un envoy french foreign minister bernard kouchner told reporters the sanctions would not be immediately implemented .
kouchner added that the eu was also considering sending a mission to myanmar , formerly named burma , to hold talks with the military rulers on reconciliation with the country 's domestic political opponents .
eu external relations commission benita ferrero-walder said she backed a delay in the imposition of the additional sanctions to support the mission of un envoy to myanmar ibrahim gambarai .

" i think he should have sticks and carrots in order to be able to work . "

the foreign ministers also gave their final approval during the meeting to deploy a 3,000-strong eu peacekeeping force to help refugees and the displaced along darfur 's borders with chad and the central african republic .
mostly french peacekeeping force set for chad kouchner said that the eu force - around half of which would be made up of french troops - would be involved in improving security and making it easier for aid groups to do their work in the camps that border sudan 's darfur region .
" it is a reconstruction mission , a development mission and a humanitarian one , " the french foreign minister said .
he added that security needed to be assured for the refugees but the mission would not include action to secure the border areas .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the conflicts in the region have led to a refugee crisis united nations estimates show that almost 3 million people have been uprooted by conflicts in the region , including the fighting in darfur and unrelated rebellions in chad and the central african republic .
some 2.25 million former darfur residents are currently displaced within their own country .
the eu foreign ministers also appealed to northern and southern sudanese political factions to stick to a 2005 peace pact , fearing that a collapse of the delicate treaty in that unrelated sudanese conflict could lead to new civil war complicating international efforts to end the darfur crisis . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

15 , although merkel warned of further sanctions . the russian leader , who leaves office in the spring after completing two terms , drew a parallel between iran 's contentious uranium enrichment program and north korea 's nuclear weapons program . " remember , only recently we just as emotionally discussed the north korean nuclear program , and now we are seeing positive moves on the korean peninsula , " putin said , adding that patience and continued negotiations would be keys to a breakthrough with tehran .
" we can and must be patient and look for a way out .
can we do it without having a dialogue with the iranian leadership and people ?
i think that 's impossible . "
merkel warned that if tehran did not comply with demands for transparency on its nuclear program " a new round of sanctions must be initiated . "

the pipeline - a project run by a consortium consisting of russia 's gas export monopoly gazprom and germany 's basf and e.on - will run from russia to germany under the baltic sea .
some countries through which the pipeline will run have raised concerns about the environmental safety aspects .
" we see no need to act at the moment , so i can only say that in my view the project will go ahead , " merkel said .
" as far as germany is concerned , we want to see this project completed and economically implemented , " she added .

the new aircraft is scheduled to take off for singapore on tuesday , oct .
16 . dogged by a series of production problems which have played havoc with its reputation , european aircraft manufacturer airbus can finally breathe a sigh of relief .
singapore airlines is now the proud owner of the world 's very first superjumbo jet , an event which airbus head thomas enders has already described as a " milestone . " " we can be very proud of this day , " enders said , adding that the next major challenge would be to get serial production up and running .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a final test flight for the airbus a380 " only if we manage to accelerate the production process in the next two years , will we be out of the woods with the a380 program , " enders said in an interview with german newsmagazine der spiegel .

15 , germany 's chancellor said that the international community needs to be ready to impose further sanctions on tehran should leaders there refuse to cooperate in the nuclear row . speaking ahead of monday 's meeting with russian president vladimir putin in the central german town of wiesbaden , merkel said that the international community continued to worry about the iranian nuclear crisis as tehran had ignored binding resolutions by the un security council and demands of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- .
" together with our partners france , england , america , russia and china , we 've searched for ways again and again to bring iran back to the negotiating table , " merkel told the web site of german daily die welt in response to a question on whether germany had become too dependent on us foreign policy .
" since iran did n't accept - even though we made constructive offers - and since it still does n't fulfill the demands of the international community , we had to choose the path of sanctions in the un security council , " the chancellor said , adding that china and russia supported the sanctions " we can not close our eyes to the dangers , " she said .
" i strongly support finding a diplomatic solution , but we also need to be ready to impose further sanctions if iran does not budge .
it threatens israel 's security , which is non-negotiable for me as german chancellor .
it threatens the region , europe , and the world .
we have to prevent that . "
putin goes ahead with iran visit the topic was also expected to dominate merkel 's talks with putin on monday ahead of a joint attendance of an annual russian-german forum , the st. petersburg dialogue .
putin meanwhile confirmed that he will travel to tehran later on monday despite a reported assassination plot by suicide bombers .

" together with our partners france , england , america , russia and china , we 've searched for ways again and again to bring iran back to the negotiating table , " merkel told the web site of german daily die welt in response to a question on whether germany had become too dependent on us foreign policy .
" since iran did n't accept - even though we made constructive offers - and since it still does n't fulfill the demands of the international community , we had to choose the path of sanctions in the un security council , " the chancellor said , adding that china and russia supported the sanctions " we can not close our eyes to the dangers , " she said .
" i strongly support finding a diplomatic solution , but we also need to be ready to impose further sanctions if iran does not budge .
it threatens israel 's security , which is non-negotiable for me as german chancellor .

but does the westwards exodus of film professionals mean the home-grown industry loses out ? hitting german cinema screens in october are " premonition " by mennan yapo , " trade " by marco kreuzpaintner and oliver hirschbiegel ’ s " the invasion , " a remake of the 1955 classic " the body snatchers , " starring nicole kidman .
us-backed projects by christian alvart , sandra nettelbeck , florian baxmeyer and joseph rusnak are still in the pipeline - and the list goes on .
still basking in the afterglow of florian von donnersmarck 's " the lives of others " oscar triumph in february , germany could n't be prouder of its young directors suddenly swarming the dream factory .
young , gifted and cheap they certainly look like they 've started running with the big guys .
but they 're succeeding by going native and mainstream - what they 're not doing is adding any quintessentially german artistic vision to the hollywood mix .
instead , they 've learnt how to beat the americans at their own game .
taking their cues from germany 's only long-standing hollywood heavyweights , roland emmerich and wolfgang petersen , the new crop of directors is making solid commercial fare expertly pitched at the us market .
the appeal of german directors in hollywood is n't any unique artistic agenda , says andrea dittgen from the association of german film critics .
it 's purely practical .
" they 're hired because they 're cheaper than their american peers , " she said .
crucially , this latest generation - with the exception of hirschbiegel - is also very young , and can still be " steered . "
" they 're willing to work for less , because hollywood is where they want to be .
and these directors are very open-minded about giving the studios what they want , " she said .
hollywood getting its money 's worth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " premonition " is a classic psycho-thriller " premonition , " a supernatural thriller made by mennan yapo for sony , is a case in point .
the turkish-german director was snapped up by the entertainment capital on the strength of just one feature-length movie in germany , which was released in the us as " soundless . "
hollywood knew what it was doing .
garnering sandra bullock the highest-grossing opening weekend of her career , " premonition " ticks all the right hollywood boxes .
" when the studios hire germans they know they 're going to get more out of the budget , " said yapo .
" they 're punctual and they 're basically good workers who are very well trained . "
" german directors come highly skilled , " said german producer and visual effects supervisor volker engel , who won an oscar in 1997 for his work on " independence day . "
the movie , which still ranks among the top 10 all-time box-office smashes , was one of the first to prove that german directors - in this case , roland emmerich - were adept at delivering classic american blockbusters with maximum efficiency .
" they 're used to shooting fast , because german films are done with smaller budgets and have less shooting days than us productions , " he adds .
but mennan yapo feels a bit of european flair should n't be underestimated .
" hollywood also knows it 's going to get some edge from german directors , " he says .
" it 's basically an industry , and it 's aware that now and then , it needs fresh blood .
a couple of years ago the mexicans came along and brought in some new flavor .
now it 's the germans ' turn .
especially when they 're doing genre films , they deliver a different point of view on americana . "
taking the rough with the smooth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : emmerich can make disaster movies with the best of them even so , old-school " auteur " filmmakers are less likely to find themselves clasped to the tinseltown bosom .
like yapo , volker engel is aware that hollywood is always on the lookout for the new " it " people , but that an invitation to the party does come with strings attached .
" it can be difficult for a german director to do his first project here , because on the one hand they make you feel like the ' king ' , but on the other hand you 're spending their money .
so they will say : " hey , ' king , ' you can do whatever you want , but only as long as we 're happy with it . "
but this is n't necessarily a problem for german directors , who have a natural affinity for us-style movie-making .
" germany is very america-friendly , " said film critic andrea dittgen .
" most young directors grew up with us movies and they 're heavily influenced by them . "
germany 's part in the history of cinema in fact , the affinity is mutual .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the producer of " capote " was born in düsseldorf " there has been a long-standing tradition of german emigres working -lsb- in hollywood -rsb- , from the classical era to the present day , " explained german producer michael ohoven , whose movie " capote " was nominated as best motion picture of the year in 2005 .
he points out that germans have been instrumental in defining the hollywood cinema since its early days .
" the most skilled and influential directors from the golden age of hollywood were german , including fritz lang , f. w. murnau , billy wilder , ernst lubitsch , and douglas sirk , " he said .
" the stylistic tendencies of american film noir , which produced some of hollywood ’ s greatest titles of all time , are largely indebted to the german expressionist films of the 1920s . "
" perhaps because germany has a popular cinema with a strong genre sensibility , germans are uniquely suited to succeed within the hollywood system , " he added .
as mennan yapo observed , their sudden prominence in hollywood after decades of absence is basically an organic progression .
" let 's not forget that after the second world war , well up to the ' 70s , there were not many german directors anywhere at all , not even in germany , " he explains .
" no one who emigrated to the us during the nazi regime came back .
the years from ' 33 to ' 45 emptied germany artistically , so the country took a while to get back on track . "
but then it began gaining new artistic self-confidence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rainer werner fassbinder , a very european director " in the 1970s , werner herzog , rainer werner fassbinder and volker schlöndorff came along , " said yapo .
" initially , they leaned more towards the french directors and the new wave .
but then schlöndorff , for example , started making films in english , and they started leaning towards hollywood .
we began to see the fruits of all the film schools that had started up in the 60s and 70s . "
the next step , however , was to strike out for american shores .
and it still is .
" film still is n't an industry here , " says yapo .
" at some point , german directors have to make a decision about where they 're going to work , " said andrea dittgen .
" if they stay in germany , most of them will end up working for television , which ultimately spoils them for hollywood because they become unable to adapt .
whereas if they head to hollywood they 'll broaden their horizons , which is always a good thing .
and they do n't necessarily have to stay - they can always come back and use what they 've learned in germany . "
volker engel is similarly optimistic that germany does n't need to worry about a brain drain .

us-backed projects by christian alvart , sandra nettelbeck , florian baxmeyer and joseph rusnak are still in the pipeline - and the list goes on .
still basking in the afterglow of florian von donnersmarck 's " the lives of others " oscar triumph in february , germany could n't be prouder of its young directors suddenly swarming the dream factory .
young , gifted and cheap they certainly look like they 've started running with the big guys .
but they 're succeeding by going native and mainstream - what they 're not doing is adding any quintessentially german artistic vision to the hollywood mix .
instead , they 've learnt how to beat the americans at their own game .
taking their cues from germany 's only long-standing hollywood heavyweights , roland emmerich and wolfgang petersen , the new crop of directors is making solid commercial fare expertly pitched at the us market .
the appeal of german directors in hollywood is n't any unique artistic agenda , says andrea dittgen from the association of german film critics .
it 's purely practical .
" they 're hired because they 're cheaper than their american peers , " she said .
crucially , this latest generation - with the exception of hirschbiegel - is also very young , and can still be " steered . "
" they 're willing to work for less , because hollywood is where they want to be .
and these directors are very open-minded about giving the studios what they want , " she said .
hollywood getting its money 's worth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " premonition " is a classic psycho-thriller " premonition , " a supernatural thriller made by mennan yapo for sony , is a case in point .
the turkish-german director was snapped up by the entertainment capital on the strength of just one feature-length movie in germany , which was released in the us as " soundless . "
hollywood knew what it was doing .
garnering sandra bullock the highest-grossing opening weekend of her career , " premonition " ticks all the right hollywood boxes .
" when the studios hire germans they know they 're going to get more out of the budget , " said yapo .
" they 're punctual and they 're basically good workers who are very well trained . "
" german directors come highly skilled , " said german producer and visual effects supervisor volker engel , who won an oscar in 1997 for his work on " independence day . "
the movie , which still ranks among the top 10 all-time box-office smashes , was one of the first to prove that german directors - in this case , roland emmerich - were adept at delivering classic american blockbusters with maximum efficiency .
" they 're used to shooting fast , because german films are done with smaller budgets and have less shooting days than us productions , " he adds .
but mennan yapo feels a bit of european flair should n't be underestimated .
" hollywood also knows it 's going to get some edge from german directors , " he says .
" it 's basically an industry , and it 's aware that now and then , it needs fresh blood .
a couple of years ago the mexicans came along and brought in some new flavor .
now it 's the germans ' turn .
especially when they 're doing genre films , they deliver a different point of view on americana . "
taking the rough with the smooth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : emmerich can make disaster movies with the best of them even so , old-school " auteur " filmmakers are less likely to find themselves clasped to the tinseltown bosom .
like yapo , volker engel is aware that hollywood is always on the lookout for the new " it " people , but that an invitation to the party does come with strings attached .
" it can be difficult for a german director to do his first project here , because on the one hand they make you feel like the ' king ' , but on the other hand you 're spending their money .
so they will say : " hey , ' king , ' you can do whatever you want , but only as long as we 're happy with it . "
but this is n't necessarily a problem for german directors , who have a natural affinity for us-style movie-making .
" germany is very america-friendly , " said film critic andrea dittgen .
" most young directors grew up with us movies and they 're heavily influenced by them . "
germany 's part in the history of cinema in fact , the affinity is mutual .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the producer of " capote " was born in düsseldorf " there has been a long-standing tradition of german emigres working -lsb- in hollywood -rsb- , from the classical era to the present day , " explained german producer michael ohoven , whose movie " capote " was nominated as best motion picture of the year in 2005 .
he points out that germans have been instrumental in defining the hollywood cinema since its early days .
" the most skilled and influential directors from the golden age of hollywood were german , including fritz lang , f. w. murnau , billy wilder , ernst lubitsch , and douglas sirk , " he said .
" the stylistic tendencies of american film noir , which produced some of hollywood ’ s greatest titles of all time , are largely indebted to the german expressionist films of the 1920s . "
" perhaps because germany has a popular cinema with a strong genre sensibility , germans are uniquely suited to succeed within the hollywood system , " he added .
as mennan yapo observed , their sudden prominence in hollywood after decades of absence is basically an organic progression .
" let 's not forget that after the second world war , well up to the ' 70s , there were not many german directors anywhere at all , not even in germany , " he explains .
" no one who emigrated to the us during the nazi regime came back .
the years from ' 33 to ' 45 emptied germany artistically , so the country took a while to get back on track . "
but then it began gaining new artistic self-confidence .

so they will say : " hey , ' king , ' you can do whatever you want , but only as long as we 're happy with it . "
but this is n't necessarily a problem for german directors , who have a natural affinity for us-style movie-making .
" germany is very america-friendly , " said film critic andrea dittgen .
" most young directors grew up with us movies and they 're heavily influenced by them . "
germany 's part in the history of cinema in fact , the affinity is mutual .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the producer of " capote " was born in düsseldorf " there has been a long-standing tradition of german emigres working -lsb- in hollywood -rsb- , from the classical era to the present day , " explained german producer michael ohoven , whose movie " capote " was nominated as best motion picture of the year in 2005 .
he points out that germans have been instrumental in defining the hollywood cinema since its early days .
" the most skilled and influential directors from the golden age of hollywood were german , including fritz lang , f. w. murnau , billy wilder , ernst lubitsch , and douglas sirk , " he said .
" the stylistic tendencies of american film noir , which produced some of hollywood ’ s greatest titles of all time , are largely indebted to the german expressionist films of the 1920s . "
" perhaps because germany has a popular cinema with a strong genre sensibility , germans are uniquely suited to succeed within the hollywood system , " he added .
as mennan yapo observed , their sudden prominence in hollywood after decades of absence is basically an organic progression .
" let 's not forget that after the second world war , well up to the ' 70s , there were not many german directors anywhere at all , not even in germany , " he explains .
" no one who emigrated to the us during the nazi regime came back .
the years from ' 33 to ' 45 emptied germany artistically , so the country took a while to get back on track . "
but then it began gaining new artistic self-confidence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rainer werner fassbinder , a very european director " in the 1970s , werner herzog , rainer werner fassbinder and volker schlöndorff came along , " said yapo .
" initially , they leaned more towards the french directors and the new wave .
but then schlöndorff , for example , started making films in english , and they started leaning towards hollywood .
we began to see the fruits of all the film schools that had started up in the 60s and 70s . "
the next step , however , was to strike out for american shores .
and it still is .
" film still is n't an industry here , " says yapo .
" at some point , german directors have to make a decision about where they 're going to work , " said andrea dittgen .
" if they stay in germany , most of them will end up working for television , which ultimately spoils them for hollywood because they become unable to adapt .
whereas if they head to hollywood they 'll broaden their horizons , which is always a good thing .
and they do n't necessarily have to stay - they can always come back and use what they 've learned in germany . "
volker engel is similarly optimistic that germany does n't need to worry about a brain drain .
" i see a future for more german directors making movies both in hollywood and in germany , and moving back and forth between two very different worlds , " he said . jane paulick send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

poland , despite its opposition to many aspects of the treaty , is confident of success . eu leaders are meeting on monday , oct .
15 , in luxembourg hoping that polish calls for last-minute changes to the bloc 's reform treaty will not prove fatal .
they 're also crossing their fingers that poland 's stated optimism about the treaty 's chances is on the mark .
the eu 's future treaty received an optimistic boost last week when polish president lech kaczynski , leader of a country with many reservations about the text , said that there was a " 95-98 percent " chance of an agreement on the treaty at the forthcoming lisbon summit being held on oct .
18-19 .
kaczynski told reporters that " all we had considered as the problems of the treaty belong more to the past than the present . "
" i am convinced that we will be able to come to an agreement , " he added polish reservations date back to june the progress of the treaty has been hindered since it was first hammered into shape at a european union summit in brussels in june during germany 's presidency of the 27-country bloc .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's job in june was made difficult by kaczynski poland 's strong opposition to the system under which voting rights are distributed throughout the eu according to the treaty led to marathon negotiations overseen by german chancellor angela merkel .
the poles succeeded in delaying the introduction of the double majority voting system - which warsaw opposes for fear it will give big countries too much decision-making power - until 2014 , after which it would be phased in over three years .
fundamental rights charter also a problem kaczynski acknowledged that poland had reservations about voting rights and a charter of fundamental rights but said that these objections could be dealt with in " a separate declaration . "
but he maintained that poland would oppose the current plan for a european charter of fundamental rights , saying " poland 's point of view culturally is different from the majority of other european countries . "
he said the overwhelmingly roman catholic nation could not " for example accept marriages of people of the same sex . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland hopes france can help cure its eu headaches kaczynski added that warsaw 's demand for a permanent post at the european court also remained " a considerable problem " but underlined that this could be " resolved " with the help of other countries , notably france .
despite his confidence over an agreement in lisbon this week , kaczynski hinted that legislative elections in his country , due to take place two days after the eu summit , would not make his task in negotiating on an eu level any easier .
" it would have been better if the summit took place after the elections , " he said .

poland , despite its opposition to many aspects of the treaty , is confident of success . eu leaders are meeting on monday , oct .
15 , in luxembourg hoping that polish calls for last-minute changes to the bloc 's reform treaty will not prove fatal .
they 're also crossing their fingers that poland 's stated optimism about the treaty 's chances is on the mark .
the eu 's future treaty received an optimistic boost last week when polish president lech kaczynski , leader of a country with many reservations about the text , said that there was a " 95-98 percent " chance of an agreement on the treaty at the forthcoming lisbon summit being held on oct .
18-19 .
kaczynski told reporters that " all we had considered as the problems of the treaty belong more to the past than the present . "
" i am convinced that we will be able to come to an agreement , " he added polish reservations date back to june the progress of the treaty has been hindered since it was first hammered into shape at a european union summit in brussels in june during germany 's presidency of the 27-country bloc .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's job in june was made difficult by kaczynski poland 's strong opposition to the system under which voting rights are distributed throughout the eu according to the treaty led to marathon negotiations overseen by german chancellor angela merkel .
the poles succeeded in delaying the introduction of the double majority voting system - which warsaw opposes for fear it will give big countries too much decision-making power - until 2014 , after which it would be phased in over three years .
fundamental rights charter also a problem kaczynski acknowledged that poland had reservations about voting rights and a charter of fundamental rights but said that these objections could be dealt with in " a separate declaration . "
but he maintained that poland would oppose the current plan for a european charter of fundamental rights , saying " poland 's point of view culturally is different from the majority of other european countries . "
he said the overwhelmingly roman catholic nation could not " for example accept marriages of people of the same sex . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland hopes france can help cure its eu headaches kaczynski added that warsaw 's demand for a permanent post at the european court also remained " a considerable problem " but underlined that this could be " resolved " with the help of other countries , notably france .
despite his confidence over an agreement in lisbon this week , kaczynski hinted that legislative elections in his country , due to take place two days after the eu summit , would not make his task in negotiating on an eu level any easier .
" it would have been better if the summit took place after the elections , " he said .

poland , despite its opposition to many aspects of the treaty , is confident of success . eu leaders are meeting on monday , oct .
15 , in luxembourg hoping that polish calls for last-minute changes to the bloc 's reform treaty will not prove fatal .
they 're also crossing their fingers that poland 's stated optimism about the treaty 's chances is on the mark .
the eu 's future treaty received an optimistic boost last week when polish president lech kaczynski , leader of a country with many reservations about the text , said that there was a " 95-98 percent " chance of an agreement on the treaty at the forthcoming lisbon summit being held on oct .
18-19 .
kaczynski told reporters that " all we had considered as the problems of the treaty belong more to the past than the present . "
" i am convinced that we will be able to come to an agreement , " he added polish reservations date back to june the progress of the treaty has been hindered since it was first hammered into shape at a european union summit in brussels in june during germany 's presidency of the 27-country bloc .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's job in june was made difficult by kaczynski poland 's strong opposition to the system under which voting rights are distributed throughout the eu according to the treaty led to marathon negotiations overseen by german chancellor angela merkel .
the poles succeeded in delaying the introduction of the double majority voting system - which warsaw opposes for fear it will give big countries too much decision-making power - until 2014 , after which it would be phased in over three years .
fundamental rights charter also a problem kaczynski acknowledged that poland had reservations about voting rights and a charter of fundamental rights but said that these objections could be dealt with in " a separate declaration . "
but he maintained that poland would oppose the current plan for a european charter of fundamental rights , saying " poland 's point of view culturally is different from the majority of other european countries . "
he said the overwhelmingly roman catholic nation could not " for example accept marriages of people of the same sex . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland hopes france can help cure its eu headaches kaczynski added that warsaw 's demand for a permanent post at the european court also remained " a considerable problem " but underlined that this could be " resolved " with the help of other countries , notably france .
despite his confidence over an agreement in lisbon this week , kaczynski hinted that legislative elections in his country , due to take place two days after the eu summit , would not make his task in negotiating on an eu level any easier .
" it would have been better if the summit took place after the elections , " he said .
poland called new legislative elections for oct .
21 after the collapse of prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski 's fractious coalition with a far-right party and a rural populist movement .
eu hopeful bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what started in berlin is hoped to be completed in lisbon portugal , the current holder of the six-month eu rotating presidency , is confident the final version of the treaty will be approved at the summit in lisbon before being ratified in all member states in 2008 and coming into force on jan .
1 , 2009 .
eu leaders want the treaty to come into force by the jan .
1 deadline so that public confidence in the european project is not undermined during elections to the european parliament that year .
the new treaty , the compromise text which replaces the much-maligned and doomed eu constitution , is seen as vital to streamlining the workings of a union which has expanded from 15 to 27 member states since 2004 . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" together with our partners france , england , america , russia and china , we 've searched for ways again and again to bring iran back to the negotiating table , " merkel told the web site of german daily die welt in response to a question on whether germany had become too dependent on us foreign policy .

" i strongly support finding a diplomatic solution , but we also need to be ready to impose further sanctions if iran does not budge .
it threatens israel 's security , which is non-negotiable for me as german chancellor .
it threatens the region , europe , and the world .
we have to prevent that . "

still basking in the afterglow of florian von donnersmarck 's " the lives of others " oscar triumph in february , germany could n't be prouder of its young directors suddenly swarming the dream factory .
young , gifted and cheap they certainly look like they 've started running with the big guys .
but they 're succeeding by going native and mainstream - what they 're not doing is adding any quintessentially german artistic vision to the hollywood mix .
instead , they 've learnt how to beat the americans at their own game .
taking their cues from germany 's only long-standing hollywood heavyweights , roland emmerich and wolfgang petersen , the new crop of directors is making solid commercial fare expertly pitched at the us market .
the appeal of german directors in hollywood is n't any unique artistic agenda , says andrea dittgen from the association of german film critics .
it 's purely practical .
" they 're hired because they 're cheaper than their american peers , " she said .
crucially , this latest generation - with the exception of hirschbiegel - is also very young , and can still be " steered . "
" they 're willing to work for less , because hollywood is where they want to be .
and these directors are very open-minded about giving the studios what they want , " she said .
hollywood getting its money 's worth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " premonition " is a classic psycho-thriller " premonition , " a supernatural thriller made by mennan yapo for sony , is a case in point .
the turkish-german director was snapped up by the entertainment capital on the strength of just one feature-length movie in germany , which was released in the us as " soundless . "
hollywood knew what it was doing .
garnering sandra bullock the highest-grossing opening weekend of her career , " premonition " ticks all the right hollywood boxes .
" when the studios hire germans they know they 're going to get more out of the budget , " said yapo .
" they 're punctual and they 're basically good workers who are very well trained . "
" german directors come highly skilled , " said german producer and visual effects supervisor volker engel , who won an oscar in 1997 for his work on " independence day . "
the movie , which still ranks among the top 10 all-time box-office smashes , was one of the first to prove that german directors - in this case , roland emmerich - were adept at delivering classic american blockbusters with maximum efficiency .
" they 're used to shooting fast , because german films are done with smaller budgets and have less shooting days than us productions , " he adds .
but mennan yapo feels a bit of european flair should n't be underestimated .
" hollywood also knows it 's going to get some edge from german directors , " he says .
" it 's basically an industry , and it 's aware that now and then , it needs fresh blood .
a couple of years ago the mexicans came along and brought in some new flavor .
now it 's the germans ' turn .
especially when they 're doing genre films , they deliver a different point of view on americana . "
taking the rough with the smooth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : emmerich can make disaster movies with the best of them even so , old-school " auteur " filmmakers are less likely to find themselves clasped to the tinseltown bosom .
like yapo , volker engel is aware that hollywood is always on the lookout for the new " it " people , but that an invitation to the party does come with strings attached .
" it can be difficult for a german director to do his first project here , because on the one hand they make you feel like the ' king ' , but on the other hand you 're spending their money .
so they will say : " hey , ' king , ' you can do whatever you want , but only as long as we 're happy with it . "
but this is n't necessarily a problem for german directors , who have a natural affinity for us-style movie-making .
" germany is very america-friendly , " said film critic andrea dittgen .
" most young directors grew up with us movies and they 're heavily influenced by them . "
germany 's part in the history of cinema in fact , the affinity is mutual .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the producer of " capote " was born in düsseldorf " there has been a long-standing tradition of german emigres working -lsb- in hollywood -rsb- , from the classical era to the present day , " explained german producer michael ohoven , whose movie " capote " was nominated as best motion picture of the year in 2005 .
he points out that germans have been instrumental in defining the hollywood cinema since its early days .
" the most skilled and influential directors from the golden age of hollywood were german , including fritz lang , f. w. murnau , billy wilder , ernst lubitsch , and douglas sirk , " he said .
" the stylistic tendencies of american film noir , which produced some of hollywood ’ s greatest titles of all time , are largely indebted to the german expressionist films of the 1920s . "
" perhaps because germany has a popular cinema with a strong genre sensibility , germans are uniquely suited to succeed within the hollywood system , " he added .
as mennan yapo observed , their sudden prominence in hollywood after decades of absence is basically an organic progression .
" let 's not forget that after the second world war , well up to the ' 70s , there were not many german directors anywhere at all , not even in germany , " he explains .
" no one who emigrated to the us during the nazi regime came back .
the years from ' 33 to ' 45 emptied germany artistically , so the country took a while to get back on track . "
but then it began gaining new artistic self-confidence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rainer werner fassbinder , a very european director " in the 1970s , werner herzog , rainer werner fassbinder and volker schlöndorff came along , " said yapo .
" initially , they leaned more towards the french directors and the new wave .
but then schlöndorff , for example , started making films in english , and they started leaning towards hollywood .
we began to see the fruits of all the film schools that had started up in the 60s and 70s . "
the next step , however , was to strike out for american shores .
and it still is .
" film still is n't an industry here , " says yapo .
" at some point , german directors have to make a decision about where they 're going to work , " said andrea dittgen .
" if they stay in germany , most of them will end up working for television , which ultimately spoils them for hollywood because they become unable to adapt .
whereas if they head to hollywood they 'll broaden their horizons , which is always a good thing .
and they do n't necessarily have to stay - they can always come back and use what they 've learned in germany . "
volker engel is similarly optimistic that germany does n't need to worry about a brain drain .

the bloc also agreed to send an eu security force to chad . after a meeting of the eu 's foreign ministers on monday , oct .
15 , a decision was made to broaden existing sanctions that include visa bans and asset freezes on myanmar 's military and government officials as well as their relatives , and new steps targeting the country 's key timber , metals and gemstone sectors .
" the eu deems it necessary to increase direct pressure on the regime , " the ministers said in a statement issued after talks in luxembourg .
" it will therefore adopt a package of measures that do not harm the general population but that target those responsible for the violent crackdown and the overall political stalemate in the country . "
eu sanctions on hold while mission planned bildunterschrift : tougher eu sanctions are a negotiation stick for the un envoy french foreign minister bernard kouchner told reporters the sanctions would not be immediately implemented .
kouchner added that the eu was also considering sending a mission to myanmar , formerly named burma , to hold talks with the military rulers on reconciliation with the country 's domestic political opponents .
eu external relations commission benita ferrero-walder said she backed a delay in the imposition of the additional sanctions to support the mission of un envoy to myanmar ibrahim gambarai .
" he is the only one who has a chance for leverage at the moment , " she said .
" i think he should have sticks and carrots in order to be able to work . "
she said the eu wanted to see the release of political prisoners and the start of a process of dialogue with opponents .
the foreign ministers also gave their final approval during the meeting to deploy a 3,000-strong eu peacekeeping force to help refugees and the displaced along darfur 's borders with chad and the central african republic .
mostly french peacekeeping force set for chad kouchner said that the eu force - around half of which would be made up of french troops - would be involved in improving security and making it easier for aid groups to do their work in the camps that border sudan 's darfur region .
" it is a reconstruction mission , a development mission and a humanitarian one , " the french foreign minister said .
he added that security needed to be assured for the refugees but the mission would not include action to secure the border areas .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the conflicts in the region have led to a refugee crisis united nations estimates show that almost 3 million people have been uprooted by conflicts in the region , including the fighting in darfur and unrelated rebellions in chad and the central african republic .
some 2.25 million former darfur residents are currently displaced within their own country .
the eu foreign ministers also appealed to northern and southern sudanese political factions to stick to a 2005 peace pact , fearing that a collapse of the delicate treaty in that unrelated sudanese conflict could lead to new civil war complicating international efforts to end the darfur crisis . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the bloc also agreed to send an eu security force to chad . after a meeting of the eu 's foreign ministers on monday , oct .
15 , a decision was made to broaden existing sanctions that include visa bans and asset freezes on myanmar 's military and government officials as well as their relatives , and new steps targeting the country 's key timber , metals and gemstone sectors .
" the eu deems it necessary to increase direct pressure on the regime , " the ministers said in a statement issued after talks in luxembourg .
" it will therefore adopt a package of measures that do not harm the general population but that target those responsible for the violent crackdown and the overall political stalemate in the country . "
eu sanctions on hold while mission planned bildunterschrift : tougher eu sanctions are a negotiation stick for the un envoy french foreign minister bernard kouchner told reporters the sanctions would not be immediately implemented .
kouchner added that the eu was also considering sending a mission to myanmar , formerly named burma , to hold talks with the military rulers on reconciliation with the country 's domestic political opponents .
eu external relations commission benita ferrero-walder said she backed a delay in the imposition of the additional sanctions to support the mission of un envoy to myanmar ibrahim gambarai .
" he is the only one who has a chance for leverage at the moment , " she said .
" i think he should have sticks and carrots in order to be able to work . "
she said the eu wanted to see the release of political prisoners and the start of a process of dialogue with opponents .
the foreign ministers also gave their final approval during the meeting to deploy a 3,000-strong eu peacekeeping force to help refugees and the displaced along darfur 's borders with chad and the central african republic .
mostly french peacekeeping force set for chad kouchner said that the eu force - around half of which would be made up of french troops - would be involved in improving security and making it easier for aid groups to do their work in the camps that border sudan 's darfur region .
" it is a reconstruction mission , a development mission and a humanitarian one , " the french foreign minister said .
he added that security needed to be assured for the refugees but the mission would not include action to secure the border areas .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the conflicts in the region have led to a refugee crisis united nations estimates show that almost 3 million people have been uprooted by conflicts in the region , including the fighting in darfur and unrelated rebellions in chad and the central african republic .
some 2.25 million former darfur residents are currently displaced within their own country .
the eu foreign ministers also appealed to northern and southern sudanese political factions to stick to a 2005 peace pact , fearing that a collapse of the delicate treaty in that unrelated sudanese conflict could lead to new civil war complicating international efforts to end the darfur crisis . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de film -pipe- 15.10.2007 german directors the new toast of hollywood großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mennan yapo , rubbing shoulders with sandra bullock in la with a spate of new hollywood movies boasting german directors , tinseltown 's latest love affair is with talent from germany .
but does the westwards exodus of film professionals mean the home-grown industry loses out ? hitting german cinema screens in october are " premonition " by mennan yapo , " trade " by marco kreuzpaintner and oliver hirschbiegel ’ s " the invasion , " a remake of the 1955 classic " the body snatchers , " starring nicole kidman .
us-backed projects by christian alvart , sandra nettelbeck , florian baxmeyer and joseph rusnak are still in the pipeline - and the list goes on .
still basking in the afterglow of florian von donnersmarck 's " the lives of others " oscar triumph in february , germany could n't be prouder of its young directors suddenly swarming the dream factory .
young , gifted and cheap they certainly look like they 've started running with the big guys .
but they 're succeeding by going native and mainstream - what they 're not doing is adding any quintessentially german artistic vision to the hollywood mix .
instead , they 've learnt how to beat the americans at their own game .
taking their cues from germany 's only long-standing hollywood heavyweights , roland emmerich and wolfgang petersen , the new crop of directors is making solid commercial fare expertly pitched at the us market .
the appeal of german directors in hollywood is n't any unique artistic agenda , says andrea dittgen from the association of german film critics .
it 's purely practical .
" they 're hired because they 're cheaper than their american peers , " she said .
crucially , this latest generation - with the exception of hirschbiegel - is also very young , and can still be " steered . "
" they 're willing to work for less , because hollywood is where they want to be .
and these directors are very open-minded about giving the studios what they want , " she said .
hollywood getting its money 's worth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " premonition " is a classic psycho-thriller " premonition , " a supernatural thriller made by mennan yapo for sony , is a case in point .
the turkish-german director was snapped up by the entertainment capital on the strength of just one feature-length movie in germany , which was released in the us as " soundless . "
hollywood knew what it was doing .
garnering sandra bullock the highest-grossing opening weekend of her career , " premonition " ticks all the right hollywood boxes .
" when the studios hire germans they know they 're going to get more out of the budget , " said yapo .
" they 're punctual and they 're basically good workers who are very well trained . "
" german directors come highly skilled , " said german producer and visual effects supervisor volker engel , who won an oscar in 1997 for his work on " independence day . "
the movie , which still ranks among the top 10 all-time box-office smashes , was one of the first to prove that german directors - in this case , roland emmerich - were adept at delivering classic american blockbusters with maximum efficiency .
" they 're used to shooting fast , because german films are done with smaller budgets and have less shooting days than us productions , " he adds .
but mennan yapo feels a bit of european flair should n't be underestimated .
" hollywood also knows it 's going to get some edge from german directors , " he says .
" it 's basically an industry , and it 's aware that now and then , it needs fresh blood .
a couple of years ago the mexicans came along and brought in some new flavor .
now it 's the germans ' turn .
especially when they 're doing genre films , they deliver a different point of view on americana . "
taking the rough with the smooth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : emmerich can make disaster movies with the best of them even so , old-school " auteur " filmmakers are less likely to find themselves clasped to the tinseltown bosom .
like yapo , volker engel is aware that hollywood is always on the lookout for the new " it " people , but that an invitation to the party does come with strings attached .
" it can be difficult for a german director to do his first project here , because on the one hand they make you feel like the ' king ' , but on the other hand you 're spending their money .
so they will say : " hey , ' king , ' you can do whatever you want , but only as long as we 're happy with it . "
but this is n't necessarily a problem for german directors , who have a natural affinity for us-style movie-making .
" germany is very america-friendly , " said film critic andrea dittgen .
" most young directors grew up with us movies and they 're heavily influenced by them . "
germany 's part in the history of cinema in fact , the affinity is mutual .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the producer of " capote " was born in düsseldorf " there has been a long-standing tradition of german emigres working -lsb- in hollywood -rsb- , from the classical era to the present day , " explained german producer michael ohoven , whose movie " capote " was nominated as best motion picture of the year in 2005 .
he points out that germans have been instrumental in defining the hollywood cinema since its early days .
" the most skilled and influential directors from the golden age of hollywood were german , including fritz lang , f. w. murnau , billy wilder , ernst lubitsch , and douglas sirk , " he said .
" the stylistic tendencies of american film noir , which produced some of hollywood ’ s greatest titles of all time , are largely indebted to the german expressionist films of the 1920s . "
" perhaps because germany has a popular cinema with a strong genre sensibility , germans are uniquely suited to succeed within the hollywood system , " he added .
as mennan yapo observed , their sudden prominence in hollywood after decades of absence is basically an organic progression .
" let 's not forget that after the second world war , well up to the ' 70s , there were not many german directors anywhere at all , not even in germany , " he explains .
" no one who emigrated to the us during the nazi regime came back .
the years from ' 33 to ' 45 emptied germany artistically , so the country took a while to get back on track . "
but then it began gaining new artistic self-confidence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rainer werner fassbinder , a very european director " in the 1970s , werner herzog , rainer werner fassbinder and volker schlöndorff came along , " said yapo .
" initially , they leaned more towards the french directors and the new wave .
but then schlöndorff , for example , started making films in english , and they started leaning towards hollywood .
we began to see the fruits of all the film schools that had started up in the 60s and 70s . "
the next step , however , was to strike out for american shores .
and it still is .
" film still is n't an industry here , " says yapo .
" at some point , german directors have to make a decision about where they 're going to work , " said andrea dittgen .
" if they stay in germany , most of them will end up working for television , which ultimately spoils them for hollywood because they become unable to adapt .
whereas if they head to hollywood they 'll broaden their horizons , which is always a good thing .
and they do n't necessarily have to stay - they can always come back and use what they 've learned in germany . "
volker engel is similarly optimistic that germany does n't need to worry about a brain drain .
" i see a future for more german directors making movies both in hollywood and in germany , and moving back and forth between two very different worlds , " he said . jane paulick send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

however , one firm may have put both at risk in an unprecedented crackdown of diarrhea sufferers . germany continues to debate whether increased numbers of security cameras will help reduce the risk of terror attacks .
the german interior ministry is particularly keen on rolling out more surveillance systems and while there is a certain amount of concern among civil liberty groups and a percentage of the population , many germans equate more security with more protection and seem to have few problems with the idea .
one section of the population who may start to have a problem with more cctv is the nation 's bus drivers .
while a strategically placed camera may be used to identify a person of specific threat from ending hundreds of people 's lives , a single device can also be used to ruin just one person 's life and put his career on the skids .
stomach cramps lead to employment pain this is exactly what happened to german bus driver jochen lorenz .
the 58-year-old driver from the central town of ilmenau - with no known affiliations with any terrorist group - was sacked after being spotted taking a roll of toilet paper from the bus depot lavatory .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some thought the security measures went too far lorenz had arrived at work for his shift at 5:30 a.m. , feeling a little under the weather with stomach cramps .
he made an emergency visit to the loo shortly before taking his seat at the helm of his bus and , fearing he may be caught short on the route , took a roll from the cubicle just in case .
" i was feeling ill when i arrived at the bus depot .
stomach problems , " lorenz told the bild zeitung newspaper .
" so i went to the lavatory .
things did n't get better so i took a roll of toilet paper and put it in the bus .
i wanted to have some during the drive in case of an emergency . "
bus driver unaware of strict paper controls the eye-in-the-sky , however , did not look favorably on this .
the surveillance cameras had been installed by the powers that be to monitor strict control of toilet paper usage , among other things .
this fact , unbeknownst to lorenz at the time , was made glaringly and painfully obvious when he received his marching orders .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans showed their solidarity for the sacked driver the letter of dismissal stated that the quantity of toilet paper was strictly monitored and that a fresh roll of paper had disappeared .
“ after the surveillance data was analyzed , it was found that you , herr lorenz , were the only user to use the facilities , at 05:49 hours , " the letter from the bus company said .
lorenz protested against the sacking and told his boss that the roll was still in the bus , but to no avail .
so lorenz took the company to court and managed to secure a pay-off settlement totaling € 7,500 -lrb- $ 10,625 -rrb- . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the bloc also agreed to send an eu security force to chad . after a meeting of the eu 's foreign ministers on monday , oct .
15 , a decision was made to broaden existing sanctions that include visa bans and asset freezes on myanmar 's military and government officials as well as their relatives , and new steps targeting the country 's key timber , metals and gemstone sectors .
" the eu deems it necessary to increase direct pressure on the regime , " the ministers said in a statement issued after talks in luxembourg .
" it will therefore adopt a package of measures that do not harm the general population but that target those responsible for the violent crackdown and the overall political stalemate in the country . "
eu sanctions on hold while mission planned bildunterschrift : tougher eu sanctions are a negotiation stick for the un envoy french foreign minister bernard kouchner told reporters the sanctions would not be immediately implemented .
kouchner added that the eu was also considering sending a mission to myanmar , formerly named burma , to hold talks with the military rulers on reconciliation with the country 's domestic political opponents .
eu external relations commission benita ferrero-walder said she backed a delay in the imposition of the additional sanctions to support the mission of un envoy to myanmar ibrahim gambarai .
" he is the only one who has a chance for leverage at the moment , " she said .
" i think he should have sticks and carrots in order to be able to work . "
she said the eu wanted to see the release of political prisoners and the start of a process of dialogue with opponents .
the foreign ministers also gave their final approval during the meeting to deploy a 3,000-strong eu peacekeeping force to help refugees and the displaced along darfur 's borders with chad and the central african republic .
mostly french peacekeeping force set for chad kouchner said that the eu force - around half of which would be made up of french troops - would be involved in improving security and making it easier for aid groups to do their work in the camps that border sudan 's darfur region .
" it is a reconstruction mission , a development mission and a humanitarian one , " the french foreign minister said .
he added that security needed to be assured for the refugees but the mission would not include action to secure the border areas .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the conflicts in the region have led to a refugee crisis united nations estimates show that almost 3 million people have been uprooted by conflicts in the region , including the fighting in darfur and unrelated rebellions in chad and the central african republic .
some 2.25 million former darfur residents are currently displaced within their own country .
the eu foreign ministers also appealed to northern and southern sudanese political factions to stick to a 2005 peace pact , fearing that a collapse of the delicate treaty in that unrelated sudanese conflict could lead to new civil war complicating international efforts to end the darfur crisis . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but they 're succeeding by going native and mainstream - what they 're not doing is adding any quintessentially german artistic vision to the hollywood mix .
instead , they 've learnt how to beat the americans at their own game .
taking their cues from germany 's only long-standing hollywood heavyweights , roland emmerich and wolfgang petersen , the new crop of directors is making solid commercial fare expertly pitched at the us market .
the appeal of german directors in hollywood is n't any unique artistic agenda , says andrea dittgen from the association of german film critics .
it 's purely practical .
" they 're hired because they 're cheaper than their american peers , " she said .
crucially , this latest generation - with the exception of hirschbiegel - is also very young , and can still be " steered . "
" they 're willing to work for less , because hollywood is where they want to be .
and these directors are very open-minded about giving the studios what they want , " she said .
hollywood getting its money 's worth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " premonition " is a classic psycho-thriller " premonition , " a supernatural thriller made by mennan yapo for sony , is a case in point .
the turkish-german director was snapped up by the entertainment capital on the strength of just one feature-length movie in germany , which was released in the us as " soundless . "
hollywood knew what it was doing .
garnering sandra bullock the highest-grossing opening weekend of her career , " premonition " ticks all the right hollywood boxes .
" when the studios hire germans they know they 're going to get more out of the budget , " said yapo .
" they 're punctual and they 're basically good workers who are very well trained . "
" german directors come highly skilled , " said german producer and visual effects supervisor volker engel , who won an oscar in 1997 for his work on " independence day . "
the movie , which still ranks among the top 10 all-time box-office smashes , was one of the first to prove that german directors - in this case , roland emmerich - were adept at delivering classic american blockbusters with maximum efficiency .
" they 're used to shooting fast , because german films are done with smaller budgets and have less shooting days than us productions , " he adds .
but mennan yapo feels a bit of european flair should n't be underestimated .
" hollywood also knows it 's going to get some edge from german directors , " he says .
" it 's basically an industry , and it 's aware that now and then , it needs fresh blood .
a couple of years ago the mexicans came along and brought in some new flavor .
now it 's the germans ' turn .
especially when they 're doing genre films , they deliver a different point of view on americana . "
taking the rough with the smooth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : emmerich can make disaster movies with the best of them even so , old-school " auteur " filmmakers are less likely to find themselves clasped to the tinseltown bosom .
like yapo , volker engel is aware that hollywood is always on the lookout for the new " it " people , but that an invitation to the party does come with strings attached .
" it can be difficult for a german director to do his first project here , because on the one hand they make you feel like the ' king ' , but on the other hand you 're spending their money .
so they will say : " hey , ' king , ' you can do whatever you want , but only as long as we 're happy with it . "
but this is n't necessarily a problem for german directors , who have a natural affinity for us-style movie-making .
" germany is very america-friendly , " said film critic andrea dittgen .
" most young directors grew up with us movies and they 're heavily influenced by them . "
germany 's part in the history of cinema in fact , the affinity is mutual .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the producer of " capote " was born in düsseldorf " there has been a long-standing tradition of german emigres working -lsb- in hollywood -rsb- , from the classical era to the present day , " explained german producer michael ohoven , whose movie " capote " was nominated as best motion picture of the year in 2005 .
he points out that germans have been instrumental in defining the hollywood cinema since its early days .
" the most skilled and influential directors from the golden age of hollywood were german , including fritz lang , f. w. murnau , billy wilder , ernst lubitsch , and douglas sirk , " he said .
" the stylistic tendencies of american film noir , which produced some of hollywood ’ s greatest titles of all time , are largely indebted to the german expressionist films of the 1920s . "
" perhaps because germany has a popular cinema with a strong genre sensibility , germans are uniquely suited to succeed within the hollywood system , " he added .
as mennan yapo observed , their sudden prominence in hollywood after decades of absence is basically an organic progression .
" let 's not forget that after the second world war , well up to the ' 70s , there were not many german directors anywhere at all , not even in germany , " he explains .
" no one who emigrated to the us during the nazi regime came back .
the years from ' 33 to ' 45 emptied germany artistically , so the country took a while to get back on track . "
but then it began gaining new artistic self-confidence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rainer werner fassbinder , a very european director " in the 1970s , werner herzog , rainer werner fassbinder and volker schlöndorff came along , " said yapo .
" initially , they leaned more towards the french directors and the new wave .
but then schlöndorff , for example , started making films in english , and they started leaning towards hollywood .
we began to see the fruits of all the film schools that had started up in the 60s and 70s . "
the next step , however , was to strike out for american shores .
and it still is .
" film still is n't an industry here , " says yapo .
" at some point , german directors have to make a decision about where they 're going to work , " said andrea dittgen .
" if they stay in germany , most of them will end up working for television , which ultimately spoils them for hollywood because they become unable to adapt .
whereas if they head to hollywood they 'll broaden their horizons , which is always a good thing .
and they do n't necessarily have to stay - they can always come back and use what they 've learned in germany . "
volker engel is similarly optimistic that germany does n't need to worry about a brain drain .
" i see a future for more german directors making movies both in hollywood and in germany , and moving back and forth between two very different worlds , " he said . jane paulick send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

15 , germany 's chancellor said that the international community needs to be ready to impose further sanctions on tehran should leaders there refuse to cooperate in the nuclear row . speaking ahead of monday 's meeting with russian president vladimir putin in the central german town of wiesbaden , merkel said that the international community continued to worry about the iranian nuclear crisis as tehran had ignored binding resolutions by the un security council and demands of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- .
" together with our partners france , england , america , russia and china , we 've searched for ways again and again to bring iran back to the negotiating table , " merkel told the web site of german daily die welt in response to a question on whether germany had become too dependent on us foreign policy .
" since iran did n't accept - even though we made constructive offers - and since it still does n't fulfill the demands of the international community , we had to choose the path of sanctions in the un security council , " the chancellor said , adding that china and russia supported the sanctions " we can not close our eyes to the dangers , " she said .
" i strongly support finding a diplomatic solution , but we also need to be ready to impose further sanctions if iran does not budge .
it threatens israel 's security , which is non-negotiable for me as german chancellor .
it threatens the region , europe , and the world .
we have to prevent that . "

15 , although merkel warned of further sanctions . the russian leader , who leaves office in the spring after completing two terms , drew a parallel between iran 's contentious uranium enrichment program and north korea 's nuclear weapons program . " remember , only recently we just as emotionally discussed the north korean nuclear program , and now we are seeing positive moves on the korean peninsula , " putin said , adding that patience and continued negotiations would be keys to a breakthrough with tehran .
" we can and must be patient and look for a way out .
can we do it without having a dialogue with the iranian leadership and people ?
i think that 's impossible . "
merkel warned that if tehran did not comply with demands for transparency on its nuclear program " a new round of sanctions must be initiated . "
the chancellor nevertheless made clear germany , like russia , was banking on a negotiated end to the impasse .
bilateral relations , trade good bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin took questions on his and russia 's political future on the topic of bilateral relations , both leaders said cooperation in internal and external security was good .
they noted rapidly growing trade , which rose 38 percent last year to a total of 53 billion euros -lrb- $ 75 billion -rrb- .
russia provides around a third of germany 's crude oil and gas needs and the trade balance is in its favor by close to 6 billion euros .
putin said the two economies complemented each other , with russia providing reliable energy resources and opportunities for german business in technology and construction .
merkel also announced that the two countries hoped to build the nord stream trans-baltic gas pipeline and were keen to allay the concerns of transit states over the project . nord stream goes ahead , assures merkel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nord stream pipeline will be completed on time , the leaders said " where there are problems implementing it economically , we can help - if political talks help , " the project is politically desired .
" if investment conditions need clearing up , that must ensue at a company level . "
the pipeline - a project run by a consortium consisting of russia 's gas export monopoly gazprom and germany 's basf and e.on - will run from russia to germany under the baltic sea .
some countries through which the pipeline will run have raised concerns about the environmental safety aspects .
" we see no need to act at the moment , so i can only say that in my view the project will go ahead , " merkel said .
" as far as germany is concerned , we want to see this project completed and economically implemented , " she added .
russians willing to meet transit states in debate russian energy minister viktor khristenko told reporters at a separate meeting that berlin and moscow would continue to hold discussions with the transit states . " the project is going according to plan , but there is a situation where questions about the route need to be discussed with baltic sea littoral states , " he said .
" we are in a position to ensure a high level of environmental security on the route of this pipeline . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters demanded answers in the case of murdered russian journalist politkovskaya putin took the opportunity of his visit to germany to reiterate his plan to visit iran after it an alleged assassination plot had been uncovered .
" of course i 'm going to iran , " he said in response to a question .
putin also fielded awkward questions about the ongoing probe into the murder a year ago of journalist anna politkovskaya .
the president said investigations were entering the final stage and the outstanding issue was to find who was behind the killing .
asked about his political future , putin pledged that the russian constitution , which allows only two consecutive presidential terms , would be implemented in letter and spirit , but this did not mean that he could not continue to be politically active .
putin 's recent suggestion that he could become prime minister , has raised concerns that he could be seeking to undermine russia 's democratic institutions . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it is part of a bbc wales reality series and will see the men and boys work at the blaentillery drift mine - the last working mine of its kind .
while the women will remain in tiny miners ' cottages in blaenavon during the day looking after the children .
coal house will be broadcast from next monday .
all three families will have their work cut out during their month-long stay .
the men and boys over 14 will face long walks to work over mountainous terrain in all weather , before a long day at the drift mine .
back home the women will have to keep the children fed , watered and clean without the benefit of supermarkets , washing machines , ready meals or cars .
more than 150 families applied for the series and 12 of them were tested on initiative , stamina and team-working as well as undergoing psychological tests to find out how they might cope with the stresses of life in the cottages .
the three families who triumphed are welcoming the challenge of downsizing to the extreme .
they include a university professor , a coal merchant , builder , carpenter , and a lorry driver .
joe and annabel cartwright , from penarth in the vale of glamorgan , a professor and astrophysicist , say they are excited about stepping into history rather than just looking at it .
daughters gwen and kitty , who are 12 and 11 , say they will miss their west highland terrier bertie , as well as social networking websites bebo and msn .
debra griffiths , from cardigan , will celebrate her 40th birthday there with husband cerdin , 46 , and children steffan , 13 , angharad , 12 and gethin , eight .
the griffiths are the only welsh-speaking family taking part .
they say they find they do not communicate as much as they would like , and they want to use this opportunity to spend quality time together as a family - a common theme among the coal house families .
the third family taking part are the phillipses from cowbridge , and with six children of whom the youngest are still both in nappies , stephanie thinks she will miss her washing machine most .
both stephanie and husband richie , 33 , whose great-grandfather was killed in a mining disaster , say they would do anything to escape from listening to modern celebrity gossip .
bbc wales executive producer martyn ingram said : " when these adventurous families enter the cottages they will effectively enter a time-travel bubble , going back in time and stepping into a real life history - and the real beauty of it is that the rest of the country can share their experiences through television , radio and online . "
coal house will air three evenings a week - mondays , wednesdays and fridays - on bbc one wales and on bbc two , beginning 22 october .

it is part of a bbc wales reality series and will see the men and boys work at the blaentillery drift mine - the last working mine of its kind .
while the women will remain in tiny miners ' cottages in blaenavon during the day looking after the children .
coal house will be broadcast from next monday .
all three families will have their work cut out during their month-long stay .
the men and boys over 14 will face long walks to work over mountainous terrain in all weather , before a long day at the drift mine .
back home the women will have to keep the children fed , watered and clean without the benefit of supermarkets , washing machines , ready meals or cars .
more than 150 families applied for the series and 12 of them were tested on initiative , stamina and team-working as well as undergoing psychological tests to find out how they might cope with the stresses of life in the cottages .
the three families who triumphed are welcoming the challenge of downsizing to the extreme .
they include a university professor , a coal merchant , builder , carpenter , and a lorry driver .
the griffiths are the only welsh-speaking family joe and annabel cartwright , from penarth in the vale of glamorgan , a professor and astrophysicist , say they are excited about stepping into history rather than just looking at it .
daughters gwen and kitty , who are 12 and 11 , say they will miss their west highland terrier bertie , as well as social networking websites bebo and msn .
debra griffiths , from cardigan , will celebrate her 40th birthday there with husband cerdin , 46 , and children steffan , 13 , angharad , 12 and gethin , eight .
the griffiths are the only welsh-speaking family taking part .
they say they find they do not communicate as much as they would like , and they want to use this opportunity to spend quality time together as a family - a common theme among the coal house families .
washing for six children will be a worry for stephanie phillips the third family taking part are the phillipses from cowbridge , and with six children of whom the youngest are still both in nappies , stephanie thinks she will miss her washing machine most .
both stephanie and husband richie , 33 , whose great-grandfather was killed in a mining disaster , say they would do anything to escape from listening to modern celebrity gossip .
bbc wales executive producer martyn ingram said : " when these adventurous families enter the cottages they will effectively enter a time-travel bubble , going back in time and stepping into a real life history - and the real beauty of it is that the rest of the country can share their experiences through television , radio and online . "
coal house will air three evenings a week - mondays , wednesdays and fridays - on bbc one wales and on bbc two , beginning 22 october .

mps are being asked to sign a petition in the shape of a giant running shoe , representing the estimated 140,000 under-18s who go missing each year .
specialists are to give evidence at a series of parliamentary hearings to highlight the problems runaways face .
the children 's society said it should be recognised that a teenager facing a night on the streets was a high risk .
kathy evans , policy director at the children 's society , said some local services were in place but it was nowhere near a national safety net .
when you run away , it 's hard to trust people jessica lee , former runaway she told bbc breakfast there needed to be local services , a national helpline and a look at the way police respond when a child is reported missing and what happens when they are found .
jessica lee , who ran away from home at 13 , told the programme she did not know who to turn to for help .
" things were really difficult at home so i ran away , " she said .
for three months , she stayed with her dad who she met for the first time , friends , sometimes strangers and even spent one night on the street before she found help .
" it got to the point where it became an addiction to me , " she said .
" for me , social services , and anyone in authority , was the enemy .

' life-saver service ' paul tuohy , chief executive of missing people , said the issue of missing people often slipped through the cracks and off the public agenda .
" the national infrastructure to safeguard runaways and missing children at the moment is , in actual fact , fairly small , which might come as a surprise to most people , " he said .
in some cases , things were so bad for these children that it led to fatalities , he said .

specialists are to give evidence at a series of parliamentary hearings to highlight the problems runaways face .
the children 's society said it should be recognised that a teenager facing a night on the streets was a high risk .
kathy evans , policy director at the children 's society , said some local services were in place but it was nowhere near a national safety net .
when you run away , it 's hard to trust people jessica lee , former runaway she told bbc breakfast there needed to be local services , a national helpline and a look at the way police respond when a child is reported missing and what happens when they are found .
jessica lee , who ran away from home at 13 , told the programme she did not know who to turn to for help .
" things were really difficult at home so i ran away , " she said .
for three months , she stayed with her dad who she met for the first time , friends , sometimes strangers and even spent one night on the street before she found help .
" it got to the point where it became an addiction to me , " she said .
" for me , social services , and anyone in authority , was the enemy .
but i found out about a children 's society project in devon .
they built the trust up with me .
when you run away , it 's hard to trust people . "
' life-saver service ' paul tuohy , chief executive of missing people , said the issue of missing people often slipped through the cracks and off the public agenda .
" the national infrastructure to safeguard runaways and missing children at the moment is , in actual fact , fairly small , which might come as a surprise to most people , " he said .
in some cases , things were so bad for these children that it led to fatalities , he said .
" we 've really got to put it in front of the public agenda for our mps ... that the runaway helpline , the national service we offer , is actually a life-saver service . "

they give mr veltroni , 52 , nearly 75 % of the votes in sunday 's election .
the party was born after a merger of the democrats of the left and the margherita -lrb- daisy -rrb- party .
the pd 's supporters hope it can boost the flagging fortunes of prime minister romano prodi 's centre-left coalition .
he is expected to quit politics in 2011 .
the pd also aims to become italy 's largest political grouping , overtaking the right-wing forza italia of former prime minister and now opposition leader silvio berlusconi .
' unprecedented choice ' exit polls give mr veltroni 's closest rival , families minister rosy bindi , only about 14 % of the vote .
enrico letta , undersecretary in mr prodi 's office , was third with some 11 % , while two other contenders won less than 1 % .
about three million centre-left supporters took part in the poll .
casting his vote , mr veltroni said : " it 's a fantastic day for italian democracy .
we have in these primaries chosen to create a new party - a choice absolutely unique and unprecedented in european politics . "
if confirmed , the margin of mr veltroni 's victory would make him the prime candidate to replace mr prodi .
mr prodi has been pushing for the creation of the pd , in a plan to simplify italian politics and stabilise his disparate centre-left coalition .
the pd 's founding congress is due to be held on 27 october .

kent county council 's -lrb- kcc -rrb- paul carter made the comment ahead of a meeting with health trust officials to discuss the clostridium difficile outbreak .
but kent air ambulance said it had now resumed flights to maidstone hospital four days after they were suspended .
a healthcare commission report said 90 people died due to infection outbreaks .
the health trust - which runs maidstone hospital , the kent and sussex hospital and pembury hospital - came under fire on thursday when a " litany " of errors was cited in its handling of c.difficile between 2004 and 2006 .
crisis ' support ' a public meeting of kcc 's cabinet on monday morning was due to be attended by glenn douglas , the interim trust chief executive , and steve phoenix , chief executive of the west kent primary care trust .
mr carter said the report into the c.difficile deaths made " appalling reading " .
and he said he felt the scandal would make recruiting nurses more difficult .
" i think it 's now a case of everybody delivering public services pulling together to help and support when a crisis occurs . "
he said he wanted to see the health trust chair and board quitting , " an injection of additional public money " from health secretary alan johnson , and monthly inspection visits " to make sure the right disciplines and regimes are instilled very quickly " .
" i personally believe the existing board and chairman should resign , " he said .
mr carter has also made an offer of " significant management experience " from the county council to support the recovery of the maidstone and tunbridge wells nhs trust .
kent air ambulance trust boycotted maidstone hospital on the day of the report , saying it was " deeply concerned " .
it said on monday it had now received a personal assurance from candy morris , chief executive of south east coast strategic health authority , that it was safe to take patients to maidstone .
the kent and sussex and pembury hospitals do not have helipads .

the infection often goes undiagnosed because there are few obvious symptoms , but is known to cause infertility in women if untreated .
spanish researchers found it can damage sperm quality .
the study , of 143 men , was presented at an american society for reproductive medicine conference . "
chlamydia is getting out of control " allan pacey british fertility society a team from canalejo university hospital in la coruna examined sperm from men infected with chlamydia and another urinary tract infection who had failed to father a child .
using a new microscopic analysis technique , they found the level of damage - or dna fragmentation - in their sperm was more than three times higher than in healthy men .
the concentration of their sperm , and its ability to swim quickly were also poor , and there were increased levels of defects in shape .
the researchers treated 95 of the infertile men with antibiotics and found their dna sperm damage improved an average of 36 % after four months .
during that period , 13 % of the couples got pregnant and , after the treatment was finished , 86 % got pregnant .
growing problem rates of chlamydia have risen sharply in the uk in recent years .
research suggests that as many as one in 10 people aged 18 to 25 carry the bacteria which cause the infection .
the nhs has launched a screening programme to try to counter the threat , but there are concerns that too few young people take the problem seriously .
dr allan pacey , senior lecturer in andrology at the university of sheffield and secretary of the british fertility society , said more needed to be done to target the younger generation .
he said : " the message is that we might think of chlamydia as a disease that damages female fertility , but we need to think again .
" it does damage female fertility , but it appears to damage male fertility too .
" chlamydia is getting out of control .
we have got to encourage men as well as women to go for screening , but men are more reluctant to do this if they do n't have symptoms .
" it is the 18 to 25 age group that is of most concern .
there should be a page on facebook you can log onto and sort screening out . "
dr pacey said in severe cases chlamydia could cause swelling of the testicles , and the epididymis , the tightly coiled tube which forms a key part of the male reproductive system .
" if you have that you will clearly know about it , you will be complaining quite severely , but in most men it is just a low-level , grumbling disease that does not present them with a great deal of problems .
" that means they do not present for screening , and do not get the treatment that they need . "

the infection often goes undiagnosed because there are few obvious symptoms , but is known to cause infertility in women if untreated .
spanish researchers found it can damage sperm quality .
the study , of 143 men , was presented at an american society for reproductive medicine conference .
chlamydia is getting out of control allan pacey british fertility society a team from canalejo university hospital in la coruna examined sperm from men infected with chlamydia and another urinary tract infection who had failed to father a child .
using a new microscopic analysis technique , they found the level of damage - or dna fragmentation - in their sperm was more than three times higher than in healthy men .
the concentration of their sperm , and its ability to swim quickly were also poor , and there were increased levels of defects in shape .
the researchers treated 95 of the infertile men with antibiotics and found their dna sperm damage improved an average of 36 % after four months .
during that period , 13 % of the couples got pregnant and , after the treatment was finished , 86 % got pregnant .
growing problem rates of chlamydia have risen sharply in the uk in recent years .
research suggests that as many as one in 10 people aged 18 to 25 carry the bacteria which cause the infection .
the nhs has launched a screening programme to try to counter the threat , but there are concerns that too few young people take the problem seriously .
dr allan pacey , senior lecturer in andrology at the university of sheffield and secretary of the british fertility society , said more needed to be done to target the younger generation .
he said : " the message is that we might think of chlamydia as a disease that damages female fertility , but we need to think again .
" it does damage female fertility , but it appears to damage male fertility too .
" chlamydia is getting out of control .
we have got to encourage men as well as women to go for screening , but men are more reluctant to do this if they do n't have symptoms .
" it is the 18 to 25 age group that is of most concern .

" if i am still functioning and working well , it is very likely i would be asked to do it , " he told reuters .
sir ian played the role in the lord of the rings trilogy , landing an oscar nomination in the process .
due to a legal dispute with film studio new line , however , peter jackson will not be back as director for the hobbit . "
i would be disappointed if they did n't want to have the original gandalf " sir ian mckellen " when peter announced he had withdrawn from the hobbit , he sent me an email saying : ' because i am not going to do it , it does n't mean you have to do the same , " ' mckellen is quoted as saying .
" ' of course , you must play gandalf whether i direct or not . " '
" i am glad to read that it is looking more and more likely , " the 68-year-old continued .
fantasy prequel " i would be disappointed if they did n't want to have the original gandalf . "
the hobbit , which tolkien wrote before the rings books , tells how bilbo baggins finds a supernatural ring - which is passed on to his nephew , frodo , in lord of the rings .
jackson has been ruled out of directing the film adaptation due to a dispute about income from the first rings film , the fellowship of the ring .
it is not yet known who will take his place or when filming will commence .
sir ian is currently in los angeles playing the title role in the royal shakespeare company 's production of king lear .
the veteran actor said playing the part was extremely taxing " spiritually and emotionally and mentally " .

the action was taken despite a deal aimed at ending their long-running dispute over shift patterns .
at a meeting at aintree racecourse on friday , 800 merseyside staff voted to reject proposals to return to work .
a meeting will take place later and , if staff agree to the new deal , they could return to work straight away .
leaders of the communication workers union -lrb- cwu -rrb- will meet later to discuss a proposed agreement aimed at resolving the bitter national row over pay , jobs and pensions .
' negotiate flexibility ' in liverpool , cwu branch secretary mark walsh said if local workers agreed with the national deal there would be a return to work on monday afternoon .
" it is in the hands of the management to be reasonable , " said mr walsh .
" we need safeguards around the ability to negotiate later starts and not have them imposed .
" we believe we can negotiate flexibility rather than have draconian implementations . "
the liverpool postal workers took unofficial action last week after being told that their shift times were changing .
the royal mail obtained a high court injunction on friday to prevent strikes going ahead on monday and tuesday .
a royal mail spokesman said 99 % of the company 's workforce were working normally on monday .

the scientists are studying sediments from the sea bed in the fabled northwest passage .
these muds may cast valuable historical light on why some famous expeditions to the region were successful while others were doomed to failure .
the research could also guide computer forecasts of future climate .
the reasoning is that , as with tree rings and coral growth , the thin layers of sediment which build up on the ocean floor act a storehouse of information about the patterns of past conditions .
the plymouth work is being conducted from the canadian coast guard ship , the amundsen .
microscopic clues in bitterly cold weather , professor simon belt , dr guillaume masse and colleagues are using a box-core - a large metal scoop - to extract the upper layers of mud from the ocean floor . "
significantly , periods of sea ice cover frequently coincide with dramatic changes to human populations due to famines and illnesses " dr guillaume masse , university of plymouth the sediments are then divided into slices - each slice representing about 15 years ' accumulation .
the presence in the mud of a particular kind of lipid - an oil - released by microscopic forms of algae indicates how much ice was present each arctic spring .
the more of the lipid is found , the more algae there was , and therefore the more sea-ice there may have been in any given period .
the amundsen is on a science cruise in the arctic diary : northwest passage ice melt raises tension ice data ' shatters record ' professor belt says the technique should allow a sea-ice record to be generated stretching back hundreds of years - certainly far further back than the 20-30 years of satellite data so far gathered .
" the satellites show the sea ice retreat in summertime from 1979 , but before then there 's virtually no record at all .
we believe this lipid acts as a fingerprint for past sea ice , " he told bbc news .
" the indications are that the natural cycles of change over the past have been very rapid - but the likelihood is that we 're now seeing the effects of manmade warming on top of that . "
remarkable resolution the team 's research into sediments off the coast of iceland has provided a very accurate match with recorded historical accounts of the sea ice there over the past millennium .
now the aim is to provide a similar insight into the advance and retreat of the ice in the canadian arctic .
this year 's study builds on earlier work in the northwest passage two years ago .
dr masse said : " our method for historical sea ice determination not only shows remarkable agreement with known historical events , but it has allowed us to provide some information for periods where records are scarce or absent .
" significantly , periods of sea ice cover frequently coincide with dramatic changes to human populations due to famines and illnesses . "
this work holds out the possibility of identifying ice conditions in particular years - for example in 1845 when the royal navy despatched sir john franklin on his famous expedition to find the northwest passage - a clear route from the atlantic to the pacific via the arctic .
it was one of the largest imperial ventures of its kind , but ended with the loss of all 129 men , the expedition 's two warships becoming locked in the ice for two years running .

the scientists are studying sediments from the sea bed in the fabled northwest passage .
these muds may cast valuable historical light on why some famous expeditions to the region were successful while others were doomed to failure .
the research could also guide computer forecasts of future climate .
the reasoning is that , as with tree rings and coral growth , the thin layers of sediment which build up on the ocean floor act a storehouse of information about the patterns of past conditions .
the plymouth work is being conducted from the canadian coast guard ship , the amundsen .
microscopic clues in bitterly cold weather , professor simon belt , dr guillaume masse and colleagues are using a box-core - a large metal scoop - to extract the upper layers of mud from the ocean floor .
significantly , periods of sea ice cover frequently coincide with dramatic changes to human populations due to famines and illnesses dr guillaume masse , university of plymouth the sediments are then divided into slices - each slice representing about 15 years ' accumulation .
the presence in the mud of a particular kind of lipid - an oil - released by microscopic forms of algae indicates how much ice was present each arctic spring .
the more of the lipid is found , the more algae there was , and therefore the more sea-ice there may have been in any given period .
the amundsen is on a science cruise in the arctic diary : northwest passage ice melt raises tension ice data ' shatters record ' professor belt says the technique should allow a sea-ice record to be generated stretching back hundreds of years - certainly far further back than the 20-30 years of satellite data so far gathered .
" the satellites show the sea ice retreat in summertime from 1979 , but before then there 's virtually no record at all .
we believe this lipid acts as a fingerprint for past sea ice , " he told bbc news .
" the indications are that the natural cycles of change over the past have been very rapid - but the likelihood is that we 're now seeing the effects of manmade warming on top of that . "
remarkable resolution the team 's research into sediments off the coast of iceland has provided a very accurate match with recorded historical accounts of the sea ice there over the past millennium .
now the aim is to provide a similar insight into the advance and retreat of the ice in the canadian arctic .
the mud provides a " proxy " for past climate - just like tree rings this year 's study builds on earlier work in the northwest passage two years ago .
dr masse said : " our method for historical sea ice determination not only shows remarkable agreement with known historical events , but it has allowed us to provide some information for periods where records are scarce or absent .
" significantly , periods of sea ice cover frequently coincide with dramatic changes to human populations due to famines and illnesses . "
this work holds out the possibility of identifying ice conditions in particular years - for example in 1845 when the royal navy despatched sir john franklin on his famous expedition to find the northwest passage - a clear route from the atlantic to the pacific via the arctic .
it was one of the largest imperial ventures of its kind , but ended with the loss of all 129 men , the expedition 's two warships becoming locked in the ice for two years running .
