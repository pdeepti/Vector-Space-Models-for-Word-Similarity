it 's no secret that both the catholic and protestant churches in germany have long faced the problem of shrinking congregations , but has the nation irrevocably turned its back on its religious heritage ? in the past six decades , the number of german citizens belonging to one of the country 's two main churches has fallen from 94.4 to just shy of 62 percent .
and although the trend has slowed , there is no indication of a reversal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many young germans are alienated from religion carsten frerk who runs fowid , a research group on belief systems in germany , says the church has lost its power and , perhaps more crucially , it has lost the nation 's youth . " children in germany are no longer born into a religion in the way they used to be , " frerk said .
" young people are not forced into a religious culture anymore . " the younger generations have too many choices at their disposal and this is what keeps them away from making binding ideological decisions .
according to frerk , the rate at which young people break away from religious groups will soon put non-denominational germans in the majority . " one percent of christians are leaving the church every year , " he said .
" so in 20 years from now , they 'll be the minority . " europe 's christian identity but opinions divide on whether germany has irrevocably turned its back on religion . hubert seiwert , a professor of comparative religious studies , says that although there is a widespread belief that religion and all things modern stand in direct opposition to one another , the death knell has yet to toll for christianity in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is islam in europe making europeans more aware of their christian roots ?
at the moment , the tendency in german society is to talk about religion in the context of conflicts , but not otherwise . " take the islam issue for example , " seiwert said .
" that is something people are taking seriously . " but discussions about islam and its role in western , secular societies have prompted many germans to re-examine their own religious roots . " suddenly people are talking about europe having a christian identity , " he said . according to reinhard holmer , director of germany 's evangelische allianz , an association of evangelical christians , people are nowadays , in fact , beginning to ask more questions about what religion can offer . " religious issues are becoming more mainstream and people want to know what answers the church can provide , " holmer said . seeking spirituality elsewhere bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german mormons are welcoming new members to their church for many , those answers have not been satisfying enough to keep them coming back for more .
but just because people have left the largest church communities does n't always mean they have turned their backs on religion , or indeed christianity , entirely . " some people leave the church because it is too lackadaisical while they are looking for something more charismatic , " seiwert said . although such leaps of faith are the exception rather than the rule , seiwert claims a growing number of people are seeking spiritual fulfillment outside the mainstream churches .
and there are literally dozens of alternative religions - christian and otherwise - waiting to welcome new recruits into the fold .
some have to wait longer than others . small but steady growth ralf grünke , spokesman for germany 's church of the latter-day saints - also known as mormons - says 1,066 people of all denominations have joined its ranks over the past two years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smaller religious groups in germany are often looked upon with skepticism " the church is attractive to people of all backgrounds , " grünke said , " because it is lively and our sermons are conducted by laypeople rather than vicars . " the jehovah 's witnesses in germany record an average annual increase in membership of between 0.5 and 1.5 percent .
other groups , such as the bible fellowship church and the seventh-day adventists also claim to have witnessed a small increase of members over the past years . according to seiwert , memberships are unlikely to go up unless attitudes towards the lesser-known religions in germany are changed . " we are warned against smaller groups which are not a part of the main church , " he said .
" and decisions to join them are met with skepticism . " tamsin walker send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de security -pipe- 14.09.2007 exposed cyber attacks could be the tip of the iceberg großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts believe that many more nations than those reported are involved in cyber attacks high-profile claims against russia and china this year , accusing them of mounting cyber attacks against western state computer systems could be the first publicized salvos of a secret cyber war involving many nations . twenty years ago , the concept of a country coming under attack not from land , air or sea but via telephone lines and communication systems was seen as science fiction .
but today , when gaining access to a government web site takes just a few mouse clicks , cyber-terrorism is a very real fact .
the alleged russian attacks on estonia 's digital infrastructure in the middle of a diplomatic spat over the relocation of a soviet-era monument in may sent nato experts to tallinn to investigate what some called the first direct attack by moscow on a nato member .
confusion over whether an attack was actually happening , however , allowed nato to avoid formulating a response to the suspected cyber attack .
then germany joined the united states , france and britain last month in blaming china for recent hacker attacks on sensitive government sites , including the pentagon and the french defense ministry . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister ansip 's estonia was targeted online " i 'm sure the germans and americans would n't have named china without having evidence , " said jan hassel , an expert and author on the subject of cyber-terrorism .
" the fact that china was singled out means that the countries apparently targeted by the chinese wanted to send out a warning . " beijing has denied all involvement in the alleged attacks , and the western governments have been unwilling to publicize exactly what , if any , classified information was compromised . badly protected systems vulnerable to attack " the increasing reliance on technology is making governments more vulnerable to cyber attack , " hassel said .
" many do n't have adequate defense systems on their files and hackers will look for a weak link , maybe a person , maybe an application and focus on that , releasing viruses to disable the system through emails . " the pentagon admitted hackers had gained access to an unclassified e-mail system in the office of us defense secretary robert gates but would not comment on a financial times report that the chinese government was involved . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us hackers targeted arabic broadcaster al jazeera in 2003 britain 's the times also reported that the pentagon suspected china 's people 's liberation army -lrb- pla -rrb- hackers of preparing a plan to disable the us aircraft carrier fleet , a threat hassel said has been exaggerated . " it would not be possible for a hacker to steer a battleship , " said hassel .
" the main threat would be the interception of communications .
while unauthorized access to military systems is a real concern , we should n't get too carried away .
there is still much of what makes up a ' nightmare ' scenario which can not currently be achieved by hacking . "
publicly accused are not alone but by engaging in cyber warfare , as seen in the estonian case , a country can obtain information about and destabilize rival nations faster - and at a fraction of the cost of the spy networks or militaries that were once necessary . retired us army officer and lecturer on asymmetric warfare zachary hubbard recently claimed in a report that the pla had developed a sizable force of professional computer hackers trained to disrupt the computer networks of china 's enemies . hubbard claimed that these hackers were trained to target banking and electronic commerce networks and electric power grids , transportation networks and oil and gas pipelines often making use of information publicly available on the internet .
china has denied the existence of any such force .
cyber units at large in the world ? while china and russia currently appear to have taken the lead in online espionage , it is highly unlikely they are alone since " no one is going to admit to -lsb- having -rsb- cyber units , " according to hassel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pla is suspected of having trained cyber units " a lot of countries are doing it , and i would not be surprised if those accusing others of the practice are guilty as well , " he said .
" what is more likely is that governments are turning a blind eye to hackers targeting other nations , or even using freelance hackers while publicly condemning the practice . " while we do n't know whether there are any official military units in europe charged with cyber missions , we have seen that certain exercises and war games carried out by the likes of china have included cyber attack scenarios , " hassel added .
nations stumped over appropriate response the official denials of any engagement in cyber espionage and difficulty in presenting hard evidence of an attack , however , have left countries wondering what action to take after falling victim to an attack . in europe , the council of europe 's convention on cybercrime became the first , and only , international legal instrument in dealing with cyber attacks .
but even that is regarded as ineffective as it applies only to signatory nations .
the convention has been signed by 38 council of europe members and five non-members - canada , japan , montenegro , south africa and the united states .
" the council of europe 's convention allows the signatories protection against each other but does little if anything to provide a legal framework where an outsider could be held accountable , " said hassel .
" european nations and the united states can expect to become increasingly targeted until a full international agreement on cyber attacks is in place . " nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

14 , that the makers of " valkyrie , " a film about failed hitler assassin count claus von stauffenberg , starring cruise , will be allowed to shoot key scenes of the movie in a courtyard of the german defense ministry .
stauffenberg and his co-conspirators were executed there after the failed 1944 attempt to kill the nazi dictator . " there has been a change of mind at the defense ministry , " thorsten albig , a spokesman for the german finance ministry , which issues film permits at government buildings , told the paper .
" a new request by the film team has received a positive answer . " concerns about preserving memorial 's dignity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a statue honoring stauffenberg in the courtyard earlier this year , cruise 's plan to film at the bendlerblock memorial had been met with resistance from government officials . according to news reports , german defense minister franz josef jung had said that his ministry would not allow filming at the site after one of his party colleagues had voiced concern over cruise 's scientology membership . a lawmaker , who had originally urged government officials to deny any request by the filmmakers to use the memorial site , called the turnaround an " unfortunate decision .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de security -pipe- 14.09.2007 exposed cyber attacks could be the tip of the iceberg großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts believe that many more nations than those reported are involved in cyber attacks high-profile claims against russia and china this year , accusing them of mounting cyber attacks against western state computer systems could be the first publicized salvos of a secret cyber war involving many nations . twenty years ago , the concept of a country coming under attack not from land , air or sea but via telephone lines and communication systems was seen as science fiction .
but today , when gaining access to a government web site takes just a few mouse clicks , cyber-terrorism is a very real fact .
the alleged russian attacks on estonia 's digital infrastructure in the middle of a diplomatic spat over the relocation of a soviet-era monument in may sent nato experts to tallinn to investigate what some called the first direct attack by moscow on a nato member .
confusion over whether an attack was actually happening , however , allowed nato to avoid formulating a response to the suspected cyber attack .
then germany joined the united states , france and britain last month in blaming china for recent hacker attacks on sensitive government sites , including the pentagon and the french defense ministry . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister ansip 's estonia was targeted online " i 'm sure the germans and americans would n't have named china without having evidence , " said jan hassel , an expert and author on the subject of cyber-terrorism .
" the fact that china was singled out means that the countries apparently targeted by the chinese wanted to send out a warning . " beijing has denied all involvement in the alleged attacks , and the western governments have been unwilling to publicize exactly what , if any , classified information was compromised . badly protected systems vulnerable to attack " the increasing reliance on technology is making governments more vulnerable to cyber attack , " hassel said .
" many do n't have adequate defense systems on their files and hackers will look for a weak link , maybe a person , maybe an application and focus on that , releasing viruses to disable the system through emails . " the pentagon admitted hackers had gained access to an unclassified e-mail system in the office of us defense secretary robert gates but would not comment on a financial times report that the chinese government was involved . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us hackers targeted arabic broadcaster al jazeera in 2003 britain 's the times also reported that the pentagon suspected china 's people 's liberation army -lrb- pla -rrb- hackers of preparing a plan to disable the us aircraft carrier fleet , a threat hassel said has been exaggerated . " it would not be possible for a hacker to steer a battleship , " said hassel .
" the main threat would be the interception of communications .
while unauthorized access to military systems is a real concern , we should n't get too carried away .
there is still much of what makes up a ' nightmare ' scenario which can not currently be achieved by hacking . "
publicly accused are not alone but by engaging in cyber warfare , as seen in the estonian case , a country can obtain information about and destabilize rival nations faster - and at a fraction of the cost of the spy networks or militaries that were once necessary . retired us army officer and lecturer on asymmetric warfare zachary hubbard recently claimed in a report that the pla had developed a sizable force of professional computer hackers trained to disrupt the computer networks of china 's enemies . hubbard claimed that these hackers were trained to target banking and electronic commerce networks and electric power grids , transportation networks and oil and gas pipelines often making use of information publicly available on the internet .
china has denied the existence of any such force .
cyber units at large in the world ? while china and russia currently appear to have taken the lead in online espionage , it is highly unlikely they are alone since " no one is going to admit to -lsb- having -rsb- cyber units , " according to hassel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pla is suspected of having trained cyber units " a lot of countries are doing it , and i would not be surprised if those accusing others of the practice are guilty as well , " he said .
" what is more likely is that governments are turning a blind eye to hackers targeting other nations , or even using freelance hackers while publicly condemning the practice . " while we do n't know whether there are any official military units in europe charged with cyber missions , we have seen that certain exercises and war games carried out by the likes of china have included cyber attack scenarios , " hassel added .
nations stumped over appropriate response the official denials of any engagement in cyber espionage and difficulty in presenting hard evidence of an attack , however , have left countries wondering what action to take after falling victim to an attack . in europe , the council of europe 's convention on cybercrime became the first , and only , international legal instrument in dealing with cyber attacks .
but even that is regarded as ineffective as it applies only to signatory nations .
the convention has been signed by 38 council of europe members and five non-members - canada , japan , montenegro , south africa and the united states .
" the council of europe 's convention allows the signatories protection against each other but does little if anything to provide a legal framework where an outsider could be held accountable , " said hassel .
" european nations and the united states can expect to become increasingly targeted until a full international agreement on cyber attacks is in place . " nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it 's no secret that both the catholic and protestant churches in germany have long faced the problem of shrinking congregations , but has the nation irrevocably turned its back on its religious heritage ? in the past six decades , the number of german citizens belonging to one of the country 's two main churches has fallen from 94.4 to just shy of 62 percent .
and although the trend has slowed , there is no indication of a reversal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many young germans are alienated from religion carsten frerk who runs fowid , a research group on belief systems in germany , says the church has lost its power and , perhaps more crucially , it has lost the nation 's youth . " children in germany are no longer born into a religion in the way they used to be , " frerk said .
" young people are not forced into a religious culture anymore . " the younger generations have too many choices at their disposal and this is what keeps them away from making binding ideological decisions .
according to frerk , the rate at which young people break away from religious groups will soon put non-denominational germans in the majority . " one percent of christians are leaving the church every year , " he said .
" so in 20 years from now , they 'll be the minority . " europe 's christian identity but opinions divide on whether germany has irrevocably turned its back on religion . hubert seiwert , a professor of comparative religious studies , says that although there is a widespread belief that religion and all things modern stand in direct opposition to one another , the death knell has yet to toll for christianity in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is islam in europe making europeans more aware of their christian roots ?
at the moment , the tendency in german society is to talk about religion in the context of conflicts , but not otherwise . " take the islam issue for example , " seiwert said .
" that is something people are taking seriously . " but discussions about islam and its role in western , secular societies have prompted many germans to re-examine their own religious roots . " suddenly people are talking about europe having a christian identity , " he said . according to reinhard holmer , director of germany 's evangelische allianz , an association of evangelical christians , people are nowadays , in fact , beginning to ask more questions about what religion can offer . " religious issues are becoming more mainstream and people want to know what answers the church can provide , " holmer said . seeking spirituality elsewhere bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german mormons are welcoming new members to their church for many , those answers have not been satisfying enough to keep them coming back for more .
but just because people have left the largest church communities does n't always mean they have turned their backs on religion , or indeed christianity , entirely . " some people leave the church because it is too lackadaisical while they are looking for something more charismatic , " seiwert said . although such leaps of faith are the exception rather than the rule , seiwert claims a growing number of people are seeking spiritual fulfillment outside the mainstream churches .
and there are literally dozens of alternative religions - christian and otherwise - waiting to welcome new recruits into the fold .

" what 's happening to our political parties ? "
it 's a question i get asked again and again as a parliamentarian .
the question is usually followed by more : " do you think that parties still represent the people ?
do they still know what citizens are worried about ? "
all this then quickly leads to a debate about the " end of party democracy . "
on the one hand , one should n't just accept the common stereotype that - in simple terms - parties and politicians are responsible for the current problems .
on the other hand , citizens also have a certain responsibility for democracy .
" let the state , let politics fix it . "
democracy is n't that easy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : omid nouripour at 32 , i 'm a fairly young german , who spent the first 13 years of his life in iran .
it 's a country where absolutely nothing could and can be taken for granted that seems so natural to us in germany : freedom of opinion , freedom of the press , the rule of law and - last , but not least - the right to free elections .
here , people , unfortunately , take these achievements for granted .
but taking things for granted usually leads to indifference .
" do n't talk to me about indifference , " some might say .
" we 're all staunch democrats , but we do n't have to pretend each day that democracy has to be reinvented . "
still , there are extreme situations in which democracy might not have to be reinvented , but certainly defended on a daily basis - for example , in light of the recurring right-wing extremist attacks on foreigners or people who appear foreign , which are , to put it mildly , " tolerated " by bystanders .
if we give right-wing extremists a free rein , we not only turn away and forfeit any kind of humanity and moral courage , we also question our democratic freedom and rights , as the ideology of right-wing extremists is founded on arbitrariness , hatred and violence .
today , they go against those who look different , tomorrow against those , who simply say what they think .
but i also miss civic participation to safeguard democratic values in less extreme situations - for example , when the current government increasingly wants to curtail civil rights and snoop around the privacy of citizens .
i still have n't heard the cry of protest from staunch democrats in cases such as limiting data protection by saving airplane passenger information , telecommunications data retention , online searches of private computers or insufficient protection for minorities .
" those who would give up essential liberty to purchase a little temporary safety , deserve neither liberty nor safety , " this quote attributed to benjamin franklin has been used a lot during the current discussion , but has rarely been heard .
democracy only works when there 's a balance of freedom and safety .
that 's why i think that a functioning democracy needs citizens who do n't grow tired of defending democratic values and freedoms .
democracy could do with a bit more heart and soul .
parties are commonly seen as the ground zero of all weariness when it comes to politics and democracy .
they are no longer trusted .
-lrb- were they ever ? -rrb-
they make a lot of promises and keep very few of them .
they are not able to solve the problems that lie ahead of us .
their work mainly concentrates on their own interests or those that they 've been drawn to by lobbyists .
their personnel is interested in power and status symbols , such as official cars , and has no scruples about enriching itself via regular pay raises that are taken from the public coffers .
this image has been around for quite some time .
considering the scandals that are regularly uncovered , it 's hard to counter this assessment of politicians and parties - just think of the party financing scandal of the christian democratic union and the demystification of the republic 's " eternal " political leading figure , former chancellor helmut kohl .
all those who claim that politics is a business like any other are wrong : politicians bear a special responsibility and have a special duty to integrity and independence .
citizens have a right to a " transparent representative , " who tells them what he earns and where his money comes from .
every politician should know that he can not ask citizens to be completely honest when it comes to taxes , but use - on good advice , in most cases - every possible loophole that he can find or has created himself .
credibility also gets lost when scandals are uncovered but have no ramifications .
roland koch , the " ruthless scout " with dubious involvement in the cdu 's financing scandal , is still state premier of hesse .
franz-josef jung , his former chief-of-staff , who stepped down because of the scandal in september 2000 , is now germany 's defense minister .
that 's not just frustrating .
it 's scandalous .
so who should fix it then ?
talk about the " failure of parties " is often followed by the demand to replace party politicians with experts .
after all , the latter are seen as impartial and have to know what 's really needed .
parties on the other hand are biased .
but how much objectivity can democracy stand ?
parties produce opinions , differing assessments , interpretations and conclusions about current facts and developments .
they do n't deliver " truths , " even if they like to pretend they do .
democratic pluralism is based on a multitude of more or less subjective opinions and assessments that citizens can choose from .
one can admittedly question to what extent parties currently fulfill that task .
if only experts decide on policy , the " objective truth " suddenly moves to the center of politics - a truth that only a small elite of specialists has knowledge about .
democracy would become an " expertocracy " that 's much less transparent and much harder for citizens to influence .
that 's why i can not imagine democracy without parties .
and still , democracy goes beyond the concept of parties .
some backroom party strategist may fantasize about taking complete control of democracy , but that wo n't happen .
our party system is n't static but mirrors societal changes .
the current weakening of peoples ' parties and the increasing number of five-party parliaments is proof of this .
in my opinion , it 's crucial to strengthen awareness for democratic freedom and values - within parties and within society .
if we manage to do that and if parties will be more open to new ideas and supporters than they have been so far , quite a few tired democrats might become wide awake again - and help to build party membership .

but today , when gaining access to a government web site takes just a few mouse clicks , cyber-terrorism is a very real fact .
the alleged russian attacks on estonia 's digital infrastructure in the middle of a diplomatic spat over the relocation of a soviet-era monument in may sent nato experts to tallinn to investigate what some called the first direct attack by moscow on a nato member .
confusion over whether an attack was actually happening , however , allowed nato to avoid formulating a response to the suspected cyber attack .
then germany joined the united states , france and britain last month in blaming china for recent hacker attacks on sensitive government sites , including the pentagon and the french defense ministry . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister ansip 's estonia was targeted online " i 'm sure the germans and americans would n't have named china without having evidence , " said jan hassel , an expert and author on the subject of cyber-terrorism .
" the fact that china was singled out means that the countries apparently targeted by the chinese wanted to send out a warning . " beijing has denied all involvement in the alleged attacks , and the western governments have been unwilling to publicize exactly what , if any , classified information was compromised . badly protected systems vulnerable to attack " the increasing reliance on technology is making governments more vulnerable to cyber attack , " hassel said .
" many do n't have adequate defense systems on their files and hackers will look for a weak link , maybe a person , maybe an application and focus on that , releasing viruses to disable the system through emails . " the pentagon admitted hackers had gained access to an unclassified e-mail system in the office of us defense secretary robert gates but would not comment on a financial times report that the chinese government was involved . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us hackers targeted arabic broadcaster al jazeera in 2003 britain 's the times also reported that the pentagon suspected china 's people 's liberation army -lrb- pla -rrb- hackers of preparing a plan to disable the us aircraft carrier fleet , a threat hassel said has been exaggerated . " it would not be possible for a hacker to steer a battleship , " said hassel .
" the main threat would be the interception of communications .
while unauthorized access to military systems is a real concern , we should n't get too carried away .
there is still much of what makes up a ' nightmare ' scenario which can not currently be achieved by hacking . "
publicly accused are not alone but by engaging in cyber warfare , as seen in the estonian case , a country can obtain information about and destabilize rival nations faster - and at a fraction of the cost of the spy networks or militaries that were once necessary . retired us army officer and lecturer on asymmetric warfare zachary hubbard recently claimed in a report that the pla had developed a sizable force of professional computer hackers trained to disrupt the computer networks of china 's enemies . hubbard claimed that these hackers were trained to target banking and electronic commerce networks and electric power grids , transportation networks and oil and gas pipelines often making use of information publicly available on the internet .
china has denied the existence of any such force .
cyber units at large in the world ? while china and russia currently appear to have taken the lead in online espionage , it is highly unlikely they are alone since " no one is going to admit to -lsb- having -rsb- cyber units , " according to hassel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pla is suspected of having trained cyber units " a lot of countries are doing it , and i would not be surprised if those accusing others of the practice are guilty as well , " he said .
" what is more likely is that governments are turning a blind eye to hackers targeting other nations , or even using freelance hackers while publicly condemning the practice . " while we do n't know whether there are any official military units in europe charged with cyber missions , we have seen that certain exercises and war games carried out by the likes of china have included cyber attack scenarios , " hassel added .
nations stumped over appropriate response the official denials of any engagement in cyber espionage and difficulty in presenting hard evidence of an attack , however , have left countries wondering what action to take after falling victim to an attack . in europe , the council of europe 's convention on cybercrime became the first , and only , international legal instrument in dealing with cyber attacks .
but even that is regarded as ineffective as it applies only to signatory nations .
the convention has been signed by 38 council of europe members and five non-members - canada , japan , montenegro , south africa and the united states .

" what 's happening to our political parties ? "
it 's a question i get asked again and again as a parliamentarian .
the question is usually followed by more : " do you think that parties still represent the people ?
do they still know what citizens are worried about ? "
all this then quickly leads to a debate about the " end of party democracy . "
on the one hand , one should n't just accept the common stereotype that - in simple terms - parties and politicians are responsible for the current problems .
on the other hand , citizens also have a certain responsibility for democracy .
" let the state , let politics fix it . "
democracy is n't that easy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : omid nouripour at 32 , i 'm a fairly young german , who spent the first 13 years of his life in iran .
it 's a country where absolutely nothing could and can be taken for granted that seems so natural to us in germany : freedom of opinion , freedom of the press , the rule of law and - last , but not least - the right to free elections .
here , people , unfortunately , take these achievements for granted .
but taking things for granted usually leads to indifference .
" do n't talk to me about indifference , " some might say .
" we 're all staunch democrats , but we do n't have to pretend each day that democracy has to be reinvented . "
still , there are extreme situations in which democracy might not have to be reinvented , but certainly defended on a daily basis - for example , in light of the recurring right-wing extremist attacks on foreigners or people who appear foreign , which are , to put it mildly , " tolerated " by bystanders .
if we give right-wing extremists a free rein , we not only turn away and forfeit any kind of humanity and moral courage , we also question our democratic freedom and rights , as the ideology of right-wing extremists is founded on arbitrariness , hatred and violence .
today , they go against those who look different , tomorrow against those , who simply say what they think .
but i also miss civic participation to safeguard democratic values in less extreme situations - for example , when the current government increasingly wants to curtail civil rights and snoop around the privacy of citizens .
i still have n't heard the cry of protest from staunch democrats in cases such as limiting data protection by saving airplane passenger information , telecommunications data retention , online searches of private computers or insufficient protection for minorities .
" those who would give up essential liberty to purchase a little temporary safety , deserve neither liberty nor safety , " this quote attributed to benjamin franklin has been used a lot during the current discussion , but has rarely been heard .
democracy only works when there 's a balance of freedom and safety .
that 's why i think that a functioning democracy needs citizens who do n't grow tired of defending democratic values and freedoms .
democracy could do with a bit more heart and soul .
parties are commonly seen as the ground zero of all weariness when it comes to politics and democracy .
they are no longer trusted .
-lrb- were they ever ? -rrb-
they make a lot of promises and keep very few of them .
they are not able to solve the problems that lie ahead of us .
their work mainly concentrates on their own interests or those that they 've been drawn to by lobbyists .
their personnel is interested in power and status symbols , such as official cars , and has no scruples about enriching itself via regular pay raises that are taken from the public coffers .
this image has been around for quite some time .
considering the scandals that are regularly uncovered , it 's hard to counter this assessment of politicians and parties - just think of the party financing scandal of the christian democratic union and the demystification of the republic 's " eternal " political leading figure , former chancellor helmut kohl .
all those who claim that politics is a business like any other are wrong : politicians bear a special responsibility and have a special duty to integrity and independence .
citizens have a right to a " transparent representative , " who tells them what he earns and where his money comes from .
every politician should know that he can not ask citizens to be completely honest when it comes to taxes , but use - on good advice , in most cases - every possible loophole that he can find or has created himself .
credibility also gets lost when scandals are uncovered but have no ramifications .
roland koch , the " ruthless scout " with dubious involvement in the cdu 's financing scandal , is still state premier of hesse .
franz-josef jung , his former chief-of-staff , who stepped down because of the scandal in september 2000 , is now germany 's defense minister .
that 's not just frustrating .
it 's scandalous .
so who should fix it then ?
talk about the " failure of parties " is often followed by the demand to replace party politicians with experts .
after all , the latter are seen as impartial and have to know what 's really needed .
parties on the other hand are biased .
but how much objectivity can democracy stand ?
parties produce opinions , differing assessments , interpretations and conclusions about current facts and developments .
they do n't deliver " truths , " even if they like to pretend they do .
democratic pluralism is based on a multitude of more or less subjective opinions and assessments that citizens can choose from .
one can admittedly question to what extent parties currently fulfill that task .
if only experts decide on policy , the " objective truth " suddenly moves to the center of politics - a truth that only a small elite of specialists has knowledge about .
democracy would become an " expertocracy " that 's much less transparent and much harder for citizens to influence .
that 's why i can not imagine democracy without parties .
and still , democracy goes beyond the concept of parties .
some backroom party strategist may fantasize about taking complete control of democracy , but that wo n't happen .
our party system is n't static but mirrors societal changes .
the current weakening of peoples ' parties and the increasing number of five-party parliaments is proof of this .
in my opinion , it 's crucial to strengthen awareness for democratic freedom and values - within parties and within society .
if we manage to do that and if parties will be more open to new ideas and supporters than they have been so far , quite a few tired democrats might become wide awake again - and help to build party membership .

" tibetans need international support more than ever and germany can take an important leadership role , " he said .
exiled leader the dalai lama heads a tibetan " government in exile " based in india .
he fled tibet after it was taken over by chinese troops and was awarded the nobel peace prize in 1989 for his non-violent campaigning on behalf of his country .
in his frequent visits to europe , the dalai lama promotes the cause of tibet .

why not get yourself down to sauerland and get an eyeful of some good old-fashioned deer porn . when it comes to getting kinky kicks in germany , most people know that the place to go is the reeperbahn area of hamburg .
the sleazy mile of brothels and clubs offering all manner of dances - lap , table and pole - has become world famous for providing everything that seekers of sexual thrills could hope for .
but even the reeperbahn has its boundaries when it comes to pushing the envelope of lust and desire , which is why the notorious hamburg quarter may start losing customers in search of the hottest stag party .
those wanting the ultimate in horny action with a new and risqué take on voyeuristic pleasure need look no further than the ruhr area in the western german state of north-rhine westphalia .
heading into the forests around the town of arnsberg-vosswinkel , those looking for something a little unusual and au natural can pay 40 euros -lrb- $ 56 -rrb- for the pleasure of a whole night watching the locals rut wildly .
perverts beware : this is not a bestiality bus trip bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " hey babes , wanna rut ? "
before bus loads of international perverts start flooding to the region in search of exhibitionist sauerlanders , it must be revealed at this point that those performing during these night-long steamy outdoor sessions are not humans .
if that only speeds up the flow of deviants , then it must also be noted that these organized trips into the wild are run by wildwald vosswinkel , a well-respected nature trust , and that sexually excited adults are discouraged from attending .
the trust has been organizing trips into the sauerland forests for decades but only recently have they struck on the idea of bussing nature lovers into the woods to watch the local red deer mating season up close .
from sept .
22 to oct .
21 , wildwald will be taking the curious to the best rutting areas in the forests , where young stags fight over the available deer babes before claiming their prize in the time-honored fashion .
organizers shocked by questions of weirdness bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " does the ear tag and collar ensemble do anything for you ? "
despite it all being very natural and above board , there remains something a little weird about groups of humans - children included - hiding in the bushes watching animals have sex … and paying for the privilege .
" it 's not weird because we observe the deer purely from an educational perspective and our staff are always on hand to offer insight and answer questions on what is one of nature 's most fascinating rituals , " wildwald 's spokesperson told dw-world.de. okay , but surely if there is a group of people standing around with night-vision equipment , observing and asking questions about a stag 's moves , that 's going to upset the rhythm and spoil the magic for the deer .
" no , " assured the wildwald spokesperson .
" we keep the people at a good distance where they can observe safely and can not disturb the animals .
wildwald has been taking people into the woods for 30 years and we know how to respect the privacy of the animals there . "
so there you have it .
a nature expedition or just some good old deer porn ?
we 'll let you decide .
those wanting to get their names down for the hot buck-on-doe action have until oct .

it 's no secret that both the catholic and protestant churches in germany have long faced the problem of shrinking congregations , but has the nation irrevocably turned its back on its religious heritage ? in the past six decades , the number of german citizens belonging to one of the country 's two main churches has fallen from 94.4 to just shy of 62 percent .
and although the trend has slowed , there is no indication of a reversal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many young germans are alienated from religion carsten frerk who runs fowid , a research group on belief systems in germany , says the church has lost its power and , perhaps more crucially , it has lost the nation 's youth . " children in germany are no longer born into a religion in the way they used to be , " frerk said .
" young people are not forced into a religious culture anymore . " the younger generations have too many choices at their disposal and this is what keeps them away from making binding ideological decisions .
according to frerk , the rate at which young people break away from religious groups will soon put non-denominational germans in the majority . " one percent of christians are leaving the church every year , " he said .
" so in 20 years from now , they 'll be the minority . " europe 's christian identity but opinions divide on whether germany has irrevocably turned its back on religion . hubert seiwert , a professor of comparative religious studies , says that although there is a widespread belief that religion and all things modern stand in direct opposition to one another , the death knell has yet to toll for christianity in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is islam in europe making europeans more aware of their christian roots ?
at the moment , the tendency in german society is to talk about religion in the context of conflicts , but not otherwise . " take the islam issue for example , " seiwert said .
" that is something people are taking seriously . " but discussions about islam and its role in western , secular societies have prompted many germans to re-examine their own religious roots . " suddenly people are talking about europe having a christian identity , " he said . according to reinhard holmer , director of germany 's evangelische allianz , an association of evangelical christians , people are nowadays , in fact , beginning to ask more questions about what religion can offer . " religious issues are becoming more mainstream and people want to know what answers the church can provide , " holmer said . seeking spirituality elsewhere bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german mormons are welcoming new members to their church for many , those answers have not been satisfying enough to keep them coming back for more .
but just because people have left the largest church communities does n't always mean they have turned their backs on religion , or indeed christianity , entirely . " some people leave the church because it is too lackadaisical while they are looking for something more charismatic , " seiwert said . although such leaps of faith are the exception rather than the rule , seiwert claims a growing number of people are seeking spiritual fulfillment outside the mainstream churches .
and there are literally dozens of alternative religions - christian and otherwise - waiting to welcome new recruits into the fold .
some have to wait longer than others . small but steady growth ralf grünke , spokesman for germany 's church of the latter-day saints - also known as mormons - says 1,066 people of all denominations have joined its ranks over the past two years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smaller religious groups in germany are often looked upon with skepticism " the church is attractive to people of all backgrounds , " grünke said , " because it is lively and our sermons are conducted by laypeople rather than vicars . " the jehovah 's witnesses in germany record an average annual increase in membership of between 0.5 and 1.5 percent .
other groups , such as the bible fellowship church and the seventh-day adventists also claim to have witnessed a small increase of members over the past years . according to seiwert , memberships are unlikely to go up unless attitudes towards the lesser-known religions in germany are changed . " we are warned against smaller groups which are not a part of the main church , " he said .
" and decisions to join them are met with skepticism . " tamsin walker send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

14 , in portugal , the continued strength of the euro was a concern , although finance chiefs said economic growth should hold .
france got a deficit scolding . before the 13 ministers got down to business in the northern city of porto , portugal on friday , they took a ride on a river cruiser up the douro river .
the message in this time of global credit upheavals seemed to be : do n't rock the boat .
europe is enjoying healthy growth and financial chiefs do n't want the us sub-prime rate crisis or a muscle-bound euro to throw it off track .
" we are able to handle situations like -lrb- the current economic uncertainty -rrb- , " austrian finance minister wilhelm molterer told journalists as the 13 gathered for a working breakfast .
" the european economy is robust and stable . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european central bank president jean-claude trichet is worried about financial market volatility the reassuring words come after the euro hit a record high of $ 1.3927 on thursday , reviving fears that an overly strong currency could hurt euro-zone exports by making them more expensive on international markets .
" we are following very closely all developments that can occur " on currency markets , said luxembourg 's prime minister jean-claude juncker , who chaired the meeting .
ministers were careful , however , not to overplay their concerns , fearful that hitting the panic button could unnerve financial markets reeling from a slew of bad economic news of late .
besides the strong euro , it appears that the international fall-out from the sub-prime crisis in the us , which was sparked by high-risk home mortgage lending , is continuing .
impact , but not a huge one analysts say the creeping paralysis that the sub-prime crisis has caused has occurred not because banks have necessarily lost money as a consequence of the crisis , but because they are not sure if they have lost money or not .
this type of uncertainty has made them wary about lending , exacerbating the problem .
on friday , news broke that british mortgage lender northern rock had been given an emergency loan by the bank of england to see it through a credit crunch .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the finance chiefs delivered a relatively upbeat assessment despite that , ministers from the 13 nations who have adopted the euro were careful to say that , while recent events will not help economic matters , the turbulence will not hurt them that much either .
" we think that the recent developments on the financial markets will have an impact , but a light impact , on the outlook for growth in 2007 toward the end of the year , " said juncker .
" we believe that economic growth will remain sufficiently robust so that in 2008 we will not see a sharp downward revision . "
the european commission lowered its euro-zone growth forecasts slightly this week - not because of the strong euro , but because of the credit crunch .
it predicted that the bloc 's economy would grow by 2.5 percent instead of 2.6 percent , which had been previously forecast .
" the fundamentals in the euro area and the european economies remain solid : profits in private companies continue to be high , balance sheets in the private sector are sound ... and unemployment is at the lowest level in the past two decades , " said joaquin almunia , the eu 's economic affairs commissioner .
france rapped on knuckles france came in for a scolding at friday 's meeting for not doing enough about its deficit and was urged to do more to bring it down .
" we think that the ambitions that france has shown do not entirely correspond to the level of our expectations , " juncker told journalists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french finance minister christine lagarde although structural reforms undertaken by france " go in the right direction and should increase growth potential , " juncker said the ministers " believe that structural reforms and budget consolidation should go together . "
euro-zone finance chiefs had committed themselves in april in berlin to balancing their budgets by 2010 , but were warned by french president nicolas sarkozy that his reform plan meant france might not be in the black until 2012 .
he wants to jolt the french economy with a growth " shock " through a series of tax cuts .
the move risks reversing the country 's downward deficit trend .
france 's finance minister christine lagarde acknowledged the dissatisfaction of her counterparts , but stressed that they had approved of sarkozy 's reform package .
if the french deficit starts rising again , it could soon break the eu rules requiring that fiscal shortfalls be kept to less than 3 percent .
" we will make every effort to reach the berlin objectives in so far as the economic situation permits , " lagarde said . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

23 , will be the first time the tibetan religious leader has been invited to the chancellery , government spokesman ulrich wilhelm said on friday , sept .
14 .
the meeting is one of a series between merkel and senior religious leaders , he added .
asked by reporters if china could be upset at the dalai lama being invited to the chancellery , wilhelm said the situation in tibet was regularly brought up during german-chinese consultations on human rights .
during his term in office , former german foreign minister joschka fischer courted chinese disapproval by meeting with the buddhist leader in berlin .

" the meeting is an important sign of support for tibet and especially for the policies of the dalai lama , " ict germany head kai müller said on friday in berlin .
" tibetans need international support more than ever and germany can take an important leadership role , " he said .
exiled leader the dalai lama heads a tibetan " government in exile " based in india .
he fled tibet after it was taken over by chinese troops and was awarded the nobel peace prize in 1989 for his non-violent campaigning on behalf of his country .
in his frequent visits to europe , the dalai lama promotes the cause of tibet .
recently , however , he has backed off from calling for tibetan independence , encouraging instead the international community to push for " genuine autonomy " for the himalayan region .

it 's no secret that both the catholic and protestant churches in germany have long faced the problem of shrinking congregations , but has the nation irrevocably turned its back on its religious heritage ? in the past six decades , the number of german citizens belonging to one of the country 's two main churches has fallen from 94.4 to just shy of 62 percent .
and although the trend has slowed , there is no indication of a reversal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many young germans are alienated from religion carsten frerk who runs fowid , a research group on belief systems in germany , says the church has lost its power and , perhaps more crucially , it has lost the nation 's youth . " children in germany are no longer born into a religion in the way they used to be , " frerk said .
" young people are not forced into a religious culture anymore . " the younger generations have too many choices at their disposal and this is what keeps them away from making binding ideological decisions .
according to frerk , the rate at which young people break away from religious groups will soon put non-denominational germans in the majority . " one percent of christians are leaving the church every year , " he said .
" so in 20 years from now , they 'll be the minority . " europe 's christian identity but opinions divide on whether germany has irrevocably turned its back on religion . hubert seiwert , a professor of comparative religious studies , says that although there is a widespread belief that religion and all things modern stand in direct opposition to one another , the death knell has yet to toll for christianity in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is islam in europe making europeans more aware of their christian roots ?
at the moment , the tendency in german society is to talk about religion in the context of conflicts , but not otherwise . " take the islam issue for example , " seiwert said .
" that is something people are taking seriously . " but discussions about islam and its role in western , secular societies have prompted many germans to re-examine their own religious roots . " suddenly people are talking about europe having a christian identity , " he said . according to reinhard holmer , director of germany 's evangelische allianz , an association of evangelical christians , people are nowadays , in fact , beginning to ask more questions about what religion can offer . " religious issues are becoming more mainstream and people want to know what answers the church can provide , " holmer said . seeking spirituality elsewhere bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german mormons are welcoming new members to their church for many , those answers have not been satisfying enough to keep them coming back for more .
but just because people have left the largest church communities does n't always mean they have turned their backs on religion , or indeed christianity , entirely . " some people leave the church because it is too lackadaisical while they are looking for something more charismatic , " seiwert said . although such leaps of faith are the exception rather than the rule , seiwert claims a growing number of people are seeking spiritual fulfillment outside the mainstream churches .
and there are literally dozens of alternative religions - christian and otherwise - waiting to welcome new recruits into the fold .
some have to wait longer than others . small but steady growth ralf grünke , spokesman for germany 's church of the latter-day saints - also known as mormons - says 1,066 people of all denominations have joined its ranks over the past two years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smaller religious groups in germany are often looked upon with skepticism " the church is attractive to people of all backgrounds , " grünke said , " because it is lively and our sermons are conducted by laypeople rather than vicars . " the jehovah 's witnesses in germany record an average annual increase in membership of between 0.5 and 1.5 percent .
other groups , such as the bible fellowship church and the seventh-day adventists also claim to have witnessed a small increase of members over the past years . according to seiwert , memberships are unlikely to go up unless attitudes towards the lesser-known religions in germany are changed . " we are warned against smaller groups which are not a part of the main church , " he said .
" and decisions to join them are met with skepticism . " tamsin walker send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the team , however , will race on . the formula one powers-that-be moved to end one of the sport 's biggest scandals in years on thursday , sept .
13 , by punishing the mclaren-mercedes racing team for having used secret technical documents acquired from rival ferrari .
but in doing so , and by fining mclaren-mercedes a massive 72 million euros -lrb- $ 100 million -rrb- and stripping the team of its constructors ' championship points , the world motor sport council may have created more controversy .
under the terms of the punishment , the british-german team has escaped being suspended from racing .
that means both world champion fernando alonso and championship leader lewis hamilton , the mclaren-mercedes team drivers , will still be allowed to race and their points in the drivers ' championship remain unaffected by the action .
mclaren drivers free to chase championship bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lewis hamilton -lrb- r . -rrb- will be able to pursue his title dream hamilton heads the drivers ' standings with 92 points , with alonso second with 89 .
ferrari drivers kimi raikkonen and felipe massa are third and fourth with 74 and 69 points , respectively .
ferrari now takes over the lead in the constructors ' standings , with bmw in second place .
the fact that the mclaren-mercedes drivers are still allowed to compete has led to some in the sport saying that the fine and punishment , in the context of the mega-bucks world of formula one , was derisory , while others were amazed by the amount demanded .
former mclaren team boss eddie jordan said the size of the punishment meted out was " baffling . "
" it does n't seem logical at all in terms of the amount of money , " jordan told bbc radio 5live .
" it is baffling .
" to the outside world this is a ridiculous amount of money , and we also need to know where is this money going to ? "
it appears as if the judgment was designed to allow everyone to emerge with some degree of satisfaction .
mclaren stands an excellent chance of winning the drivers ' championship , ferrari will almost certainly win the constructors ' title , and formula one sponsors and fans can count on a highly competitive rest of the season .
mclaren chief stands firm however , mclaren boss ron dennis said that he " did not accept " the decision to punish his team .
he told reporters that the evidence given by alonso , hamilton and team test driver pedro de la rosa demonstrated " that we did not use the leaked information to gain a competitive advantage . "
dennis was quick to stifle his ire , knowing that the punishment could have been a lot worse .
" the most important thing is that we will be going motor racing this weekend , the rest of the year and every season , " he said .
" this means that the drivers can continue to compete in the championship . "
the scandal erupted in july when a 780-page file on ferrari 's racing cars was found at the home of mclaren chief designer mike coughlan .
the documents were allegedly supplied by ferrari mechanic nigel stepney .
mclaren guilty of fraudulent conduct bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mclaren says it did not use the information from ferrari at an earlier hearing on july 26 , the council had found mclaren guilty of fraudulent conduct for having the documents in its possession but did not punish the team because there was not enough evidence to suggest that it had misused the information contained in the documents .
however , the council had warned mclaren that the team could be banned for two seasons if it were proven it had used the material to gain an unfair advantage .
last week , the fia had announced that evidence had been found that warranted a new hearing .
this evidence reportedly included e-mails between alonso and de la rosa and transcripts of phone and text-message conversations between coughlan and stepney .
" in light of new evidence , facts and behavior of an extremely serious nature and grossly prejudicial to the interest of the sport have been further demonstrated , " the ferrari team said in a statement .

it 's no secret that both the catholic and protestant churches in germany have long faced the problem of shrinking congregations , but has the nation irrevocably turned its back on its religious heritage ? in the past six decades , the number of german citizens belonging to one of the country 's two main churches has fallen from 94.4 to just shy of 62 percent .
and although the trend has slowed , there is no indication of a reversal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many young germans are alienated from religion carsten frerk who runs fowid , a research group on belief systems in germany , says the church has lost its power and , perhaps more crucially , it has lost the nation 's youth . " children in germany are no longer born into a religion in the way they used to be , " frerk said .
" young people are not forced into a religious culture anymore . " the younger generations have too many choices at their disposal and this is what keeps them away from making binding ideological decisions .
according to frerk , the rate at which young people break away from religious groups will soon put non-denominational germans in the majority . " one percent of christians are leaving the church every year , " he said .
" so in 20 years from now , they 'll be the minority . " europe 's christian identity but opinions divide on whether germany has irrevocably turned its back on religion . hubert seiwert , a professor of comparative religious studies , says that although there is a widespread belief that religion and all things modern stand in direct opposition to one another , the death knell has yet to toll for christianity in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is islam in europe making europeans more aware of their christian roots ?
at the moment , the tendency in german society is to talk about religion in the context of conflicts , but not otherwise . " take the islam issue for example , " seiwert said .
" that is something people are taking seriously . " but discussions about islam and its role in western , secular societies have prompted many germans to re-examine their own religious roots . " suddenly people are talking about europe having a christian identity , " he said . according to reinhard holmer , director of germany 's evangelische allianz , an association of evangelical christians , people are nowadays , in fact , beginning to ask more questions about what religion can offer . " religious issues are becoming more mainstream and people want to know what answers the church can provide , " holmer said . seeking spirituality elsewhere bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german mormons are welcoming new members to their church for many , those answers have not been satisfying enough to keep them coming back for more .
but just because people have left the largest church communities does n't always mean they have turned their backs on religion , or indeed christianity , entirely . " some people leave the church because it is too lackadaisical while they are looking for something more charismatic , " seiwert said . although such leaps of faith are the exception rather than the rule , seiwert claims a growing number of people are seeking spiritual fulfillment outside the mainstream churches .
and there are literally dozens of alternative religions - christian and otherwise - waiting to welcome new recruits into the fold .
some have to wait longer than others . small but steady growth ralf grünke , spokesman for germany 's church of the latter-day saints - also known as mormons - says 1,066 people of all denominations have joined its ranks over the past two years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smaller religious groups in germany are often looked upon with skepticism " the church is attractive to people of all backgrounds , " grünke said , " because it is lively and our sermons are conducted by laypeople rather than vicars . " the jehovah 's witnesses in germany record an average annual increase in membership of between 0.5 and 1.5 percent .
other groups , such as the bible fellowship church and the seventh-day adventists also claim to have witnessed a small increase of members over the past years . according to seiwert , memberships are unlikely to go up unless attitudes towards the lesser-known religions in germany are changed . " we are warned against smaller groups which are not a part of the main church , " he said .
" and decisions to join them are met with skepticism . " tamsin walker send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

since 2006 , he 's also been a member of the supervisory board at volkswagen . dw-world.de : ahead of the iaa , the dispute over co2 emission targets has been getting louder and harsher .
you 've publicly stated your opinion .
do you have a better concept ? wendelin wiedeking : first of all , i think that the automobile industry is not the biggest emitter of co2 , even though it 's always presented that way .
in germany , for example , passenger cars are responsible for only 12 percent of co2 emissions .
we , the car industry , have worked on environment issues over the last years and decades .
we 'll continue to reduce co2 emissions in the coming years with modern engines and modern cars .
i think the car industry is not as bad as its image . global warming can be felt and environmental protection is a big issue .
how do you bring together environmental consciousness and powerful luxury sports cars ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : porsche unveiled a new hybrid engine earlier this year our sports cars , for example , have the lowest co2 emissions per horsepower because of extensive research work .
if our technology were used in small or medium-sized cars , they could already emit much less .
it 's the strategy of german premium producers to test technology , invest a lot of money , and introduce the technology step by step via mid-sized cars into small ones .
a good example is mercedes-benz 's abs technology , which was first introduced in s-class models many years ago - at a high cost , also for customers .
today it 's hard to think of cars without abs breaking systems .
it 's going to be like that in the future as well .
we need a variety of offerings - high-end cars , medium-sized cars and small ones - in order for the car industry to move forward in terms of technology . porsche is germany 's smallest car producer , but also the most profitable one .
how much money do you invest in research ? we spend significantly more than 10 percent of revenue on research and development each year .
that means that we invest in new technologies probably in a way unlike any other producer .
porsche thrives on new technologies , on issues such as environment , safety and driving pleasure in a way that many others ca n't or do n't want to .
we 're investing disproportionately in the future . what do you think about the current debate to protect companies against foreign takeovers ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vw and porsche have co-built cars for decades there are many nations that find it important to control key sectors .
the americans take the stand that foreigners can not buy anything that gets anywhere near arms production .
newspapers and publishing companies on the other hand can be bought .
in other words , it 's perfectly natural for americans to protect many sectors .
europeans did n't have that until now .
the state has to take on a certain protective function for the country , i can understand that .
it has to be watched , of course . a free society has to allow free capital flow . do you ever worry that porsche might be taken over by another company ? i 've actually never worried about that because i know that the porsche and piech families - the only stockholders allowed to vote - stand firmly behind the company and its tradition .
as long as the company makes money , i am sure that both families wo n't think about selling . what 's the relationship between porsche and vw like ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wiedeking thinks his cars are to kneel down for i think that we 've worked hard at porsche over the last couple of years .

why not get yourself down to sauerland and get an eyeful of some good old-fashioned deer porn . when it comes to getting kinky kicks in germany , most people know that the place to go is the reeperbahn area of hamburg .
the sleazy mile of brothels and clubs offering all manner of dances - lap , table and pole - has become world famous for providing everything that seekers of sexual thrills could hope for .
but even the reeperbahn has its boundaries when it comes to pushing the envelope of lust and desire , which is why the notorious hamburg quarter may start losing customers in search of the hottest stag party .
those wanting the ultimate in horny action with a new and risqué take on voyeuristic pleasure need look no further than the ruhr area in the western german state of north-rhine westphalia .
heading into the forests around the town of arnsberg-vosswinkel , those looking for something a little unusual and au natural can pay 40 euros -lrb- $ 56 -rrb- for the pleasure of a whole night watching the locals rut wildly .
perverts beware : this is not a bestiality bus trip bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " hey babes , wanna rut ? "
before bus loads of international perverts start flooding to the region in search of exhibitionist sauerlanders , it must be revealed at this point that those performing during these night-long steamy outdoor sessions are not humans .
if that only speeds up the flow of deviants , then it must also be noted that these organized trips into the wild are run by wildwald vosswinkel , a well-respected nature trust , and that sexually excited adults are discouraged from attending .
the trust has been organizing trips into the sauerland forests for decades but only recently have they struck on the idea of bussing nature lovers into the woods to watch the local red deer mating season up close .
from sept .
22 to oct .
21 , wildwald will be taking the curious to the best rutting areas in the forests , where young stags fight over the available deer babes before claiming their prize in the time-honored fashion .
organizers shocked by questions of weirdness bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " does the ear tag and collar ensemble do anything for you ? "
despite it all being very natural and above board , there remains something a little weird about groups of humans - children included - hiding in the bushes watching animals have sex … and paying for the privilege .
" it 's not weird because we observe the deer purely from an educational perspective and our staff are always on hand to offer insight and answer questions on what is one of nature 's most fascinating rituals , " wildwald 's spokesperson told dw-world.de. okay , but surely if there is a group of people standing around with night-vision equipment , observing and asking questions about a stag 's moves , that 's going to upset the rhythm and spoil the magic for the deer .
" no , " assured the wildwald spokesperson .
" we keep the people at a good distance where they can observe safely and can not disturb the animals .
wildwald has been taking people into the woods for 30 years and we know how to respect the privacy of the animals there . "
so there you have it .
a nature expedition or just some good old deer porn ?
we 'll let you decide .
those wanting to get their names down for the hot buck-on-doe action have until oct .

14 , in portugal , the continued strength of the euro was a concern , although finance chiefs said economic growth should hold .
france got a deficit scolding . before the 13 ministers got down to business in the northern city of porto , portugal on friday , they took a ride on a river cruiser up the douro river .
the message in this time of global credit upheavals seemed to be : do n't rock the boat .
europe is enjoying healthy growth and financial chiefs do n't want the us sub-prime rate crisis or a muscle-bound euro to throw it off track .
" we are able to handle situations like -lrb- the current economic uncertainty -rrb- , " austrian finance minister wilhelm molterer told journalists as the 13 gathered for a working breakfast .
" the european economy is robust and stable . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european central bank president jean-claude trichet is worried about financial market volatility the reassuring words come after the euro hit a record high of $ 1.3927 on thursday , reviving fears that an overly strong currency could hurt euro-zone exports by making them more expensive on international markets .
" we are following very closely all developments that can occur " on currency markets , said luxembourg 's prime minister jean-claude juncker , who chaired the meeting .
ministers were careful , however , not to overplay their concerns , fearful that hitting the panic button could unnerve financial markets reeling from a slew of bad economic news of late .
besides the strong euro , it appears that the international fall-out from the sub-prime crisis in the us , which was sparked by high-risk home mortgage lending , is continuing .
impact , but not a huge one analysts say the creeping paralysis that the sub-prime crisis has caused has occurred not because banks have necessarily lost money as a consequence of the crisis , but because they are not sure if they have lost money or not .
this type of uncertainty has made them wary about lending , exacerbating the problem .
on friday , news broke that british mortgage lender northern rock had been given an emergency loan by the bank of england to see it through a credit crunch .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the finance chiefs delivered a relatively upbeat assessment despite that , ministers from the 13 nations who have adopted the euro were careful to say that , while recent events will not help economic matters , the turbulence will not hurt them that much either .
" we think that the recent developments on the financial markets will have an impact , but a light impact , on the outlook for growth in 2007 toward the end of the year , " said juncker .
" we believe that economic growth will remain sufficiently robust so that in 2008 we will not see a sharp downward revision . "
the european commission lowered its euro-zone growth forecasts slightly this week - not because of the strong euro , but because of the credit crunch .
it predicted that the bloc 's economy would grow by 2.5 percent instead of 2.6 percent , which had been previously forecast .
" the fundamentals in the euro area and the european economies remain solid : profits in private companies continue to be high , balance sheets in the private sector are sound ... and unemployment is at the lowest level in the past two decades , " said joaquin almunia , the eu 's economic affairs commissioner .
france rapped on knuckles france came in for a scolding at friday 's meeting for not doing enough about its deficit and was urged to do more to bring it down .
" we think that the ambitions that france has shown do not entirely correspond to the level of our expectations , " juncker told journalists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french finance minister christine lagarde although structural reforms undertaken by france " go in the right direction and should increase growth potential , " juncker said the ministers " believe that structural reforms and budget consolidation should go together . "
euro-zone finance chiefs had committed themselves in april in berlin to balancing their budgets by 2010 , but were warned by french president nicolas sarkozy that his reform plan meant france might not be in the black until 2012 .
he wants to jolt the french economy with a growth " shock " through a series of tax cuts .
the move risks reversing the country 's downward deficit trend .
france 's finance minister christine lagarde acknowledged the dissatisfaction of her counterparts , but stressed that they had approved of sarkozy 's reform package .
if the french deficit starts rising again , it could soon break the eu rules requiring that fiscal shortfalls be kept to less than 3 percent .

" " i would have wished for the ministry to stick to its original decision , " said antje blumenthal , a member of jung 's christian democratic union , in a press statement on friday .
she added that she still believed that there were serious reasons to prohibit filming at the site , but said that she would respect the decision . in july , albig had told reporters that the memorial 's dignity would be compromised by allowing a film crew to use it . no nazi flags allowed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nazi flags at the german finance ministry in august according to a defense ministry spokesman , film director brian singer and ministry officials will jointly visit the memorial to decide what can be filmed there . bild reported that government officials will not allow the crew to display nazi flags at the site .
the crew was permitted to fly the flags at the german finance ministry , where filming took place in august . the tabloid said that the film script called for four scenes to be shot at the memorial , including stauffenberg 's execution . cruise feels " great responsibility " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cruise resembles stauffenberg in an interview with german celebrity magazine bunte in august , cruise had said he felt it was important that the movie was shot on original locations instead of a studio set .

" i carry a great responsibility to the germans , for whom a man like stauffenberg is of deep significance , and i feel this responsibility to the man himself .

why not get yourself down to sauerland and get an eyeful of some good old-fashioned deer porn . when it comes to getting kinky kicks in germany , most people know that the place to go is the reeperbahn area of hamburg .
the sleazy mile of brothels and clubs offering all manner of dances - lap , table and pole - has become world famous for providing everything that seekers of sexual thrills could hope for .
but even the reeperbahn has its boundaries when it comes to pushing the envelope of lust and desire , which is why the notorious hamburg quarter may start losing customers in search of the hottest stag party .
those wanting the ultimate in horny action with a new and risqué take on voyeuristic pleasure need look no further than the ruhr area in the western german state of north-rhine westphalia .
heading into the forests around the town of arnsberg-vosswinkel , those looking for something a little unusual and au natural can pay 40 euros -lrb- $ 56 -rrb- for the pleasure of a whole night watching the locals rut wildly .
perverts beware : this is not a bestiality bus trip bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " hey babes , wanna rut ? "
before bus loads of international perverts start flooding to the region in search of exhibitionist sauerlanders , it must be revealed at this point that those performing during these night-long steamy outdoor sessions are not humans .
if that only speeds up the flow of deviants , then it must also be noted that these organized trips into the wild are run by wildwald vosswinkel , a well-respected nature trust , and that sexually excited adults are discouraged from attending .
the trust has been organizing trips into the sauerland forests for decades but only recently have they struck on the idea of bussing nature lovers into the woods to watch the local red deer mating season up close .
from sept .
22 to oct .
21 , wildwald will be taking the curious to the best rutting areas in the forests , where young stags fight over the available deer babes before claiming their prize in the time-honored fashion .
organizers shocked by questions of weirdness bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " does the ear tag and collar ensemble do anything for you ? "
despite it all being very natural and above board , there remains something a little weird about groups of humans - children included - hiding in the bushes watching animals have sex … and paying for the privilege .
" it 's not weird because we observe the deer purely from an educational perspective and our staff are always on hand to offer insight and answer questions on what is one of nature 's most fascinating rituals , " wildwald 's spokesperson told dw-world.de. okay , but surely if there is a group of people standing around with night-vision equipment , observing and asking questions about a stag 's moves , that 's going to upset the rhythm and spoil the magic for the deer .
" no , " assured the wildwald spokesperson .
" we keep the people at a good distance where they can observe safely and can not disturb the animals .
wildwald has been taking people into the woods for 30 years and we know how to respect the privacy of the animals there . "
so there you have it .

it 's no secret that both the catholic and protestant churches in germany have long faced the problem of shrinking congregations , but has the nation irrevocably turned its back on its religious heritage ? in the past six decades , the number of german citizens belonging to one of the country 's two main churches has fallen from 94.4 to just shy of 62 percent .
and although the trend has slowed , there is no indication of a reversal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many young germans are alienated from religion carsten frerk who runs fowid , a research group on belief systems in germany , says the church has lost its power and , perhaps more crucially , it has lost the nation 's youth . " children in germany are no longer born into a religion in the way they used to be , " frerk said .
" young people are not forced into a religious culture anymore . " the younger generations have too many choices at their disposal and this is what keeps them away from making binding ideological decisions .
according to frerk , the rate at which young people break away from religious groups will soon put non-denominational germans in the majority . " one percent of christians are leaving the church every year , " he said .
" so in 20 years from now , they 'll be the minority . " europe 's christian identity but opinions divide on whether germany has irrevocably turned its back on religion . hubert seiwert , a professor of comparative religious studies , says that although there is a widespread belief that religion and all things modern stand in direct opposition to one another , the death knell has yet to toll for christianity in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is islam in europe making europeans more aware of their christian roots ?
at the moment , the tendency in german society is to talk about religion in the context of conflicts , but not otherwise . " take the islam issue for example , " seiwert said .
" that is something people are taking seriously . " but discussions about islam and its role in western , secular societies have prompted many germans to re-examine their own religious roots . " suddenly people are talking about europe having a christian identity , " he said . according to reinhard holmer , director of germany 's evangelische allianz , an association of evangelical christians , people are nowadays , in fact , beginning to ask more questions about what religion can offer . " religious issues are becoming more mainstream and people want to know what answers the church can provide , " holmer said . seeking spirituality elsewhere bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german mormons are welcoming new members to their church for many , those answers have not been satisfying enough to keep them coming back for more .
but just because people have left the largest church communities does n't always mean they have turned their backs on religion , or indeed christianity , entirely . " some people leave the church because it is too lackadaisical while they are looking for something more charismatic , " seiwert said . although such leaps of faith are the exception rather than the rule , seiwert claims a growing number of people are seeking spiritual fulfillment outside the mainstream churches .
and there are literally dozens of alternative religions - christian and otherwise - waiting to welcome new recruits into the fold .
some have to wait longer than others . small but steady growth ralf grünke , spokesman for germany 's church of the latter-day saints - also known as mormons - says 1,066 people of all denominations have joined its ranks over the past two years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smaller religious groups in germany are often looked upon with skepticism " the church is attractive to people of all backgrounds , " grünke said , " because it is lively and our sermons are conducted by laypeople rather than vicars . " the jehovah 's witnesses in germany record an average annual increase in membership of between 0.5 and 1.5 percent .
other groups , such as the bible fellowship church and the seventh-day adventists also claim to have witnessed a small increase of members over the past years . according to seiwert , memberships are unlikely to go up unless attitudes towards the lesser-known religions in germany are changed .

the signatories called for the eu , nato and the nato-russia council to be involved in future missile defense talks .
" a decision to station the missiles must not be taken unilaterally or bilaterally , since this is a major issue affecting the security of the whole of europe , " they said .
no new arms race in europe , urges beck bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spd leader beck called for chancellor angela merkel to oppose the missile shield beck said the statement was also a message to conservative german chancellor angela merkel , with whom the social democrats jointly rule , aimed at convincing the chancellor to oppose the shield and any new arms race in europe .

the hungarian social democrats were the only invitees who refused to sign up to the wide-ranging rebuff of us attempts to site a tracking radar in the czech republic and 10 interceptor missiles in neighboring poland at a two-day meeting of party leaders in prague .
" the hungarian social democratic party believes that europe is exposed to a terrorist attack and we have to defend ourselves against it , " the hungarian statement issued by defense minister and deputy party chairman imre szekeres read .
" individual countries should decide on their cooperation in this area .
we recognize their right to do so . "

washington is currently in talks with the conservative governments in poland - where it wants to put 10 ground-based interceptor missiles - and in the czech republic , which is meant to host a radar base .
the socialist movements in both countries have been vehemently opposed to the plan and signaled their position on friday by signing the declaration .

it 's no secret that both the catholic and protestant churches in germany have long faced the problem of shrinking congregations , but has the nation irrevocably turned its back on its religious heritage ? in the past six decades , the number of german citizens belonging to one of the country 's two main churches has fallen from 94.4 to just shy of 62 percent .
and although the trend has slowed , there is no indication of a reversal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many young germans are alienated from religion carsten frerk who runs fowid , a research group on belief systems in germany , says the church has lost its power and , perhaps more crucially , it has lost the nation 's youth . " children in germany are no longer born into a religion in the way they used to be , " frerk said .
" young people are not forced into a religious culture anymore . " the younger generations have too many choices at their disposal and this is what keeps them away from making binding ideological decisions .
according to frerk , the rate at which young people break away from religious groups will soon put non-denominational germans in the majority . " one percent of christians are leaving the church every year , " he said .
" so in 20 years from now , they 'll be the minority . " europe 's christian identity but opinions divide on whether germany has irrevocably turned its back on religion . hubert seiwert , a professor of comparative religious studies , says that although there is a widespread belief that religion and all things modern stand in direct opposition to one another , the death knell has yet to toll for christianity in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is islam in europe making europeans more aware of their christian roots ?
at the moment , the tendency in german society is to talk about religion in the context of conflicts , but not otherwise . " take the islam issue for example , " seiwert said .
" that is something people are taking seriously . " but discussions about islam and its role in western , secular societies have prompted many germans to re-examine their own religious roots . " suddenly people are talking about europe having a christian identity , " he said . according to reinhard holmer , director of germany 's evangelische allianz , an association of evangelical christians , people are nowadays , in fact , beginning to ask more questions about what religion can offer . " religious issues are becoming more mainstream and people want to know what answers the church can provide , " holmer said . seeking spirituality elsewhere bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german mormons are welcoming new members to their church for many , those answers have not been satisfying enough to keep them coming back for more .
but just because people have left the largest church communities does n't always mean they have turned their backs on religion , or indeed christianity , entirely . " some people leave the church because it is too lackadaisical while they are looking for something more charismatic , " seiwert said . although such leaps of faith are the exception rather than the rule , seiwert claims a growing number of people are seeking spiritual fulfillment outside the mainstream churches .
and there are literally dozens of alternative religions - christian and otherwise - waiting to welcome new recruits into the fold .
some have to wait longer than others . small but steady growth ralf grünke , spokesman for germany 's church of the latter-day saints - also known as mormons - says 1,066 people of all denominations have joined its ranks over the past two years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smaller religious groups in germany are often looked upon with skepticism " the church is attractive to people of all backgrounds , " grünke said , " because it is lively and our sermons are conducted by laypeople rather than vicars . " the jehovah 's witnesses in germany record an average annual increase in membership of between 0.5 and 1.5 percent .
other groups , such as the bible fellowship church and the seventh-day adventists also claim to have witnessed a small increase of members over the past years . according to seiwert , memberships are unlikely to go up unless attitudes towards the lesser-known religions in germany are changed . " we are warned against smaller groups which are not a part of the main church , " he said .
" and decisions to join them are met with skepticism . " tamsin walker send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

why not get yourself down to sauerland and get an eyeful of some good old-fashioned deer porn . when it comes to getting kinky kicks in germany , most people know that the place to go is the reeperbahn area of hamburg .
the sleazy mile of brothels and clubs offering all manner of dances - lap , table and pole - has become world famous for providing everything that seekers of sexual thrills could hope for .
but even the reeperbahn has its boundaries when it comes to pushing the envelope of lust and desire , which is why the notorious hamburg quarter may start losing customers in search of the hottest stag party .
those wanting the ultimate in horny action with a new and risqué take on voyeuristic pleasure need look no further than the ruhr area in the western german state of north-rhine westphalia .
heading into the forests around the town of arnsberg-vosswinkel , those looking for something a little unusual and au natural can pay 40 euros -lrb- $ 56 -rrb- for the pleasure of a whole night watching the locals rut wildly .
perverts beware : this is not a bestiality bus trip bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " hey babes , wanna rut ? "
before bus loads of international perverts start flooding to the region in search of exhibitionist sauerlanders , it must be revealed at this point that those performing during these night-long steamy outdoor sessions are not humans .
if that only speeds up the flow of deviants , then it must also be noted that these organized trips into the wild are run by wildwald vosswinkel , a well-respected nature trust , and that sexually excited adults are discouraged from attending .
the trust has been organizing trips into the sauerland forests for decades but only recently have they struck on the idea of bussing nature lovers into the woods to watch the local red deer mating season up close .
from sept .
22 to oct .
21 , wildwald will be taking the curious to the best rutting areas in the forests , where young stags fight over the available deer babes before claiming their prize in the time-honored fashion .
organizers shocked by questions of weirdness bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " does the ear tag and collar ensemble do anything for you ? "
despite it all being very natural and above board , there remains something a little weird about groups of humans - children included - hiding in the bushes watching animals have sex … and paying for the privilege .
" it 's not weird because we observe the deer purely from an educational perspective and our staff are always on hand to offer insight and answer questions on what is one of nature 's most fascinating rituals , " wildwald 's spokesperson told dw-world.de. okay , but surely if there is a group of people standing around with night-vision equipment , observing and asking questions about a stag 's moves , that 's going to upset the rhythm and spoil the magic for the deer .
" no , " assured the wildwald spokesperson .
" we keep the people at a good distance where they can observe safely and can not disturb the animals .
wildwald has been taking people into the woods for 30 years and we know how to respect the privacy of the animals there . "
so there you have it .
a nature expedition or just some good old deer porn ?
we 'll let you decide .

france got a deficit scolding . before the 13 ministers got down to business in the northern city of porto , portugal on friday , they took a ride on a river cruiser up the douro river .
the message in this time of global credit upheavals seemed to be : do n't rock the boat .
europe is enjoying healthy growth and financial chiefs do n't want the us sub-prime rate crisis or a muscle-bound euro to throw it off track .

" we are following very closely all developments that can occur " on currency markets , said luxembourg 's prime minister jean-claude juncker , who chaired the meeting .
ministers were careful , however , not to overplay their concerns , fearful that hitting the panic button could unnerve financial markets reeling from a slew of bad economic news of late .

" we think that the recent developments on the financial markets will have an impact , but a light impact , on the outlook for growth in 2007 toward the end of the year , " said juncker .
" we believe that economic growth will remain sufficiently robust so that in 2008 we will not see a sharp downward revision . "
the european commission lowered its euro-zone growth forecasts slightly this week - not because of the strong euro , but because of the credit crunch .
it predicted that the bloc 's economy would grow by 2.5 percent instead of 2.6 percent , which had been previously forecast .
" the fundamentals in the euro area and the european economies remain solid : profits in private companies continue to be high , balance sheets in the private sector are sound ... and unemployment is at the lowest level in the past two decades , " said joaquin almunia , the eu 's economic affairs commissioner .

he wants to jolt the french economy with a growth " shock " through a series of tax cuts .
the move risks reversing the country 's downward deficit trend .
france 's finance minister christine lagarde acknowledged the dissatisfaction of her counterparts , but stressed that they had approved of sarkozy 's reform package .

since 2006 , he 's also been a member of the supervisory board at volkswagen . dw-world.de : ahead of the iaa , the dispute over co2 emission targets has been getting louder and harsher .
you 've publicly stated your opinion .
do you have a better concept ? wendelin wiedeking : first of all , i think that the automobile industry is not the biggest emitter of co2 , even though it 's always presented that way .
in germany , for example , passenger cars are responsible for only 12 percent of co2 emissions .
we , the car industry , have worked on environment issues over the last years and decades .
we 'll continue to reduce co2 emissions in the coming years with modern engines and modern cars .
i think the car industry is not as bad as its image . global warming can be felt and environmental protection is a big issue .
how do you bring together environmental consciousness and powerful luxury sports cars ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : porsche unveiled a new hybrid engine earlier this year our sports cars , for example , have the lowest co2 emissions per horsepower because of extensive research work .
if our technology were used in small or medium-sized cars , they could already emit much less .
it 's the strategy of german premium producers to test technology , invest a lot of money , and introduce the technology step by step via mid-sized cars into small ones .
a good example is mercedes-benz 's abs technology , which was first introduced in s-class models many years ago - at a high cost , also for customers .
today it 's hard to think of cars without abs breaking systems .
it 's going to be like that in the future as well .
we need a variety of offerings - high-end cars , medium-sized cars and small ones - in order for the car industry to move forward in terms of technology . porsche is germany 's smallest car producer , but also the most profitable one .
how much money do you invest in research ? we spend significantly more than 10 percent of revenue on research and development each year .
that means that we invest in new technologies probably in a way unlike any other producer .
porsche thrives on new technologies , on issues such as environment , safety and driving pleasure in a way that many others ca n't or do n't want to .
we 're investing disproportionately in the future . what do you think about the current debate to protect companies against foreign takeovers ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vw and porsche have co-built cars for decades there are many nations that find it important to control key sectors .
the americans take the stand that foreigners can not buy anything that gets anywhere near arms production .
newspapers and publishing companies on the other hand can be bought .
in other words , it 's perfectly natural for americans to protect many sectors .
europeans did n't have that until now .
the state has to take on a certain protective function for the country , i can understand that .
it has to be watched , of course . a free society has to allow free capital flow . do you ever worry that porsche might be taken over by another company ? i 've actually never worried about that because i know that the porsche and piech families - the only stockholders allowed to vote - stand firmly behind the company and its tradition .
as long as the company makes money , i am sure that both families wo n't think about selling . what 's the relationship between porsche and vw like ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wiedeking thinks his cars are to kneel down for i think that we 've worked hard at porsche over the last couple of years .
we were able to take over vw shares at a manageable cost .
we own more than 31 percent of vw shares .
the relationship between porsche and volkswagen is very good and that 's why it made sense for us to get involved .
we were able to afford it and vw shares were cheap . what does the ceo of porsche do during his spare time ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iaa visitors can check out wiedeking 's potato salad i harvested potatoes with a porsche tractor last saturday .
the potato salad that you can get here -lsb- at the iaa -rsb- is made from my potatoes . you 're fascinated by technology and have often said you 've always just concentrated on the things that brought you forward .
could one say that you 're a humor-less person in real life ? you 'll have to ask the people around me how boring i am .
because i have so little free time , i only do the things i want to do .
i have a great collection of tools , probably the best you can imagine .
i have all the tools you need to build things , but i also like to go to music events once in a while .
when i have time , i really like to live well .
i 'm usually the last one to leave a party , but that just does n't happen very often . what 's your motto ? no risk , no fun ! interview : zhu hong -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it 's no secret that both the catholic and protestant churches in germany have long faced the problem of shrinking congregations , but has the nation irrevocably turned its back on its religious heritage ? in the past six decades , the number of german citizens belonging to one of the country 's two main churches has fallen from 94.4 to just shy of 62 percent .
and although the trend has slowed , there is no indication of a reversal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many young germans are alienated from religion carsten frerk who runs fowid , a research group on belief systems in germany , says the church has lost its power and , perhaps more crucially , it has lost the nation 's youth . " children in germany are no longer born into a religion in the way they used to be , " frerk said .
" young people are not forced into a religious culture anymore . " the younger generations have too many choices at their disposal and this is what keeps them away from making binding ideological decisions .
according to frerk , the rate at which young people break away from religious groups will soon put non-denominational germans in the majority . " one percent of christians are leaving the church every year , " he said .
" so in 20 years from now , they 'll be the minority . " europe 's christian identity but opinions divide on whether germany has irrevocably turned its back on religion . hubert seiwert , a professor of comparative religious studies , says that although there is a widespread belief that religion and all things modern stand in direct opposition to one another , the death knell has yet to toll for christianity in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is islam in europe making europeans more aware of their christian roots ?
at the moment , the tendency in german society is to talk about religion in the context of conflicts , but not otherwise . " take the islam issue for example , " seiwert said .
" that is something people are taking seriously . " but discussions about islam and its role in western , secular societies have prompted many germans to re-examine their own religious roots . " suddenly people are talking about europe having a christian identity , " he said . according to reinhard holmer , director of germany 's evangelische allianz , an association of evangelical christians , people are nowadays , in fact , beginning to ask more questions about what religion can offer . " religious issues are becoming more mainstream and people want to know what answers the church can provide , " holmer said . seeking spirituality elsewhere bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german mormons are welcoming new members to their church for many , those answers have not been satisfying enough to keep them coming back for more .
but just because people have left the largest church communities does n't always mean they have turned their backs on religion , or indeed christianity , entirely . " some people leave the church because it is too lackadaisical while they are looking for something more charismatic , " seiwert said . although such leaps of faith are the exception rather than the rule , seiwert claims a growing number of people are seeking spiritual fulfillment outside the mainstream churches .
and there are literally dozens of alternative religions - christian and otherwise - waiting to welcome new recruits into the fold .
some have to wait longer than others . small but steady growth ralf grünke , spokesman for germany 's church of the latter-day saints - also known as mormons - says 1,066 people of all denominations have joined its ranks over the past two years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smaller religious groups in germany are often looked upon with skepticism " the church is attractive to people of all backgrounds , " grünke said , " because it is lively and our sermons are conducted by laypeople rather than vicars . " the jehovah 's witnesses in germany record an average annual increase in membership of between 0.5 and 1.5 percent .
other groups , such as the bible fellowship church and the seventh-day adventists also claim to have witnessed a small increase of members over the past years . according to seiwert , memberships are unlikely to go up unless attitudes towards the lesser-known religions in germany are changed . " we are warned against smaller groups which are not a part of the main church , " he said .
" and decisions to join them are met with skepticism . " tamsin walker send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

france got a deficit scolding . before the 13 ministers got down to business in the northern city of porto , portugal on friday , they took a ride on a river cruiser up the douro river .
the message in this time of global credit upheavals seemed to be : do n't rock the boat .
europe is enjoying healthy growth and financial chiefs do n't want the us sub-prime rate crisis or a muscle-bound euro to throw it off track .
" we are able to handle situations like -lrb- the current economic uncertainty -rrb- , " austrian finance minister wilhelm molterer told journalists as the 13 gathered for a working breakfast .
" the european economy is robust and stable . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european central bank president jean-claude trichet is worried about financial market volatility the reassuring words come after the euro hit a record high of $ 1.3927 on thursday , reviving fears that an overly strong currency could hurt euro-zone exports by making them more expensive on international markets .
" we are following very closely all developments that can occur " on currency markets , said luxembourg 's prime minister jean-claude juncker , who chaired the meeting .
ministers were careful , however , not to overplay their concerns , fearful that hitting the panic button could unnerve financial markets reeling from a slew of bad economic news of late .
besides the strong euro , it appears that the international fall-out from the sub-prime crisis in the us , which was sparked by high-risk home mortgage lending , is continuing .
impact , but not a huge one analysts say the creeping paralysis that the sub-prime crisis has caused has occurred not because banks have necessarily lost money as a consequence of the crisis , but because they are not sure if they have lost money or not .
this type of uncertainty has made them wary about lending , exacerbating the problem .
on friday , news broke that british mortgage lender northern rock had been given an emergency loan by the bank of england to see it through a credit crunch .

" we think that the recent developments on the financial markets will have an impact , but a light impact , on the outlook for growth in 2007 toward the end of the year , " said juncker .
" we believe that economic growth will remain sufficiently robust so that in 2008 we will not see a sharp downward revision . "
the european commission lowered its euro-zone growth forecasts slightly this week - not because of the strong euro , but because of the credit crunch .
it predicted that the bloc 's economy would grow by 2.5 percent instead of 2.6 percent , which had been previously forecast .
" the fundamentals in the euro area and the european economies remain solid : profits in private companies continue to be high , balance sheets in the private sector are sound ... and unemployment is at the lowest level in the past two decades , " said joaquin almunia , the eu 's economic affairs commissioner .
france rapped on knuckles france came in for a scolding at friday 's meeting for not doing enough about its deficit and was urged to do more to bring it down .
" we think that the ambitions that france has shown do not entirely correspond to the level of our expectations , " juncker told journalists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french finance minister christine lagarde although structural reforms undertaken by france " go in the right direction and should increase growth potential , " juncker said the ministers " believe that structural reforms and budget consolidation should go together .

euro-zone finance chiefs had committed themselves in april in berlin to balancing their budgets by 2010 , but were warned by french president nicolas sarkozy that his reform plan meant france might not be in the black until 2012 .
he wants to jolt the french economy with a growth " shock " through a series of tax cuts .
the move risks reversing the country 's downward deficit trend .
france 's finance minister christine lagarde acknowledged the dissatisfaction of her counterparts , but stressed that they had approved of sarkozy 's reform package .
if the french deficit starts rising again , it could soon break the eu rules requiring that fiscal shortfalls be kept to less than 3 percent .

" religious issues are becoming more mainstream and people want to know what answers the church can provide , " holmer said . seeking spirituality elsewhere bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german mormons are welcoming new members to their church for many , those answers have not been satisfying enough to keep them coming back for more .
but just because people have left the largest church communities does n't always mean they have turned their backs on religion , or indeed christianity , entirely . " some people leave the church because it is too lackadaisical while they are looking for something more charismatic , " seiwert said . although such leaps of faith are the exception rather than the rule , seiwert claims a growing number of people are seeking spiritual fulfillment outside the mainstream churches .
and there are literally dozens of alternative religions - christian and otherwise - waiting to welcome new recruits into the fold .
some have to wait longer than others . small but steady growth ralf grünke , spokesman for germany 's church of the latter-day saints - also known as mormons - says 1,066 people of all denominations have joined its ranks over the past two years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smaller religious groups in germany are often looked upon with skepticism " the church is attractive to people of all backgrounds , " grünke said , " because it is lively and our sermons are conducted by laypeople rather than vicars . " the jehovah 's witnesses in germany record an average annual increase in membership of between 0.5 and 1.5 percent .
other groups , such as the bible fellowship church and the seventh-day adventists also claim to have witnessed a small increase of members over the past years . according to seiwert , memberships are unlikely to go up unless attitudes towards the lesser-known religions in germany are changed . " we are warned against smaller groups which are not a part of the main church , " he said .

14 , in portugal , the continued strength of the euro was a concern , although finance chiefs said economic growth should hold .
france got a deficit scolding . before the 13 ministers got down to business in the northern city of porto , portugal on friday , they took a ride on a river cruiser up the douro river .
the message in this time of global credit upheavals seemed to be : do n't rock the boat .
europe is enjoying healthy growth and financial chiefs do n't want the us sub-prime rate crisis or a muscle-bound euro to throw it off track .
" we are able to handle situations like -lrb- the current economic uncertainty -rrb- , " austrian finance minister wilhelm molterer told journalists as the 13 gathered for a working breakfast .
" the european economy is robust and stable . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european central bank president jean-claude trichet is worried about financial market volatility the reassuring words come after the euro hit a record high of $ 1.3927 on thursday , reviving fears that an overly strong currency could hurt euro-zone exports by making them more expensive on international markets .
" we are following very closely all developments that can occur " on currency markets , said luxembourg 's prime minister jean-claude juncker , who chaired the meeting .
ministers were careful , however , not to overplay their concerns , fearful that hitting the panic button could unnerve financial markets reeling from a slew of bad economic news of late .
besides the strong euro , it appears that the international fall-out from the sub-prime crisis in the us , which was sparked by high-risk home mortgage lending , is continuing .
impact , but not a huge one analysts say the creeping paralysis that the sub-prime crisis has caused has occurred not because banks have necessarily lost money as a consequence of the crisis , but because they are not sure if they have lost money or not .
this type of uncertainty has made them wary about lending , exacerbating the problem .
on friday , news broke that british mortgage lender northern rock had been given an emergency loan by the bank of england to see it through a credit crunch .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the finance chiefs delivered a relatively upbeat assessment despite that , ministers from the 13 nations who have adopted the euro were careful to say that , while recent events will not help economic matters , the turbulence will not hurt them that much either .
" we think that the recent developments on the financial markets will have an impact , but a light impact , on the outlook for growth in 2007 toward the end of the year , " said juncker .
" we believe that economic growth will remain sufficiently robust so that in 2008 we will not see a sharp downward revision . "
the european commission lowered its euro-zone growth forecasts slightly this week - not because of the strong euro , but because of the credit crunch .
it predicted that the bloc 's economy would grow by 2.5 percent instead of 2.6 percent , which had been previously forecast .
" the fundamentals in the euro area and the european economies remain solid : profits in private companies continue to be high , balance sheets in the private sector are sound ... and unemployment is at the lowest level in the past two decades , " said joaquin almunia , the eu 's economic affairs commissioner .
france rapped on knuckles france came in for a scolding at friday 's meeting for not doing enough about its deficit and was urged to do more to bring it down .
" we think that the ambitions that france has shown do not entirely correspond to the level of our expectations , " juncker told journalists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french finance minister christine lagarde although structural reforms undertaken by france " go in the right direction and should increase growth potential , " juncker said the ministers " believe that structural reforms and budget consolidation should go together . "
euro-zone finance chiefs had committed themselves in april in berlin to balancing their budgets by 2010 , but were warned by french president nicolas sarkozy that his reform plan meant france might not be in the black until 2012 .
he wants to jolt the french economy with a growth " shock " through a series of tax cuts .
the move risks reversing the country 's downward deficit trend .
france 's finance minister christine lagarde acknowledged the dissatisfaction of her counterparts , but stressed that they had approved of sarkozy 's reform package .
if the french deficit starts rising again , it could soon break the eu rules requiring that fiscal shortfalls be kept to less than 3 percent .
" we will make every effort to reach the berlin objectives in so far as the economic situation permits , " lagarde said . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

whether they want to or not , people are swept away by the current of change .
the search for orientation in this world is immense and many people look to religion for support and answers .
be it the pope , who is celebrated like a pop star in the west , or islamist groups that are finding more followers in the arab world , religion is once again an issue .

why not get yourself down to sauerland and get an eyeful of some good old-fashioned deer porn . when it comes to getting kinky kicks in germany , most people know that the place to go is the reeperbahn area of hamburg .
the sleazy mile of brothels and clubs offering all manner of dances - lap , table and pole - has become world famous for providing everything that seekers of sexual thrills could hope for .
but even the reeperbahn has its boundaries when it comes to pushing the envelope of lust and desire , which is why the notorious hamburg quarter may start losing customers in search of the hottest stag party .
those wanting the ultimate in horny action with a new and risqué take on voyeuristic pleasure need look no further than the ruhr area in the western german state of north-rhine westphalia .
heading into the forests around the town of arnsberg-vosswinkel , those looking for something a little unusual and au natural can pay 40 euros -lrb- $ 56 -rrb- for the pleasure of a whole night watching the locals rut wildly .
perverts beware : this is not a bestiality bus trip bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " hey babes , wanna rut ? "
before bus loads of international perverts start flooding to the region in search of exhibitionist sauerlanders , it must be revealed at this point that those performing during these night-long steamy outdoor sessions are not humans .
if that only speeds up the flow of deviants , then it must also be noted that these organized trips into the wild are run by wildwald vosswinkel , a well-respected nature trust , and that sexually excited adults are discouraged from attending .
the trust has been organizing trips into the sauerland forests for decades but only recently have they struck on the idea of bussing nature lovers into the woods to watch the local red deer mating season up close .
from sept .
22 to oct .
21 , wildwald will be taking the curious to the best rutting areas in the forests , where young stags fight over the available deer babes before claiming their prize in the time-honored fashion .
organizers shocked by questions of weirdness bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " does the ear tag and collar ensemble do anything for you ? "
despite it all being very natural and above board , there remains something a little weird about groups of humans - children included - hiding in the bushes watching animals have sex … and paying for the privilege .
" it 's not weird because we observe the deer purely from an educational perspective and our staff are always on hand to offer insight and answer questions on what is one of nature 's most fascinating rituals , " wildwald 's spokesperson told dw-world.de. okay , but surely if there is a group of people standing around with night-vision equipment , observing and asking questions about a stag 's moves , that 's going to upset the rhythm and spoil the magic for the deer .
" no , " assured the wildwald spokesperson .
" we keep the people at a good distance where they can observe safely and can not disturb the animals .
wildwald has been taking people into the woods for 30 years and we know how to respect the privacy of the animals there . "
so there you have it .
a nature expedition or just some good old deer porn ?
we 'll let you decide .
those wanting to get their names down for the hot buck-on-doe action have until oct .

the team , however , will race on . the formula one powers-that-be moved to end one of the sport 's biggest scandals in years on thursday , sept .
13 , by punishing the mclaren-mercedes racing team for having used secret technical documents acquired from rival ferrari .
but in doing so , and by fining mclaren-mercedes a massive 72 million euros -lrb- $ 100 million -rrb- and stripping the team of its constructors ' championship points , the world motor sport council may have created more controversy .
under the terms of the punishment , the british-german team has escaped being suspended from racing .
that means both world champion fernando alonso and championship leader lewis hamilton , the mclaren-mercedes team drivers , will still be allowed to race and their points in the drivers ' championship remain unaffected by the action .
mclaren drivers free to chase championship bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lewis hamilton -lrb- r . -rrb- will be able to pursue his title dream hamilton heads the drivers ' standings with 92 points , with alonso second with 89 .
ferrari drivers kimi raikkonen and felipe massa are third and fourth with 74 and 69 points , respectively .
ferrari now takes over the lead in the constructors ' standings , with bmw in second place .
the fact that the mclaren-mercedes drivers are still allowed to compete has led to some in the sport saying that the fine and punishment , in the context of the mega-bucks world of formula one , was derisory , while others were amazed by the amount demanded .
former mclaren team boss eddie jordan said the size of the punishment meted out was " baffling . "
" it does n't seem logical at all in terms of the amount of money , " jordan told bbc radio 5live .
" it is baffling .
" to the outside world this is a ridiculous amount of money , and we also need to know where is this money going to ? "
it appears as if the judgment was designed to allow everyone to emerge with some degree of satisfaction .
mclaren stands an excellent chance of winning the drivers ' championship , ferrari will almost certainly win the constructors ' title , and formula one sponsors and fans can count on a highly competitive rest of the season .
mclaren chief stands firm however , mclaren boss ron dennis said that he " did not accept " the decision to punish his team .
he told reporters that the evidence given by alonso , hamilton and team test driver pedro de la rosa demonstrated " that we did not use the leaked information to gain a competitive advantage . "
dennis was quick to stifle his ire , knowing that the punishment could have been a lot worse .
" the most important thing is that we will be going motor racing this weekend , the rest of the year and every season , " he said .
" this means that the drivers can continue to compete in the championship . "
the scandal erupted in july when a 780-page file on ferrari 's racing cars was found at the home of mclaren chief designer mike coughlan .
the documents were allegedly supplied by ferrari mechanic nigel stepney .
mclaren guilty of fraudulent conduct bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mclaren says it did not use the information from ferrari at an earlier hearing on july 26 , the council had found mclaren guilty of fraudulent conduct for having the documents in its possession but did not punish the team because there was not enough evidence to suggest that it had misused the information contained in the documents .
however , the council had warned mclaren that the team could be banned for two seasons if it were proven it had used the material to gain an unfair advantage .
last week , the fia had announced that evidence had been found that warranted a new hearing .
this evidence reportedly included e-mails between alonso and de la rosa and transcripts of phone and text-message conversations between coughlan and stepney .
" in light of new evidence , facts and behavior of an extremely serious nature and grossly prejudicial to the interest of the sport have been further demonstrated , " the ferrari team said in a statement .
" ferrari is satisfied that the truth has now emerged . " dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but in doing so , and by fining mclaren-mercedes a massive 72 million euros -lrb- $ 100 million -rrb- and stripping the team of its constructors ' championship points , the world motor sport council may have created more controversy .
under the terms of the punishment , the british-german team has escaped being suspended from racing .
that means both world champion fernando alonso and championship leader lewis hamilton , the mclaren-mercedes team drivers , will still be allowed to race and their points in the drivers ' championship remain unaffected by the action .

former mclaren team boss eddie jordan said the size of the punishment meted out was " baffling . "
" it does n't seem logical at all in terms of the amount of money , " jordan told bbc radio 5live .
" it is baffling .
" to the outside world this is a ridiculous amount of money , and we also need to know where is this money going to ? "

he told reporters that the evidence given by alonso , hamilton and team test driver pedro de la rosa demonstrated " that we did not use the leaked information to gain a competitive advantage . "
dennis was quick to stifle his ire , knowing that the punishment could have been a lot worse .
" the most important thing is that we will be going motor racing this weekend , the rest of the year and every season , " he said .
" this means that the drivers can continue to compete in the championship . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : germany 's political parties in crisis germany 's political parties in crisis german parties begin early search for future partners expert says germany 's parties must reinvent themselves cdu puts new twist on conservative politics politics -pipe- 14.09.2007 greens politician : democracy needs more heart and soul großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : democracy has to be defended on a daily basis , but political parties are n't the only ones responsible : citizens also have to do their part , writes omid nouripour in his guest commentary for dw-world.de. " what 's happening to our political parties ? "
it 's a question i get asked again and again as a parliamentarian .
the question is usually followed by more : " do you think that parties still represent the people ?
do they still know what citizens are worried about ? "
all this then quickly leads to a debate about the " end of party democracy . "
on the one hand , one should n't just accept the common stereotype that - in simple terms - parties and politicians are responsible for the current problems .
on the other hand , citizens also have a certain responsibility for democracy .
" let the state , let politics fix it . "
democracy is n't that easy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : omid nouripour at 32 , i 'm a fairly young german , who spent the first 13 years of his life in iran .
it 's a country where absolutely nothing could and can be taken for granted that seems so natural to us in germany : freedom of opinion , freedom of the press , the rule of law and - last , but not least - the right to free elections .
here , people , unfortunately , take these achievements for granted .
but taking things for granted usually leads to indifference .
" do n't talk to me about indifference , " some might say .
" we 're all staunch democrats , but we do n't have to pretend each day that democracy has to be reinvented . "
still , there are extreme situations in which democracy might not have to be reinvented , but certainly defended on a daily basis - for example , in light of the recurring right-wing extremist attacks on foreigners or people who appear foreign , which are , to put it mildly , " tolerated " by bystanders .
if we give right-wing extremists a free rein , we not only turn away and forfeit any kind of humanity and moral courage , we also question our democratic freedom and rights , as the ideology of right-wing extremists is founded on arbitrariness , hatred and violence .
today , they go against those who look different , tomorrow against those , who simply say what they think .
but i also miss civic participation to safeguard democratic values in less extreme situations - for example , when the current government increasingly wants to curtail civil rights and snoop around the privacy of citizens .
i still have n't heard the cry of protest from staunch democrats in cases such as limiting data protection by saving airplane passenger information , telecommunications data retention , online searches of private computers or insufficient protection for minorities .
" those who would give up essential liberty to purchase a little temporary safety , deserve neither liberty nor safety , " this quote attributed to benjamin franklin has been used a lot during the current discussion , but has rarely been heard .
democracy only works when there 's a balance of freedom and safety .
that 's why i think that a functioning democracy needs citizens who do n't grow tired of defending democratic values and freedoms .
democracy could do with a bit more heart and soul .
parties are commonly seen as the ground zero of all weariness when it comes to politics and democracy .
they are no longer trusted .
-lrb- were they ever ? -rrb-
they make a lot of promises and keep very few of them .
they are not able to solve the problems that lie ahead of us .
their work mainly concentrates on their own interests or those that they 've been drawn to by lobbyists .
their personnel is interested in power and status symbols , such as official cars , and has no scruples about enriching itself via regular pay raises that are taken from the public coffers .
this image has been around for quite some time .
considering the scandals that are regularly uncovered , it 's hard to counter this assessment of politicians and parties - just think of the party financing scandal of the christian democratic union and the demystification of the republic 's " eternal " political leading figure , former chancellor helmut kohl .
all those who claim that politics is a business like any other are wrong : politicians bear a special responsibility and have a special duty to integrity and independence .
citizens have a right to a " transparent representative , " who tells them what he earns and where his money comes from .
every politician should know that he can not ask citizens to be completely honest when it comes to taxes , but use - on good advice , in most cases - every possible loophole that he can find or has created himself .
credibility also gets lost when scandals are uncovered but have no ramifications .
roland koch , the " ruthless scout " with dubious involvement in the cdu 's financing scandal , is still state premier of hesse .
franz-josef jung , his former chief-of-staff , who stepped down because of the scandal in september 2000 , is now germany 's defense minister .
that 's not just frustrating .
it 's scandalous .
so who should fix it then ?
talk about the " failure of parties " is often followed by the demand to replace party politicians with experts .
after all , the latter are seen as impartial and have to know what 's really needed .
parties on the other hand are biased .
but how much objectivity can democracy stand ?
parties produce opinions , differing assessments , interpretations and conclusions about current facts and developments .
they do n't deliver " truths , " even if they like to pretend they do .
democratic pluralism is based on a multitude of more or less subjective opinions and assessments that citizens can choose from .
one can admittedly question to what extent parties currently fulfill that task .
if only experts decide on policy , the " objective truth " suddenly moves to the center of politics - a truth that only a small elite of specialists has knowledge about .
democracy would become an " expertocracy " that 's much less transparent and much harder for citizens to influence .
that 's why i can not imagine democracy without parties .
and still , democracy goes beyond the concept of parties .
some backroom party strategist may fantasize about taking complete control of democracy , but that wo n't happen .
our party system is n't static but mirrors societal changes .
the current weakening of peoples ' parties and the increasing number of five-party parliaments is proof of this .
in my opinion , it 's crucial to strengthen awareness for democratic freedom and values - within parties and within society .
if we manage to do that and if parties will be more open to new ideas and supporters than they have been so far , quite a few tired democrats might become wide awake again - and help to build party membership .

if we manage to do that and if parties will be more open to new ideas and supporters than they have been so far , quite a few tired democrats might become wide awake again - and help to build party membership .

" what 's happening to our political parties ? "
it 's a question i get asked again and again as a parliamentarian .
the question is usually followed by more : " do you think that parties still represent the people ?
do they still know what citizens are worried about ? "
all this then quickly leads to a debate about the " end of party democracy . "
on the one hand , one should n't just accept the common stereotype that - in simple terms - parties and politicians are responsible for the current problems .
on the other hand , citizens also have a certain responsibility for democracy .
" let the state , let politics fix it . "
democracy is n't that easy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : omid nouripour at 32 , i 'm a fairly young german , who spent the first 13 years of his life in iran .
it 's a country where absolutely nothing could and can be taken for granted that seems so natural to us in germany : freedom of opinion , freedom of the press , the rule of law and - last , but not least - the right to free elections .
here , people , unfortunately , take these achievements for granted .
but taking things for granted usually leads to indifference .
" do n't talk to me about indifference , " some might say .
" we 're all staunch democrats , but we do n't have to pretend each day that democracy has to be reinvented . "
still , there are extreme situations in which democracy might not have to be reinvented , but certainly defended on a daily basis - for example , in light of the recurring right-wing extremist attacks on foreigners or people who appear foreign , which are , to put it mildly , " tolerated " by bystanders .
if we give right-wing extremists a free rein , we not only turn away and forfeit any kind of humanity and moral courage , we also question our democratic freedom and rights , as the ideology of right-wing extremists is founded on arbitrariness , hatred and violence .
today , they go against those who look different , tomorrow against those , who simply say what they think .
but i also miss civic participation to safeguard democratic values in less extreme situations - for example , when the current government increasingly wants to curtail civil rights and snoop around the privacy of citizens .
i still have n't heard the cry of protest from staunch democrats in cases such as limiting data protection by saving airplane passenger information , telecommunications data retention , online searches of private computers or insufficient protection for minorities .
" those who would give up essential liberty to purchase a little temporary safety , deserve neither liberty nor safety , " this quote attributed to benjamin franklin has been used a lot during the current discussion , but has rarely been heard .
democracy only works when there 's a balance of freedom and safety .
that 's why i think that a functioning democracy needs citizens who do n't grow tired of defending democratic values and freedoms .
democracy could do with a bit more heart and soul .
parties are commonly seen as the ground zero of all weariness when it comes to politics and democracy .
they are no longer trusted .
-lrb- were they ever ? -rrb-
they make a lot of promises and keep very few of them .
they are not able to solve the problems that lie ahead of us .
their work mainly concentrates on their own interests or those that they 've been drawn to by lobbyists .
their personnel is interested in power and status symbols , such as official cars , and has no scruples about enriching itself via regular pay raises that are taken from the public coffers .
this image has been around for quite some time .
considering the scandals that are regularly uncovered , it 's hard to counter this assessment of politicians and parties - just think of the party financing scandal of the christian democratic union and the demystification of the republic 's " eternal " political leading figure , former chancellor helmut kohl .
all those who claim that politics is a business like any other are wrong : politicians bear a special responsibility and have a special duty to integrity and independence .
citizens have a right to a " transparent representative , " who tells them what he earns and where his money comes from .
every politician should know that he can not ask citizens to be completely honest when it comes to taxes , but use - on good advice , in most cases - every possible loophole that he can find or has created himself .
credibility also gets lost when scandals are uncovered but have no ramifications .
roland koch , the " ruthless scout " with dubious involvement in the cdu 's financing scandal , is still state premier of hesse .
franz-josef jung , his former chief-of-staff , who stepped down because of the scandal in september 2000 , is now germany 's defense minister .
that 's not just frustrating .
it 's scandalous .
so who should fix it then ?
talk about the " failure of parties " is often followed by the demand to replace party politicians with experts .
after all , the latter are seen as impartial and have to know what 's really needed .
parties on the other hand are biased .
but how much objectivity can democracy stand ?
parties produce opinions , differing assessments , interpretations and conclusions about current facts and developments .
they do n't deliver " truths , " even if they like to pretend they do .
democratic pluralism is based on a multitude of more or less subjective opinions and assessments that citizens can choose from .
one can admittedly question to what extent parties currently fulfill that task .
if only experts decide on policy , the " objective truth " suddenly moves to the center of politics - a truth that only a small elite of specialists has knowledge about .
democracy would become an " expertocracy " that 's much less transparent and much harder for citizens to influence .
that 's why i can not imagine democracy without parties .
and still , democracy goes beyond the concept of parties .
some backroom party strategist may fantasize about taking complete control of democracy , but that wo n't happen .
our party system is n't static but mirrors societal changes .
the current weakening of peoples ' parties and the increasing number of five-party parliaments is proof of this .
in my opinion , it 's crucial to strengthen awareness for democratic freedom and values - within parties and within society .
if we manage to do that and if parties will be more open to new ideas and supporters than they have been so far , quite a few tired democrats might become wide awake again - and help to build party membership .

you 've publicly stated your opinion .
do you have a better concept ? wendelin wiedeking : first of all , i think that the automobile industry is not the biggest emitter of co2 , even though it 's always presented that way .
in germany , for example , passenger cars are responsible for only 12 percent of co2 emissions .
we , the car industry , have worked on environment issues over the last years and decades .
we 'll continue to reduce co2 emissions in the coming years with modern engines and modern cars .
i think the car industry is not as bad as its image . global warming can be felt and environmental protection is a big issue .

if our technology were used in small or medium-sized cars , they could already emit much less .
it 's the strategy of german premium producers to test technology , invest a lot of money , and introduce the technology step by step via mid-sized cars into small ones .
a good example is mercedes-benz 's abs technology , which was first introduced in s-class models many years ago - at a high cost , also for customers .
today it 's hard to think of cars without abs breaking systems .
it 's going to be like that in the future as well .
we need a variety of offerings - high-end cars , medium-sized cars and small ones - in order for the car industry to move forward in terms of technology . porsche is germany 's smallest car producer , but also the most profitable one .
how much money do you invest in research ? we spend significantly more than 10 percent of revenue on research and development each year .
that means that we invest in new technologies probably in a way unlike any other producer .
porsche thrives on new technologies , on issues such as environment , safety and driving pleasure in a way that many others ca n't or do n't want to .
we 're investing disproportionately in the future . what do you think about the current debate to protect companies against foreign takeovers ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vw and porsche have co-built cars for decades there are many nations that find it important to control key sectors .
the americans take the stand that foreigners can not buy anything that gets anywhere near arms production .

in other words , it 's perfectly natural for americans to protect many sectors .
europeans did n't have that until now .
the state has to take on a certain protective function for the country , i can understand that .
it has to be watched , of course . a free society has to allow free capital flow . do you ever worry that porsche might be taken over by another company ? i 've actually never worried about that because i know that the porsche and piech families - the only stockholders allowed to vote - stand firmly behind the company and its tradition .

we 're investing disproportionately in the future . what do you think about the current debate to protect companies against foreign takeovers ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vw and porsche have co-built cars for decades there are many nations that find it important to control key sectors .
the americans take the stand that foreigners can not buy anything that gets anywhere near arms production .
newspapers and publishing companies on the other hand can be bought .
in other words , it 's perfectly natural for americans to protect many sectors .
europeans did n't have that until now .
the state has to take on a certain protective function for the country , i can understand that .
it has to be watched , of course . a free society has to allow free capital flow . do you ever worry that porsche might be taken over by another company ? i 've actually never worried about that because i know that the porsche and piech families - the only stockholders allowed to vote - stand firmly behind the company and its tradition .
as long as the company makes money , i am sure that both families wo n't think about selling . what 's the relationship between porsche and vw like ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wiedeking thinks his cars are to kneel down for i think that we 've worked hard at porsche over the last couple of years .
we were able to take over vw shares at a manageable cost .
we own more than 31 percent of vw shares .
the relationship between porsche and volkswagen is very good and that 's why it made sense for us to get involved .
we were able to afford it and vw shares were cheap . what does the ceo of porsche do during his spare time ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iaa visitors can check out wiedeking 's potato salad i harvested potatoes with a porsche tractor last saturday .
the potato salad that you can get here -lsb- at the iaa -rsb- is made from my potatoes . you 're fascinated by technology and have often said you 've always just concentrated on the things that brought you forward .
could one say that you 're a humor-less person in real life ? you 'll have to ask the people around me how boring i am .
because i have so little free time , i only do the things i want to do .
i have a great collection of tools , probably the best you can imagine .
i have all the tools you need to build things , but i also like to go to music events once in a while .
when i have time , i really like to live well .
i 'm usually the last one to leave a party , but that just does n't happen very often . what 's your motto ? no risk , no fun ! interview : zhu hong -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" what 's happening to our political parties ? "
it 's a question i get asked again and again as a parliamentarian .
the question is usually followed by more : " do you think that parties still represent the people ?
do they still know what citizens are worried about ? "
all this then quickly leads to a debate about the " end of party democracy . "
on the one hand , one should n't just accept the common stereotype that - in simple terms - parties and politicians are responsible for the current problems .
on the other hand , citizens also have a certain responsibility for democracy .
" let the state , let politics fix it . "
democracy is n't that easy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : omid nouripour at 32 , i 'm a fairly young german , who spent the first 13 years of his life in iran .
it 's a country where absolutely nothing could and can be taken for granted that seems so natural to us in germany : freedom of opinion , freedom of the press , the rule of law and - last , but not least - the right to free elections .
here , people , unfortunately , take these achievements for granted .
but taking things for granted usually leads to indifference .
" do n't talk to me about indifference , " some might say .
" we 're all staunch democrats , but we do n't have to pretend each day that democracy has to be reinvented . "
still , there are extreme situations in which democracy might not have to be reinvented , but certainly defended on a daily basis - for example , in light of the recurring right-wing extremist attacks on foreigners or people who appear foreign , which are , to put it mildly , " tolerated " by bystanders .
if we give right-wing extremists a free rein , we not only turn away and forfeit any kind of humanity and moral courage , we also question our democratic freedom and rights , as the ideology of right-wing extremists is founded on arbitrariness , hatred and violence .
today , they go against those who look different , tomorrow against those , who simply say what they think .
but i also miss civic participation to safeguard democratic values in less extreme situations - for example , when the current government increasingly wants to curtail civil rights and snoop around the privacy of citizens .
i still have n't heard the cry of protest from staunch democrats in cases such as limiting data protection by saving airplane passenger information , telecommunications data retention , online searches of private computers or insufficient protection for minorities .
" those who would give up essential liberty to purchase a little temporary safety , deserve neither liberty nor safety , " this quote attributed to benjamin franklin has been used a lot during the current discussion , but has rarely been heard .
democracy only works when there 's a balance of freedom and safety .
that 's why i think that a functioning democracy needs citizens who do n't grow tired of defending democratic values and freedoms .
democracy could do with a bit more heart and soul .
parties are commonly seen as the ground zero of all weariness when it comes to politics and democracy .
they are no longer trusted .
-lrb- were they ever ? -rrb-
they make a lot of promises and keep very few of them .
they are not able to solve the problems that lie ahead of us .
their work mainly concentrates on their own interests or those that they 've been drawn to by lobbyists .
their personnel is interested in power and status symbols , such as official cars , and has no scruples about enriching itself via regular pay raises that are taken from the public coffers .
this image has been around for quite some time .
considering the scandals that are regularly uncovered , it 's hard to counter this assessment of politicians and parties - just think of the party financing scandal of the christian democratic union and the demystification of the republic 's " eternal " political leading figure , former chancellor helmut kohl .
all those who claim that politics is a business like any other are wrong : politicians bear a special responsibility and have a special duty to integrity and independence .
citizens have a right to a " transparent representative , " who tells them what he earns and where his money comes from .
every politician should know that he can not ask citizens to be completely honest when it comes to taxes , but use - on good advice , in most cases - every possible loophole that he can find or has created himself .
credibility also gets lost when scandals are uncovered but have no ramifications .
roland koch , the " ruthless scout " with dubious involvement in the cdu 's financing scandal , is still state premier of hesse .
franz-josef jung , his former chief-of-staff , who stepped down because of the scandal in september 2000 , is now germany 's defense minister .
that 's not just frustrating .
it 's scandalous .
so who should fix it then ?
talk about the " failure of parties " is often followed by the demand to replace party politicians with experts .
after all , the latter are seen as impartial and have to know what 's really needed .
parties on the other hand are biased .
but how much objectivity can democracy stand ?
parties produce opinions , differing assessments , interpretations and conclusions about current facts and developments .
they do n't deliver " truths , " even if they like to pretend they do .
democratic pluralism is based on a multitude of more or less subjective opinions and assessments that citizens can choose from .
one can admittedly question to what extent parties currently fulfill that task .
if only experts decide on policy , the " objective truth " suddenly moves to the center of politics - a truth that only a small elite of specialists has knowledge about .
democracy would become an " expertocracy " that 's much less transparent and much harder for citizens to influence .
that 's why i can not imagine democracy without parties .
and still , democracy goes beyond the concept of parties .
some backroom party strategist may fantasize about taking complete control of democracy , but that wo n't happen .
our party system is n't static but mirrors societal changes .
the current weakening of peoples ' parties and the increasing number of five-party parliaments is proof of this .
in my opinion , it 's crucial to strengthen awareness for democratic freedom and values - within parties and within society .
if we manage to do that and if parties will be more open to new ideas and supporters than they have been so far , quite a few tired democrats might become wide awake again - and help to build party membership .

the team , however , will race on . the formula one powers-that-be moved to end one of the sport 's biggest scandals in years on thursday , sept .
13 , by punishing the mclaren-mercedes racing team for having used secret technical documents acquired from rival ferrari .
but in doing so , and by fining mclaren-mercedes a massive 72 million euros -lrb- $ 100 million -rrb- and stripping the team of its constructors ' championship points , the world motor sport council may have created more controversy .
under the terms of the punishment , the british-german team has escaped being suspended from racing .
that means both world champion fernando alonso and championship leader lewis hamilton , the mclaren-mercedes team drivers , will still be allowed to race and their points in the drivers ' championship remain unaffected by the action .
mclaren drivers free to chase championship bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lewis hamilton -lrb- r . -rrb- will be able to pursue his title dream hamilton heads the drivers ' standings with 92 points , with alonso second with 89 .
ferrari drivers kimi raikkonen and felipe massa are third and fourth with 74 and 69 points , respectively .
ferrari now takes over the lead in the constructors ' standings , with bmw in second place .
the fact that the mclaren-mercedes drivers are still allowed to compete has led to some in the sport saying that the fine and punishment , in the context of the mega-bucks world of formula one , was derisory , while others were amazed by the amount demanded .
former mclaren team boss eddie jordan said the size of the punishment meted out was " baffling . "
" it does n't seem logical at all in terms of the amount of money , " jordan told bbc radio 5live .
" it is baffling .
" to the outside world this is a ridiculous amount of money , and we also need to know where is this money going to ? "
it appears as if the judgment was designed to allow everyone to emerge with some degree of satisfaction .
mclaren stands an excellent chance of winning the drivers ' championship , ferrari will almost certainly win the constructors ' title , and formula one sponsors and fans can count on a highly competitive rest of the season .
mclaren chief stands firm however , mclaren boss ron dennis said that he " did not accept " the decision to punish his team .
he told reporters that the evidence given by alonso , hamilton and team test driver pedro de la rosa demonstrated " that we did not use the leaked information to gain a competitive advantage . "
dennis was quick to stifle his ire , knowing that the punishment could have been a lot worse .
" the most important thing is that we will be going motor racing this weekend , the rest of the year and every season , " he said .
" this means that the drivers can continue to compete in the championship . "
the scandal erupted in july when a 780-page file on ferrari 's racing cars was found at the home of mclaren chief designer mike coughlan .
the documents were allegedly supplied by ferrari mechanic nigel stepney .
mclaren guilty of fraudulent conduct bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mclaren says it did not use the information from ferrari at an earlier hearing on july 26 , the council had found mclaren guilty of fraudulent conduct for having the documents in its possession but did not punish the team because there was not enough evidence to suggest that it had misused the information contained in the documents .
however , the council had warned mclaren that the team could be banned for two seasons if it were proven it had used the material to gain an unfair advantage .
last week , the fia had announced that evidence had been found that warranted a new hearing .
this evidence reportedly included e-mails between alonso and de la rosa and transcripts of phone and text-message conversations between coughlan and stepney .
" in light of new evidence , facts and behavior of an extremely serious nature and grossly prejudicial to the interest of the sport have been further demonstrated , " the ferrari team said in a statement .
" ferrari is satisfied that the truth has now emerged . " dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

since 2006 , he 's also been a member of the supervisory board at volkswagen . dw-world.de : ahead of the iaa , the dispute over co2 emission targets has been getting louder and harsher .
you 've publicly stated your opinion .
do you have a better concept ? wendelin wiedeking : first of all , i think that the automobile industry is not the biggest emitter of co2 , even though it 's always presented that way .
in germany , for example , passenger cars are responsible for only 12 percent of co2 emissions .
we , the car industry , have worked on environment issues over the last years and decades .
we 'll continue to reduce co2 emissions in the coming years with modern engines and modern cars .
i think the car industry is not as bad as its image . global warming can be felt and environmental protection is a big issue .
how do you bring together environmental consciousness and powerful luxury sports cars ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : porsche unveiled a new hybrid engine earlier this year our sports cars , for example , have the lowest co2 emissions per horsepower because of extensive research work .
if our technology were used in small or medium-sized cars , they could already emit much less .
it 's the strategy of german premium producers to test technology , invest a lot of money , and introduce the technology step by step via mid-sized cars into small ones .
a good example is mercedes-benz 's abs technology , which was first introduced in s-class models many years ago - at a high cost , also for customers .
today it 's hard to think of cars without abs breaking systems .
it 's going to be like that in the future as well .
we need a variety of offerings - high-end cars , medium-sized cars and small ones - in order for the car industry to move forward in terms of technology . porsche is germany 's smallest car producer , but also the most profitable one .
how much money do you invest in research ? we spend significantly more than 10 percent of revenue on research and development each year .
that means that we invest in new technologies probably in a way unlike any other producer .
porsche thrives on new technologies , on issues such as environment , safety and driving pleasure in a way that many others ca n't or do n't want to .
we 're investing disproportionately in the future . what do you think about the current debate to protect companies against foreign takeovers ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vw and porsche have co-built cars for decades there are many nations that find it important to control key sectors .
the americans take the stand that foreigners can not buy anything that gets anywhere near arms production .
newspapers and publishing companies on the other hand can be bought .
in other words , it 's perfectly natural for americans to protect many sectors .
europeans did n't have that until now .
the state has to take on a certain protective function for the country , i can understand that .
it has to be watched , of course . a free society has to allow free capital flow . do you ever worry that porsche might be taken over by another company ? i 've actually never worried about that because i know that the porsche and piech families - the only stockholders allowed to vote - stand firmly behind the company and its tradition .
as long as the company makes money , i am sure that both families wo n't think about selling . what 's the relationship between porsche and vw like ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wiedeking thinks his cars are to kneel down for i think that we 've worked hard at porsche over the last couple of years .
we were able to take over vw shares at a manageable cost .
we own more than 31 percent of vw shares .
the relationship between porsche and volkswagen is very good and that 's why it made sense for us to get involved .
we were able to afford it and vw shares were cheap . what does the ceo of porsche do during his spare time ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iaa visitors can check out wiedeking 's potato salad i harvested potatoes with a porsche tractor last saturday .
the potato salad that you can get here -lsb- at the iaa -rsb- is made from my potatoes . you 're fascinated by technology and have often said you 've always just concentrated on the things that brought you forward .
could one say that you 're a humor-less person in real life ? you 'll have to ask the people around me how boring i am .
because i have so little free time , i only do the things i want to do .
i have a great collection of tools , probably the best you can imagine .
i have all the tools you need to build things , but i also like to go to music events once in a while .
when i have time , i really like to live well .
i 'm usually the last one to leave a party , but that just does n't happen very often . what 's your motto ? no risk , no fun ! interview : zhu hong -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de from the fringe -pipe- 14.09.2007 a nature expedition or merely deer porn ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : insert obvious and infantile comment about " feeling horny " here stuck for something to do with the family at the weekend ?
why not get yourself down to sauerland and get an eyeful of some good old-fashioned deer porn . when it comes to getting kinky kicks in germany , most people know that the place to go is the reeperbahn area of hamburg .
the sleazy mile of brothels and clubs offering all manner of dances - lap , table and pole - has become world famous for providing everything that seekers of sexual thrills could hope for .
but even the reeperbahn has its boundaries when it comes to pushing the envelope of lust and desire , which is why the notorious hamburg quarter may start losing customers in search of the hottest stag party .
those wanting the ultimate in horny action with a new and risqué take on voyeuristic pleasure need look no further than the ruhr area in the western german state of north-rhine westphalia .
heading into the forests around the town of arnsberg-vosswinkel , those looking for something a little unusual and au natural can pay 40 euros -lrb- $ 56 -rrb- for the pleasure of a whole night watching the locals rut wildly .
perverts beware : this is not a bestiality bus trip bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " hey babes , wanna rut ? "
before bus loads of international perverts start flooding to the region in search of exhibitionist sauerlanders , it must be revealed at this point that those performing during these night-long steamy outdoor sessions are not humans .
if that only speeds up the flow of deviants , then it must also be noted that these organized trips into the wild are run by wildwald vosswinkel , a well-respected nature trust , and that sexually excited adults are discouraged from attending .
the trust has been organizing trips into the sauerland forests for decades but only recently have they struck on the idea of bussing nature lovers into the woods to watch the local red deer mating season up close .
from sept .
22 to oct .
21 , wildwald will be taking the curious to the best rutting areas in the forests , where young stags fight over the available deer babes before claiming their prize in the time-honored fashion .
organizers shocked by questions of weirdness bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " does the ear tag and collar ensemble do anything for you ? "
despite it all being very natural and above board , there remains something a little weird about groups of humans - children included - hiding in the bushes watching animals have sex … and paying for the privilege .
" it 's not weird because we observe the deer purely from an educational perspective and our staff are always on hand to offer insight and answer questions on what is one of nature 's most fascinating rituals , " wildwald 's spokesperson told dw-world.de. okay , but surely if there is a group of people standing around with night-vision equipment , observing and asking questions about a stag 's moves , that 's going to upset the rhythm and spoil the magic for the deer .
" no , " assured the wildwald spokesperson .
" we keep the people at a good distance where they can observe safely and can not disturb the animals .
wildwald has been taking people into the woods for 30 years and we know how to respect the privacy of the animals there . "
so there you have it .
a nature expedition or just some good old deer porn ?
we 'll let you decide .
those wanting to get their names down for the hot buck-on-doe action have until oct .
1 to reserve their places . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it 's no secret that both the catholic and protestant churches in germany have long faced the problem of shrinking congregations , but has the nation irrevocably turned its back on its religious heritage ? in the past six decades , the number of german citizens belonging to one of the country 's two main churches has fallen from 94.4 to just shy of 62 percent .

it 's no secret that both the catholic and protestant churches in germany have long faced the problem of shrinking congregations , but has the nation irrevocably turned its back on its religious heritage ? in the past six decades , the number of german citizens belonging to one of the country 's two main churches has fallen from 94.4 to just shy of 62 percent .
and although the trend has slowed , there is no indication of a reversal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many young germans are alienated from religion carsten frerk who runs fowid , a research group on belief systems in germany , says the church has lost its power and , perhaps more crucially , it has lost the nation 's youth . " children in germany are no longer born into a religion in the way they used to be , " frerk said .
" young people are not forced into a religious culture anymore . " the younger generations have too many choices at their disposal and this is what keeps them away from making binding ideological decisions .
according to frerk , the rate at which young people break away from religious groups will soon put non-denominational germans in the majority . " one percent of christians are leaving the church every year , " he said .
" so in 20 years from now , they 'll be the minority . " europe 's christian identity but opinions divide on whether germany has irrevocably turned its back on religion . hubert seiwert , a professor of comparative religious studies , says that although there is a widespread belief that religion and all things modern stand in direct opposition to one another , the death knell has yet to toll for christianity in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is islam in europe making europeans more aware of their christian roots ?
at the moment , the tendency in german society is to talk about religion in the context of conflicts , but not otherwise . " take the islam issue for example , " seiwert said .
" that is something people are taking seriously . " but discussions about islam and its role in western , secular societies have prompted many germans to re-examine their own religious roots . " suddenly people are talking about europe having a christian identity , " he said . according to reinhard holmer , director of germany 's evangelische allianz , an association of evangelical christians , people are nowadays , in fact , beginning to ask more questions about what religion can offer . " religious issues are becoming more mainstream and people want to know what answers the church can provide , " holmer said . seeking spirituality elsewhere bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german mormons are welcoming new members to their church for many , those answers have not been satisfying enough to keep them coming back for more .
but just because people have left the largest church communities does n't always mean they have turned their backs on religion , or indeed christianity , entirely . " some people leave the church because it is too lackadaisical while they are looking for something more charismatic , " seiwert said . although such leaps of faith are the exception rather than the rule , seiwert claims a growing number of people are seeking spiritual fulfillment outside the mainstream churches .
and there are literally dozens of alternative religions - christian and otherwise - waiting to welcome new recruits into the fold .
some have to wait longer than others . small but steady growth ralf grünke , spokesman for germany 's church of the latter-day saints - also known as mormons - says 1,066 people of all denominations have joined its ranks over the past two years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smaller religious groups in germany are often looked upon with skepticism " the church is attractive to people of all backgrounds , " grünke said , " because it is lively and our sermons are conducted by laypeople rather than vicars . " the jehovah 's witnesses in germany record an average annual increase in membership of between 0.5 and 1.5 percent .
other groups , such as the bible fellowship church and the seventh-day adventists also claim to have witnessed a small increase of members over the past years . according to seiwert , memberships are unlikely to go up unless attitudes towards the lesser-known religions in germany are changed . " we are warned against smaller groups which are not a part of the main church , " he said .
" and decisions to join them are met with skepticism . " tamsin walker send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but in doing so , and by fining mclaren-mercedes a massive 72 million euros -lrb- $ 100 million -rrb- and stripping the team of its constructors ' championship points , the world motor sport council may have created more controversy .
under the terms of the punishment , the british-german team has escaped being suspended from racing .
that means both world champion fernando alonso and championship leader lewis hamilton , the mclaren-mercedes team drivers , will still be allowed to race and their points in the drivers ' championship remain unaffected by the action .
mclaren drivers free to chase championship bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lewis hamilton -lrb- r . -rrb- will be able to pursue his title dream hamilton heads the drivers ' standings with 92 points , with alonso second with 89 .
ferrari drivers kimi raikkonen and felipe massa are third and fourth with 74 and 69 points , respectively .
ferrari now takes over the lead in the constructors ' standings , with bmw in second place .
the fact that the mclaren-mercedes drivers are still allowed to compete has led to some in the sport saying that the fine and punishment , in the context of the mega-bucks world of formula one , was derisory , while others were amazed by the amount demanded .
former mclaren team boss eddie jordan said the size of the punishment meted out was " baffling . "
" it does n't seem logical at all in terms of the amount of money , " jordan told bbc radio 5live .
" it is baffling .
" to the outside world this is a ridiculous amount of money , and we also need to know where is this money going to ? "
it appears as if the judgment was designed to allow everyone to emerge with some degree of satisfaction .
mclaren stands an excellent chance of winning the drivers ' championship , ferrari will almost certainly win the constructors ' title , and formula one sponsors and fans can count on a highly competitive rest of the season .
mclaren chief stands firm however , mclaren boss ron dennis said that he " did not accept " the decision to punish his team .
he told reporters that the evidence given by alonso , hamilton and team test driver pedro de la rosa demonstrated " that we did not use the leaked information to gain a competitive advantage . "
dennis was quick to stifle his ire , knowing that the punishment could have been a lot worse .
" the most important thing is that we will be going motor racing this weekend , the rest of the year and every season , " he said .
" this means that the drivers can continue to compete in the championship . "
the scandal erupted in july when a 780-page file on ferrari 's racing cars was found at the home of mclaren chief designer mike coughlan .
the documents were allegedly supplied by ferrari mechanic nigel stepney .
mclaren guilty of fraudulent conduct bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mclaren says it did not use the information from ferrari at an earlier hearing on july 26 , the council had found mclaren guilty of fraudulent conduct for having the documents in its possession but did not punish the team because there was not enough evidence to suggest that it had misused the information contained in the documents .
however , the council had warned mclaren that the team could be banned for two seasons if it were proven it had used the material to gain an unfair advantage .

the team , however , will race on . the formula one powers-that-be moved to end one of the sport 's biggest scandals in years on thursday , sept .
13 , by punishing the mclaren-mercedes racing team for having used secret technical documents acquired from rival ferrari .
but in doing so , and by fining mclaren-mercedes a massive 72 million euros -lrb- $ 100 million -rrb- and stripping the team of its constructors ' championship points , the world motor sport council may have created more controversy .
under the terms of the punishment , the british-german team has escaped being suspended from racing .
that means both world champion fernando alonso and championship leader lewis hamilton , the mclaren-mercedes team drivers , will still be allowed to race and their points in the drivers ' championship remain unaffected by the action .
mclaren drivers free to chase championship bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lewis hamilton -lrb- r . -rrb- will be able to pursue his title dream hamilton heads the drivers ' standings with 92 points , with alonso second with 89 .
ferrari drivers kimi raikkonen and felipe massa are third and fourth with 74 and 69 points , respectively .
ferrari now takes over the lead in the constructors ' standings , with bmw in second place .
the fact that the mclaren-mercedes drivers are still allowed to compete has led to some in the sport saying that the fine and punishment , in the context of the mega-bucks world of formula one , was derisory , while others were amazed by the amount demanded .
former mclaren team boss eddie jordan said the size of the punishment meted out was " baffling . "
" it does n't seem logical at all in terms of the amount of money , " jordan told bbc radio 5live .
" it is baffling .
" to the outside world this is a ridiculous amount of money , and we also need to know where is this money going to ? "
it appears as if the judgment was designed to allow everyone to emerge with some degree of satisfaction .

why not get yourself down to sauerland and get an eyeful of some good old-fashioned deer porn . when it comes to getting kinky kicks in germany , most people know that the place to go is the reeperbahn area of hamburg .
the sleazy mile of brothels and clubs offering all manner of dances - lap , table and pole - has become world famous for providing everything that seekers of sexual thrills could hope for .
but even the reeperbahn has its boundaries when it comes to pushing the envelope of lust and desire , which is why the notorious hamburg quarter may start losing customers in search of the hottest stag party .
those wanting the ultimate in horny action with a new and risqué take on voyeuristic pleasure need look no further than the ruhr area in the western german state of north-rhine westphalia .
heading into the forests around the town of arnsberg-vosswinkel , those looking for something a little unusual and au natural can pay 40 euros -lrb- $ 56 -rrb- for the pleasure of a whole night watching the locals rut wildly .
perverts beware : this is not a bestiality bus trip bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " hey babes , wanna rut ? "
before bus loads of international perverts start flooding to the region in search of exhibitionist sauerlanders , it must be revealed at this point that those performing during these night-long steamy outdoor sessions are not humans .
if that only speeds up the flow of deviants , then it must also be noted that these organized trips into the wild are run by wildwald vosswinkel , a well-respected nature trust , and that sexually excited adults are discouraged from attending .
the trust has been organizing trips into the sauerland forests for decades but only recently have they struck on the idea of bussing nature lovers into the woods to watch the local red deer mating season up close .
from sept .
22 to oct .
21 , wildwald will be taking the curious to the best rutting areas in the forests , where young stags fight over the available deer babes before claiming their prize in the time-honored fashion .
organizers shocked by questions of weirdness bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " does the ear tag and collar ensemble do anything for you ? "
despite it all being very natural and above board , there remains something a little weird about groups of humans - children included - hiding in the bushes watching animals have sex … and paying for the privilege .
" it 's not weird because we observe the deer purely from an educational perspective and our staff are always on hand to offer insight and answer questions on what is one of nature 's most fascinating rituals , " wildwald 's spokesperson told dw-world.de. okay , but surely if there is a group of people standing around with night-vision equipment , observing and asking questions about a stag 's moves , that 's going to upset the rhythm and spoil the magic for the deer .
" no , " assured the wildwald spokesperson .
" we keep the people at a good distance where they can observe safely and can not disturb the animals .
wildwald has been taking people into the woods for 30 years and we know how to respect the privacy of the animals there . "

why not get yourself down to sauerland and get an eyeful of some good old-fashioned deer porn . when it comes to getting kinky kicks in germany , most people know that the place to go is the reeperbahn area of hamburg .
the sleazy mile of brothels and clubs offering all manner of dances - lap , table and pole - has become world famous for providing everything that seekers of sexual thrills could hope for .
but even the reeperbahn has its boundaries when it comes to pushing the envelope of lust and desire , which is why the notorious hamburg quarter may start losing customers in search of the hottest stag party .
those wanting the ultimate in horny action with a new and risqué take on voyeuristic pleasure need look no further than the ruhr area in the western german state of north-rhine westphalia .
heading into the forests around the town of arnsberg-vosswinkel , those looking for something a little unusual and au natural can pay 40 euros -lrb- $ 56 -rrb- for the pleasure of a whole night watching the locals rut wildly .
perverts beware : this is not a bestiality bus trip bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " hey babes , wanna rut ? "
before bus loads of international perverts start flooding to the region in search of exhibitionist sauerlanders , it must be revealed at this point that those performing during these night-long steamy outdoor sessions are not humans .
if that only speeds up the flow of deviants , then it must also be noted that these organized trips into the wild are run by wildwald vosswinkel , a well-respected nature trust , and that sexually excited adults are discouraged from attending .
the trust has been organizing trips into the sauerland forests for decades but only recently have they struck on the idea of bussing nature lovers into the woods to watch the local red deer mating season up close .
from sept .
22 to oct .
21 , wildwald will be taking the curious to the best rutting areas in the forests , where young stags fight over the available deer babes before claiming their prize in the time-honored fashion .
organizers shocked by questions of weirdness bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " does the ear tag and collar ensemble do anything for you ? "
despite it all being very natural and above board , there remains something a little weird about groups of humans - children included - hiding in the bushes watching animals have sex … and paying for the privilege .
" it 's not weird because we observe the deer purely from an educational perspective and our staff are always on hand to offer insight and answer questions on what is one of nature 's most fascinating rituals , " wildwald 's spokesperson told dw-world.de. okay , but surely if there is a group of people standing around with night-vision equipment , observing and asking questions about a stag 's moves , that 's going to upset the rhythm and spoil the magic for the deer .
" no , " assured the wildwald spokesperson .
" we keep the people at a good distance where they can observe safely and can not disturb the animals .
wildwald has been taking people into the woods for 30 years and we know how to respect the privacy of the animals there . "
so there you have it .

since 2006 , he 's also been a member of the supervisory board at volkswagen . dw-world.de : ahead of the iaa , the dispute over co2 emission targets has been getting louder and harsher .
you 've publicly stated your opinion .
do you have a better concept ? wendelin wiedeking : first of all , i think that the automobile industry is not the biggest emitter of co2 , even though it 's always presented that way .
in germany , for example , passenger cars are responsible for only 12 percent of co2 emissions .
we , the car industry , have worked on environment issues over the last years and decades .
we 'll continue to reduce co2 emissions in the coming years with modern engines and modern cars .
i think the car industry is not as bad as its image . global warming can be felt and environmental protection is a big issue .
how do you bring together environmental consciousness and powerful luxury sports cars ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : porsche unveiled a new hybrid engine earlier this year our sports cars , for example , have the lowest co2 emissions per horsepower because of extensive research work .
if our technology were used in small or medium-sized cars , they could already emit much less .
it 's the strategy of german premium producers to test technology , invest a lot of money , and introduce the technology step by step via mid-sized cars into small ones .
a good example is mercedes-benz 's abs technology , which was first introduced in s-class models many years ago - at a high cost , also for customers .
today it 's hard to think of cars without abs breaking systems .
it 's going to be like that in the future as well .
we need a variety of offerings - high-end cars , medium-sized cars and small ones - in order for the car industry to move forward in terms of technology . porsche is germany 's smallest car producer , but also the most profitable one .
how much money do you invest in research ? we spend significantly more than 10 percent of revenue on research and development each year .
that means that we invest in new technologies probably in a way unlike any other producer .
porsche thrives on new technologies , on issues such as environment , safety and driving pleasure in a way that many others ca n't or do n't want to .
we 're investing disproportionately in the future . what do you think about the current debate to protect companies against foreign takeovers ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vw and porsche have co-built cars for decades there are many nations that find it important to control key sectors .
the americans take the stand that foreigners can not buy anything that gets anywhere near arms production .
newspapers and publishing companies on the other hand can be bought .
in other words , it 's perfectly natural for americans to protect many sectors .
europeans did n't have that until now .
the state has to take on a certain protective function for the country , i can understand that .
it has to be watched , of course . a free society has to allow free capital flow . do you ever worry that porsche might be taken over by another company ? i 've actually never worried about that because i know that the porsche and piech families - the only stockholders allowed to vote - stand firmly behind the company and its tradition .
as long as the company makes money , i am sure that both families wo n't think about selling . what 's the relationship between porsche and vw like ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wiedeking thinks his cars are to kneel down for i think that we 've worked hard at porsche over the last couple of years .
we were able to take over vw shares at a manageable cost .
we own more than 31 percent of vw shares .
the relationship between porsche and volkswagen is very good and that 's why it made sense for us to get involved .
we were able to afford it and vw shares were cheap . what does the ceo of porsche do during his spare time ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iaa visitors can check out wiedeking 's potato salad i harvested potatoes with a porsche tractor last saturday .
the potato salad that you can get here -lsb- at the iaa -rsb- is made from my potatoes . you 're fascinated by technology and have often said you 've always just concentrated on the things that brought you forward .
could one say that you 're a humor-less person in real life ? you 'll have to ask the people around me how boring i am .
because i have so little free time , i only do the things i want to do .
i have a great collection of tools , probably the best you can imagine .
i have all the tools you need to build things , but i also like to go to music events once in a while .
when i have time , i really like to live well .
i 'm usually the last one to leave a party , but that just does n't happen very often . what 's your motto ? no risk , no fun ! interview : zhu hong -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

since 2006 , he 's also been a member of the supervisory board at volkswagen . dw-world.de : ahead of the iaa , the dispute over co2 emission targets has been getting louder and harsher .
you 've publicly stated your opinion .
do you have a better concept ? wendelin wiedeking : first of all , i think that the automobile industry is not the biggest emitter of co2 , even though it 's always presented that way .
in germany , for example , passenger cars are responsible for only 12 percent of co2 emissions .
we , the car industry , have worked on environment issues over the last years and decades .
we 'll continue to reduce co2 emissions in the coming years with modern engines and modern cars .
i think the car industry is not as bad as its image . global warming can be felt and environmental protection is a big issue .
how do you bring together environmental consciousness and powerful luxury sports cars ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : porsche unveiled a new hybrid engine earlier this year our sports cars , for example , have the lowest co2 emissions per horsepower because of extensive research work .
if our technology were used in small or medium-sized cars , they could already emit much less .
it 's the strategy of german premium producers to test technology , invest a lot of money , and introduce the technology step by step via mid-sized cars into small ones .
a good example is mercedes-benz 's abs technology , which was first introduced in s-class models many years ago - at a high cost , also for customers .
today it 's hard to think of cars without abs breaking systems .
it 's going to be like that in the future as well .
we need a variety of offerings - high-end cars , medium-sized cars and small ones - in order for the car industry to move forward in terms of technology . porsche is germany 's smallest car producer , but also the most profitable one .
how much money do you invest in research ? we spend significantly more than 10 percent of revenue on research and development each year .
that means that we invest in new technologies probably in a way unlike any other producer .
porsche thrives on new technologies , on issues such as environment , safety and driving pleasure in a way that many others ca n't or do n't want to .
we 're investing disproportionately in the future . what do you think about the current debate to protect companies against foreign takeovers ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vw and porsche have co-built cars for decades there are many nations that find it important to control key sectors .
the americans take the stand that foreigners can not buy anything that gets anywhere near arms production .
newspapers and publishing companies on the other hand can be bought .
in other words , it 's perfectly natural for americans to protect many sectors .
europeans did n't have that until now .
the state has to take on a certain protective function for the country , i can understand that .
it has to be watched , of course . a free society has to allow free capital flow . do you ever worry that porsche might be taken over by another company ? i 've actually never worried about that because i know that the porsche and piech families - the only stockholders allowed to vote - stand firmly behind the company and its tradition .

how much money do you invest in research ? we spend significantly more than 10 percent of revenue on research and development each year .
that means that we invest in new technologies probably in a way unlike any other producer .
porsche thrives on new technologies , on issues such as environment , safety and driving pleasure in a way that many others ca n't or do n't want to .
we 're investing disproportionately in the future . what do you think about the current debate to protect companies against foreign takeovers ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vw and porsche have co-built cars for decades there are many nations that find it important to control key sectors .
the americans take the stand that foreigners can not buy anything that gets anywhere near arms production .
newspapers and publishing companies on the other hand can be bought .
in other words , it 's perfectly natural for americans to protect many sectors .
europeans did n't have that until now .
the state has to take on a certain protective function for the country , i can understand that .
it has to be watched , of course . a free society has to allow free capital flow . do you ever worry that porsche might be taken over by another company ? i 've actually never worried about that because i know that the porsche and piech families - the only stockholders allowed to vote - stand firmly behind the company and its tradition .
as long as the company makes money , i am sure that both families wo n't think about selling . what 's the relationship between porsche and vw like ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wiedeking thinks his cars are to kneel down for i think that we 've worked hard at porsche over the last couple of years .
we were able to take over vw shares at a manageable cost .
we own more than 31 percent of vw shares .
the relationship between porsche and volkswagen is very good and that 's why it made sense for us to get involved .
we were able to afford it and vw shares were cheap . what does the ceo of porsche do during his spare time ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iaa visitors can check out wiedeking 's potato salad i harvested potatoes with a porsche tractor last saturday .
the potato salad that you can get here -lsb- at the iaa -rsb- is made from my potatoes . you 're fascinated by technology and have often said you 've always just concentrated on the things that brought you forward .
could one say that you 're a humor-less person in real life ? you 'll have to ask the people around me how boring i am .
because i have so little free time , i only do the things i want to do .
i have a great collection of tools , probably the best you can imagine .
i have all the tools you need to build things , but i also like to go to music events once in a while .
when i have time , i really like to live well .
i 'm usually the last one to leave a party , but that just does n't happen very often . what 's your motto ? no risk , no fun ! interview : zhu hong -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

14 , in portugal , the continued strength of the euro was a concern , although finance chiefs said economic growth should hold .
france got a deficit scolding . before the 13 ministers got down to business in the northern city of porto , portugal on friday , they took a ride on a river cruiser up the douro river .
the message in this time of global credit upheavals seemed to be : do n't rock the boat .
europe is enjoying healthy growth and financial chiefs do n't want the us sub-prime rate crisis or a muscle-bound euro to throw it off track .
" we are able to handle situations like -lrb- the current economic uncertainty -rrb- , " austrian finance minister wilhelm molterer told journalists as the 13 gathered for a working breakfast .
" the european economy is robust and stable . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european central bank president jean-claude trichet is worried about financial market volatility the reassuring words come after the euro hit a record high of $ 1.3927 on thursday , reviving fears that an overly strong currency could hurt euro-zone exports by making them more expensive on international markets .
" we are following very closely all developments that can occur " on currency markets , said luxembourg 's prime minister jean-claude juncker , who chaired the meeting .
ministers were careful , however , not to overplay their concerns , fearful that hitting the panic button could unnerve financial markets reeling from a slew of bad economic news of late .
besides the strong euro , it appears that the international fall-out from the sub-prime crisis in the us , which was sparked by high-risk home mortgage lending , is continuing .
impact , but not a huge one analysts say the creeping paralysis that the sub-prime crisis has caused has occurred not because banks have necessarily lost money as a consequence of the crisis , but because they are not sure if they have lost money or not .
this type of uncertainty has made them wary about lending , exacerbating the problem .
on friday , news broke that british mortgage lender northern rock had been given an emergency loan by the bank of england to see it through a credit crunch .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the finance chiefs delivered a relatively upbeat assessment despite that , ministers from the 13 nations who have adopted the euro were careful to say that , while recent events will not help economic matters , the turbulence will not hurt them that much either .
" we think that the recent developments on the financial markets will have an impact , but a light impact , on the outlook for growth in 2007 toward the end of the year , " said juncker .
" we believe that economic growth will remain sufficiently robust so that in 2008 we will not see a sharp downward revision . "
the european commission lowered its euro-zone growth forecasts slightly this week - not because of the strong euro , but because of the credit crunch .
it predicted that the bloc 's economy would grow by 2.5 percent instead of 2.6 percent , which had been previously forecast .
" the fundamentals in the euro area and the european economies remain solid : profits in private companies continue to be high , balance sheets in the private sector are sound ... and unemployment is at the lowest level in the past two decades , " said joaquin almunia , the eu 's economic affairs commissioner .
france rapped on knuckles france came in for a scolding at friday 's meeting for not doing enough about its deficit and was urged to do more to bring it down .
" we think that the ambitions that france has shown do not entirely correspond to the level of our expectations , " juncker told journalists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french finance minister christine lagarde although structural reforms undertaken by france " go in the right direction and should increase growth potential , " juncker said the ministers " believe that structural reforms and budget consolidation should go together . "
euro-zone finance chiefs had committed themselves in april in berlin to balancing their budgets by 2010 , but were warned by french president nicolas sarkozy that his reform plan meant france might not be in the black until 2012 .
he wants to jolt the french economy with a growth " shock " through a series of tax cuts .
the move risks reversing the country 's downward deficit trend .
france 's finance minister christine lagarde acknowledged the dissatisfaction of her counterparts , but stressed that they had approved of sarkozy 's reform package .
if the french deficit starts rising again , it could soon break the eu rules requiring that fiscal shortfalls be kept to less than 3 percent .

it 's no secret that both the catholic and protestant churches in germany have long faced the problem of shrinking congregations , but has the nation irrevocably turned its back on its religious heritage ? in the past six decades , the number of german citizens belonging to one of the country 's two main churches has fallen from 94.4 to just shy of 62 percent .
and although the trend has slowed , there is no indication of a reversal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many young germans are alienated from religion carsten frerk who runs fowid , a research group on belief systems in germany , says the church has lost its power and , perhaps more crucially , it has lost the nation 's youth . " children in germany are no longer born into a religion in the way they used to be , " frerk said .
" young people are not forced into a religious culture anymore . " the younger generations have too many choices at their disposal and this is what keeps them away from making binding ideological decisions .
according to frerk , the rate at which young people break away from religious groups will soon put non-denominational germans in the majority . " one percent of christians are leaving the church every year , " he said .
" so in 20 years from now , they 'll be the minority . " europe 's christian identity but opinions divide on whether germany has irrevocably turned its back on religion . hubert seiwert , a professor of comparative religious studies , says that although there is a widespread belief that religion and all things modern stand in direct opposition to one another , the death knell has yet to toll for christianity in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is islam in europe making europeans more aware of their christian roots ?
at the moment , the tendency in german society is to talk about religion in the context of conflicts , but not otherwise . " take the islam issue for example , " seiwert said .

it 's no secret that both the catholic and protestant churches in germany have long faced the problem of shrinking congregations , but has the nation irrevocably turned its back on its religious heritage ? in the past six decades , the number of german citizens belonging to one of the country 's two main churches has fallen from 94.4 to just shy of 62 percent .
and although the trend has slowed , there is no indication of a reversal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many young germans are alienated from religion carsten frerk who runs fowid , a research group on belief systems in germany , says the church has lost its power and , perhaps more crucially , it has lost the nation 's youth . " children in germany are no longer born into a religion in the way they used to be , " frerk said .
" young people are not forced into a religious culture anymore . " the younger generations have too many choices at their disposal and this is what keeps them away from making binding ideological decisions .
according to frerk , the rate at which young people break away from religious groups will soon put non-denominational germans in the majority . " one percent of christians are leaving the church every year , " he said .
" so in 20 years from now , they 'll be the minority . " europe 's christian identity but opinions divide on whether germany has irrevocably turned its back on religion . hubert seiwert , a professor of comparative religious studies , says that although there is a widespread belief that religion and all things modern stand in direct opposition to one another , the death knell has yet to toll for christianity in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is islam in europe making europeans more aware of their christian roots ?
at the moment , the tendency in german society is to talk about religion in the context of conflicts , but not otherwise . " take the islam issue for example , " seiwert said .
" that is something people are taking seriously . " but discussions about islam and its role in western , secular societies have prompted many germans to re-examine their own religious roots . " suddenly people are talking about europe having a christian identity , " he said . according to reinhard holmer , director of germany 's evangelische allianz , an association of evangelical christians , people are nowadays , in fact , beginning to ask more questions about what religion can offer .

since 2006 , he 's also been a member of the supervisory board at volkswagen . dw-world.de : ahead of the iaa , the dispute over co2 emission targets has been getting louder and harsher .
you 've publicly stated your opinion .
do you have a better concept ? wendelin wiedeking : first of all , i think that the automobile industry is not the biggest emitter of co2 , even though it 's always presented that way .
in germany , for example , passenger cars are responsible for only 12 percent of co2 emissions .
we , the car industry , have worked on environment issues over the last years and decades .
we 'll continue to reduce co2 emissions in the coming years with modern engines and modern cars .
i think the car industry is not as bad as its image . global warming can be felt and environmental protection is a big issue .
how do you bring together environmental consciousness and powerful luxury sports cars ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : porsche unveiled a new hybrid engine earlier this year our sports cars , for example , have the lowest co2 emissions per horsepower because of extensive research work .
if our technology were used in small or medium-sized cars , they could already emit much less .
it 's the strategy of german premium producers to test technology , invest a lot of money , and introduce the technology step by step via mid-sized cars into small ones .
a good example is mercedes-benz 's abs technology , which was first introduced in s-class models many years ago - at a high cost , also for customers .
today it 's hard to think of cars without abs breaking systems .
it 's going to be like that in the future as well .
we need a variety of offerings - high-end cars , medium-sized cars and small ones - in order for the car industry to move forward in terms of technology . porsche is germany 's smallest car producer , but also the most profitable one .
how much money do you invest in research ? we spend significantly more than 10 percent of revenue on research and development each year .
that means that we invest in new technologies probably in a way unlike any other producer .
porsche thrives on new technologies , on issues such as environment , safety and driving pleasure in a way that many others ca n't or do n't want to .
we 're investing disproportionately in the future . what do you think about the current debate to protect companies against foreign takeovers ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vw and porsche have co-built cars for decades there are many nations that find it important to control key sectors .
the americans take the stand that foreigners can not buy anything that gets anywhere near arms production .
newspapers and publishing companies on the other hand can be bought .
in other words , it 's perfectly natural for americans to protect many sectors .
europeans did n't have that until now .
the state has to take on a certain protective function for the country , i can understand that .
it has to be watched , of course . a free society has to allow free capital flow . do you ever worry that porsche might be taken over by another company ? i 've actually never worried about that because i know that the porsche and piech families - the only stockholders allowed to vote - stand firmly behind the company and its tradition .
as long as the company makes money , i am sure that both families wo n't think about selling . what 's the relationship between porsche and vw like ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wiedeking thinks his cars are to kneel down for i think that we 've worked hard at porsche over the last couple of years .
we were able to take over vw shares at a manageable cost .
we own more than 31 percent of vw shares .
the relationship between porsche and volkswagen is very good and that 's why it made sense for us to get involved .
we were able to afford it and vw shares were cheap . what does the ceo of porsche do during his spare time ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iaa visitors can check out wiedeking 's potato salad i harvested potatoes with a porsche tractor last saturday .
the potato salad that you can get here -lsb- at the iaa -rsb- is made from my potatoes . you 're fascinated by technology and have often said you 've always just concentrated on the things that brought you forward .
could one say that you 're a humor-less person in real life ? you 'll have to ask the people around me how boring i am .
because i have so little free time , i only do the things i want to do .
i have a great collection of tools , probably the best you can imagine .
i have all the tools you need to build things , but i also like to go to music events once in a while .
when i have time , i really like to live well .
i 'm usually the last one to leave a party , but that just does n't happen very often . what 's your motto ? no risk , no fun ! interview : zhu hong -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

why not get yourself down to sauerland and get an eyeful of some good old-fashioned deer porn . when it comes to getting kinky kicks in germany , most people know that the place to go is the reeperbahn area of hamburg .
the sleazy mile of brothels and clubs offering all manner of dances - lap , table and pole - has become world famous for providing everything that seekers of sexual thrills could hope for .
but even the reeperbahn has its boundaries when it comes to pushing the envelope of lust and desire , which is why the notorious hamburg quarter may start losing customers in search of the hottest stag party .
those wanting the ultimate in horny action with a new and risqué take on voyeuristic pleasure need look no further than the ruhr area in the western german state of north-rhine westphalia .
heading into the forests around the town of arnsberg-vosswinkel , those looking for something a little unusual and au natural can pay 40 euros -lrb- $ 56 -rrb- for the pleasure of a whole night watching the locals rut wildly .
perverts beware : this is not a bestiality bus trip bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " hey babes , wanna rut ? "
before bus loads of international perverts start flooding to the region in search of exhibitionist sauerlanders , it must be revealed at this point that those performing during these night-long steamy outdoor sessions are not humans .
if that only speeds up the flow of deviants , then it must also be noted that these organized trips into the wild are run by wildwald vosswinkel , a well-respected nature trust , and that sexually excited adults are discouraged from attending .
the trust has been organizing trips into the sauerland forests for decades but only recently have they struck on the idea of bussing nature lovers into the woods to watch the local red deer mating season up close .
from sept .
22 to oct .
21 , wildwald will be taking the curious to the best rutting areas in the forests , where young stags fight over the available deer babes before claiming their prize in the time-honored fashion .
organizers shocked by questions of weirdness bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " does the ear tag and collar ensemble do anything for you ? "
despite it all being very natural and above board , there remains something a little weird about groups of humans - children included - hiding in the bushes watching animals have sex … and paying for the privilege .
" it 's not weird because we observe the deer purely from an educational perspective and our staff are always on hand to offer insight and answer questions on what is one of nature 's most fascinating rituals , " wildwald 's spokesperson told dw-world.de. okay , but surely if there is a group of people standing around with night-vision equipment , observing and asking questions about a stag 's moves , that 's going to upset the rhythm and spoil the magic for the deer .
" no , " assured the wildwald spokesperson .
" we keep the people at a good distance where they can observe safely and can not disturb the animals .
wildwald has been taking people into the woods for 30 years and we know how to respect the privacy of the animals there . "
so there you have it .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : the return of religion promises of miracles attract millions to nigeria 's churches theologian küng : christianity gets on many people 's nerves ex-muslims demand right to renounce islamic faith most european nations keep god out of constitution religion -pipe- 14.09.2007 in search of germany 's religious identity großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what does the cross mean for germans today ?
it 's no secret that both the catholic and protestant churches in germany have long faced the problem of shrinking congregations , but has the nation irrevocably turned its back on its religious heritage ? in the past six decades , the number of german citizens belonging to one of the country 's two main churches has fallen from 94.4 to just shy of 62 percent .
and although the trend has slowed , there is no indication of a reversal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many young germans are alienated from religion carsten frerk who runs fowid , a research group on belief systems in germany , says the church has lost its power and , perhaps more crucially , it has lost the nation 's youth . " children in germany are no longer born into a religion in the way they used to be , " frerk said .
" young people are not forced into a religious culture anymore . " the younger generations have too many choices at their disposal and this is what keeps them away from making binding ideological decisions .
according to frerk , the rate at which young people break away from religious groups will soon put non-denominational germans in the majority . " one percent of christians are leaving the church every year , " he said .
" so in 20 years from now , they 'll be the minority . " europe 's christian identity but opinions divide on whether germany has irrevocably turned its back on religion . hubert seiwert , a professor of comparative religious studies , says that although there is a widespread belief that religion and all things modern stand in direct opposition to one another , the death knell has yet to toll for christianity in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is islam in europe making europeans more aware of their christian roots ?
at the moment , the tendency in german society is to talk about religion in the context of conflicts , but not otherwise . " take the islam issue for example , " seiwert said .
" that is something people are taking seriously . " but discussions about islam and its role in western , secular societies have prompted many germans to re-examine their own religious roots . " suddenly people are talking about europe having a christian identity , " he said . according to reinhard holmer , director of germany 's evangelische allianz , an association of evangelical christians , people are nowadays , in fact , beginning to ask more questions about what religion can offer . " religious issues are becoming more mainstream and people want to know what answers the church can provide , " holmer said . seeking spirituality elsewhere bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german mormons are welcoming new members to their church for many , those answers have not been satisfying enough to keep them coming back for more .
but just because people have left the largest church communities does n't always mean they have turned their backs on religion , or indeed christianity , entirely . " some people leave the church because it is too lackadaisical while they are looking for something more charismatic , " seiwert said . although such leaps of faith are the exception rather than the rule , seiwert claims a growing number of people are seeking spiritual fulfillment outside the mainstream churches .
and there are literally dozens of alternative religions - christian and otherwise - waiting to welcome new recruits into the fold .
some have to wait longer than others . small but steady growth ralf grünke , spokesman for germany 's church of the latter-day saints - also known as mormons - says 1,066 people of all denominations have joined its ranks over the past two years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smaller religious groups in germany are often looked upon with skepticism " the church is attractive to people of all backgrounds , " grünke said , " because it is lively and our sermons are conducted by laypeople rather than vicars . " the jehovah 's witnesses in germany record an average annual increase in membership of between 0.5 and 1.5 percent .
other groups , such as the bible fellowship church and the seventh-day adventists also claim to have witnessed a small increase of members over the past years . according to seiwert , memberships are unlikely to go up unless attitudes towards the lesser-known religions in germany are changed . " we are warned against smaller groups which are not a part of the main church , " he said .
" and decisions to join them are met with skepticism . " tamsin walker send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

why not get yourself down to sauerland and get an eyeful of some good old-fashioned deer porn . when it comes to getting kinky kicks in germany , most people know that the place to go is the reeperbahn area of hamburg .
the sleazy mile of brothels and clubs offering all manner of dances - lap , table and pole - has become world famous for providing everything that seekers of sexual thrills could hope for .
but even the reeperbahn has its boundaries when it comes to pushing the envelope of lust and desire , which is why the notorious hamburg quarter may start losing customers in search of the hottest stag party .
those wanting the ultimate in horny action with a new and risqué take on voyeuristic pleasure need look no further than the ruhr area in the western german state of north-rhine westphalia .
heading into the forests around the town of arnsberg-vosswinkel , those looking for something a little unusual and au natural can pay 40 euros -lrb- $ 56 -rrb- for the pleasure of a whole night watching the locals rut wildly .
perverts beware : this is not a bestiality bus trip bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " hey babes , wanna rut ? "
before bus loads of international perverts start flooding to the region in search of exhibitionist sauerlanders , it must be revealed at this point that those performing during these night-long steamy outdoor sessions are not humans .
if that only speeds up the flow of deviants , then it must also be noted that these organized trips into the wild are run by wildwald vosswinkel , a well-respected nature trust , and that sexually excited adults are discouraged from attending .
the trust has been organizing trips into the sauerland forests for decades but only recently have they struck on the idea of bussing nature lovers into the woods to watch the local red deer mating season up close .
from sept .
22 to oct .
21 , wildwald will be taking the curious to the best rutting areas in the forests , where young stags fight over the available deer babes before claiming their prize in the time-honored fashion .
organizers shocked by questions of weirdness bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " does the ear tag and collar ensemble do anything for you ? "
despite it all being very natural and above board , there remains something a little weird about groups of humans - children included - hiding in the bushes watching animals have sex … and paying for the privilege .
" it 's not weird because we observe the deer purely from an educational perspective and our staff are always on hand to offer insight and answer questions on what is one of nature 's most fascinating rituals , " wildwald 's spokesperson told dw-world.de. okay , but surely if there is a group of people standing around with night-vision equipment , observing and asking questions about a stag 's moves , that 's going to upset the rhythm and spoil the magic for the deer .
" no , " assured the wildwald spokesperson .
" we keep the people at a good distance where they can observe safely and can not disturb the animals .
wildwald has been taking people into the woods for 30 years and we know how to respect the privacy of the animals there . "
so there you have it .

he told reporters that the evidence given by alonso , hamilton and team test driver pedro de la rosa demonstrated " that we did not use the leaked information to gain a competitive advantage . "
dennis was quick to stifle his ire , knowing that the punishment could have been a lot worse .
" the most important thing is that we will be going motor racing this weekend , the rest of the year and every season , " he said .
" this means that the drivers can continue to compete in the championship . "
the scandal erupted in july when a 780-page file on ferrari 's racing cars was found at the home of mclaren chief designer mike coughlan .
the documents were allegedly supplied by ferrari mechanic nigel stepney .
mclaren guilty of fraudulent conduct bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mclaren says it did not use the information from ferrari at an earlier hearing on july 26 , the council had found mclaren guilty of fraudulent conduct for having the documents in its possession but did not punish the team because there was not enough evidence to suggest that it had misused the information contained in the documents .
however , the council had warned mclaren that the team could be banned for two seasons if it were proven it had used the material to gain an unfair advantage .
last week , the fia had announced that evidence had been found that warranted a new hearing .
this evidence reportedly included e-mails between alonso and de la rosa and transcripts of phone and text-message conversations between coughlan and stepney .

but in doing so , and by fining mclaren-mercedes a massive 72 million euros -lrb- $ 100 million -rrb- and stripping the team of its constructors ' championship points , the world motor sport council may have created more controversy .
under the terms of the punishment , the british-german team has escaped being suspended from racing .
that means both world champion fernando alonso and championship leader lewis hamilton , the mclaren-mercedes team drivers , will still be allowed to race and their points in the drivers ' championship remain unaffected by the action .

the fact that the mclaren-mercedes drivers are still allowed to compete has led to some in the sport saying that the fine and punishment , in the context of the mega-bucks world of formula one , was derisory , while others were amazed by the amount demanded .
former mclaren team boss eddie jordan said the size of the punishment meted out was " baffling . "
" it does n't seem logical at all in terms of the amount of money , " jordan told bbc radio 5live .
" it is baffling .
" to the outside world this is a ridiculous amount of money , and we also need to know where is this money going to ? "
it appears as if the judgment was designed to allow everyone to emerge with some degree of satisfaction .
mclaren stands an excellent chance of winning the drivers ' championship , ferrari will almost certainly win the constructors ' title , and formula one sponsors and fans can count on a highly competitive rest of the season .
mclaren chief stands firm however , mclaren boss ron dennis said that he " did not accept " the decision to punish his team .
he told reporters that the evidence given by alonso , hamilton and team test driver pedro de la rosa demonstrated " that we did not use the leaked information to gain a competitive advantage . "

it 's no secret that both the catholic and protestant churches in germany have long faced the problem of shrinking congregations , but has the nation irrevocably turned its back on its religious heritage ? in the past six decades , the number of german citizens belonging to one of the country 's two main churches has fallen from 94.4 to just shy of 62 percent .
and although the trend has slowed , there is no indication of a reversal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many young germans are alienated from religion carsten frerk who runs fowid , a research group on belief systems in germany , says the church has lost its power and , perhaps more crucially , it has lost the nation 's youth . " children in germany are no longer born into a religion in the way they used to be , " frerk said .
" young people are not forced into a religious culture anymore . " the younger generations have too many choices at their disposal and this is what keeps them away from making binding ideological decisions .
according to frerk , the rate at which young people break away from religious groups will soon put non-denominational germans in the majority . " one percent of christians are leaving the church every year , " he said .
" so in 20 years from now , they 'll be the minority . " europe 's christian identity but opinions divide on whether germany has irrevocably turned its back on religion . hubert seiwert , a professor of comparative religious studies , says that although there is a widespread belief that religion and all things modern stand in direct opposition to one another , the death knell has yet to toll for christianity in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is islam in europe making europeans more aware of their christian roots ?
at the moment , the tendency in german society is to talk about religion in the context of conflicts , but not otherwise . " take the islam issue for example , " seiwert said .
" that is something people are taking seriously . " but discussions about islam and its role in western , secular societies have prompted many germans to re-examine their own religious roots . " suddenly people are talking about europe having a christian identity , " he said . according to reinhard holmer , director of germany 's evangelische allianz , an association of evangelical christians , people are nowadays , in fact , beginning to ask more questions about what religion can offer . " religious issues are becoming more mainstream and people want to know what answers the church can provide , " holmer said . seeking spirituality elsewhere bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german mormons are welcoming new members to their church for many , those answers have not been satisfying enough to keep them coming back for more .
but just because people have left the largest church communities does n't always mean they have turned their backs on religion , or indeed christianity , entirely . " some people leave the church because it is too lackadaisical while they are looking for something more charismatic , " seiwert said . although such leaps of faith are the exception rather than the rule , seiwert claims a growing number of people are seeking spiritual fulfillment outside the mainstream churches .
and there are literally dozens of alternative religions - christian and otherwise - waiting to welcome new recruits into the fold .
some have to wait longer than others . small but steady growth ralf grünke , spokesman for germany 's church of the latter-day saints - also known as mormons - says 1,066 people of all denominations have joined its ranks over the past two years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smaller religious groups in germany are often looked upon with skepticism " the church is attractive to people of all backgrounds , " grünke said , " because it is lively and our sermons are conducted by laypeople rather than vicars . " the jehovah 's witnesses in germany record an average annual increase in membership of between 0.5 and 1.5 percent .
other groups , such as the bible fellowship church and the seventh-day adventists also claim to have witnessed a small increase of members over the past years . according to seiwert , memberships are unlikely to go up unless attitudes towards the lesser-known religions in germany are changed . " we are warned against smaller groups which are not a part of the main church , " he said .

" we are concerned about the decision to deploy the system and are at one with the large majority of our populations in rejecting it , " read the declaration .
the signatories called for the eu , nato and the nato-russia council to be involved in future missile defense talks .
" a decision to station the missiles must not be taken unilaterally or bilaterally , since this is a major issue affecting the security of the whole of europe , " they said .
no new arms race in europe , urges beck bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spd leader beck called for chancellor angela merkel to oppose the missile shield beck said the statement was also a message to conservative german chancellor angela merkel , with whom the social democrats jointly rule , aimed at convincing the chancellor to oppose the shield and any new arms race in europe .
" we agreed we are against any new arms build-up in europe , " the spd leader said .
the hungarian social democrats were the only invitees who refused to sign up to the wide-ranging rebuff of us attempts to site a tracking radar in the czech republic and 10 interceptor missiles in neighboring poland at a two-day meeting of party leaders in prague .
" the hungarian social democratic party believes that europe is exposed to a terrorist attack and we have to defend ourselves against it , " the hungarian statement issued by defense minister and deputy party chairman imre szekeres read .
" individual countries should decide on their cooperation in this area .
we recognize their right to do so . "
tensions rise over proposed bases on russian border since the plan was first revealed , it has been widely condemned .
russia has been particularly irked by plans by the us to expand the defense system along its borders .
russia opposes the plan , saying it would upset a delicate strategic balance between major powers and threaten its own security .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some poles have made their feelings known the us claims that the missiles would not be aimed at russia but positioned to intercept any chemical , biological or nuclear missile attack coming from iran or north korea .
washington is currently in talks with the conservative governments in poland - where it wants to put 10 ground-based interceptor missiles - and in the czech republic , which is meant to host a radar base .
the socialist movements in both countries have been vehemently opposed to the plan and signaled their position on friday by signing the declaration .
plan hits funding obstacles in washington while opposition in europe comes from the moral and political side of the argument , the missile shield has hit financial obstacles back home in the united states .

it 's no secret that both the catholic and protestant churches in germany have long faced the problem of shrinking congregations , but has the nation irrevocably turned its back on its religious heritage ? in the past six decades , the number of german citizens belonging to one of the country 's two main churches has fallen from 94.4 to just shy of 62 percent .
and although the trend has slowed , there is no indication of a reversal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many young germans are alienated from religion carsten frerk who runs fowid , a research group on belief systems in germany , says the church has lost its power and , perhaps more crucially , it has lost the nation 's youth . " children in germany are no longer born into a religion in the way they used to be , " frerk said .
" young people are not forced into a religious culture anymore . " the younger generations have too many choices at their disposal and this is what keeps them away from making binding ideological decisions .
according to frerk , the rate at which young people break away from religious groups will soon put non-denominational germans in the majority . " one percent of christians are leaving the church every year , " he said .
" so in 20 years from now , they 'll be the minority . " europe 's christian identity but opinions divide on whether germany has irrevocably turned its back on religion . hubert seiwert , a professor of comparative religious studies , says that although there is a widespread belief that religion and all things modern stand in direct opposition to one another , the death knell has yet to toll for christianity in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is islam in europe making europeans more aware of their christian roots ?
at the moment , the tendency in german society is to talk about religion in the context of conflicts , but not otherwise . " take the islam issue for example , " seiwert said .
" that is something people are taking seriously . " but discussions about islam and its role in western , secular societies have prompted many germans to re-examine their own religious roots . " suddenly people are talking about europe having a christian identity , " he said . according to reinhard holmer , director of germany 's evangelische allianz , an association of evangelical christians , people are nowadays , in fact , beginning to ask more questions about what religion can offer . " religious issues are becoming more mainstream and people want to know what answers the church can provide , " holmer said . seeking spirituality elsewhere bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german mormons are welcoming new members to their church for many , those answers have not been satisfying enough to keep them coming back for more .
but just because people have left the largest church communities does n't always mean they have turned their backs on religion , or indeed christianity , entirely . " some people leave the church because it is too lackadaisical while they are looking for something more charismatic , " seiwert said . although such leaps of faith are the exception rather than the rule , seiwert claims a growing number of people are seeking spiritual fulfillment outside the mainstream churches .
and there are literally dozens of alternative religions - christian and otherwise - waiting to welcome new recruits into the fold .
some have to wait longer than others . small but steady growth ralf grünke , spokesman for germany 's church of the latter-day saints - also known as mormons - says 1,066 people of all denominations have joined its ranks over the past two years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smaller religious groups in germany are often looked upon with skepticism " the church is attractive to people of all backgrounds , " grünke said , " because it is lively and our sermons are conducted by laypeople rather than vicars . " the jehovah 's witnesses in germany record an average annual increase in membership of between 0.5 and 1.5 percent .
other groups , such as the bible fellowship church and the seventh-day adventists also claim to have witnessed a small increase of members over the past years . according to seiwert , memberships are unlikely to go up unless attitudes towards the lesser-known religions in germany are changed .

the team , however , will race on . the formula one powers-that-be moved to end one of the sport 's biggest scandals in years on thursday , sept .
13 , by punishing the mclaren-mercedes racing team for having used secret technical documents acquired from rival ferrari .
but in doing so , and by fining mclaren-mercedes a massive 72 million euros -lrb- $ 100 million -rrb- and stripping the team of its constructors ' championship points , the world motor sport council may have created more controversy .
under the terms of the punishment , the british-german team has escaped being suspended from racing .
that means both world champion fernando alonso and championship leader lewis hamilton , the mclaren-mercedes team drivers , will still be allowed to race and their points in the drivers ' championship remain unaffected by the action .
mclaren drivers free to chase championship bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lewis hamilton -lrb- r . -rrb- will be able to pursue his title dream hamilton heads the drivers ' standings with 92 points , with alonso second with 89 .
ferrari drivers kimi raikkonen and felipe massa are third and fourth with 74 and 69 points , respectively .
ferrari now takes over the lead in the constructors ' standings , with bmw in second place .
the fact that the mclaren-mercedes drivers are still allowed to compete has led to some in the sport saying that the fine and punishment , in the context of the mega-bucks world of formula one , was derisory , while others were amazed by the amount demanded .
former mclaren team boss eddie jordan said the size of the punishment meted out was " baffling . "
" it does n't seem logical at all in terms of the amount of money , " jordan told bbc radio 5live .
" it is baffling .
" to the outside world this is a ridiculous amount of money , and we also need to know where is this money going to ? "
it appears as if the judgment was designed to allow everyone to emerge with some degree of satisfaction .
mclaren stands an excellent chance of winning the drivers ' championship , ferrari will almost certainly win the constructors ' title , and formula one sponsors and fans can count on a highly competitive rest of the season .
mclaren chief stands firm however , mclaren boss ron dennis said that he " did not accept " the decision to punish his team .
he told reporters that the evidence given by alonso , hamilton and team test driver pedro de la rosa demonstrated " that we did not use the leaked information to gain a competitive advantage . "
dennis was quick to stifle his ire , knowing that the punishment could have been a lot worse .
" the most important thing is that we will be going motor racing this weekend , the rest of the year and every season , " he said .
" this means that the drivers can continue to compete in the championship . "
the scandal erupted in july when a 780-page file on ferrari 's racing cars was found at the home of mclaren chief designer mike coughlan .
the documents were allegedly supplied by ferrari mechanic nigel stepney .
mclaren guilty of fraudulent conduct bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mclaren says it did not use the information from ferrari at an earlier hearing on july 26 , the council had found mclaren guilty of fraudulent conduct for having the documents in its possession but did not punish the team because there was not enough evidence to suggest that it had misused the information contained in the documents .
however , the council had warned mclaren that the team could be banned for two seasons if it were proven it had used the material to gain an unfair advantage .
last week , the fia had announced that evidence had been found that warranted a new hearing .
this evidence reportedly included e-mails between alonso and de la rosa and transcripts of phone and text-message conversations between coughlan and stepney .
" in light of new evidence , facts and behavior of an extremely serious nature and grossly prejudicial to the interest of the sport have been further demonstrated , " the ferrari team said in a statement .

14 , in portugal , the continued strength of the euro was a concern , although finance chiefs said economic growth should hold .
france got a deficit scolding . before the 13 ministers got down to business in the northern city of porto , portugal on friday , they took a ride on a river cruiser up the douro river .
the message in this time of global credit upheavals seemed to be : do n't rock the boat .
europe is enjoying healthy growth and financial chiefs do n't want the us sub-prime rate crisis or a muscle-bound euro to throw it off track .
" we are able to handle situations like -lrb- the current economic uncertainty -rrb- , " austrian finance minister wilhelm molterer told journalists as the 13 gathered for a working breakfast .
" the european economy is robust and stable . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european central bank president jean-claude trichet is worried about financial market volatility the reassuring words come after the euro hit a record high of $ 1.3927 on thursday , reviving fears that an overly strong currency could hurt euro-zone exports by making them more expensive on international markets .
" we are following very closely all developments that can occur " on currency markets , said luxembourg 's prime minister jean-claude juncker , who chaired the meeting .
ministers were careful , however , not to overplay their concerns , fearful that hitting the panic button could unnerve financial markets reeling from a slew of bad economic news of late .
besides the strong euro , it appears that the international fall-out from the sub-prime crisis in the us , which was sparked by high-risk home mortgage lending , is continuing .
impact , but not a huge one analysts say the creeping paralysis that the sub-prime crisis has caused has occurred not because banks have necessarily lost money as a consequence of the crisis , but because they are not sure if they have lost money or not .
this type of uncertainty has made them wary about lending , exacerbating the problem .
on friday , news broke that british mortgage lender northern rock had been given an emergency loan by the bank of england to see it through a credit crunch .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the finance chiefs delivered a relatively upbeat assessment despite that , ministers from the 13 nations who have adopted the euro were careful to say that , while recent events will not help economic matters , the turbulence will not hurt them that much either .
" we think that the recent developments on the financial markets will have an impact , but a light impact , on the outlook for growth in 2007 toward the end of the year , " said juncker .
" we believe that economic growth will remain sufficiently robust so that in 2008 we will not see a sharp downward revision . "
the european commission lowered its euro-zone growth forecasts slightly this week - not because of the strong euro , but because of the credit crunch .
it predicted that the bloc 's economy would grow by 2.5 percent instead of 2.6 percent , which had been previously forecast .
" the fundamentals in the euro area and the european economies remain solid : profits in private companies continue to be high , balance sheets in the private sector are sound ... and unemployment is at the lowest level in the past two decades , " said joaquin almunia , the eu 's economic affairs commissioner .
france rapped on knuckles france came in for a scolding at friday 's meeting for not doing enough about its deficit and was urged to do more to bring it down .
" we think that the ambitions that france has shown do not entirely correspond to the level of our expectations , " juncker told journalists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french finance minister christine lagarde although structural reforms undertaken by france " go in the right direction and should increase growth potential , " juncker said the ministers " believe that structural reforms and budget consolidation should go together . "
euro-zone finance chiefs had committed themselves in april in berlin to balancing their budgets by 2010 , but were warned by french president nicolas sarkozy that his reform plan meant france might not be in the black until 2012 .
he wants to jolt the french economy with a growth " shock " through a series of tax cuts .
the move risks reversing the country 's downward deficit trend .
france 's finance minister christine lagarde acknowledged the dissatisfaction of her counterparts , but stressed that they had approved of sarkozy 's reform package .
if the french deficit starts rising again , it could soon break the eu rules requiring that fiscal shortfalls be kept to less than 3 percent .
" we will make every effort to reach the berlin objectives in so far as the economic situation permits , " lagarde said . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it 's no secret that both the catholic and protestant churches in germany have long faced the problem of shrinking congregations , but has the nation irrevocably turned its back on its religious heritage ? in the past six decades , the number of german citizens belonging to one of the country 's two main churches has fallen from 94.4 to just shy of 62 percent .
and although the trend has slowed , there is no indication of a reversal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many young germans are alienated from religion carsten frerk who runs fowid , a research group on belief systems in germany , says the church has lost its power and , perhaps more crucially , it has lost the nation 's youth . " children in germany are no longer born into a religion in the way they used to be , " frerk said .
" young people are not forced into a religious culture anymore . " the younger generations have too many choices at their disposal and this is what keeps them away from making binding ideological decisions .
according to frerk , the rate at which young people break away from religious groups will soon put non-denominational germans in the majority . " one percent of christians are leaving the church every year , " he said .
" so in 20 years from now , they 'll be the minority . " europe 's christian identity but opinions divide on whether germany has irrevocably turned its back on religion . hubert seiwert , a professor of comparative religious studies , says that although there is a widespread belief that religion and all things modern stand in direct opposition to one another , the death knell has yet to toll for christianity in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is islam in europe making europeans more aware of their christian roots ?
at the moment , the tendency in german society is to talk about religion in the context of conflicts , but not otherwise . " take the islam issue for example , " seiwert said .
" that is something people are taking seriously . " but discussions about islam and its role in western , secular societies have prompted many germans to re-examine their own religious roots . " suddenly people are talking about europe having a christian identity , " he said . according to reinhard holmer , director of germany 's evangelische allianz , an association of evangelical christians , people are nowadays , in fact , beginning to ask more questions about what religion can offer . " religious issues are becoming more mainstream and people want to know what answers the church can provide , " holmer said . seeking spirituality elsewhere bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german mormons are welcoming new members to their church for many , those answers have not been satisfying enough to keep them coming back for more .
but just because people have left the largest church communities does n't always mean they have turned their backs on religion , or indeed christianity , entirely . " some people leave the church because it is too lackadaisical while they are looking for something more charismatic , " seiwert said . although such leaps of faith are the exception rather than the rule , seiwert claims a growing number of people are seeking spiritual fulfillment outside the mainstream churches .
and there are literally dozens of alternative religions - christian and otherwise - waiting to welcome new recruits into the fold .
some have to wait longer than others . small but steady growth ralf grünke , spokesman for germany 's church of the latter-day saints - also known as mormons - says 1,066 people of all denominations have joined its ranks over the past two years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smaller religious groups in germany are often looked upon with skepticism " the church is attractive to people of all backgrounds , " grünke said , " because it is lively and our sermons are conducted by laypeople rather than vicars . " the jehovah 's witnesses in germany record an average annual increase in membership of between 0.5 and 1.5 percent .
other groups , such as the bible fellowship church and the seventh-day adventists also claim to have witnessed a small increase of members over the past years . according to seiwert , memberships are unlikely to go up unless attitudes towards the lesser-known religions in germany are changed . " we are warned against smaller groups which are not a part of the main church , " he said .
" and decisions to join them are met with skepticism . " tamsin walker send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but today , when gaining access to a government web site takes just a few mouse clicks , cyber-terrorism is a very real fact .
the alleged russian attacks on estonia 's digital infrastructure in the middle of a diplomatic spat over the relocation of a soviet-era monument in may sent nato experts to tallinn to investigate what some called the first direct attack by moscow on a nato member .
confusion over whether an attack was actually happening , however , allowed nato to avoid formulating a response to the suspected cyber attack .
then germany joined the united states , france and britain last month in blaming china for recent hacker attacks on sensitive government sites , including the pentagon and the french defense ministry . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister ansip 's estonia was targeted online " i 'm sure the germans and americans would n't have named china without having evidence , " said jan hassel , an expert and author on the subject of cyber-terrorism .
" the fact that china was singled out means that the countries apparently targeted by the chinese wanted to send out a warning . " beijing has denied all involvement in the alleged attacks , and the western governments have been unwilling to publicize exactly what , if any , classified information was compromised . badly protected systems vulnerable to attack " the increasing reliance on technology is making governments more vulnerable to cyber attack , " hassel said .
" many do n't have adequate defense systems on their files and hackers will look for a weak link , maybe a person , maybe an application and focus on that , releasing viruses to disable the system through emails . " the pentagon admitted hackers had gained access to an unclassified e-mail system in the office of us defense secretary robert gates but would not comment on a financial times report that the chinese government was involved . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us hackers targeted arabic broadcaster al jazeera in 2003 britain 's the times also reported that the pentagon suspected china 's people 's liberation army -lrb- pla -rrb- hackers of preparing a plan to disable the us aircraft carrier fleet , a threat hassel said has been exaggerated . " it would not be possible for a hacker to steer a battleship , " said hassel .
" the main threat would be the interception of communications .
while unauthorized access to military systems is a real concern , we should n't get too carried away .
there is still much of what makes up a ' nightmare ' scenario which can not currently be achieved by hacking . "
publicly accused are not alone but by engaging in cyber warfare , as seen in the estonian case , a country can obtain information about and destabilize rival nations faster - and at a fraction of the cost of the spy networks or militaries that were once necessary . retired us army officer and lecturer on asymmetric warfare zachary hubbard recently claimed in a report that the pla had developed a sizable force of professional computer hackers trained to disrupt the computer networks of china 's enemies . hubbard claimed that these hackers were trained to target banking and electronic commerce networks and electric power grids , transportation networks and oil and gas pipelines often making use of information publicly available on the internet .
china has denied the existence of any such force .
cyber units at large in the world ? while china and russia currently appear to have taken the lead in online espionage , it is highly unlikely they are alone since " no one is going to admit to -lsb- having -rsb- cyber units , " according to hassel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pla is suspected of having trained cyber units " a lot of countries are doing it , and i would not be surprised if those accusing others of the practice are guilty as well , " he said .
" what is more likely is that governments are turning a blind eye to hackers targeting other nations , or even using freelance hackers while publicly condemning the practice . " while we do n't know whether there are any official military units in europe charged with cyber missions , we have seen that certain exercises and war games carried out by the likes of china have included cyber attack scenarios , " hassel added .
nations stumped over appropriate response the official denials of any engagement in cyber espionage and difficulty in presenting hard evidence of an attack , however , have left countries wondering what action to take after falling victim to an attack . in europe , the council of europe 's convention on cybercrime became the first , and only , international legal instrument in dealing with cyber attacks .
but even that is regarded as ineffective as it applies only to signatory nations .
the convention has been signed by 38 council of europe members and five non-members - canada , japan , montenegro , south africa and the united states .
" the council of europe 's convention allows the signatories protection against each other but does little if anything to provide a legal framework where an outsider could be held accountable , " said hassel .

but today , when gaining access to a government web site takes just a few mouse clicks , cyber-terrorism is a very real fact .
the alleged russian attacks on estonia 's digital infrastructure in the middle of a diplomatic spat over the relocation of a soviet-era monument in may sent nato experts to tallinn to investigate what some called the first direct attack by moscow on a nato member .
confusion over whether an attack was actually happening , however , allowed nato to avoid formulating a response to the suspected cyber attack .
then germany joined the united states , france and britain last month in blaming china for recent hacker attacks on sensitive government sites , including the pentagon and the french defense ministry . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister ansip 's estonia was targeted online " i 'm sure the germans and americans would n't have named china without having evidence , " said jan hassel , an expert and author on the subject of cyber-terrorism .
" the fact that china was singled out means that the countries apparently targeted by the chinese wanted to send out a warning . " beijing has denied all involvement in the alleged attacks , and the western governments have been unwilling to publicize exactly what , if any , classified information was compromised . badly protected systems vulnerable to attack " the increasing reliance on technology is making governments more vulnerable to cyber attack , " hassel said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de from the fringe -pipe- 14.09.2007 a nature expedition or merely deer porn ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : insert obvious and infantile comment about " feeling horny " here stuck for something to do with the family at the weekend ?
why not get yourself down to sauerland and get an eyeful of some good old-fashioned deer porn . when it comes to getting kinky kicks in germany , most people know that the place to go is the reeperbahn area of hamburg .
the sleazy mile of brothels and clubs offering all manner of dances - lap , table and pole - has become world famous for providing everything that seekers of sexual thrills could hope for .
but even the reeperbahn has its boundaries when it comes to pushing the envelope of lust and desire , which is why the notorious hamburg quarter may start losing customers in search of the hottest stag party .
those wanting the ultimate in horny action with a new and risqué take on voyeuristic pleasure need look no further than the ruhr area in the western german state of north-rhine westphalia .
heading into the forests around the town of arnsberg-vosswinkel , those looking for something a little unusual and au natural can pay 40 euros -lrb- $ 56 -rrb- for the pleasure of a whole night watching the locals rut wildly .
perverts beware : this is not a bestiality bus trip bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " hey babes , wanna rut ? "
before bus loads of international perverts start flooding to the region in search of exhibitionist sauerlanders , it must be revealed at this point that those performing during these night-long steamy outdoor sessions are not humans .
if that only speeds up the flow of deviants , then it must also be noted that these organized trips into the wild are run by wildwald vosswinkel , a well-respected nature trust , and that sexually excited adults are discouraged from attending .
the trust has been organizing trips into the sauerland forests for decades but only recently have they struck on the idea of bussing nature lovers into the woods to watch the local red deer mating season up close .
from sept .
22 to oct .
21 , wildwald will be taking the curious to the best rutting areas in the forests , where young stags fight over the available deer babes before claiming their prize in the time-honored fashion .
organizers shocked by questions of weirdness bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " does the ear tag and collar ensemble do anything for you ? "
despite it all being very natural and above board , there remains something a little weird about groups of humans - children included - hiding in the bushes watching animals have sex … and paying for the privilege .
" it 's not weird because we observe the deer purely from an educational perspective and our staff are always on hand to offer insight and answer questions on what is one of nature 's most fascinating rituals , " wildwald 's spokesperson told dw-world.de. okay , but surely if there is a group of people standing around with night-vision equipment , observing and asking questions about a stag 's moves , that 's going to upset the rhythm and spoil the magic for the deer .
" no , " assured the wildwald spokesperson .
" we keep the people at a good distance where they can observe safely and can not disturb the animals .
wildwald has been taking people into the woods for 30 years and we know how to respect the privacy of the animals there . "
so there you have it .
a nature expedition or just some good old deer porn ?
we 'll let you decide .
those wanting to get their names down for the hot buck-on-doe action have until oct .
1 to reserve their places . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

since 2006 , he 's also been a member of the supervisory board at volkswagen . dw-world.de : ahead of the iaa , the dispute over co2 emission targets has been getting louder and harsher .
you 've publicly stated your opinion .
do you have a better concept ? wendelin wiedeking : first of all , i think that the automobile industry is not the biggest emitter of co2 , even though it 's always presented that way .
in germany , for example , passenger cars are responsible for only 12 percent of co2 emissions .
we , the car industry , have worked on environment issues over the last years and decades .
we 'll continue to reduce co2 emissions in the coming years with modern engines and modern cars .
i think the car industry is not as bad as its image . global warming can be felt and environmental protection is a big issue .
how do you bring together environmental consciousness and powerful luxury sports cars ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : porsche unveiled a new hybrid engine earlier this year our sports cars , for example , have the lowest co2 emissions per horsepower because of extensive research work .
if our technology were used in small or medium-sized cars , they could already emit much less .
it 's the strategy of german premium producers to test technology , invest a lot of money , and introduce the technology step by step via mid-sized cars into small ones .
a good example is mercedes-benz 's abs technology , which was first introduced in s-class models many years ago - at a high cost , also for customers .
today it 's hard to think of cars without abs breaking systems .
it 's going to be like that in the future as well .
we need a variety of offerings - high-end cars , medium-sized cars and small ones - in order for the car industry to move forward in terms of technology . porsche is germany 's smallest car producer , but also the most profitable one .
how much money do you invest in research ? we spend significantly more than 10 percent of revenue on research and development each year .
that means that we invest in new technologies probably in a way unlike any other producer .
porsche thrives on new technologies , on issues such as environment , safety and driving pleasure in a way that many others ca n't or do n't want to .
we 're investing disproportionately in the future . what do you think about the current debate to protect companies against foreign takeovers ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vw and porsche have co-built cars for decades there are many nations that find it important to control key sectors .
the americans take the stand that foreigners can not buy anything that gets anywhere near arms production .
newspapers and publishing companies on the other hand can be bought .
in other words , it 's perfectly natural for americans to protect many sectors .
europeans did n't have that until now .
the state has to take on a certain protective function for the country , i can understand that .
it has to be watched , of course . a free society has to allow free capital flow . do you ever worry that porsche might be taken over by another company ? i 've actually never worried about that because i know that the porsche and piech families - the only stockholders allowed to vote - stand firmly behind the company and its tradition .
as long as the company makes money , i am sure that both families wo n't think about selling . what 's the relationship between porsche and vw like ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wiedeking thinks his cars are to kneel down for i think that we 've worked hard at porsche over the last couple of years .
we were able to take over vw shares at a manageable cost .
we own more than 31 percent of vw shares .
the relationship between porsche and volkswagen is very good and that 's why it made sense for us to get involved .
we were able to afford it and vw shares were cheap . what does the ceo of porsche do during his spare time ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iaa visitors can check out wiedeking 's potato salad i harvested potatoes with a porsche tractor last saturday .
the potato salad that you can get here -lsb- at the iaa -rsb- is made from my potatoes . you 're fascinated by technology and have often said you 've always just concentrated on the things that brought you forward .
could one say that you 're a humor-less person in real life ? you 'll have to ask the people around me how boring i am .
because i have so little free time , i only do the things i want to do .
i have a great collection of tools , probably the best you can imagine .

since 2006 , he 's also been a member of the supervisory board at volkswagen . dw-world.de : ahead of the iaa , the dispute over co2 emission targets has been getting louder and harsher .
you 've publicly stated your opinion .
do you have a better concept ? wendelin wiedeking : first of all , i think that the automobile industry is not the biggest emitter of co2 , even though it 's always presented that way .
in germany , for example , passenger cars are responsible for only 12 percent of co2 emissions .
we , the car industry , have worked on environment issues over the last years and decades .
we 'll continue to reduce co2 emissions in the coming years with modern engines and modern cars .
i think the car industry is not as bad as its image . global warming can be felt and environmental protection is a big issue .
how do you bring together environmental consciousness and powerful luxury sports cars ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : porsche unveiled a new hybrid engine earlier this year our sports cars , for example , have the lowest co2 emissions per horsepower because of extensive research work .
if our technology were used in small or medium-sized cars , they could already emit much less .
it 's the strategy of german premium producers to test technology , invest a lot of money , and introduce the technology step by step via mid-sized cars into small ones .
a good example is mercedes-benz 's abs technology , which was first introduced in s-class models many years ago - at a high cost , also for customers .
today it 's hard to think of cars without abs breaking systems .
it 's going to be like that in the future as well .
we need a variety of offerings - high-end cars , medium-sized cars and small ones - in order for the car industry to move forward in terms of technology . porsche is germany 's smallest car producer , but also the most profitable one .
how much money do you invest in research ? we spend significantly more than 10 percent of revenue on research and development each year .
that means that we invest in new technologies probably in a way unlike any other producer .

14 , condemning us plans to base its missile defense shield on european soil . in what will be a massive blow to the united states ' plans to base its missile defense shield in central europe , left-wing leaders from the czech republic , poland , slovenia and slovakia plus austrian chancellor alfred gusenbauer and germany 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- chief kurt beck condemned the plan and issued a joint declaration stating their opposition in no uncertain terms .
" we are concerned about the decision to deploy the system and are at one with the large majority of our populations in rejecting it , " read the declaration .
the signatories called for the eu , nato and the nato-russia council to be involved in future missile defense talks .
" a decision to station the missiles must not be taken unilaterally or bilaterally , since this is a major issue affecting the security of the whole of europe , " they said .
no new arms race in europe , urges beck bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spd leader beck called for chancellor angela merkel to oppose the missile shield beck said the statement was also a message to conservative german chancellor angela merkel , with whom the social democrats jointly rule , aimed at convincing the chancellor to oppose the shield and any new arms race in europe .

but today , when gaining access to a government web site takes just a few mouse clicks , cyber-terrorism is a very real fact .
the alleged russian attacks on estonia 's digital infrastructure in the middle of a diplomatic spat over the relocation of a soviet-era monument in may sent nato experts to tallinn to investigate what some called the first direct attack by moscow on a nato member .
confusion over whether an attack was actually happening , however , allowed nato to avoid formulating a response to the suspected cyber attack .
then germany joined the united states , france and britain last month in blaming china for recent hacker attacks on sensitive government sites , including the pentagon and the french defense ministry . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister ansip 's estonia was targeted online " i 'm sure the germans and americans would n't have named china without having evidence , " said jan hassel , an expert and author on the subject of cyber-terrorism .
" the fact that china was singled out means that the countries apparently targeted by the chinese wanted to send out a warning . " beijing has denied all involvement in the alleged attacks , and the western governments have been unwilling to publicize exactly what , if any , classified information was compromised . badly protected systems vulnerable to attack " the increasing reliance on technology is making governments more vulnerable to cyber attack , " hassel said .
" many do n't have adequate defense systems on their files and hackers will look for a weak link , maybe a person , maybe an application and focus on that , releasing viruses to disable the system through emails . " the pentagon admitted hackers had gained access to an unclassified e-mail system in the office of us defense secretary robert gates but would not comment on a financial times report that the chinese government was involved . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us hackers targeted arabic broadcaster al jazeera in 2003 britain 's the times also reported that the pentagon suspected china 's people 's liberation army -lrb- pla -rrb- hackers of preparing a plan to disable the us aircraft carrier fleet , a threat hassel said has been exaggerated . " it would not be possible for a hacker to steer a battleship , " said hassel .
" the main threat would be the interception of communications .
while unauthorized access to military systems is a real concern , we should n't get too carried away .
there is still much of what makes up a ' nightmare ' scenario which can not currently be achieved by hacking . "
publicly accused are not alone but by engaging in cyber warfare , as seen in the estonian case , a country can obtain information about and destabilize rival nations faster - and at a fraction of the cost of the spy networks or militaries that were once necessary . retired us army officer and lecturer on asymmetric warfare zachary hubbard recently claimed in a report that the pla had developed a sizable force of professional computer hackers trained to disrupt the computer networks of china 's enemies . hubbard claimed that these hackers were trained to target banking and electronic commerce networks and electric power grids , transportation networks and oil and gas pipelines often making use of information publicly available on the internet .
china has denied the existence of any such force .
cyber units at large in the world ? while china and russia currently appear to have taken the lead in online espionage , it is highly unlikely they are alone since " no one is going to admit to -lsb- having -rsb- cyber units , " according to hassel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pla is suspected of having trained cyber units " a lot of countries are doing it , and i would not be surprised if those accusing others of the practice are guilty as well , " he said .
" what is more likely is that governments are turning a blind eye to hackers targeting other nations , or even using freelance hackers while publicly condemning the practice . " while we do n't know whether there are any official military units in europe charged with cyber missions , we have seen that certain exercises and war games carried out by the likes of china have included cyber attack scenarios , " hassel added .
nations stumped over appropriate response the official denials of any engagement in cyber espionage and difficulty in presenting hard evidence of an attack , however , have left countries wondering what action to take after falling victim to an attack . in europe , the council of europe 's convention on cybercrime became the first , and only , international legal instrument in dealing with cyber attacks .
but even that is regarded as ineffective as it applies only to signatory nations .
the convention has been signed by 38 council of europe members and five non-members - canada , japan , montenegro , south africa and the united states .
" the council of europe 's convention allows the signatories protection against each other but does little if anything to provide a legal framework where an outsider could be held accountable , " said hassel .
" european nations and the united states can expect to become increasingly targeted until a full international agreement on cyber attacks is in place . " nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : the return of religion promises of miracles attract millions to nigeria 's churches theologian küng : christianity gets on many people 's nerves ex-muslims demand right to renounce islamic faith most european nations keep god out of constitution religion -pipe- 14.09.2007 in search of germany 's religious identity großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what does the cross mean for germans today ?
it 's no secret that both the catholic and protestant churches in germany have long faced the problem of shrinking congregations , but has the nation irrevocably turned its back on its religious heritage ? in the past six decades , the number of german citizens belonging to one of the country 's two main churches has fallen from 94.4 to just shy of 62 percent .
and although the trend has slowed , there is no indication of a reversal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many young germans are alienated from religion carsten frerk who runs fowid , a research group on belief systems in germany , says the church has lost its power and , perhaps more crucially , it has lost the nation 's youth . " children in germany are no longer born into a religion in the way they used to be , " frerk said .
" young people are not forced into a religious culture anymore . " the younger generations have too many choices at their disposal and this is what keeps them away from making binding ideological decisions .
according to frerk , the rate at which young people break away from religious groups will soon put non-denominational germans in the majority . " one percent of christians are leaving the church every year , " he said .
" so in 20 years from now , they 'll be the minority . " europe 's christian identity but opinions divide on whether germany has irrevocably turned its back on religion . hubert seiwert , a professor of comparative religious studies , says that although there is a widespread belief that religion and all things modern stand in direct opposition to one another , the death knell has yet to toll for christianity in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is islam in europe making europeans more aware of their christian roots ?
at the moment , the tendency in german society is to talk about religion in the context of conflicts , but not otherwise . " take the islam issue for example , " seiwert said .
" that is something people are taking seriously . " but discussions about islam and its role in western , secular societies have prompted many germans to re-examine their own religious roots . " suddenly people are talking about europe having a christian identity , " he said . according to reinhard holmer , director of germany 's evangelische allianz , an association of evangelical christians , people are nowadays , in fact , beginning to ask more questions about what religion can offer . " religious issues are becoming more mainstream and people want to know what answers the church can provide , " holmer said . seeking spirituality elsewhere bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german mormons are welcoming new members to their church for many , those answers have not been satisfying enough to keep them coming back for more .
but just because people have left the largest church communities does n't always mean they have turned their backs on religion , or indeed christianity , entirely . " some people leave the church because it is too lackadaisical while they are looking for something more charismatic , " seiwert said . although such leaps of faith are the exception rather than the rule , seiwert claims a growing number of people are seeking spiritual fulfillment outside the mainstream churches .
and there are literally dozens of alternative religions - christian and otherwise - waiting to welcome new recruits into the fold .
some have to wait longer than others . small but steady growth ralf grünke , spokesman for germany 's church of the latter-day saints - also known as mormons - says 1,066 people of all denominations have joined its ranks over the past two years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smaller religious groups in germany are often looked upon with skepticism " the church is attractive to people of all backgrounds , " grünke said , " because it is lively and our sermons are conducted by laypeople rather than vicars . " the jehovah 's witnesses in germany record an average annual increase in membership of between 0.5 and 1.5 percent .
other groups , such as the bible fellowship church and the seventh-day adventists also claim to have witnessed a small increase of members over the past years . according to seiwert , memberships are unlikely to go up unless attitudes towards the lesser-known religions in germany are changed . " we are warned against smaller groups which are not a part of the main church , " he said .
" and decisions to join them are met with skepticism . " tamsin walker send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de security -pipe- 14.09.2007 exposed cyber attacks could be the tip of the iceberg großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts believe that many more nations than those reported are involved in cyber attacks high-profile claims against russia and china this year , accusing them of mounting cyber attacks against western state computer systems could be the first publicized salvos of a secret cyber war involving many nations . twenty years ago , the concept of a country coming under attack not from land , air or sea but via telephone lines and communication systems was seen as science fiction .
but today , when gaining access to a government web site takes just a few mouse clicks , cyber-terrorism is a very real fact .
the alleged russian attacks on estonia 's digital infrastructure in the middle of a diplomatic spat over the relocation of a soviet-era monument in may sent nato experts to tallinn to investigate what some called the first direct attack by moscow on a nato member .
confusion over whether an attack was actually happening , however , allowed nato to avoid formulating a response to the suspected cyber attack .
then germany joined the united states , france and britain last month in blaming china for recent hacker attacks on sensitive government sites , including the pentagon and the french defense ministry . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister ansip 's estonia was targeted online " i 'm sure the germans and americans would n't have named china without having evidence , " said jan hassel , an expert and author on the subject of cyber-terrorism .
" the fact that china was singled out means that the countries apparently targeted by the chinese wanted to send out a warning . " beijing has denied all involvement in the alleged attacks , and the western governments have been unwilling to publicize exactly what , if any , classified information was compromised . badly protected systems vulnerable to attack " the increasing reliance on technology is making governments more vulnerable to cyber attack , " hassel said .
" many do n't have adequate defense systems on their files and hackers will look for a weak link , maybe a person , maybe an application and focus on that , releasing viruses to disable the system through emails . " the pentagon admitted hackers had gained access to an unclassified e-mail system in the office of us defense secretary robert gates but would not comment on a financial times report that the chinese government was involved . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us hackers targeted arabic broadcaster al jazeera in 2003 britain 's the times also reported that the pentagon suspected china 's people 's liberation army -lrb- pla -rrb- hackers of preparing a plan to disable the us aircraft carrier fleet , a threat hassel said has been exaggerated . " it would not be possible for a hacker to steer a battleship , " said hassel .
" the main threat would be the interception of communications .

but today , when gaining access to a government web site takes just a few mouse clicks , cyber-terrorism is a very real fact .
the alleged russian attacks on estonia 's digital infrastructure in the middle of a diplomatic spat over the relocation of a soviet-era monument in may sent nato experts to tallinn to investigate what some called the first direct attack by moscow on a nato member .
confusion over whether an attack was actually happening , however , allowed nato to avoid formulating a response to the suspected cyber attack .
then germany joined the united states , france and britain last month in blaming china for recent hacker attacks on sensitive government sites , including the pentagon and the french defense ministry . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister ansip 's estonia was targeted online " i 'm sure the germans and americans would n't have named china without having evidence , " said jan hassel , an expert and author on the subject of cyber-terrorism .
" the fact that china was singled out means that the countries apparently targeted by the chinese wanted to send out a warning . " beijing has denied all involvement in the alleged attacks , and the western governments have been unwilling to publicize exactly what , if any , classified information was compromised . badly protected systems vulnerable to attack " the increasing reliance on technology is making governments more vulnerable to cyber attack , " hassel said .
" many do n't have adequate defense systems on their files and hackers will look for a weak link , maybe a person , maybe an application and focus on that , releasing viruses to disable the system through emails . " the pentagon admitted hackers had gained access to an unclassified e-mail system in the office of us defense secretary robert gates but would not comment on a financial times report that the chinese government was involved . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us hackers targeted arabic broadcaster al jazeera in 2003 britain 's the times also reported that the pentagon suspected china 's people 's liberation army -lrb- pla -rrb- hackers of preparing a plan to disable the us aircraft carrier fleet , a threat hassel said has been exaggerated . " it would not be possible for a hacker to steer a battleship , " said hassel .
" the main threat would be the interception of communications .
while unauthorized access to military systems is a real concern , we should n't get too carried away .
there is still much of what makes up a ' nightmare ' scenario which can not currently be achieved by hacking . "
publicly accused are not alone but by engaging in cyber warfare , as seen in the estonian case , a country can obtain information about and destabilize rival nations faster - and at a fraction of the cost of the spy networks or militaries that were once necessary . retired us army officer and lecturer on asymmetric warfare zachary hubbard recently claimed in a report that the pla had developed a sizable force of professional computer hackers trained to disrupt the computer networks of china 's enemies . hubbard claimed that these hackers were trained to target banking and electronic commerce networks and electric power grids , transportation networks and oil and gas pipelines often making use of information publicly available on the internet .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de from the fringe -pipe- 14.09.2007 a nature expedition or merely deer porn ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : insert obvious and infantile comment about " feeling horny " here stuck for something to do with the family at the weekend ?
why not get yourself down to sauerland and get an eyeful of some good old-fashioned deer porn . when it comes to getting kinky kicks in germany , most people know that the place to go is the reeperbahn area of hamburg .
the sleazy mile of brothels and clubs offering all manner of dances - lap , table and pole - has become world famous for providing everything that seekers of sexual thrills could hope for .
but even the reeperbahn has its boundaries when it comes to pushing the envelope of lust and desire , which is why the notorious hamburg quarter may start losing customers in search of the hottest stag party .
those wanting the ultimate in horny action with a new and risqué take on voyeuristic pleasure need look no further than the ruhr area in the western german state of north-rhine westphalia .
heading into the forests around the town of arnsberg-vosswinkel , those looking for something a little unusual and au natural can pay 40 euros -lrb- $ 56 -rrb- for the pleasure of a whole night watching the locals rut wildly .
perverts beware : this is not a bestiality bus trip bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " hey babes , wanna rut ? "
before bus loads of international perverts start flooding to the region in search of exhibitionist sauerlanders , it must be revealed at this point that those performing during these night-long steamy outdoor sessions are not humans .
if that only speeds up the flow of deviants , then it must also be noted that these organized trips into the wild are run by wildwald vosswinkel , a well-respected nature trust , and that sexually excited adults are discouraged from attending .
the trust has been organizing trips into the sauerland forests for decades but only recently have they struck on the idea of bussing nature lovers into the woods to watch the local red deer mating season up close .
from sept .
22 to oct .
21 , wildwald will be taking the curious to the best rutting areas in the forests , where young stags fight over the available deer babes before claiming their prize in the time-honored fashion .
organizers shocked by questions of weirdness bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " does the ear tag and collar ensemble do anything for you ? "
despite it all being very natural and above board , there remains something a little weird about groups of humans - children included - hiding in the bushes watching animals have sex … and paying for the privilege .
" it 's not weird because we observe the deer purely from an educational perspective and our staff are always on hand to offer insight and answer questions on what is one of nature 's most fascinating rituals , " wildwald 's spokesperson told dw-world.de. okay , but surely if there is a group of people standing around with night-vision equipment , observing and asking questions about a stag 's moves , that 's going to upset the rhythm and spoil the magic for the deer .
" no , " assured the wildwald spokesperson .
" we keep the people at a good distance where they can observe safely and can not disturb the animals .
wildwald has been taking people into the woods for 30 years and we know how to respect the privacy of the animals there . "
so there you have it .
a nature expedition or just some good old deer porn ?
we 'll let you decide .
those wanting to get their names down for the hot buck-on-doe action have until oct .

" what 's happening to our political parties ? "
it 's a question i get asked again and again as a parliamentarian .
the question is usually followed by more : " do you think that parties still represent the people ?
do they still know what citizens are worried about ? "
all this then quickly leads to a debate about the " end of party democracy . "
on the one hand , one should n't just accept the common stereotype that - in simple terms - parties and politicians are responsible for the current problems .
on the other hand , citizens also have a certain responsibility for democracy .
" let the state , let politics fix it . "
democracy is n't that easy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : omid nouripour at 32 , i 'm a fairly young german , who spent the first 13 years of his life in iran .
it 's a country where absolutely nothing could and can be taken for granted that seems so natural to us in germany : freedom of opinion , freedom of the press , the rule of law and - last , but not least - the right to free elections .
here , people , unfortunately , take these achievements for granted .
but taking things for granted usually leads to indifference .
" do n't talk to me about indifference , " some might say .
" we 're all staunch democrats , but we do n't have to pretend each day that democracy has to be reinvented . "
still , there are extreme situations in which democracy might not have to be reinvented , but certainly defended on a daily basis - for example , in light of the recurring right-wing extremist attacks on foreigners or people who appear foreign , which are , to put it mildly , " tolerated " by bystanders .
if we give right-wing extremists a free rein , we not only turn away and forfeit any kind of humanity and moral courage , we also question our democratic freedom and rights , as the ideology of right-wing extremists is founded on arbitrariness , hatred and violence .
today , they go against those who look different , tomorrow against those , who simply say what they think .
but i also miss civic participation to safeguard democratic values in less extreme situations - for example , when the current government increasingly wants to curtail civil rights and snoop around the privacy of citizens .
i still have n't heard the cry of protest from staunch democrats in cases such as limiting data protection by saving airplane passenger information , telecommunications data retention , online searches of private computers or insufficient protection for minorities .
" those who would give up essential liberty to purchase a little temporary safety , deserve neither liberty nor safety , " this quote attributed to benjamin franklin has been used a lot during the current discussion , but has rarely been heard .
democracy only works when there 's a balance of freedom and safety .
that 's why i think that a functioning democracy needs citizens who do n't grow tired of defending democratic values and freedoms .
democracy could do with a bit more heart and soul .
parties are commonly seen as the ground zero of all weariness when it comes to politics and democracy .
they are no longer trusted .
-lrb- were they ever ? -rrb-
they make a lot of promises and keep very few of them .
they are not able to solve the problems that lie ahead of us .
their work mainly concentrates on their own interests or those that they 've been drawn to by lobbyists .
their personnel is interested in power and status symbols , such as official cars , and has no scruples about enriching itself via regular pay raises that are taken from the public coffers .
this image has been around for quite some time .
considering the scandals that are regularly uncovered , it 's hard to counter this assessment of politicians and parties - just think of the party financing scandal of the christian democratic union and the demystification of the republic 's " eternal " political leading figure , former chancellor helmut kohl .
all those who claim that politics is a business like any other are wrong : politicians bear a special responsibility and have a special duty to integrity and independence .
citizens have a right to a " transparent representative , " who tells them what he earns and where his money comes from .
every politician should know that he can not ask citizens to be completely honest when it comes to taxes , but use - on good advice , in most cases - every possible loophole that he can find or has created himself .
credibility also gets lost when scandals are uncovered but have no ramifications .
roland koch , the " ruthless scout " with dubious involvement in the cdu 's financing scandal , is still state premier of hesse .
franz-josef jung , his former chief-of-staff , who stepped down because of the scandal in september 2000 , is now germany 's defense minister .
that 's not just frustrating .
it 's scandalous .
so who should fix it then ?
talk about the " failure of parties " is often followed by the demand to replace party politicians with experts .
after all , the latter are seen as impartial and have to know what 's really needed .
parties on the other hand are biased .
but how much objectivity can democracy stand ?
parties produce opinions , differing assessments , interpretations and conclusions about current facts and developments .
they do n't deliver " truths , " even if they like to pretend they do .
democratic pluralism is based on a multitude of more or less subjective opinions and assessments that citizens can choose from .
one can admittedly question to what extent parties currently fulfill that task .
if only experts decide on policy , the " objective truth " suddenly moves to the center of politics - a truth that only a small elite of specialists has knowledge about .
democracy would become an " expertocracy " that 's much less transparent and much harder for citizens to influence .
that 's why i can not imagine democracy without parties .
and still , democracy goes beyond the concept of parties .
some backroom party strategist may fantasize about taking complete control of democracy , but that wo n't happen .
our party system is n't static but mirrors societal changes .
the current weakening of peoples ' parties and the increasing number of five-party parliaments is proof of this .
in my opinion , it 's crucial to strengthen awareness for democratic freedom and values - within parties and within society .
if we manage to do that and if parties will be more open to new ideas and supporters than they have been so far , quite a few tired democrats might become wide awake again - and help to build party membership .

" what 's happening to our political parties ? "
it 's a question i get asked again and again as a parliamentarian .
the question is usually followed by more : " do you think that parties still represent the people ?

all this then quickly leads to a debate about the " end of party democracy . "
on the one hand , one should n't just accept the common stereotype that - in simple terms - parties and politicians are responsible for the current problems .

if only experts decide on policy , the " objective truth " suddenly moves to the center of politics - a truth that only a small elite of specialists has knowledge about .
democracy would become an " expertocracy " that 's much less transparent and much harder for citizens to influence .
that 's why i can not imagine democracy without parties .
and still , democracy goes beyond the concept of parties .
some backroom party strategist may fantasize about taking complete control of democracy , but that wo n't happen .
our party system is n't static but mirrors societal changes .
the current weakening of peoples ' parties and the increasing number of five-party parliaments is proof of this .
in my opinion , it 's crucial to strengthen awareness for democratic freedom and values - within parties and within society .
if we manage to do that and if parties will be more open to new ideas and supporters than they have been so far , quite a few tired democrats might become wide awake again - and help to build party membership .

" what 's happening to our political parties ? "
it 's a question i get asked again and again as a parliamentarian .
the question is usually followed by more : " do you think that parties still represent the people ?
do they still know what citizens are worried about ? "
all this then quickly leads to a debate about the " end of party democracy . "
on the one hand , one should n't just accept the common stereotype that - in simple terms - parties and politicians are responsible for the current problems .
on the other hand , citizens also have a certain responsibility for democracy .
" let the state , let politics fix it . "
democracy is n't that easy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : omid nouripour at 32 , i 'm a fairly young german , who spent the first 13 years of his life in iran .
it 's a country where absolutely nothing could and can be taken for granted that seems so natural to us in germany : freedom of opinion , freedom of the press , the rule of law and - last , but not least - the right to free elections .
here , people , unfortunately , take these achievements for granted .
but taking things for granted usually leads to indifference .
" do n't talk to me about indifference , " some might say .
" we 're all staunch democrats , but we do n't have to pretend each day that democracy has to be reinvented . "
still , there are extreme situations in which democracy might not have to be reinvented , but certainly defended on a daily basis - for example , in light of the recurring right-wing extremist attacks on foreigners or people who appear foreign , which are , to put it mildly , " tolerated " by bystanders .
if we give right-wing extremists a free rein , we not only turn away and forfeit any kind of humanity and moral courage , we also question our democratic freedom and rights , as the ideology of right-wing extremists is founded on arbitrariness , hatred and violence .
today , they go against those who look different , tomorrow against those , who simply say what they think .
but i also miss civic participation to safeguard democratic values in less extreme situations - for example , when the current government increasingly wants to curtail civil rights and snoop around the privacy of citizens .
i still have n't heard the cry of protest from staunch democrats in cases such as limiting data protection by saving airplane passenger information , telecommunications data retention , online searches of private computers or insufficient protection for minorities .
" those who would give up essential liberty to purchase a little temporary safety , deserve neither liberty nor safety , " this quote attributed to benjamin franklin has been used a lot during the current discussion , but has rarely been heard .
democracy only works when there 's a balance of freedom and safety .
that 's why i think that a functioning democracy needs citizens who do n't grow tired of defending democratic values and freedoms .
democracy could do with a bit more heart and soul .
parties are commonly seen as the ground zero of all weariness when it comes to politics and democracy .
they are no longer trusted .
-lrb- were they ever ? -rrb-
they make a lot of promises and keep very few of them .
they are not able to solve the problems that lie ahead of us .
their work mainly concentrates on their own interests or those that they 've been drawn to by lobbyists .
their personnel is interested in power and status symbols , such as official cars , and has no scruples about enriching itself via regular pay raises that are taken from the public coffers .
this image has been around for quite some time .
considering the scandals that are regularly uncovered , it 's hard to counter this assessment of politicians and parties - just think of the party financing scandal of the christian democratic union and the demystification of the republic 's " eternal " political leading figure , former chancellor helmut kohl .
all those who claim that politics is a business like any other are wrong : politicians bear a special responsibility and have a special duty to integrity and independence .
citizens have a right to a " transparent representative , " who tells them what he earns and where his money comes from .
every politician should know that he can not ask citizens to be completely honest when it comes to taxes , but use - on good advice , in most cases - every possible loophole that he can find or has created himself .
credibility also gets lost when scandals are uncovered but have no ramifications .
roland koch , the " ruthless scout " with dubious involvement in the cdu 's financing scandal , is still state premier of hesse .
franz-josef jung , his former chief-of-staff , who stepped down because of the scandal in september 2000 , is now germany 's defense minister .
that 's not just frustrating .
it 's scandalous .
so who should fix it then ?
talk about the " failure of parties " is often followed by the demand to replace party politicians with experts .
after all , the latter are seen as impartial and have to know what 's really needed .
parties on the other hand are biased .
but how much objectivity can democracy stand ?
parties produce opinions , differing assessments , interpretations and conclusions about current facts and developments .
they do n't deliver " truths , " even if they like to pretend they do .
democratic pluralism is based on a multitude of more or less subjective opinions and assessments that citizens can choose from .
one can admittedly question to what extent parties currently fulfill that task .
if only experts decide on policy , the " objective truth " suddenly moves to the center of politics - a truth that only a small elite of specialists has knowledge about .

" we are following very closely all developments that can occur " on currency markets , said luxembourg 's prime minister jean-claude juncker , who chaired the meeting .
ministers were careful , however , not to overplay their concerns , fearful that hitting the panic button could unnerve financial markets reeling from a slew of bad economic news of late .

14 , in portugal , the continued strength of the euro was a concern , although finance chiefs said economic growth should hold .
france got a deficit scolding . before the 13 ministers got down to business in the northern city of porto , portugal on friday , they took a ride on a river cruiser up the douro river .
the message in this time of global credit upheavals seemed to be : do n't rock the boat .
europe is enjoying healthy growth and financial chiefs do n't want the us sub-prime rate crisis or a muscle-bound euro to throw it off track .
" we are able to handle situations like -lrb- the current economic uncertainty -rrb- , " austrian finance minister wilhelm molterer told journalists as the 13 gathered for a working breakfast .
" the european economy is robust and stable . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european central bank president jean-claude trichet is worried about financial market volatility the reassuring words come after the euro hit a record high of $ 1.3927 on thursday , reviving fears that an overly strong currency could hurt euro-zone exports by making them more expensive on international markets .
" we are following very closely all developments that can occur " on currency markets , said luxembourg 's prime minister jean-claude juncker , who chaired the meeting .
ministers were careful , however , not to overplay their concerns , fearful that hitting the panic button could unnerve financial markets reeling from a slew of bad economic news of late .
besides the strong euro , it appears that the international fall-out from the sub-prime crisis in the us , which was sparked by high-risk home mortgage lending , is continuing .
impact , but not a huge one analysts say the creeping paralysis that the sub-prime crisis has caused has occurred not because banks have necessarily lost money as a consequence of the crisis , but because they are not sure if they have lost money or not .
this type of uncertainty has made them wary about lending , exacerbating the problem .
on friday , news broke that british mortgage lender northern rock had been given an emergency loan by the bank of england to see it through a credit crunch .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the finance chiefs delivered a relatively upbeat assessment despite that , ministers from the 13 nations who have adopted the euro were careful to say that , while recent events will not help economic matters , the turbulence will not hurt them that much either .
" we think that the recent developments on the financial markets will have an impact , but a light impact , on the outlook for growth in 2007 toward the end of the year , " said juncker .
" we believe that economic growth will remain sufficiently robust so that in 2008 we will not see a sharp downward revision . "
the european commission lowered its euro-zone growth forecasts slightly this week - not because of the strong euro , but because of the credit crunch .
it predicted that the bloc 's economy would grow by 2.5 percent instead of 2.6 percent , which had been previously forecast .
" the fundamentals in the euro area and the european economies remain solid : profits in private companies continue to be high , balance sheets in the private sector are sound ... and unemployment is at the lowest level in the past two decades , " said joaquin almunia , the eu 's economic affairs commissioner .
france rapped on knuckles france came in for a scolding at friday 's meeting for not doing enough about its deficit and was urged to do more to bring it down .
" we think that the ambitions that france has shown do not entirely correspond to the level of our expectations , " juncker told journalists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french finance minister christine lagarde although structural reforms undertaken by france " go in the right direction and should increase growth potential , " juncker said the ministers " believe that structural reforms and budget consolidation should go together . "
euro-zone finance chiefs had committed themselves in april in berlin to balancing their budgets by 2010 , but were warned by french president nicolas sarkozy that his reform plan meant france might not be in the black until 2012 .
he wants to jolt the french economy with a growth " shock " through a series of tax cuts .
the move risks reversing the country 's downward deficit trend .
france 's finance minister christine lagarde acknowledged the dissatisfaction of her counterparts , but stressed that they had approved of sarkozy 's reform package .
if the french deficit starts rising again , it could soon break the eu rules requiring that fiscal shortfalls be kept to less than 3 percent .
" we will make every effort to reach the berlin objectives in so far as the economic situation permits , " lagarde said . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de security -pipe- 14.09.2007 exposed cyber attacks could be the tip of the iceberg großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts believe that many more nations than those reported are involved in cyber attacks high-profile claims against russia and china this year , accusing them of mounting cyber attacks against western state computer systems could be the first publicized salvos of a secret cyber war involving many nations . twenty years ago , the concept of a country coming under attack not from land , air or sea but via telephone lines and communication systems was seen as science fiction .
but today , when gaining access to a government web site takes just a few mouse clicks , cyber-terrorism is a very real fact .
the alleged russian attacks on estonia 's digital infrastructure in the middle of a diplomatic spat over the relocation of a soviet-era monument in may sent nato experts to tallinn to investigate what some called the first direct attack by moscow on a nato member .
confusion over whether an attack was actually happening , however , allowed nato to avoid formulating a response to the suspected cyber attack .
then germany joined the united states , france and britain last month in blaming china for recent hacker attacks on sensitive government sites , including the pentagon and the french defense ministry . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister ansip 's estonia was targeted online " i 'm sure the germans and americans would n't have named china without having evidence , " said jan hassel , an expert and author on the subject of cyber-terrorism .
" the fact that china was singled out means that the countries apparently targeted by the chinese wanted to send out a warning . " beijing has denied all involvement in the alleged attacks , and the western governments have been unwilling to publicize exactly what , if any , classified information was compromised . badly protected systems vulnerable to attack " the increasing reliance on technology is making governments more vulnerable to cyber attack , " hassel said .
" many do n't have adequate defense systems on their files and hackers will look for a weak link , maybe a person , maybe an application and focus on that , releasing viruses to disable the system through emails . " the pentagon admitted hackers had gained access to an unclassified e-mail system in the office of us defense secretary robert gates but would not comment on a financial times report that the chinese government was involved . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us hackers targeted arabic broadcaster al jazeera in 2003 britain 's the times also reported that the pentagon suspected china 's people 's liberation army -lrb- pla -rrb- hackers of preparing a plan to disable the us aircraft carrier fleet , a threat hassel said has been exaggerated . " it would not be possible for a hacker to steer a battleship , " said hassel .
" the main threat would be the interception of communications .
while unauthorized access to military systems is a real concern , we should n't get too carried away .
there is still much of what makes up a ' nightmare ' scenario which can not currently be achieved by hacking . "
publicly accused are not alone but by engaging in cyber warfare , as seen in the estonian case , a country can obtain information about and destabilize rival nations faster - and at a fraction of the cost of the spy networks or militaries that were once necessary . retired us army officer and lecturer on asymmetric warfare zachary hubbard recently claimed in a report that the pla had developed a sizable force of professional computer hackers trained to disrupt the computer networks of china 's enemies . hubbard claimed that these hackers were trained to target banking and electronic commerce networks and electric power grids , transportation networks and oil and gas pipelines often making use of information publicly available on the internet .
china has denied the existence of any such force .
cyber units at large in the world ? while china and russia currently appear to have taken the lead in online espionage , it is highly unlikely they are alone since " no one is going to admit to -lsb- having -rsb- cyber units , " according to hassel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pla is suspected of having trained cyber units " a lot of countries are doing it , and i would not be surprised if those accusing others of the practice are guilty as well , " he said .
" what is more likely is that governments are turning a blind eye to hackers targeting other nations , or even using freelance hackers while publicly condemning the practice . " while we do n't know whether there are any official military units in europe charged with cyber missions , we have seen that certain exercises and war games carried out by the likes of china have included cyber attack scenarios , " hassel added .
nations stumped over appropriate response the official denials of any engagement in cyber espionage and difficulty in presenting hard evidence of an attack , however , have left countries wondering what action to take after falling victim to an attack . in europe , the council of europe 's convention on cybercrime became the first , and only , international legal instrument in dealing with cyber attacks .
but even that is regarded as ineffective as it applies only to signatory nations .
the convention has been signed by 38 council of europe members and five non-members - canada , japan , montenegro , south africa and the united states .
" the council of europe 's convention allows the signatories protection against each other but does little if anything to provide a legal framework where an outsider could be held accountable , " said hassel .
" european nations and the united states can expect to become increasingly targeted until a full international agreement on cyber attacks is in place . " nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but today , when gaining access to a government web site takes just a few mouse clicks , cyber-terrorism is a very real fact .
the alleged russian attacks on estonia 's digital infrastructure in the middle of a diplomatic spat over the relocation of a soviet-era monument in may sent nato experts to tallinn to investigate what some called the first direct attack by moscow on a nato member .
confusion over whether an attack was actually happening , however , allowed nato to avoid formulating a response to the suspected cyber attack .
then germany joined the united states , france and britain last month in blaming china for recent hacker attacks on sensitive government sites , including the pentagon and the french defense ministry . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister ansip 's estonia was targeted online " i 'm sure the germans and americans would n't have named china without having evidence , " said jan hassel , an expert and author on the subject of cyber-terrorism .
" the fact that china was singled out means that the countries apparently targeted by the chinese wanted to send out a warning . " beijing has denied all involvement in the alleged attacks , and the western governments have been unwilling to publicize exactly what , if any , classified information was compromised . badly protected systems vulnerable to attack " the increasing reliance on technology is making governments more vulnerable to cyber attack , " hassel said .
" many do n't have adequate defense systems on their files and hackers will look for a weak link , maybe a person , maybe an application and focus on that , releasing viruses to disable the system through emails . " the pentagon admitted hackers had gained access to an unclassified e-mail system in the office of us defense secretary robert gates but would not comment on a financial times report that the chinese government was involved . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us hackers targeted arabic broadcaster al jazeera in 2003 britain 's the times also reported that the pentagon suspected china 's people 's liberation army -lrb- pla -rrb- hackers of preparing a plan to disable the us aircraft carrier fleet , a threat hassel said has been exaggerated . " it would not be possible for a hacker to steer a battleship , " said hassel .
" the main threat would be the interception of communications .
while unauthorized access to military systems is a real concern , we should n't get too carried away .
there is still much of what makes up a ' nightmare ' scenario which can not currently be achieved by hacking . "
publicly accused are not alone but by engaging in cyber warfare , as seen in the estonian case , a country can obtain information about and destabilize rival nations faster - and at a fraction of the cost of the spy networks or militaries that were once necessary . retired us army officer and lecturer on asymmetric warfare zachary hubbard recently claimed in a report that the pla had developed a sizable force of professional computer hackers trained to disrupt the computer networks of china 's enemies . hubbard claimed that these hackers were trained to target banking and electronic commerce networks and electric power grids , transportation networks and oil and gas pipelines often making use of information publicly available on the internet .

it 's no secret that both the catholic and protestant churches in germany have long faced the problem of shrinking congregations , but has the nation irrevocably turned its back on its religious heritage ? in the past six decades , the number of german citizens belonging to one of the country 's two main churches has fallen from 94.4 to just shy of 62 percent .
and although the trend has slowed , there is no indication of a reversal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many young germans are alienated from religion carsten frerk who runs fowid , a research group on belief systems in germany , says the church has lost its power and , perhaps more crucially , it has lost the nation 's youth .

" young people are not forced into a religious culture anymore . " the younger generations have too many choices at their disposal and this is what keeps them away from making binding ideological decisions .
according to frerk , the rate at which young people break away from religious groups will soon put non-denominational germans in the majority . " one percent of christians are leaving the church every year , " he said .
" so in 20 years from now , they 'll be the minority .

at the moment , the tendency in german society is to talk about religion in the context of conflicts , but not otherwise . " take the islam issue for example , " seiwert said .
" that is something people are taking seriously . " but discussions about islam and its role in western , secular societies have prompted many germans to re-examine their own religious roots . " suddenly people are talking about europe having a christian identity , " he said . according to reinhard holmer , director of germany 's evangelische allianz , an association of evangelical christians , people are nowadays , in fact , beginning to ask more questions about what religion can offer .

" some people leave the church because it is too lackadaisical while they are looking for something more charismatic , " seiwert said . although such leaps of faith are the exception rather than the rule , seiwert claims a growing number of people are seeking spiritual fulfillment outside the mainstream churches .

it 's no secret that both the catholic and protestant churches in germany have long faced the problem of shrinking congregations , but has the nation irrevocably turned its back on its religious heritage ? in the past six decades , the number of german citizens belonging to one of the country 's two main churches has fallen from 94.4 to just shy of 62 percent .

" young people are not forced into a religious culture anymore . " the younger generations have too many choices at their disposal and this is what keeps them away from making binding ideological decisions .

at the moment , the tendency in german society is to talk about religion in the context of conflicts , but not otherwise . " take the islam issue for example , " seiwert said .
" that is something people are taking seriously . " but discussions about islam and its role in western , secular societies have prompted many germans to re-examine their own religious roots . " suddenly people are talking about europe having a christian identity , " he said . according to reinhard holmer , director of germany 's evangelische allianz , an association of evangelical christians , people are nowadays , in fact , beginning to ask more questions about what religion can offer .

you 've publicly stated your opinion .
do you have a better concept ? wendelin wiedeking : first of all , i think that the automobile industry is not the biggest emitter of co2 , even though it 's always presented that way .
in germany , for example , passenger cars are responsible for only 12 percent of co2 emissions .
we , the car industry , have worked on environment issues over the last years and decades .

if our technology were used in small or medium-sized cars , they could already emit much less .
it 's the strategy of german premium producers to test technology , invest a lot of money , and introduce the technology step by step via mid-sized cars into small ones .
a good example is mercedes-benz 's abs technology , which was first introduced in s-class models many years ago - at a high cost , also for customers .
today it 's hard to think of cars without abs breaking systems .

we need a variety of offerings - high-end cars , medium-sized cars and small ones - in order for the car industry to move forward in terms of technology . porsche is germany 's smallest car producer , but also the most profitable one .
how much money do you invest in research ? we spend significantly more than 10 percent of revenue on research and development each year .
that means that we invest in new technologies probably in a way unlike any other producer .
porsche thrives on new technologies , on issues such as environment , safety and driving pleasure in a way that many others ca n't or do n't want to .
we 're investing disproportionately in the future . what do you think about the current debate to protect companies against foreign takeovers ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vw and porsche have co-built cars for decades there are many nations that find it important to control key sectors .

we , the car industry , have worked on environment issues over the last years and decades .

if our technology were used in small or medium-sized cars , they could already emit much less .
it 's the strategy of german premium producers to test technology , invest a lot of money , and introduce the technology step by step via mid-sized cars into small ones .
a good example is mercedes-benz 's abs technology , which was first introduced in s-class models many years ago - at a high cost , also for customers .

we need a variety of offerings - high-end cars , medium-sized cars and small ones - in order for the car industry to move forward in terms of technology . porsche is germany 's smallest car producer , but also the most profitable one .
how much money do you invest in research ? we spend significantly more than 10 percent of revenue on research and development each year .
that means that we invest in new technologies probably in a way unlike any other producer .

" " i would have wished for the ministry to stick to its original decision , " said antje blumenthal , a member of jung 's christian democratic union , in a press statement on friday .
she added that she still believed that there were serious reasons to prohibit filming at the site , but said that she would respect the decision . in july , albig had told reporters that the memorial 's dignity would be compromised by allowing a film crew to use it . no nazi flags allowed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nazi flags at the german finance ministry in august according to a defense ministry spokesman , film director brian singer and ministry officials will jointly visit the memorial to decide what can be filmed there . bild reported that government officials will not allow the crew to display nazi flags at the site .
the crew was permitted to fly the flags at the german finance ministry , where filming took place in august . the tabloid said that the film script called for four scenes to be shot at the memorial , including stauffenberg 's execution . cruise feels " great responsibility " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cruise resembles stauffenberg in an interview with german celebrity magazine bunte in august , cruise had said he felt it was important that the movie was shot on original locations instead of a studio set . " we want the inner truth , so to speak , and location helps with that , " he said , adding that he urged his critics to wait until they had seen the film . " i carry a great responsibility to the germans , for whom a man like stauffenberg is of deep significance , and i feel this responsibility to the man himself . " in an interview with dw-world.de , one of stauffenberg 's sons said that he did n't like the fact that cruise was going to play his father , but added that he had taken no steps to prevent it from happening . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 14.09.2007 mclaren-mercedes race on despite heavy punishment for spying großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mclaren-mercedes chief ron dennis was not happy about the record fine and points deduction british-german formula one racing team mclaren-mercedes has been hit with a massive fine and the deduction of all its constructors ' points for its role in a spying scandal .
the team , however , will race on . the formula one powers-that-be moved to end one of the sport 's biggest scandals in years on thursday , sept .
13 , by punishing the mclaren-mercedes racing team for having used secret technical documents acquired from rival ferrari .
but in doing so , and by fining mclaren-mercedes a massive 72 million euros -lrb- $ 100 million -rrb- and stripping the team of its constructors ' championship points , the world motor sport council may have created more controversy .
under the terms of the punishment , the british-german team has escaped being suspended from racing .
that means both world champion fernando alonso and championship leader lewis hamilton , the mclaren-mercedes team drivers , will still be allowed to race and their points in the drivers ' championship remain unaffected by the action .
mclaren drivers free to chase championship bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lewis hamilton -lrb- r . -rrb- will be able to pursue his title dream hamilton heads the drivers ' standings with 92 points , with alonso second with 89 .
ferrari drivers kimi raikkonen and felipe massa are third and fourth with 74 and 69 points , respectively .
ferrari now takes over the lead in the constructors ' standings , with bmw in second place .
the fact that the mclaren-mercedes drivers are still allowed to compete has led to some in the sport saying that the fine and punishment , in the context of the mega-bucks world of formula one , was derisory , while others were amazed by the amount demanded .
former mclaren team boss eddie jordan said the size of the punishment meted out was " baffling . "
" it does n't seem logical at all in terms of the amount of money , " jordan told bbc radio 5live .
" it is baffling .
" to the outside world this is a ridiculous amount of money , and we also need to know where is this money going to ? "
it appears as if the judgment was designed to allow everyone to emerge with some degree of satisfaction .
mclaren stands an excellent chance of winning the drivers ' championship , ferrari will almost certainly win the constructors ' title , and formula one sponsors and fans can count on a highly competitive rest of the season .
mclaren chief stands firm however , mclaren boss ron dennis said that he " did not accept " the decision to punish his team .
he told reporters that the evidence given by alonso , hamilton and team test driver pedro de la rosa demonstrated " that we did not use the leaked information to gain a competitive advantage . "
dennis was quick to stifle his ire , knowing that the punishment could have been a lot worse .
" the most important thing is that we will be going motor racing this weekend , the rest of the year and every season , " he said .
" this means that the drivers can continue to compete in the championship . "
the scandal erupted in july when a 780-page file on ferrari 's racing cars was found at the home of mclaren chief designer mike coughlan .
the documents were allegedly supplied by ferrari mechanic nigel stepney .
mclaren guilty of fraudulent conduct bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mclaren says it did not use the information from ferrari at an earlier hearing on july 26 , the council had found mclaren guilty of fraudulent conduct for having the documents in its possession but did not punish the team because there was not enough evidence to suggest that it had misused the information contained in the documents .
however , the council had warned mclaren that the team could be banned for two seasons if it were proven it had used the material to gain an unfair advantage .
last week , the fia had announced that evidence had been found that warranted a new hearing .

the team , however , will race on . the formula one powers-that-be moved to end one of the sport 's biggest scandals in years on thursday , sept .
13 , by punishing the mclaren-mercedes racing team for having used secret technical documents acquired from rival ferrari .
but in doing so , and by fining mclaren-mercedes a massive 72 million euros -lrb- $ 100 million -rrb- and stripping the team of its constructors ' championship points , the world motor sport council may have created more controversy .
under the terms of the punishment , the british-german team has escaped being suspended from racing .
that means both world champion fernando alonso and championship leader lewis hamilton , the mclaren-mercedes team drivers , will still be allowed to race and their points in the drivers ' championship remain unaffected by the action .
mclaren drivers free to chase championship bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lewis hamilton -lrb- r . -rrb- will be able to pursue his title dream hamilton heads the drivers ' standings with 92 points , with alonso second with 89 .
ferrari drivers kimi raikkonen and felipe massa are third and fourth with 74 and 69 points , respectively .
ferrari now takes over the lead in the constructors ' standings , with bmw in second place .
the fact that the mclaren-mercedes drivers are still allowed to compete has led to some in the sport saying that the fine and punishment , in the context of the mega-bucks world of formula one , was derisory , while others were amazed by the amount demanded .
former mclaren team boss eddie jordan said the size of the punishment meted out was " baffling . "
" it does n't seem logical at all in terms of the amount of money , " jordan told bbc radio 5live .
" it is baffling .
" to the outside world this is a ridiculous amount of money , and we also need to know where is this money going to ? "
it appears as if the judgment was designed to allow everyone to emerge with some degree of satisfaction .
mclaren stands an excellent chance of winning the drivers ' championship , ferrari will almost certainly win the constructors ' title , and formula one sponsors and fans can count on a highly competitive rest of the season .
mclaren chief stands firm however , mclaren boss ron dennis said that he " did not accept " the decision to punish his team .
he told reporters that the evidence given by alonso , hamilton and team test driver pedro de la rosa demonstrated " that we did not use the leaked information to gain a competitive advantage . "
dennis was quick to stifle his ire , knowing that the punishment could have been a lot worse .
" the most important thing is that we will be going motor racing this weekend , the rest of the year and every season , " he said .
" this means that the drivers can continue to compete in the championship . "
the scandal erupted in july when a 780-page file on ferrari 's racing cars was found at the home of mclaren chief designer mike coughlan .
the documents were allegedly supplied by ferrari mechanic nigel stepney .
mclaren guilty of fraudulent conduct bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mclaren says it did not use the information from ferrari at an earlier hearing on july 26 , the council had found mclaren guilty of fraudulent conduct for having the documents in its possession but did not punish the team because there was not enough evidence to suggest that it had misused the information contained in the documents .
however , the council had warned mclaren that the team could be banned for two seasons if it were proven it had used the material to gain an unfair advantage .
last week , the fia had announced that evidence had been found that warranted a new hearing .
this evidence reportedly included e-mails between alonso and de la rosa and transcripts of phone and text-message conversations between coughlan and stepney .
" in light of new evidence , facts and behavior of an extremely serious nature and grossly prejudicial to the interest of the sport have been further demonstrated , " the ferrari team said in a statement .
" ferrari is satisfied that the truth has now emerged . " dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

why not get yourself down to sauerland and get an eyeful of some good old-fashioned deer porn . when it comes to getting kinky kicks in germany , most people know that the place to go is the reeperbahn area of hamburg .
the sleazy mile of brothels and clubs offering all manner of dances - lap , table and pole - has become world famous for providing everything that seekers of sexual thrills could hope for .
but even the reeperbahn has its boundaries when it comes to pushing the envelope of lust and desire , which is why the notorious hamburg quarter may start losing customers in search of the hottest stag party .
those wanting the ultimate in horny action with a new and risqué take on voyeuristic pleasure need look no further than the ruhr area in the western german state of north-rhine westphalia .
heading into the forests around the town of arnsberg-vosswinkel , those looking for something a little unusual and au natural can pay 40 euros -lrb- $ 56 -rrb- for the pleasure of a whole night watching the locals rut wildly .
perverts beware : this is not a bestiality bus trip bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " hey babes , wanna rut ? "
before bus loads of international perverts start flooding to the region in search of exhibitionist sauerlanders , it must be revealed at this point that those performing during these night-long steamy outdoor sessions are not humans .
if that only speeds up the flow of deviants , then it must also be noted that these organized trips into the wild are run by wildwald vosswinkel , a well-respected nature trust , and that sexually excited adults are discouraged from attending .
the trust has been organizing trips into the sauerland forests for decades but only recently have they struck on the idea of bussing nature lovers into the woods to watch the local red deer mating season up close .

despite it all being very natural and above board , there remains something a little weird about groups of humans - children included - hiding in the bushes watching animals have sex … and paying for the privilege .
" it 's not weird because we observe the deer purely from an educational perspective and our staff are always on hand to offer insight and answer questions on what is one of nature 's most fascinating rituals , " wildwald 's spokesperson told dw-world.de. okay , but surely if there is a group of people standing around with night-vision equipment , observing and asking questions about a stag 's moves , that 's going to upset the rhythm and spoil the magic for the deer .
" no , " assured the wildwald spokesperson .
" we keep the people at a good distance where they can observe safely and can not disturb the animals .
wildwald has been taking people into the woods for 30 years and we know how to respect the privacy of the animals there . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de from the fringe -pipe- 14.09.2007 a nature expedition or merely deer porn ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : insert obvious and infantile comment about " feeling horny " here stuck for something to do with the family at the weekend ?
why not get yourself down to sauerland and get an eyeful of some good old-fashioned deer porn . when it comes to getting kinky kicks in germany , most people know that the place to go is the reeperbahn area of hamburg .
the sleazy mile of brothels and clubs offering all manner of dances - lap , table and pole - has become world famous for providing everything that seekers of sexual thrills could hope for .
but even the reeperbahn has its boundaries when it comes to pushing the envelope of lust and desire , which is why the notorious hamburg quarter may start losing customers in search of the hottest stag party .
those wanting the ultimate in horny action with a new and risqué take on voyeuristic pleasure need look no further than the ruhr area in the western german state of north-rhine westphalia .
heading into the forests around the town of arnsberg-vosswinkel , those looking for something a little unusual and au natural can pay 40 euros -lrb- $ 56 -rrb- for the pleasure of a whole night watching the locals rut wildly .
perverts beware : this is not a bestiality bus trip bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " hey babes , wanna rut ? "
before bus loads of international perverts start flooding to the region in search of exhibitionist sauerlanders , it must be revealed at this point that those performing during these night-long steamy outdoor sessions are not humans .
if that only speeds up the flow of deviants , then it must also be noted that these organized trips into the wild are run by wildwald vosswinkel , a well-respected nature trust , and that sexually excited adults are discouraged from attending .
the trust has been organizing trips into the sauerland forests for decades but only recently have they struck on the idea of bussing nature lovers into the woods to watch the local red deer mating season up close .
from sept .
22 to oct .
21 , wildwald will be taking the curious to the best rutting areas in the forests , where young stags fight over the available deer babes before claiming their prize in the time-honored fashion .
organizers shocked by questions of weirdness bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " does the ear tag and collar ensemble do anything for you ? "
despite it all being very natural and above board , there remains something a little weird about groups of humans - children included - hiding in the bushes watching animals have sex … and paying for the privilege .
" it 's not weird because we observe the deer purely from an educational perspective and our staff are always on hand to offer insight and answer questions on what is one of nature 's most fascinating rituals , " wildwald 's spokesperson told dw-world.de. okay , but surely if there is a group of people standing around with night-vision equipment , observing and asking questions about a stag 's moves , that 's going to upset the rhythm and spoil the magic for the deer .
" no , " assured the wildwald spokesperson .
" we keep the people at a good distance where they can observe safely and can not disturb the animals .
wildwald has been taking people into the woods for 30 years and we know how to respect the privacy of the animals there . "
so there you have it .
a nature expedition or just some good old deer porn ?
we 'll let you decide .

" what 's happening to our political parties ? "
it 's a question i get asked again and again as a parliamentarian .
the question is usually followed by more : " do you think that parties still represent the people ?
do they still know what citizens are worried about ? "
all this then quickly leads to a debate about the " end of party democracy . "
on the one hand , one should n't just accept the common stereotype that - in simple terms - parties and politicians are responsible for the current problems .
on the other hand , citizens also have a certain responsibility for democracy .
" let the state , let politics fix it . "
democracy is n't that easy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : omid nouripour at 32 , i 'm a fairly young german , who spent the first 13 years of his life in iran .
it 's a country where absolutely nothing could and can be taken for granted that seems so natural to us in germany : freedom of opinion , freedom of the press , the rule of law and - last , but not least - the right to free elections .
here , people , unfortunately , take these achievements for granted .
but taking things for granted usually leads to indifference .
" do n't talk to me about indifference , " some might say .
" we 're all staunch democrats , but we do n't have to pretend each day that democracy has to be reinvented . "
still , there are extreme situations in which democracy might not have to be reinvented , but certainly defended on a daily basis - for example , in light of the recurring right-wing extremist attacks on foreigners or people who appear foreign , which are , to put it mildly , " tolerated " by bystanders .
if we give right-wing extremists a free rein , we not only turn away and forfeit any kind of humanity and moral courage , we also question our democratic freedom and rights , as the ideology of right-wing extremists is founded on arbitrariness , hatred and violence .
today , they go against those who look different , tomorrow against those , who simply say what they think .
but i also miss civic participation to safeguard democratic values in less extreme situations - for example , when the current government increasingly wants to curtail civil rights and snoop around the privacy of citizens .
i still have n't heard the cry of protest from staunch democrats in cases such as limiting data protection by saving airplane passenger information , telecommunications data retention , online searches of private computers or insufficient protection for minorities .
" those who would give up essential liberty to purchase a little temporary safety , deserve neither liberty nor safety , " this quote attributed to benjamin franklin has been used a lot during the current discussion , but has rarely been heard .
democracy only works when there 's a balance of freedom and safety .
that 's why i think that a functioning democracy needs citizens who do n't grow tired of defending democratic values and freedoms .
democracy could do with a bit more heart and soul .
parties are commonly seen as the ground zero of all weariness when it comes to politics and democracy .
they are no longer trusted .
-lrb- were they ever ? -rrb-
they make a lot of promises and keep very few of them .
they are not able to solve the problems that lie ahead of us .
their work mainly concentrates on their own interests or those that they 've been drawn to by lobbyists .
their personnel is interested in power and status symbols , such as official cars , and has no scruples about enriching itself via regular pay raises that are taken from the public coffers .
this image has been around for quite some time .
considering the scandals that are regularly uncovered , it 's hard to counter this assessment of politicians and parties - just think of the party financing scandal of the christian democratic union and the demystification of the republic 's " eternal " political leading figure , former chancellor helmut kohl .
all those who claim that politics is a business like any other are wrong : politicians bear a special responsibility and have a special duty to integrity and independence .
citizens have a right to a " transparent representative , " who tells them what he earns and where his money comes from .
every politician should know that he can not ask citizens to be completely honest when it comes to taxes , but use - on good advice , in most cases - every possible loophole that he can find or has created himself .
credibility also gets lost when scandals are uncovered but have no ramifications .
roland koch , the " ruthless scout " with dubious involvement in the cdu 's financing scandal , is still state premier of hesse .
franz-josef jung , his former chief-of-staff , who stepped down because of the scandal in september 2000 , is now germany 's defense minister .
that 's not just frustrating .
it 's scandalous .
so who should fix it then ?
talk about the " failure of parties " is often followed by the demand to replace party politicians with experts .
after all , the latter are seen as impartial and have to know what 's really needed .
parties on the other hand are biased .
but how much objectivity can democracy stand ?
parties produce opinions , differing assessments , interpretations and conclusions about current facts and developments .
they do n't deliver " truths , " even if they like to pretend they do .
democratic pluralism is based on a multitude of more or less subjective opinions and assessments that citizens can choose from .
one can admittedly question to what extent parties currently fulfill that task .
if only experts decide on policy , the " objective truth " suddenly moves to the center of politics - a truth that only a small elite of specialists has knowledge about .
democracy would become an " expertocracy " that 's much less transparent and much harder for citizens to influence .
that 's why i can not imagine democracy without parties .
and still , democracy goes beyond the concept of parties .
some backroom party strategist may fantasize about taking complete control of democracy , but that wo n't happen .
our party system is n't static but mirrors societal changes .
the current weakening of peoples ' parties and the increasing number of five-party parliaments is proof of this .
in my opinion , it 's crucial to strengthen awareness for democratic freedom and values - within parties and within society .
if we manage to do that and if parties will be more open to new ideas and supporters than they have been so far , quite a few tired democrats might become wide awake again - and help to build party membership .

" what 's happening to our political parties ? "
it 's a question i get asked again and again as a parliamentarian .
the question is usually followed by more : " do you think that parties still represent the people ?
do they still know what citizens are worried about ? "
all this then quickly leads to a debate about the " end of party democracy . "
on the one hand , one should n't just accept the common stereotype that - in simple terms - parties and politicians are responsible for the current problems .
on the other hand , citizens also have a certain responsibility for democracy .
" let the state , let politics fix it . "
democracy is n't that easy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : omid nouripour at 32 , i 'm a fairly young german , who spent the first 13 years of his life in iran .
it 's a country where absolutely nothing could and can be taken for granted that seems so natural to us in germany : freedom of opinion , freedom of the press , the rule of law and - last , but not least - the right to free elections .
here , people , unfortunately , take these achievements for granted .
but taking things for granted usually leads to indifference .
" do n't talk to me about indifference , " some might say .
" we 're all staunch democrats , but we do n't have to pretend each day that democracy has to be reinvented . "
still , there are extreme situations in which democracy might not have to be reinvented , but certainly defended on a daily basis - for example , in light of the recurring right-wing extremist attacks on foreigners or people who appear foreign , which are , to put it mildly , " tolerated " by bystanders .
if we give right-wing extremists a free rein , we not only turn away and forfeit any kind of humanity and moral courage , we also question our democratic freedom and rights , as the ideology of right-wing extremists is founded on arbitrariness , hatred and violence .
today , they go against those who look different , tomorrow against those , who simply say what they think .
but i also miss civic participation to safeguard democratic values in less extreme situations - for example , when the current government increasingly wants to curtail civil rights and snoop around the privacy of citizens .
i still have n't heard the cry of protest from staunch democrats in cases such as limiting data protection by saving airplane passenger information , telecommunications data retention , online searches of private computers or insufficient protection for minorities .
" those who would give up essential liberty to purchase a little temporary safety , deserve neither liberty nor safety , " this quote attributed to benjamin franklin has been used a lot during the current discussion , but has rarely been heard .
democracy only works when there 's a balance of freedom and safety .
that 's why i think that a functioning democracy needs citizens who do n't grow tired of defending democratic values and freedoms .
democracy could do with a bit more heart and soul .
parties are commonly seen as the ground zero of all weariness when it comes to politics and democracy .
they are no longer trusted .
-lrb- were they ever ? -rrb-
they make a lot of promises and keep very few of them .
they are not able to solve the problems that lie ahead of us .
their work mainly concentrates on their own interests or those that they 've been drawn to by lobbyists .
their personnel is interested in power and status symbols , such as official cars , and has no scruples about enriching itself via regular pay raises that are taken from the public coffers .
this image has been around for quite some time .
considering the scandals that are regularly uncovered , it 's hard to counter this assessment of politicians and parties - just think of the party financing scandal of the christian democratic union and the demystification of the republic 's " eternal " political leading figure , former chancellor helmut kohl .
all those who claim that politics is a business like any other are wrong : politicians bear a special responsibility and have a special duty to integrity and independence .
citizens have a right to a " transparent representative , " who tells them what he earns and where his money comes from .
every politician should know that he can not ask citizens to be completely honest when it comes to taxes , but use - on good advice , in most cases - every possible loophole that he can find or has created himself .
credibility also gets lost when scandals are uncovered but have no ramifications .
roland koch , the " ruthless scout " with dubious involvement in the cdu 's financing scandal , is still state premier of hesse .
franz-josef jung , his former chief-of-staff , who stepped down because of the scandal in september 2000 , is now germany 's defense minister .
that 's not just frustrating .
it 's scandalous .
so who should fix it then ?
talk about the " failure of parties " is often followed by the demand to replace party politicians with experts .
after all , the latter are seen as impartial and have to know what 's really needed .
parties on the other hand are biased .
but how much objectivity can democracy stand ?
parties produce opinions , differing assessments , interpretations and conclusions about current facts and developments .
they do n't deliver " truths , " even if they like to pretend they do .
democratic pluralism is based on a multitude of more or less subjective opinions and assessments that citizens can choose from .
one can admittedly question to what extent parties currently fulfill that task .
if only experts decide on policy , the " objective truth " suddenly moves to the center of politics - a truth that only a small elite of specialists has knowledge about .
democracy would become an " expertocracy " that 's much less transparent and much harder for citizens to influence .
that 's why i can not imagine democracy without parties .
and still , democracy goes beyond the concept of parties .
some backroom party strategist may fantasize about taking complete control of democracy , but that wo n't happen .
our party system is n't static but mirrors societal changes .
the current weakening of peoples ' parties and the increasing number of five-party parliaments is proof of this .
in my opinion , it 's crucial to strengthen awareness for democratic freedom and values - within parties and within society .
if we manage to do that and if parties will be more open to new ideas and supporters than they have been so far , quite a few tired democrats might become wide awake again - and help to build party membership .
omid nouripour is a member of the green party and became a german parliamentarian on sept .

" what 's happening to our political parties ? "
it 's a question i get asked again and again as a parliamentarian .
the question is usually followed by more : " do you think that parties still represent the people ?
do they still know what citizens are worried about ? "
all this then quickly leads to a debate about the " end of party democracy . "
on the one hand , one should n't just accept the common stereotype that - in simple terms - parties and politicians are responsible for the current problems .
on the other hand , citizens also have a certain responsibility for democracy .
" let the state , let politics fix it . "
democracy is n't that easy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : omid nouripour at 32 , i 'm a fairly young german , who spent the first 13 years of his life in iran .
it 's a country where absolutely nothing could and can be taken for granted that seems so natural to us in germany : freedom of opinion , freedom of the press , the rule of law and - last , but not least - the right to free elections .
here , people , unfortunately , take these achievements for granted .
but taking things for granted usually leads to indifference .
" do n't talk to me about indifference , " some might say .
" we 're all staunch democrats , but we do n't have to pretend each day that democracy has to be reinvented . "
still , there are extreme situations in which democracy might not have to be reinvented , but certainly defended on a daily basis - for example , in light of the recurring right-wing extremist attacks on foreigners or people who appear foreign , which are , to put it mildly , " tolerated " by bystanders .
if we give right-wing extremists a free rein , we not only turn away and forfeit any kind of humanity and moral courage , we also question our democratic freedom and rights , as the ideology of right-wing extremists is founded on arbitrariness , hatred and violence .
today , they go against those who look different , tomorrow against those , who simply say what they think .
but i also miss civic participation to safeguard democratic values in less extreme situations - for example , when the current government increasingly wants to curtail civil rights and snoop around the privacy of citizens .
i still have n't heard the cry of protest from staunch democrats in cases such as limiting data protection by saving airplane passenger information , telecommunications data retention , online searches of private computers or insufficient protection for minorities .
" those who would give up essential liberty to purchase a little temporary safety , deserve neither liberty nor safety , " this quote attributed to benjamin franklin has been used a lot during the current discussion , but has rarely been heard .
democracy only works when there 's a balance of freedom and safety .
that 's why i think that a functioning democracy needs citizens who do n't grow tired of defending democratic values and freedoms .
democracy could do with a bit more heart and soul .
parties are commonly seen as the ground zero of all weariness when it comes to politics and democracy .
they are no longer trusted .
-lrb- were they ever ? -rrb-
they make a lot of promises and keep very few of them .
they are not able to solve the problems that lie ahead of us .
their work mainly concentrates on their own interests or those that they 've been drawn to by lobbyists .
their personnel is interested in power and status symbols , such as official cars , and has no scruples about enriching itself via regular pay raises that are taken from the public coffers .
this image has been around for quite some time .
considering the scandals that are regularly uncovered , it 's hard to counter this assessment of politicians and parties - just think of the party financing scandal of the christian democratic union and the demystification of the republic 's " eternal " political leading figure , former chancellor helmut kohl .
all those who claim that politics is a business like any other are wrong : politicians bear a special responsibility and have a special duty to integrity and independence .
citizens have a right to a " transparent representative , " who tells them what he earns and where his money comes from .
every politician should know that he can not ask citizens to be completely honest when it comes to taxes , but use - on good advice , in most cases - every possible loophole that he can find or has created himself .
credibility also gets lost when scandals are uncovered but have no ramifications .
roland koch , the " ruthless scout " with dubious involvement in the cdu 's financing scandal , is still state premier of hesse .
franz-josef jung , his former chief-of-staff , who stepped down because of the scandal in september 2000 , is now germany 's defense minister .
that 's not just frustrating .
it 's scandalous .
so who should fix it then ?
talk about the " failure of parties " is often followed by the demand to replace party politicians with experts .
after all , the latter are seen as impartial and have to know what 's really needed .
parties on the other hand are biased .
but how much objectivity can democracy stand ?
parties produce opinions , differing assessments , interpretations and conclusions about current facts and developments .
they do n't deliver " truths , " even if they like to pretend they do .
democratic pluralism is based on a multitude of more or less subjective opinions and assessments that citizens can choose from .
one can admittedly question to what extent parties currently fulfill that task .
if only experts decide on policy , the " objective truth " suddenly moves to the center of politics - a truth that only a small elite of specialists has knowledge about .
democracy would become an " expertocracy " that 's much less transparent and much harder for citizens to influence .
that 's why i can not imagine democracy without parties .
and still , democracy goes beyond the concept of parties .
some backroom party strategist may fantasize about taking complete control of democracy , but that wo n't happen .
our party system is n't static but mirrors societal changes .
the current weakening of peoples ' parties and the increasing number of five-party parliaments is proof of this .
in my opinion , it 's crucial to strengthen awareness for democratic freedom and values - within parties and within society .
if we manage to do that and if parties will be more open to new ideas and supporters than they have been so far , quite a few tired democrats might become wide awake again - and help to build party membership .

" what 's happening to our political parties ? "
it 's a question i get asked again and again as a parliamentarian .
the question is usually followed by more : " do you think that parties still represent the people ?
do they still know what citizens are worried about ? "
all this then quickly leads to a debate about the " end of party democracy . "
on the one hand , one should n't just accept the common stereotype that - in simple terms - parties and politicians are responsible for the current problems .
on the other hand , citizens also have a certain responsibility for democracy .
" let the state , let politics fix it . "
democracy is n't that easy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : omid nouripour at 32 , i 'm a fairly young german , who spent the first 13 years of his life in iran .
it 's a country where absolutely nothing could and can be taken for granted that seems so natural to us in germany : freedom of opinion , freedom of the press , the rule of law and - last , but not least - the right to free elections .
here , people , unfortunately , take these achievements for granted .
but taking things for granted usually leads to indifference .
" do n't talk to me about indifference , " some might say .
" we 're all staunch democrats , but we do n't have to pretend each day that democracy has to be reinvented . "
still , there are extreme situations in which democracy might not have to be reinvented , but certainly defended on a daily basis - for example , in light of the recurring right-wing extremist attacks on foreigners or people who appear foreign , which are , to put it mildly , " tolerated " by bystanders .
if we give right-wing extremists a free rein , we not only turn away and forfeit any kind of humanity and moral courage , we also question our democratic freedom and rights , as the ideology of right-wing extremists is founded on arbitrariness , hatred and violence .
today , they go against those who look different , tomorrow against those , who simply say what they think .
but i also miss civic participation to safeguard democratic values in less extreme situations - for example , when the current government increasingly wants to curtail civil rights and snoop around the privacy of citizens .
i still have n't heard the cry of protest from staunch democrats in cases such as limiting data protection by saving airplane passenger information , telecommunications data retention , online searches of private computers or insufficient protection for minorities .
" those who would give up essential liberty to purchase a little temporary safety , deserve neither liberty nor safety , " this quote attributed to benjamin franklin has been used a lot during the current discussion , but has rarely been heard .
democracy only works when there 's a balance of freedom and safety .
that 's why i think that a functioning democracy needs citizens who do n't grow tired of defending democratic values and freedoms .
democracy could do with a bit more heart and soul .
parties are commonly seen as the ground zero of all weariness when it comes to politics and democracy .
they are no longer trusted .
-lrb- were they ever ? -rrb-
they make a lot of promises and keep very few of them .
they are not able to solve the problems that lie ahead of us .
their work mainly concentrates on their own interests or those that they 've been drawn to by lobbyists .
their personnel is interested in power and status symbols , such as official cars , and has no scruples about enriching itself via regular pay raises that are taken from the public coffers .
this image has been around for quite some time .
considering the scandals that are regularly uncovered , it 's hard to counter this assessment of politicians and parties - just think of the party financing scandal of the christian democratic union and the demystification of the republic 's " eternal " political leading figure , former chancellor helmut kohl .
all those who claim that politics is a business like any other are wrong : politicians bear a special responsibility and have a special duty to integrity and independence .
citizens have a right to a " transparent representative , " who tells them what he earns and where his money comes from .
every politician should know that he can not ask citizens to be completely honest when it comes to taxes , but use - on good advice , in most cases - every possible loophole that he can find or has created himself .
credibility also gets lost when scandals are uncovered but have no ramifications .
roland koch , the " ruthless scout " with dubious involvement in the cdu 's financing scandal , is still state premier of hesse .
franz-josef jung , his former chief-of-staff , who stepped down because of the scandal in september 2000 , is now germany 's defense minister .
that 's not just frustrating .
it 's scandalous .
so who should fix it then ?
talk about the " failure of parties " is often followed by the demand to replace party politicians with experts .
after all , the latter are seen as impartial and have to know what 's really needed .
parties on the other hand are biased .
but how much objectivity can democracy stand ?
parties produce opinions , differing assessments , interpretations and conclusions about current facts and developments .
they do n't deliver " truths , " even if they like to pretend they do .
democratic pluralism is based on a multitude of more or less subjective opinions and assessments that citizens can choose from .
one can admittedly question to what extent parties currently fulfill that task .
if only experts decide on policy , the " objective truth " suddenly moves to the center of politics - a truth that only a small elite of specialists has knowledge about .
democracy would become an " expertocracy " that 's much less transparent and much harder for citizens to influence .
that 's why i can not imagine democracy without parties .
and still , democracy goes beyond the concept of parties .
some backroom party strategist may fantasize about taking complete control of democracy , but that wo n't happen .
our party system is n't static but mirrors societal changes .
the current weakening of peoples ' parties and the increasing number of five-party parliaments is proof of this .
in my opinion , it 's crucial to strengthen awareness for democratic freedom and values - within parties and within society .
if we manage to do that and if parties will be more open to new ideas and supporters than they have been so far , quite a few tired democrats might become wide awake again - and help to build party membership .

" what 's happening to our political parties ? "
it 's a question i get asked again and again as a parliamentarian .
the question is usually followed by more : " do you think that parties still represent the people ?
do they still know what citizens are worried about ? "
all this then quickly leads to a debate about the " end of party democracy . "
on the one hand , one should n't just accept the common stereotype that - in simple terms - parties and politicians are responsible for the current problems .
on the other hand , citizens also have a certain responsibility for democracy .
" let the state , let politics fix it . "
democracy is n't that easy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : omid nouripour at 32 , i 'm a fairly young german , who spent the first 13 years of his life in iran .
it 's a country where absolutely nothing could and can be taken for granted that seems so natural to us in germany : freedom of opinion , freedom of the press , the rule of law and - last , but not least - the right to free elections .
here , people , unfortunately , take these achievements for granted .
but taking things for granted usually leads to indifference .
" do n't talk to me about indifference , " some might say .
" we 're all staunch democrats , but we do n't have to pretend each day that democracy has to be reinvented . "
still , there are extreme situations in which democracy might not have to be reinvented , but certainly defended on a daily basis - for example , in light of the recurring right-wing extremist attacks on foreigners or people who appear foreign , which are , to put it mildly , " tolerated " by bystanders .
if we give right-wing extremists a free rein , we not only turn away and forfeit any kind of humanity and moral courage , we also question our democratic freedom and rights , as the ideology of right-wing extremists is founded on arbitrariness , hatred and violence .
today , they go against those who look different , tomorrow against those , who simply say what they think .
but i also miss civic participation to safeguard democratic values in less extreme situations - for example , when the current government increasingly wants to curtail civil rights and snoop around the privacy of citizens .
i still have n't heard the cry of protest from staunch democrats in cases such as limiting data protection by saving airplane passenger information , telecommunications data retention , online searches of private computers or insufficient protection for minorities .
" those who would give up essential liberty to purchase a little temporary safety , deserve neither liberty nor safety , " this quote attributed to benjamin franklin has been used a lot during the current discussion , but has rarely been heard .
democracy only works when there 's a balance of freedom and safety .
that 's why i think that a functioning democracy needs citizens who do n't grow tired of defending democratic values and freedoms .
democracy could do with a bit more heart and soul .
parties are commonly seen as the ground zero of all weariness when it comes to politics and democracy .
they are no longer trusted .
-lrb- were they ever ? -rrb-
they make a lot of promises and keep very few of them .
they are not able to solve the problems that lie ahead of us .
their work mainly concentrates on their own interests or those that they 've been drawn to by lobbyists .
their personnel is interested in power and status symbols , such as official cars , and has no scruples about enriching itself via regular pay raises that are taken from the public coffers .
this image has been around for quite some time .
considering the scandals that are regularly uncovered , it 's hard to counter this assessment of politicians and parties - just think of the party financing scandal of the christian democratic union and the demystification of the republic 's " eternal " political leading figure , former chancellor helmut kohl .
all those who claim that politics is a business like any other are wrong : politicians bear a special responsibility and have a special duty to integrity and independence .
citizens have a right to a " transparent representative , " who tells them what he earns and where his money comes from .
every politician should know that he can not ask citizens to be completely honest when it comes to taxes , but use - on good advice , in most cases - every possible loophole that he can find or has created himself .
credibility also gets lost when scandals are uncovered but have no ramifications .
roland koch , the " ruthless scout " with dubious involvement in the cdu 's financing scandal , is still state premier of hesse .
franz-josef jung , his former chief-of-staff , who stepped down because of the scandal in september 2000 , is now germany 's defense minister .
that 's not just frustrating .
it 's scandalous .
so who should fix it then ?
talk about the " failure of parties " is often followed by the demand to replace party politicians with experts .
after all , the latter are seen as impartial and have to know what 's really needed .
parties on the other hand are biased .
but how much objectivity can democracy stand ?
parties produce opinions , differing assessments , interpretations and conclusions about current facts and developments .
they do n't deliver " truths , " even if they like to pretend they do .
democratic pluralism is based on a multitude of more or less subjective opinions and assessments that citizens can choose from .
one can admittedly question to what extent parties currently fulfill that task .
if only experts decide on policy , the " objective truth " suddenly moves to the center of politics - a truth that only a small elite of specialists has knowledge about .
democracy would become an " expertocracy " that 's much less transparent and much harder for citizens to influence .
that 's why i can not imagine democracy without parties .
and still , democracy goes beyond the concept of parties .
some backroom party strategist may fantasize about taking complete control of democracy , but that wo n't happen .
our party system is n't static but mirrors societal changes .
the current weakening of peoples ' parties and the increasing number of five-party parliaments is proof of this .
in my opinion , it 's crucial to strengthen awareness for democratic freedom and values - within parties and within society .
if we manage to do that and if parties will be more open to new ideas and supporters than they have been so far , quite a few tired democrats might become wide awake again - and help to build party membership .

" what 's happening to our political parties ? "
it 's a question i get asked again and again as a parliamentarian .
the question is usually followed by more : " do you think that parties still represent the people ?
do they still know what citizens are worried about ? "
all this then quickly leads to a debate about the " end of party democracy . "
on the one hand , one should n't just accept the common stereotype that - in simple terms - parties and politicians are responsible for the current problems .
on the other hand , citizens also have a certain responsibility for democracy .
" let the state , let politics fix it . "
democracy is n't that easy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : omid nouripour at 32 , i 'm a fairly young german , who spent the first 13 years of his life in iran .
it 's a country where absolutely nothing could and can be taken for granted that seems so natural to us in germany : freedom of opinion , freedom of the press , the rule of law and - last , but not least - the right to free elections .
here , people , unfortunately , take these achievements for granted .
but taking things for granted usually leads to indifference .
" do n't talk to me about indifference , " some might say .
" we 're all staunch democrats , but we do n't have to pretend each day that democracy has to be reinvented . "
still , there are extreme situations in which democracy might not have to be reinvented , but certainly defended on a daily basis - for example , in light of the recurring right-wing extremist attacks on foreigners or people who appear foreign , which are , to put it mildly , " tolerated " by bystanders .
if we give right-wing extremists a free rein , we not only turn away and forfeit any kind of humanity and moral courage , we also question our democratic freedom and rights , as the ideology of right-wing extremists is founded on arbitrariness , hatred and violence .
today , they go against those who look different , tomorrow against those , who simply say what they think .
but i also miss civic participation to safeguard democratic values in less extreme situations - for example , when the current government increasingly wants to curtail civil rights and snoop around the privacy of citizens .
i still have n't heard the cry of protest from staunch democrats in cases such as limiting data protection by saving airplane passenger information , telecommunications data retention , online searches of private computers or insufficient protection for minorities .
" those who would give up essential liberty to purchase a little temporary safety , deserve neither liberty nor safety , " this quote attributed to benjamin franklin has been used a lot during the current discussion , but has rarely been heard .
democracy only works when there 's a balance of freedom and safety .
that 's why i think that a functioning democracy needs citizens who do n't grow tired of defending democratic values and freedoms .
democracy could do with a bit more heart and soul .
parties are commonly seen as the ground zero of all weariness when it comes to politics and democracy .
they are no longer trusted .
-lrb- were they ever ? -rrb-
they make a lot of promises and keep very few of them .
they are not able to solve the problems that lie ahead of us .
their work mainly concentrates on their own interests or those that they 've been drawn to by lobbyists .
their personnel is interested in power and status symbols , such as official cars , and has no scruples about enriching itself via regular pay raises that are taken from the public coffers .
this image has been around for quite some time .
considering the scandals that are regularly uncovered , it 's hard to counter this assessment of politicians and parties - just think of the party financing scandal of the christian democratic union and the demystification of the republic 's " eternal " political leading figure , former chancellor helmut kohl .
all those who claim that politics is a business like any other are wrong : politicians bear a special responsibility and have a special duty to integrity and independence .
citizens have a right to a " transparent representative , " who tells them what he earns and where his money comes from .
every politician should know that he can not ask citizens to be completely honest when it comes to taxes , but use - on good advice , in most cases - every possible loophole that he can find or has created himself .
credibility also gets lost when scandals are uncovered but have no ramifications .
roland koch , the " ruthless scout " with dubious involvement in the cdu 's financing scandal , is still state premier of hesse .
franz-josef jung , his former chief-of-staff , who stepped down because of the scandal in september 2000 , is now germany 's defense minister .
that 's not just frustrating .
it 's scandalous .
so who should fix it then ?
talk about the " failure of parties " is often followed by the demand to replace party politicians with experts .
after all , the latter are seen as impartial and have to know what 's really needed .
parties on the other hand are biased .
but how much objectivity can democracy stand ?
parties produce opinions , differing assessments , interpretations and conclusions about current facts and developments .
they do n't deliver " truths , " even if they like to pretend they do .
democratic pluralism is based on a multitude of more or less subjective opinions and assessments that citizens can choose from .
one can admittedly question to what extent parties currently fulfill that task .
if only experts decide on policy , the " objective truth " suddenly moves to the center of politics - a truth that only a small elite of specialists has knowledge about .
democracy would become an " expertocracy " that 's much less transparent and much harder for citizens to influence .
that 's why i can not imagine democracy without parties .
and still , democracy goes beyond the concept of parties .
some backroom party strategist may fantasize about taking complete control of democracy , but that wo n't happen .
our party system is n't static but mirrors societal changes .
the current weakening of peoples ' parties and the increasing number of five-party parliaments is proof of this .
in my opinion , it 's crucial to strengthen awareness for democratic freedom and values - within parties and within society .
if we manage to do that and if parties will be more open to new ideas and supporters than they have been so far , quite a few tired democrats might become wide awake again - and help to build party membership .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de security -pipe- 14.09.2007 exposed cyber attacks could be the tip of the iceberg großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts believe that many more nations than those reported are involved in cyber attacks high-profile claims against russia and china this year , accusing them of mounting cyber attacks against western state computer systems could be the first publicized salvos of a secret cyber war involving many nations . twenty years ago , the concept of a country coming under attack not from land , air or sea but via telephone lines and communication systems was seen as science fiction .
but today , when gaining access to a government web site takes just a few mouse clicks , cyber-terrorism is a very real fact .
the alleged russian attacks on estonia 's digital infrastructure in the middle of a diplomatic spat over the relocation of a soviet-era monument in may sent nato experts to tallinn to investigate what some called the first direct attack by moscow on a nato member .
confusion over whether an attack was actually happening , however , allowed nato to avoid formulating a response to the suspected cyber attack .
then germany joined the united states , france and britain last month in blaming china for recent hacker attacks on sensitive government sites , including the pentagon and the french defense ministry . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister ansip 's estonia was targeted online " i 'm sure the germans and americans would n't have named china without having evidence , " said jan hassel , an expert and author on the subject of cyber-terrorism .
" the fact that china was singled out means that the countries apparently targeted by the chinese wanted to send out a warning . " beijing has denied all involvement in the alleged attacks , and the western governments have been unwilling to publicize exactly what , if any , classified information was compromised . badly protected systems vulnerable to attack " the increasing reliance on technology is making governments more vulnerable to cyber attack , " hassel said .
" many do n't have adequate defense systems on their files and hackers will look for a weak link , maybe a person , maybe an application and focus on that , releasing viruses to disable the system through emails . " the pentagon admitted hackers had gained access to an unclassified e-mail system in the office of us defense secretary robert gates but would not comment on a financial times report that the chinese government was involved . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us hackers targeted arabic broadcaster al jazeera in 2003 britain 's the times also reported that the pentagon suspected china 's people 's liberation army -lrb- pla -rrb- hackers of preparing a plan to disable the us aircraft carrier fleet , a threat hassel said has been exaggerated . " it would not be possible for a hacker to steer a battleship , " said hassel .
" the main threat would be the interception of communications .
while unauthorized access to military systems is a real concern , we should n't get too carried away .
there is still much of what makes up a ' nightmare ' scenario which can not currently be achieved by hacking . "
publicly accused are not alone but by engaging in cyber warfare , as seen in the estonian case , a country can obtain information about and destabilize rival nations faster - and at a fraction of the cost of the spy networks or militaries that were once necessary . retired us army officer and lecturer on asymmetric warfare zachary hubbard recently claimed in a report that the pla had developed a sizable force of professional computer hackers trained to disrupt the computer networks of china 's enemies . hubbard claimed that these hackers were trained to target banking and electronic commerce networks and electric power grids , transportation networks and oil and gas pipelines often making use of information publicly available on the internet .
china has denied the existence of any such force .
cyber units at large in the world ? while china and russia currently appear to have taken the lead in online espionage , it is highly unlikely they are alone since " no one is going to admit to -lsb- having -rsb- cyber units , " according to hassel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pla is suspected of having trained cyber units " a lot of countries are doing it , and i would not be surprised if those accusing others of the practice are guilty as well , " he said .
" what is more likely is that governments are turning a blind eye to hackers targeting other nations , or even using freelance hackers while publicly condemning the practice . " while we do n't know whether there are any official military units in europe charged with cyber missions , we have seen that certain exercises and war games carried out by the likes of china have included cyber attack scenarios , " hassel added .
nations stumped over appropriate response the official denials of any engagement in cyber espionage and difficulty in presenting hard evidence of an attack , however , have left countries wondering what action to take after falling victim to an attack . in europe , the council of europe 's convention on cybercrime became the first , and only , international legal instrument in dealing with cyber attacks .
but even that is regarded as ineffective as it applies only to signatory nations .
the convention has been signed by 38 council of europe members and five non-members - canada , japan , montenegro , south africa and the united states .
" the council of europe 's convention allows the signatories protection against each other but does little if anything to provide a legal framework where an outsider could be held accountable , " said hassel .
" european nations and the united states can expect to become increasingly targeted until a full international agreement on cyber attacks is in place . " nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de security -pipe- 14.09.2007 exposed cyber attacks could be the tip of the iceberg großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts believe that many more nations than those reported are involved in cyber attacks high-profile claims against russia and china this year , accusing them of mounting cyber attacks against western state computer systems could be the first publicized salvos of a secret cyber war involving many nations . twenty years ago , the concept of a country coming under attack not from land , air or sea but via telephone lines and communication systems was seen as science fiction .
but today , when gaining access to a government web site takes just a few mouse clicks , cyber-terrorism is a very real fact .
the alleged russian attacks on estonia 's digital infrastructure in the middle of a diplomatic spat over the relocation of a soviet-era monument in may sent nato experts to tallinn to investigate what some called the first direct attack by moscow on a nato member .
confusion over whether an attack was actually happening , however , allowed nato to avoid formulating a response to the suspected cyber attack .
then germany joined the united states , france and britain last month in blaming china for recent hacker attacks on sensitive government sites , including the pentagon and the french defense ministry . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister ansip 's estonia was targeted online " i 'm sure the germans and americans would n't have named china without having evidence , " said jan hassel , an expert and author on the subject of cyber-terrorism .
" the fact that china was singled out means that the countries apparently targeted by the chinese wanted to send out a warning . " beijing has denied all involvement in the alleged attacks , and the western governments have been unwilling to publicize exactly what , if any , classified information was compromised . badly protected systems vulnerable to attack " the increasing reliance on technology is making governments more vulnerable to cyber attack , " hassel said .
" many do n't have adequate defense systems on their files and hackers will look for a weak link , maybe a person , maybe an application and focus on that , releasing viruses to disable the system through emails . " the pentagon admitted hackers had gained access to an unclassified e-mail system in the office of us defense secretary robert gates but would not comment on a financial times report that the chinese government was involved . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us hackers targeted arabic broadcaster al jazeera in 2003 britain 's the times also reported that the pentagon suspected china 's people 's liberation army -lrb- pla -rrb- hackers of preparing a plan to disable the us aircraft carrier fleet , a threat hassel said has been exaggerated . " it would not be possible for a hacker to steer a battleship , " said hassel .
" the main threat would be the interception of communications .
while unauthorized access to military systems is a real concern , we should n't get too carried away .
there is still much of what makes up a ' nightmare ' scenario which can not currently be achieved by hacking . "
publicly accused are not alone but by engaging in cyber warfare , as seen in the estonian case , a country can obtain information about and destabilize rival nations faster - and at a fraction of the cost of the spy networks or militaries that were once necessary . retired us army officer and lecturer on asymmetric warfare zachary hubbard recently claimed in a report that the pla had developed a sizable force of professional computer hackers trained to disrupt the computer networks of china 's enemies . hubbard claimed that these hackers were trained to target banking and electronic commerce networks and electric power grids , transportation networks and oil and gas pipelines often making use of information publicly available on the internet .
china has denied the existence of any such force .
cyber units at large in the world ? while china and russia currently appear to have taken the lead in online espionage , it is highly unlikely they are alone since " no one is going to admit to -lsb- having -rsb- cyber units , " according to hassel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pla is suspected of having trained cyber units " a lot of countries are doing it , and i would not be surprised if those accusing others of the practice are guilty as well , " he said .
" what is more likely is that governments are turning a blind eye to hackers targeting other nations , or even using freelance hackers while publicly condemning the practice . " while we do n't know whether there are any official military units in europe charged with cyber missions , we have seen that certain exercises and war games carried out by the likes of china have included cyber attack scenarios , " hassel added .
nations stumped over appropriate response the official denials of any engagement in cyber espionage and difficulty in presenting hard evidence of an attack , however , have left countries wondering what action to take after falling victim to an attack . in europe , the council of europe 's convention on cybercrime became the first , and only , international legal instrument in dealing with cyber attacks .
but even that is regarded as ineffective as it applies only to signatory nations .
the convention has been signed by 38 council of europe members and five non-members - canada , japan , montenegro , south africa and the united states .
" the council of europe 's convention allows the signatories protection against each other but does little if anything to provide a legal framework where an outsider could be held accountable , " said hassel .
" european nations and the united states can expect to become increasingly targeted until a full international agreement on cyber attacks is in place . " nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" what 's happening to our political parties ? "
it 's a question i get asked again and again as a parliamentarian .
the question is usually followed by more : " do you think that parties still represent the people ?
do they still know what citizens are worried about ? "
all this then quickly leads to a debate about the " end of party democracy . "
on the one hand , one should n't just accept the common stereotype that - in simple terms - parties and politicians are responsible for the current problems .
on the other hand , citizens also have a certain responsibility for democracy .
" let the state , let politics fix it . "
democracy is n't that easy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : omid nouripour at 32 , i 'm a fairly young german , who spent the first 13 years of his life in iran .
it 's a country where absolutely nothing could and can be taken for granted that seems so natural to us in germany : freedom of opinion , freedom of the press , the rule of law and - last , but not least - the right to free elections .
here , people , unfortunately , take these achievements for granted .
but taking things for granted usually leads to indifference .
" do n't talk to me about indifference , " some might say .
" we 're all staunch democrats , but we do n't have to pretend each day that democracy has to be reinvented . "
still , there are extreme situations in which democracy might not have to be reinvented , but certainly defended on a daily basis - for example , in light of the recurring right-wing extremist attacks on foreigners or people who appear foreign , which are , to put it mildly , " tolerated " by bystanders .
if we give right-wing extremists a free rein , we not only turn away and forfeit any kind of humanity and moral courage , we also question our democratic freedom and rights , as the ideology of right-wing extremists is founded on arbitrariness , hatred and violence .
today , they go against those who look different , tomorrow against those , who simply say what they think .
but i also miss civic participation to safeguard democratic values in less extreme situations - for example , when the current government increasingly wants to curtail civil rights and snoop around the privacy of citizens .
i still have n't heard the cry of protest from staunch democrats in cases such as limiting data protection by saving airplane passenger information , telecommunications data retention , online searches of private computers or insufficient protection for minorities .
" those who would give up essential liberty to purchase a little temporary safety , deserve neither liberty nor safety , " this quote attributed to benjamin franklin has been used a lot during the current discussion , but has rarely been heard .
democracy only works when there 's a balance of freedom and safety .
that 's why i think that a functioning democracy needs citizens who do n't grow tired of defending democratic values and freedoms .
democracy could do with a bit more heart and soul .
parties are commonly seen as the ground zero of all weariness when it comes to politics and democracy .
they are no longer trusted .
-lrb- were they ever ? -rrb-
they make a lot of promises and keep very few of them .
they are not able to solve the problems that lie ahead of us .
their work mainly concentrates on their own interests or those that they 've been drawn to by lobbyists .
their personnel is interested in power and status symbols , such as official cars , and has no scruples about enriching itself via regular pay raises that are taken from the public coffers .
this image has been around for quite some time .
considering the scandals that are regularly uncovered , it 's hard to counter this assessment of politicians and parties - just think of the party financing scandal of the christian democratic union and the demystification of the republic 's " eternal " political leading figure , former chancellor helmut kohl .
all those who claim that politics is a business like any other are wrong : politicians bear a special responsibility and have a special duty to integrity and independence .
citizens have a right to a " transparent representative , " who tells them what he earns and where his money comes from .
every politician should know that he can not ask citizens to be completely honest when it comes to taxes , but use - on good advice , in most cases - every possible loophole that he can find or has created himself .
credibility also gets lost when scandals are uncovered but have no ramifications .
roland koch , the " ruthless scout " with dubious involvement in the cdu 's financing scandal , is still state premier of hesse .
franz-josef jung , his former chief-of-staff , who stepped down because of the scandal in september 2000 , is now germany 's defense minister .
that 's not just frustrating .
it 's scandalous .
so who should fix it then ?
talk about the " failure of parties " is often followed by the demand to replace party politicians with experts .
after all , the latter are seen as impartial and have to know what 's really needed .
parties on the other hand are biased .
but how much objectivity can democracy stand ?
parties produce opinions , differing assessments , interpretations and conclusions about current facts and developments .
they do n't deliver " truths , " even if they like to pretend they do .
democratic pluralism is based on a multitude of more or less subjective opinions and assessments that citizens can choose from .
one can admittedly question to what extent parties currently fulfill that task .
if only experts decide on policy , the " objective truth " suddenly moves to the center of politics - a truth that only a small elite of specialists has knowledge about .
democracy would become an " expertocracy " that 's much less transparent and much harder for citizens to influence .
that 's why i can not imagine democracy without parties .
and still , democracy goes beyond the concept of parties .
some backroom party strategist may fantasize about taking complete control of democracy , but that wo n't happen .
our party system is n't static but mirrors societal changes .
the current weakening of peoples ' parties and the increasing number of five-party parliaments is proof of this .
in my opinion , it 's crucial to strengthen awareness for democratic freedom and values - within parties and within society .
if we manage to do that and if parties will be more open to new ideas and supporters than they have been so far , quite a few tired democrats might become wide awake again - and help to build party membership .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : omid nouripour at 32 , i 'm a fairly young german , who spent the first 13 years of his life in iran .
it 's a country where absolutely nothing could and can be taken for granted that seems so natural to us in germany : freedom of opinion , freedom of the press , the rule of law and - last , but not least - the right to free elections .
here , people , unfortunately , take these achievements for granted .
but taking things for granted usually leads to indifference .
" do n't talk to me about indifference , " some might say .
" we 're all staunch democrats , but we do n't have to pretend each day that democracy has to be reinvented . "
still , there are extreme situations in which democracy might not have to be reinvented , but certainly defended on a daily basis - for example , in light of the recurring right-wing extremist attacks on foreigners or people who appear foreign , which are , to put it mildly , " tolerated " by bystanders .
if we give right-wing extremists a free rein , we not only turn away and forfeit any kind of humanity and moral courage , we also question our democratic freedom and rights , as the ideology of right-wing extremists is founded on arbitrariness , hatred and violence .
today , they go against those who look different , tomorrow against those , who simply say what they think .
but i also miss civic participation to safeguard democratic values in less extreme situations - for example , when the current government increasingly wants to curtail civil rights and snoop around the privacy of citizens .
i still have n't heard the cry of protest from staunch democrats in cases such as limiting data protection by saving airplane passenger information , telecommunications data retention , online searches of private computers or insufficient protection for minorities .
" those who would give up essential liberty to purchase a little temporary safety , deserve neither liberty nor safety , " this quote attributed to benjamin franklin has been used a lot during the current discussion , but has rarely been heard .
democracy only works when there 's a balance of freedom and safety .
that 's why i think that a functioning democracy needs citizens who do n't grow tired of defending democratic values and freedoms .
democracy could do with a bit more heart and soul .
parties are commonly seen as the ground zero of all weariness when it comes to politics and democracy .
they are no longer trusted .
-lrb- were they ever ? -rrb-
they make a lot of promises and keep very few of them .
they are not able to solve the problems that lie ahead of us .
their work mainly concentrates on their own interests or those that they 've been drawn to by lobbyists .
their personnel is interested in power and status symbols , such as official cars , and has no scruples about enriching itself via regular pay raises that are taken from the public coffers .
this image has been around for quite some time .
considering the scandals that are regularly uncovered , it 's hard to counter this assessment of politicians and parties - just think of the party financing scandal of the christian democratic union and the demystification of the republic 's " eternal " political leading figure , former chancellor helmut kohl .
all those who claim that politics is a business like any other are wrong : politicians bear a special responsibility and have a special duty to integrity and independence .
citizens have a right to a " transparent representative , " who tells them what he earns and where his money comes from .
every politician should know that he can not ask citizens to be completely honest when it comes to taxes , but use - on good advice , in most cases - every possible loophole that he can find or has created himself .
credibility also gets lost when scandals are uncovered but have no ramifications .
roland koch , the " ruthless scout " with dubious involvement in the cdu 's financing scandal , is still state premier of hesse .
franz-josef jung , his former chief-of-staff , who stepped down because of the scandal in september 2000 , is now germany 's defense minister .
that 's not just frustrating .
it 's scandalous .
so who should fix it then ?
talk about the " failure of parties " is often followed by the demand to replace party politicians with experts .
after all , the latter are seen as impartial and have to know what 's really needed .
parties on the other hand are biased .
but how much objectivity can democracy stand ?
parties produce opinions , differing assessments , interpretations and conclusions about current facts and developments .
they do n't deliver " truths , " even if they like to pretend they do .
democratic pluralism is based on a multitude of more or less subjective opinions and assessments that citizens can choose from .
one can admittedly question to what extent parties currently fulfill that task .
if only experts decide on policy , the " objective truth " suddenly moves to the center of politics - a truth that only a small elite of specialists has knowledge about .
democracy would become an " expertocracy " that 's much less transparent and much harder for citizens to influence .
that 's why i can not imagine democracy without parties .
and still , democracy goes beyond the concept of parties .
some backroom party strategist may fantasize about taking complete control of democracy , but that wo n't happen .
our party system is n't static but mirrors societal changes .
the current weakening of peoples ' parties and the increasing number of five-party parliaments is proof of this .
in my opinion , it 's crucial to strengthen awareness for democratic freedom and values - within parties and within society .
if we manage to do that and if parties will be more open to new ideas and supporters than they have been so far , quite a few tired democrats might become wide awake again - and help to build party membership .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 14.09.2007 euro-zone ministers eyeing euro muscle and market volatility großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " steady as she goes " was the message from euro-zone ministers taking a boat ride in porto at a meeting of euro-zone finance ministers on friday , sept .
14 , in portugal , the continued strength of the euro was a concern , although finance chiefs said economic growth should hold .
france got a deficit scolding . before the 13 ministers got down to business in the northern city of porto , portugal on friday , they took a ride on a river cruiser up the douro river .
the message in this time of global credit upheavals seemed to be : do n't rock the boat .
europe is enjoying healthy growth and financial chiefs do n't want the us sub-prime rate crisis or a muscle-bound euro to throw it off track .
" we are able to handle situations like -lrb- the current economic uncertainty -rrb- , " austrian finance minister wilhelm molterer told journalists as the 13 gathered for a working breakfast .
" the european economy is robust and stable . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european central bank president jean-claude trichet is worried about financial market volatility the reassuring words come after the euro hit a record high of $ 1.3927 on thursday , reviving fears that an overly strong currency could hurt euro-zone exports by making them more expensive on international markets .
" we are following very closely all developments that can occur " on currency markets , said luxembourg 's prime minister jean-claude juncker , who chaired the meeting .
ministers were careful , however , not to overplay their concerns , fearful that hitting the panic button could unnerve financial markets reeling from a slew of bad economic news of late .
besides the strong euro , it appears that the international fall-out from the sub-prime crisis in the us , which was sparked by high-risk home mortgage lending , is continuing .
impact , but not a huge one analysts say the creeping paralysis that the sub-prime crisis has caused has occurred not because banks have necessarily lost money as a consequence of the crisis , but because they are not sure if they have lost money or not .
this type of uncertainty has made them wary about lending , exacerbating the problem .
on friday , news broke that british mortgage lender northern rock had been given an emergency loan by the bank of england to see it through a credit crunch .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the finance chiefs delivered a relatively upbeat assessment despite that , ministers from the 13 nations who have adopted the euro were careful to say that , while recent events will not help economic matters , the turbulence will not hurt them that much either .
" we think that the recent developments on the financial markets will have an impact , but a light impact , on the outlook for growth in 2007 toward the end of the year , " said juncker .
" we believe that economic growth will remain sufficiently robust so that in 2008 we will not see a sharp downward revision . "
the european commission lowered its euro-zone growth forecasts slightly this week - not because of the strong euro , but because of the credit crunch .
it predicted that the bloc 's economy would grow by 2.5 percent instead of 2.6 percent , which had been previously forecast .
" the fundamentals in the euro area and the european economies remain solid : profits in private companies continue to be high , balance sheets in the private sector are sound ... and unemployment is at the lowest level in the past two decades , " said joaquin almunia , the eu 's economic affairs commissioner .
france rapped on knuckles france came in for a scolding at friday 's meeting for not doing enough about its deficit and was urged to do more to bring it down .
" we think that the ambitions that france has shown do not entirely correspond to the level of our expectations , " juncker told journalists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french finance minister christine lagarde although structural reforms undertaken by france " go in the right direction and should increase growth potential , " juncker said the ministers " believe that structural reforms and budget consolidation should go together . "
euro-zone finance chiefs had committed themselves in april in berlin to balancing their budgets by 2010 , but were warned by french president nicolas sarkozy that his reform plan meant france might not be in the black until 2012 .
he wants to jolt the french economy with a growth " shock " through a series of tax cuts .
the move risks reversing the country 's downward deficit trend .
france 's finance minister christine lagarde acknowledged the dissatisfaction of her counterparts , but stressed that they had approved of sarkozy 's reform package .
if the french deficit starts rising again , it could soon break the eu rules requiring that fiscal shortfalls be kept to less than 3 percent .
" we will make every effort to reach the berlin objectives in so far as the economic situation permits , " lagarde said . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

why not get yourself down to sauerland and get an eyeful of some good old-fashioned deer porn . when it comes to getting kinky kicks in germany , most people know that the place to go is the reeperbahn area of hamburg .
the sleazy mile of brothels and clubs offering all manner of dances - lap , table and pole - has become world famous for providing everything that seekers of sexual thrills could hope for .
but even the reeperbahn has its boundaries when it comes to pushing the envelope of lust and desire , which is why the notorious hamburg quarter may start losing customers in search of the hottest stag party .
those wanting the ultimate in horny action with a new and risqué take on voyeuristic pleasure need look no further than the ruhr area in the western german state of north-rhine westphalia .
heading into the forests around the town of arnsberg-vosswinkel , those looking for something a little unusual and au natural can pay 40 euros -lrb- $ 56 -rrb- for the pleasure of a whole night watching the locals rut wildly .
perverts beware : this is not a bestiality bus trip bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " hey babes , wanna rut ? "
before bus loads of international perverts start flooding to the region in search of exhibitionist sauerlanders , it must be revealed at this point that those performing during these night-long steamy outdoor sessions are not humans .
if that only speeds up the flow of deviants , then it must also be noted that these organized trips into the wild are run by wildwald vosswinkel , a well-respected nature trust , and that sexually excited adults are discouraged from attending .
the trust has been organizing trips into the sauerland forests for decades but only recently have they struck on the idea of bussing nature lovers into the woods to watch the local red deer mating season up close .

organizers shocked by questions of weirdness bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " does the ear tag and collar ensemble do anything for you ? "
despite it all being very natural and above board , there remains something a little weird about groups of humans - children included - hiding in the bushes watching animals have sex … and paying for the privilege .
" it 's not weird because we observe the deer purely from an educational perspective and our staff are always on hand to offer insight and answer questions on what is one of nature 's most fascinating rituals , " wildwald 's spokesperson told dw-world.de. okay , but surely if there is a group of people standing around with night-vision equipment , observing and asking questions about a stag 's moves , that 's going to upset the rhythm and spoil the magic for the deer .
" no , " assured the wildwald spokesperson .
" we keep the people at a good distance where they can observe safely and can not disturb the animals .

why not get yourself down to sauerland and get an eyeful of some good old-fashioned deer porn . when it comes to getting kinky kicks in germany , most people know that the place to go is the reeperbahn area of hamburg .
the sleazy mile of brothels and clubs offering all manner of dances - lap , table and pole - has become world famous for providing everything that seekers of sexual thrills could hope for .
but even the reeperbahn has its boundaries when it comes to pushing the envelope of lust and desire , which is why the notorious hamburg quarter may start losing customers in search of the hottest stag party .
those wanting the ultimate in horny action with a new and risqué take on voyeuristic pleasure need look no further than the ruhr area in the western german state of north-rhine westphalia .
heading into the forests around the town of arnsberg-vosswinkel , those looking for something a little unusual and au natural can pay 40 euros -lrb- $ 56 -rrb- for the pleasure of a whole night watching the locals rut wildly .
perverts beware : this is not a bestiality bus trip bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " hey babes , wanna rut ? "
before bus loads of international perverts start flooding to the region in search of exhibitionist sauerlanders , it must be revealed at this point that those performing during these night-long steamy outdoor sessions are not humans .
if that only speeds up the flow of deviants , then it must also be noted that these organized trips into the wild are run by wildwald vosswinkel , a well-respected nature trust , and that sexually excited adults are discouraged from attending .
the trust has been organizing trips into the sauerland forests for decades but only recently have they struck on the idea of bussing nature lovers into the woods to watch the local red deer mating season up close .
from sept .
22 to oct .
21 , wildwald will be taking the curious to the best rutting areas in the forests , where young stags fight over the available deer babes before claiming their prize in the time-honored fashion .
organizers shocked by questions of weirdness bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " does the ear tag and collar ensemble do anything for you ? "
despite it all being very natural and above board , there remains something a little weird about groups of humans - children included - hiding in the bushes watching animals have sex … and paying for the privilege .
" it 's not weird because we observe the deer purely from an educational perspective and our staff are always on hand to offer insight and answer questions on what is one of nature 's most fascinating rituals , " wildwald 's spokesperson told dw-world.de. okay , but surely if there is a group of people standing around with night-vision equipment , observing and asking questions about a stag 's moves , that 's going to upset the rhythm and spoil the magic for the deer .
" no , " assured the wildwald spokesperson .
" we keep the people at a good distance where they can observe safely and can not disturb the animals .
wildwald has been taking people into the woods for 30 years and we know how to respect the privacy of the animals there . "
so there you have it .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 14.09.2007 euro-zone ministers eyeing euro muscle and market volatility großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " steady as she goes " was the message from euro-zone ministers taking a boat ride in porto at a meeting of euro-zone finance ministers on friday , sept .
14 , in portugal , the continued strength of the euro was a concern , although finance chiefs said economic growth should hold .
france got a deficit scolding . before the 13 ministers got down to business in the northern city of porto , portugal on friday , they took a ride on a river cruiser up the douro river .
the message in this time of global credit upheavals seemed to be : do n't rock the boat .
europe is enjoying healthy growth and financial chiefs do n't want the us sub-prime rate crisis or a muscle-bound euro to throw it off track .
" we are able to handle situations like -lrb- the current economic uncertainty -rrb- , " austrian finance minister wilhelm molterer told journalists as the 13 gathered for a working breakfast .
" the european economy is robust and stable . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european central bank president jean-claude trichet is worried about financial market volatility the reassuring words come after the euro hit a record high of $ 1.3927 on thursday , reviving fears that an overly strong currency could hurt euro-zone exports by making them more expensive on international markets .
" we are following very closely all developments that can occur " on currency markets , said luxembourg 's prime minister jean-claude juncker , who chaired the meeting .
ministers were careful , however , not to overplay their concerns , fearful that hitting the panic button could unnerve financial markets reeling from a slew of bad economic news of late .
besides the strong euro , it appears that the international fall-out from the sub-prime crisis in the us , which was sparked by high-risk home mortgage lending , is continuing .
impact , but not a huge one analysts say the creeping paralysis that the sub-prime crisis has caused has occurred not because banks have necessarily lost money as a consequence of the crisis , but because they are not sure if they have lost money or not .
this type of uncertainty has made them wary about lending , exacerbating the problem .
on friday , news broke that british mortgage lender northern rock had been given an emergency loan by the bank of england to see it through a credit crunch .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the finance chiefs delivered a relatively upbeat assessment despite that , ministers from the 13 nations who have adopted the euro were careful to say that , while recent events will not help economic matters , the turbulence will not hurt them that much either .
" we think that the recent developments on the financial markets will have an impact , but a light impact , on the outlook for growth in 2007 toward the end of the year , " said juncker .
" we believe that economic growth will remain sufficiently robust so that in 2008 we will not see a sharp downward revision . "
the european commission lowered its euro-zone growth forecasts slightly this week - not because of the strong euro , but because of the credit crunch .
it predicted that the bloc 's economy would grow by 2.5 percent instead of 2.6 percent , which had been previously forecast .
" the fundamentals in the euro area and the european economies remain solid : profits in private companies continue to be high , balance sheets in the private sector are sound ... and unemployment is at the lowest level in the past two decades , " said joaquin almunia , the eu 's economic affairs commissioner .
france rapped on knuckles france came in for a scolding at friday 's meeting for not doing enough about its deficit and was urged to do more to bring it down .
" we think that the ambitions that france has shown do not entirely correspond to the level of our expectations , " juncker told journalists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french finance minister christine lagarde although structural reforms undertaken by france " go in the right direction and should increase growth potential , " juncker said the ministers " believe that structural reforms and budget consolidation should go together . "
euro-zone finance chiefs had committed themselves in april in berlin to balancing their budgets by 2010 , but were warned by french president nicolas sarkozy that his reform plan meant france might not be in the black until 2012 .
he wants to jolt the french economy with a growth " shock " through a series of tax cuts .
the move risks reversing the country 's downward deficit trend .
france 's finance minister christine lagarde acknowledged the dissatisfaction of her counterparts , but stressed that they had approved of sarkozy 's reform package .
if the french deficit starts rising again , it could soon break the eu rules requiring that fiscal shortfalls be kept to less than 3 percent .
" we will make every effort to reach the berlin objectives in so far as the economic situation permits , " lagarde said . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

14 , in portugal , the continued strength of the euro was a concern , although finance chiefs said economic growth should hold .
france got a deficit scolding . before the 13 ministers got down to business in the northern city of porto , portugal on friday , they took a ride on a river cruiser up the douro river .
the message in this time of global credit upheavals seemed to be : do n't rock the boat .
europe is enjoying healthy growth and financial chiefs do n't want the us sub-prime rate crisis or a muscle-bound euro to throw it off track .
" we are able to handle situations like -lrb- the current economic uncertainty -rrb- , " austrian finance minister wilhelm molterer told journalists as the 13 gathered for a working breakfast .
" the european economy is robust and stable . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european central bank president jean-claude trichet is worried about financial market volatility the reassuring words come after the euro hit a record high of $ 1.3927 on thursday , reviving fears that an overly strong currency could hurt euro-zone exports by making them more expensive on international markets .
" we are following very closely all developments that can occur " on currency markets , said luxembourg 's prime minister jean-claude juncker , who chaired the meeting .
ministers were careful , however , not to overplay their concerns , fearful that hitting the panic button could unnerve financial markets reeling from a slew of bad economic news of late .
besides the strong euro , it appears that the international fall-out from the sub-prime crisis in the us , which was sparked by high-risk home mortgage lending , is continuing .
impact , but not a huge one analysts say the creeping paralysis that the sub-prime crisis has caused has occurred not because banks have necessarily lost money as a consequence of the crisis , but because they are not sure if they have lost money or not .
this type of uncertainty has made them wary about lending , exacerbating the problem .
on friday , news broke that british mortgage lender northern rock had been given an emergency loan by the bank of england to see it through a credit crunch .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the finance chiefs delivered a relatively upbeat assessment despite that , ministers from the 13 nations who have adopted the euro were careful to say that , while recent events will not help economic matters , the turbulence will not hurt them that much either .
" we think that the recent developments on the financial markets will have an impact , but a light impact , on the outlook for growth in 2007 toward the end of the year , " said juncker .
" we believe that economic growth will remain sufficiently robust so that in 2008 we will not see a sharp downward revision . "
the european commission lowered its euro-zone growth forecasts slightly this week - not because of the strong euro , but because of the credit crunch .
it predicted that the bloc 's economy would grow by 2.5 percent instead of 2.6 percent , which had been previously forecast .
" the fundamentals in the euro area and the european economies remain solid : profits in private companies continue to be high , balance sheets in the private sector are sound ... and unemployment is at the lowest level in the past two decades , " said joaquin almunia , the eu 's economic affairs commissioner .
france rapped on knuckles france came in for a scolding at friday 's meeting for not doing enough about its deficit and was urged to do more to bring it down .
" we think that the ambitions that france has shown do not entirely correspond to the level of our expectations , " juncker told journalists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french finance minister christine lagarde although structural reforms undertaken by france " go in the right direction and should increase growth potential , " juncker said the ministers " believe that structural reforms and budget consolidation should go together . "
euro-zone finance chiefs had committed themselves in april in berlin to balancing their budgets by 2010 , but were warned by french president nicolas sarkozy that his reform plan meant france might not be in the black until 2012 .
he wants to jolt the french economy with a growth " shock " through a series of tax cuts .
the move risks reversing the country 's downward deficit trend .
france 's finance minister christine lagarde acknowledged the dissatisfaction of her counterparts , but stressed that they had approved of sarkozy 's reform package .
if the french deficit starts rising again , it could soon break the eu rules requiring that fiscal shortfalls be kept to less than 3 percent .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european central bank president jean-claude trichet is worried about financial market volatility the reassuring words come after the euro hit a record high of $ 1.3927 on thursday , reviving fears that an overly strong currency could hurt euro-zone exports by making them more expensive on international markets .
" we are following very closely all developments that can occur " on currency markets , said luxembourg 's prime minister jean-claude juncker , who chaired the meeting .
ministers were careful , however , not to overplay their concerns , fearful that hitting the panic button could unnerve financial markets reeling from a slew of bad economic news of late .
besides the strong euro , it appears that the international fall-out from the sub-prime crisis in the us , which was sparked by high-risk home mortgage lending , is continuing .
impact , but not a huge one analysts say the creeping paralysis that the sub-prime crisis has caused has occurred not because banks have necessarily lost money as a consequence of the crisis , but because they are not sure if they have lost money or not .
this type of uncertainty has made them wary about lending , exacerbating the problem .
on friday , news broke that british mortgage lender northern rock had been given an emergency loan by the bank of england to see it through a credit crunch .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the finance chiefs delivered a relatively upbeat assessment despite that , ministers from the 13 nations who have adopted the euro were careful to say that , while recent events will not help economic matters , the turbulence will not hurt them that much either .
" we think that the recent developments on the financial markets will have an impact , but a light impact , on the outlook for growth in 2007 toward the end of the year , " said juncker .
" we believe that economic growth will remain sufficiently robust so that in 2008 we will not see a sharp downward revision . "
the european commission lowered its euro-zone growth forecasts slightly this week - not because of the strong euro , but because of the credit crunch .
it predicted that the bloc 's economy would grow by 2.5 percent instead of 2.6 percent , which had been previously forecast .
" the fundamentals in the euro area and the european economies remain solid : profits in private companies continue to be high , balance sheets in the private sector are sound ... and unemployment is at the lowest level in the past two decades , " said joaquin almunia , the eu 's economic affairs commissioner .
france rapped on knuckles france came in for a scolding at friday 's meeting for not doing enough about its deficit and was urged to do more to bring it down .
" we think that the ambitions that france has shown do not entirely correspond to the level of our expectations , " juncker told journalists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french finance minister christine lagarde although structural reforms undertaken by france " go in the right direction and should increase growth potential , " juncker said the ministers " believe that structural reforms and budget consolidation should go together . "
euro-zone finance chiefs had committed themselves in april in berlin to balancing their budgets by 2010 , but were warned by french president nicolas sarkozy that his reform plan meant france might not be in the black until 2012 .
he wants to jolt the french economy with a growth " shock " through a series of tax cuts .
the move risks reversing the country 's downward deficit trend .
france 's finance minister christine lagarde acknowledged the dissatisfaction of her counterparts , but stressed that they had approved of sarkozy 's reform package .
if the french deficit starts rising again , it could soon break the eu rules requiring that fiscal shortfalls be kept to less than 3 percent .
" we will make every effort to reach the berlin objectives in so far as the economic situation permits , " lagarde said . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" this means that the drivers can continue to compete in the championship . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de security -pipe- 14.09.2007 exposed cyber attacks could be the tip of the iceberg großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts believe that many more nations than those reported are involved in cyber attacks high-profile claims against russia and china this year , accusing them of mounting cyber attacks against western state computer systems could be the first publicized salvos of a secret cyber war involving many nations . twenty years ago , the concept of a country coming under attack not from land , air or sea but via telephone lines and communication systems was seen as science fiction .
but today , when gaining access to a government web site takes just a few mouse clicks , cyber-terrorism is a very real fact .
the alleged russian attacks on estonia 's digital infrastructure in the middle of a diplomatic spat over the relocation of a soviet-era monument in may sent nato experts to tallinn to investigate what some called the first direct attack by moscow on a nato member .
confusion over whether an attack was actually happening , however , allowed nato to avoid formulating a response to the suspected cyber attack .
then germany joined the united states , france and britain last month in blaming china for recent hacker attacks on sensitive government sites , including the pentagon and the french defense ministry . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister ansip 's estonia was targeted online " i 'm sure the germans and americans would n't have named china without having evidence , " said jan hassel , an expert and author on the subject of cyber-terrorism .
" the fact that china was singled out means that the countries apparently targeted by the chinese wanted to send out a warning . " beijing has denied all involvement in the alleged attacks , and the western governments have been unwilling to publicize exactly what , if any , classified information was compromised . badly protected systems vulnerable to attack " the increasing reliance on technology is making governments more vulnerable to cyber attack , " hassel said .
" many do n't have adequate defense systems on their files and hackers will look for a weak link , maybe a person , maybe an application and focus on that , releasing viruses to disable the system through emails . " the pentagon admitted hackers had gained access to an unclassified e-mail system in the office of us defense secretary robert gates but would not comment on a financial times report that the chinese government was involved . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us hackers targeted arabic broadcaster al jazeera in 2003 britain 's the times also reported that the pentagon suspected china 's people 's liberation army -lrb- pla -rrb- hackers of preparing a plan to disable the us aircraft carrier fleet , a threat hassel said has been exaggerated . " it would not be possible for a hacker to steer a battleship , " said hassel .
" the main threat would be the interception of communications .
while unauthorized access to military systems is a real concern , we should n't get too carried away .
there is still much of what makes up a ' nightmare ' scenario which can not currently be achieved by hacking . "
publicly accused are not alone but by engaging in cyber warfare , as seen in the estonian case , a country can obtain information about and destabilize rival nations faster - and at a fraction of the cost of the spy networks or militaries that were once necessary . retired us army officer and lecturer on asymmetric warfare zachary hubbard recently claimed in a report that the pla had developed a sizable force of professional computer hackers trained to disrupt the computer networks of china 's enemies . hubbard claimed that these hackers were trained to target banking and electronic commerce networks and electric power grids , transportation networks and oil and gas pipelines often making use of information publicly available on the internet .
china has denied the existence of any such force .
cyber units at large in the world ? while china and russia currently appear to have taken the lead in online espionage , it is highly unlikely they are alone since " no one is going to admit to -lsb- having -rsb- cyber units , " according to hassel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pla is suspected of having trained cyber units " a lot of countries are doing it , and i would not be surprised if those accusing others of the practice are guilty as well , " he said .
" what is more likely is that governments are turning a blind eye to hackers targeting other nations , or even using freelance hackers while publicly condemning the practice . " while we do n't know whether there are any official military units in europe charged with cyber missions , we have seen that certain exercises and war games carried out by the likes of china have included cyber attack scenarios , " hassel added .
nations stumped over appropriate response the official denials of any engagement in cyber espionage and difficulty in presenting hard evidence of an attack , however , have left countries wondering what action to take after falling victim to an attack . in europe , the council of europe 's convention on cybercrime became the first , and only , international legal instrument in dealing with cyber attacks .
but even that is regarded as ineffective as it applies only to signatory nations .
the convention has been signed by 38 council of europe members and five non-members - canada , japan , montenegro , south africa and the united states .
" the council of europe 's convention allows the signatories protection against each other but does little if anything to provide a legal framework where an outsider could be held accountable , " said hassel .
" european nations and the united states can expect to become increasingly targeted until a full international agreement on cyber attacks is in place . " nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but today , when gaining access to a government web site takes just a few mouse clicks , cyber-terrorism is a very real fact .
the alleged russian attacks on estonia 's digital infrastructure in the middle of a diplomatic spat over the relocation of a soviet-era monument in may sent nato experts to tallinn to investigate what some called the first direct attack by moscow on a nato member .
confusion over whether an attack was actually happening , however , allowed nato to avoid formulating a response to the suspected cyber attack .
then germany joined the united states , france and britain last month in blaming china for recent hacker attacks on sensitive government sites , including the pentagon and the french defense ministry . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister ansip 's estonia was targeted online " i 'm sure the germans and americans would n't have named china without having evidence , " said jan hassel , an expert and author on the subject of cyber-terrorism .
" the fact that china was singled out means that the countries apparently targeted by the chinese wanted to send out a warning . " beijing has denied all involvement in the alleged attacks , and the western governments have been unwilling to publicize exactly what , if any , classified information was compromised . badly protected systems vulnerable to attack " the increasing reliance on technology is making governments more vulnerable to cyber attack , " hassel said .
" many do n't have adequate defense systems on their files and hackers will look for a weak link , maybe a person , maybe an application and focus on that , releasing viruses to disable the system through emails . " the pentagon admitted hackers had gained access to an unclassified e-mail system in the office of us defense secretary robert gates but would not comment on a financial times report that the chinese government was involved . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us hackers targeted arabic broadcaster al jazeera in 2003 britain 's the times also reported that the pentagon suspected china 's people 's liberation army -lrb- pla -rrb- hackers of preparing a plan to disable the us aircraft carrier fleet , a threat hassel said has been exaggerated . " it would not be possible for a hacker to steer a battleship , " said hassel .
" the main threat would be the interception of communications .
while unauthorized access to military systems is a real concern , we should n't get too carried away .
there is still much of what makes up a ' nightmare ' scenario which can not currently be achieved by hacking . "
publicly accused are not alone but by engaging in cyber warfare , as seen in the estonian case , a country can obtain information about and destabilize rival nations faster - and at a fraction of the cost of the spy networks or militaries that were once necessary . retired us army officer and lecturer on asymmetric warfare zachary hubbard recently claimed in a report that the pla had developed a sizable force of professional computer hackers trained to disrupt the computer networks of china 's enemies . hubbard claimed that these hackers were trained to target banking and electronic commerce networks and electric power grids , transportation networks and oil and gas pipelines often making use of information publicly available on the internet .
china has denied the existence of any such force .
cyber units at large in the world ? while china and russia currently appear to have taken the lead in online espionage , it is highly unlikely they are alone since " no one is going to admit to -lsb- having -rsb- cyber units , " according to hassel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pla is suspected of having trained cyber units " a lot of countries are doing it , and i would not be surprised if those accusing others of the practice are guilty as well , " he said .
" what is more likely is that governments are turning a blind eye to hackers targeting other nations , or even using freelance hackers while publicly condemning the practice . " while we do n't know whether there are any official military units in europe charged with cyber missions , we have seen that certain exercises and war games carried out by the likes of china have included cyber attack scenarios , " hassel added .
nations stumped over appropriate response the official denials of any engagement in cyber espionage and difficulty in presenting hard evidence of an attack , however , have left countries wondering what action to take after falling victim to an attack . in europe , the council of europe 's convention on cybercrime became the first , and only , international legal instrument in dealing with cyber attacks .
but even that is regarded as ineffective as it applies only to signatory nations .
the convention has been signed by 38 council of europe members and five non-members - canada , japan , montenegro , south africa and the united states .
" the council of europe 's convention allows the signatories protection against each other but does little if anything to provide a legal framework where an outsider could be held accountable , " said hassel .
" european nations and the united states can expect to become increasingly targeted until a full international agreement on cyber attacks is in place . " nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

since 2006 , he 's also been a member of the supervisory board at volkswagen . dw-world.de : ahead of the iaa , the dispute over co2 emission targets has been getting louder and harsher .
you 've publicly stated your opinion .
do you have a better concept ? wendelin wiedeking : first of all , i think that the automobile industry is not the biggest emitter of co2 , even though it 's always presented that way .
in germany , for example , passenger cars are responsible for only 12 percent of co2 emissions .
we , the car industry , have worked on environment issues over the last years and decades .
we 'll continue to reduce co2 emissions in the coming years with modern engines and modern cars .
i think the car industry is not as bad as its image . global warming can be felt and environmental protection is a big issue .
how do you bring together environmental consciousness and powerful luxury sports cars ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : porsche unveiled a new hybrid engine earlier this year our sports cars , for example , have the lowest co2 emissions per horsepower because of extensive research work .
if our technology were used in small or medium-sized cars , they could already emit much less .
it 's the strategy of german premium producers to test technology , invest a lot of money , and introduce the technology step by step via mid-sized cars into small ones .
a good example is mercedes-benz 's abs technology , which was first introduced in s-class models many years ago - at a high cost , also for customers .
today it 's hard to think of cars without abs breaking systems .
it 's going to be like that in the future as well .
we need a variety of offerings - high-end cars , medium-sized cars and small ones - in order for the car industry to move forward in terms of technology . porsche is germany 's smallest car producer , but also the most profitable one .
how much money do you invest in research ? we spend significantly more than 10 percent of revenue on research and development each year .
that means that we invest in new technologies probably in a way unlike any other producer .
porsche thrives on new technologies , on issues such as environment , safety and driving pleasure in a way that many others ca n't or do n't want to .
we 're investing disproportionately in the future . what do you think about the current debate to protect companies against foreign takeovers ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vw and porsche have co-built cars for decades there are many nations that find it important to control key sectors .
the americans take the stand that foreigners can not buy anything that gets anywhere near arms production .
newspapers and publishing companies on the other hand can be bought .
in other words , it 's perfectly natural for americans to protect many sectors .
europeans did n't have that until now .
the state has to take on a certain protective function for the country , i can understand that .
it has to be watched , of course . a free society has to allow free capital flow . do you ever worry that porsche might be taken over by another company ? i 've actually never worried about that because i know that the porsche and piech families - the only stockholders allowed to vote - stand firmly behind the company and its tradition .
as long as the company makes money , i am sure that both families wo n't think about selling . what 's the relationship between porsche and vw like ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wiedeking thinks his cars are to kneel down for i think that we 've worked hard at porsche over the last couple of years .

since 2006 , he 's also been a member of the supervisory board at volkswagen . dw-world.de : ahead of the iaa , the dispute over co2 emission targets has been getting louder and harsher .
you 've publicly stated your opinion .
do you have a better concept ? wendelin wiedeking : first of all , i think that the automobile industry is not the biggest emitter of co2 , even though it 's always presented that way .
in germany , for example , passenger cars are responsible for only 12 percent of co2 emissions .
we , the car industry , have worked on environment issues over the last years and decades .
we 'll continue to reduce co2 emissions in the coming years with modern engines and modern cars .
i think the car industry is not as bad as its image . global warming can be felt and environmental protection is a big issue .
how do you bring together environmental consciousness and powerful luxury sports cars ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : porsche unveiled a new hybrid engine earlier this year our sports cars , for example , have the lowest co2 emissions per horsepower because of extensive research work .
if our technology were used in small or medium-sized cars , they could already emit much less .
it 's the strategy of german premium producers to test technology , invest a lot of money , and introduce the technology step by step via mid-sized cars into small ones .
a good example is mercedes-benz 's abs technology , which was first introduced in s-class models many years ago - at a high cost , also for customers .
today it 's hard to think of cars without abs breaking systems .
it 's going to be like that in the future as well .
we need a variety of offerings - high-end cars , medium-sized cars and small ones - in order for the car industry to move forward in terms of technology . porsche is germany 's smallest car producer , but also the most profitable one .
how much money do you invest in research ? we spend significantly more than 10 percent of revenue on research and development each year .
that means that we invest in new technologies probably in a way unlike any other producer .
porsche thrives on new technologies , on issues such as environment , safety and driving pleasure in a way that many others ca n't or do n't want to .
we 're investing disproportionately in the future . what do you think about the current debate to protect companies against foreign takeovers ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vw and porsche have co-built cars for decades there are many nations that find it important to control key sectors .
the americans take the stand that foreigners can not buy anything that gets anywhere near arms production .
newspapers and publishing companies on the other hand can be bought .
in other words , it 's perfectly natural for americans to protect many sectors .
europeans did n't have that until now .
the state has to take on a certain protective function for the country , i can understand that .
it has to be watched , of course . a free society has to allow free capital flow . do you ever worry that porsche might be taken over by another company ? i 've actually never worried about that because i know that the porsche and piech families - the only stockholders allowed to vote - stand firmly behind the company and its tradition .
as long as the company makes money , i am sure that both families wo n't think about selling . what 's the relationship between porsche and vw like ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wiedeking thinks his cars are to kneel down for i think that we 've worked hard at porsche over the last couple of years .

" what 's happening to our political parties ? "
it 's a question i get asked again and again as a parliamentarian .
the question is usually followed by more : " do you think that parties still represent the people ?
do they still know what citizens are worried about ? "
all this then quickly leads to a debate about the " end of party democracy . "
on the one hand , one should n't just accept the common stereotype that - in simple terms - parties and politicians are responsible for the current problems .
on the other hand , citizens also have a certain responsibility for democracy .
" let the state , let politics fix it . "
democracy is n't that easy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : omid nouripour at 32 , i 'm a fairly young german , who spent the first 13 years of his life in iran .
it 's a country where absolutely nothing could and can be taken for granted that seems so natural to us in germany : freedom of opinion , freedom of the press , the rule of law and - last , but not least - the right to free elections .
here , people , unfortunately , take these achievements for granted .
but taking things for granted usually leads to indifference .
" do n't talk to me about indifference , " some might say .
" we 're all staunch democrats , but we do n't have to pretend each day that democracy has to be reinvented . "
still , there are extreme situations in which democracy might not have to be reinvented , but certainly defended on a daily basis - for example , in light of the recurring right-wing extremist attacks on foreigners or people who appear foreign , which are , to put it mildly , " tolerated " by bystanders .
if we give right-wing extremists a free rein , we not only turn away and forfeit any kind of humanity and moral courage , we also question our democratic freedom and rights , as the ideology of right-wing extremists is founded on arbitrariness , hatred and violence .
today , they go against those who look different , tomorrow against those , who simply say what they think .
but i also miss civic participation to safeguard democratic values in less extreme situations - for example , when the current government increasingly wants to curtail civil rights and snoop around the privacy of citizens .
i still have n't heard the cry of protest from staunch democrats in cases such as limiting data protection by saving airplane passenger information , telecommunications data retention , online searches of private computers or insufficient protection for minorities .
" those who would give up essential liberty to purchase a little temporary safety , deserve neither liberty nor safety , " this quote attributed to benjamin franklin has been used a lot during the current discussion , but has rarely been heard .
democracy only works when there 's a balance of freedom and safety .
that 's why i think that a functioning democracy needs citizens who do n't grow tired of defending democratic values and freedoms .
democracy could do with a bit more heart and soul .
parties are commonly seen as the ground zero of all weariness when it comes to politics and democracy .
they are no longer trusted .
-lrb- were they ever ? -rrb-
they make a lot of promises and keep very few of them .
they are not able to solve the problems that lie ahead of us .
their work mainly concentrates on their own interests or those that they 've been drawn to by lobbyists .
their personnel is interested in power and status symbols , such as official cars , and has no scruples about enriching itself via regular pay raises that are taken from the public coffers .
this image has been around for quite some time .
considering the scandals that are regularly uncovered , it 's hard to counter this assessment of politicians and parties - just think of the party financing scandal of the christian democratic union and the demystification of the republic 's " eternal " political leading figure , former chancellor helmut kohl .
all those who claim that politics is a business like any other are wrong : politicians bear a special responsibility and have a special duty to integrity and independence .
citizens have a right to a " transparent representative , " who tells them what he earns and where his money comes from .
every politician should know that he can not ask citizens to be completely honest when it comes to taxes , but use - on good advice , in most cases - every possible loophole that he can find or has created himself .
credibility also gets lost when scandals are uncovered but have no ramifications .
roland koch , the " ruthless scout " with dubious involvement in the cdu 's financing scandal , is still state premier of hesse .
franz-josef jung , his former chief-of-staff , who stepped down because of the scandal in september 2000 , is now germany 's defense minister .
that 's not just frustrating .
it 's scandalous .
so who should fix it then ?
talk about the " failure of parties " is often followed by the demand to replace party politicians with experts .
after all , the latter are seen as impartial and have to know what 's really needed .
parties on the other hand are biased .
but how much objectivity can democracy stand ?
parties produce opinions , differing assessments , interpretations and conclusions about current facts and developments .
they do n't deliver " truths , " even if they like to pretend they do .
democratic pluralism is based on a multitude of more or less subjective opinions and assessments that citizens can choose from .
one can admittedly question to what extent parties currently fulfill that task .
if only experts decide on policy , the " objective truth " suddenly moves to the center of politics - a truth that only a small elite of specialists has knowledge about .
democracy would become an " expertocracy " that 's much less transparent and much harder for citizens to influence .
that 's why i can not imagine democracy without parties .
and still , democracy goes beyond the concept of parties .
some backroom party strategist may fantasize about taking complete control of democracy , but that wo n't happen .
our party system is n't static but mirrors societal changes .
the current weakening of peoples ' parties and the increasing number of five-party parliaments is proof of this .
in my opinion , it 's crucial to strengthen awareness for democratic freedom and values - within parties and within society .
if we manage to do that and if parties will be more open to new ideas and supporters than they have been so far , quite a few tired democrats might become wide awake again - and help to build party membership .

" what 's happening to our political parties ? "
it 's a question i get asked again and again as a parliamentarian .
the question is usually followed by more : " do you think that parties still represent the people ?
do they still know what citizens are worried about ? "
all this then quickly leads to a debate about the " end of party democracy . "
on the one hand , one should n't just accept the common stereotype that - in simple terms - parties and politicians are responsible for the current problems .
on the other hand , citizens also have a certain responsibility for democracy .
" let the state , let politics fix it . "
democracy is n't that easy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : omid nouripour at 32 , i 'm a fairly young german , who spent the first 13 years of his life in iran .
it 's a country where absolutely nothing could and can be taken for granted that seems so natural to us in germany : freedom of opinion , freedom of the press , the rule of law and - last , but not least - the right to free elections .
here , people , unfortunately , take these achievements for granted .
but taking things for granted usually leads to indifference .
" do n't talk to me about indifference , " some might say .
" we 're all staunch democrats , but we do n't have to pretend each day that democracy has to be reinvented . "
still , there are extreme situations in which democracy might not have to be reinvented , but certainly defended on a daily basis - for example , in light of the recurring right-wing extremist attacks on foreigners or people who appear foreign , which are , to put it mildly , " tolerated " by bystanders .
if we give right-wing extremists a free rein , we not only turn away and forfeit any kind of humanity and moral courage , we also question our democratic freedom and rights , as the ideology of right-wing extremists is founded on arbitrariness , hatred and violence .
today , they go against those who look different , tomorrow against those , who simply say what they think .

it 's no secret that both the catholic and protestant churches in germany have long faced the problem of shrinking congregations , but has the nation irrevocably turned its back on its religious heritage ? in the past six decades , the number of german citizens belonging to one of the country 's two main churches has fallen from 94.4 to just shy of 62 percent .
and although the trend has slowed , there is no indication of a reversal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many young germans are alienated from religion carsten frerk who runs fowid , a research group on belief systems in germany , says the church has lost its power and , perhaps more crucially , it has lost the nation 's youth .

" young people are not forced into a religious culture anymore . " the younger generations have too many choices at their disposal and this is what keeps them away from making binding ideological decisions .
according to frerk , the rate at which young people break away from religious groups will soon put non-denominational germans in the majority . " one percent of christians are leaving the church every year , " he said .
" so in 20 years from now , they 'll be the minority . " europe 's christian identity but opinions divide on whether germany has irrevocably turned its back on religion . hubert seiwert , a professor of comparative religious studies , says that although there is a widespread belief that religion and all things modern stand in direct opposition to one another , the death knell has yet to toll for christianity in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is islam in europe making europeans more aware of their christian roots ?
at the moment , the tendency in german society is to talk about religion in the context of conflicts , but not otherwise . " take the islam issue for example , " seiwert said .
" that is something people are taking seriously . " but discussions about islam and its role in western , secular societies have prompted many germans to re-examine their own religious roots . " suddenly people are talking about europe having a christian identity , " he said . according to reinhard holmer , director of germany 's evangelische allianz , an association of evangelical christians , people are nowadays , in fact , beginning to ask more questions about what religion can offer .

it 's no secret that both the catholic and protestant churches in germany have long faced the problem of shrinking congregations , but has the nation irrevocably turned its back on its religious heritage ? in the past six decades , the number of german citizens belonging to one of the country 's two main churches has fallen from 94.4 to just shy of 62 percent .
and although the trend has slowed , there is no indication of a reversal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many young germans are alienated from religion carsten frerk who runs fowid , a research group on belief systems in germany , says the church has lost its power and , perhaps more crucially , it has lost the nation 's youth . " children in germany are no longer born into a religion in the way they used to be , " frerk said .
" young people are not forced into a religious culture anymore . " the younger generations have too many choices at their disposal and this is what keeps them away from making binding ideological decisions .
according to frerk , the rate at which young people break away from religious groups will soon put non-denominational germans in the majority . " one percent of christians are leaving the church every year , " he said .
" so in 20 years from now , they 'll be the minority . " europe 's christian identity but opinions divide on whether germany has irrevocably turned its back on religion . hubert seiwert , a professor of comparative religious studies , says that although there is a widespread belief that religion and all things modern stand in direct opposition to one another , the death knell has yet to toll for christianity in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is islam in europe making europeans more aware of their christian roots ?
at the moment , the tendency in german society is to talk about religion in the context of conflicts , but not otherwise . " take the islam issue for example , " seiwert said .
" that is something people are taking seriously . " but discussions about islam and its role in western , secular societies have prompted many germans to re-examine their own religious roots . " suddenly people are talking about europe having a christian identity , " he said . according to reinhard holmer , director of germany 's evangelische allianz , an association of evangelical christians , people are nowadays , in fact , beginning to ask more questions about what religion can offer . " religious issues are becoming more mainstream and people want to know what answers the church can provide , " holmer said . seeking spirituality elsewhere bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german mormons are welcoming new members to their church for many , those answers have not been satisfying enough to keep them coming back for more .
but just because people have left the largest church communities does n't always mean they have turned their backs on religion , or indeed christianity , entirely . " some people leave the church because it is too lackadaisical while they are looking for something more charismatic , " seiwert said . although such leaps of faith are the exception rather than the rule , seiwert claims a growing number of people are seeking spiritual fulfillment outside the mainstream churches .
and there are literally dozens of alternative religions - christian and otherwise - waiting to welcome new recruits into the fold .
some have to wait longer than others . small but steady growth ralf grünke , spokesman for germany 's church of the latter-day saints - also known as mormons - says 1,066 people of all denominations have joined its ranks over the past two years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smaller religious groups in germany are often looked upon with skepticism " the church is attractive to people of all backgrounds , " grünke said , " because it is lively and our sermons are conducted by laypeople rather than vicars . " the jehovah 's witnesses in germany record an average annual increase in membership of between 0.5 and 1.5 percent .
other groups , such as the bible fellowship church and the seventh-day adventists also claim to have witnessed a small increase of members over the past years . according to seiwert , memberships are unlikely to go up unless attitudes towards the lesser-known religions in germany are changed . " we are warned against smaller groups which are not a part of the main church , " he said .
" and decisions to join them are met with skepticism . " tamsin walker send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" what 's happening to our political parties ? "
it 's a question i get asked again and again as a parliamentarian .
the question is usually followed by more : " do you think that parties still represent the people ?
do they still know what citizens are worried about ? "
all this then quickly leads to a debate about the " end of party democracy . "
on the one hand , one should n't just accept the common stereotype that - in simple terms - parties and politicians are responsible for the current problems .
on the other hand , citizens also have a certain responsibility for democracy .
" let the state , let politics fix it . "
democracy is n't that easy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : omid nouripour at 32 , i 'm a fairly young german , who spent the first 13 years of his life in iran .
it 's a country where absolutely nothing could and can be taken for granted that seems so natural to us in germany : freedom of opinion , freedom of the press , the rule of law and - last , but not least - the right to free elections .
here , people , unfortunately , take these achievements for granted .
but taking things for granted usually leads to indifference .
" do n't talk to me about indifference , " some might say .
" we 're all staunch democrats , but we do n't have to pretend each day that democracy has to be reinvented . "
still , there are extreme situations in which democracy might not have to be reinvented , but certainly defended on a daily basis - for example , in light of the recurring right-wing extremist attacks on foreigners or people who appear foreign , which are , to put it mildly , " tolerated " by bystanders .
if we give right-wing extremists a free rein , we not only turn away and forfeit any kind of humanity and moral courage , we also question our democratic freedom and rights , as the ideology of right-wing extremists is founded on arbitrariness , hatred and violence .
today , they go against those who look different , tomorrow against those , who simply say what they think .
but i also miss civic participation to safeguard democratic values in less extreme situations - for example , when the current government increasingly wants to curtail civil rights and snoop around the privacy of citizens .
i still have n't heard the cry of protest from staunch democrats in cases such as limiting data protection by saving airplane passenger information , telecommunications data retention , online searches of private computers or insufficient protection for minorities .
" those who would give up essential liberty to purchase a little temporary safety , deserve neither liberty nor safety , " this quote attributed to benjamin franklin has been used a lot during the current discussion , but has rarely been heard .
democracy only works when there 's a balance of freedom and safety .
that 's why i think that a functioning democracy needs citizens who do n't grow tired of defending democratic values and freedoms .
democracy could do with a bit more heart and soul .
parties are commonly seen as the ground zero of all weariness when it comes to politics and democracy .
they are no longer trusted .
-lrb- were they ever ? -rrb-
they make a lot of promises and keep very few of them .
they are not able to solve the problems that lie ahead of us .
their work mainly concentrates on their own interests or those that they 've been drawn to by lobbyists .
their personnel is interested in power and status symbols , such as official cars , and has no scruples about enriching itself via regular pay raises that are taken from the public coffers .
this image has been around for quite some time .
considering the scandals that are regularly uncovered , it 's hard to counter this assessment of politicians and parties - just think of the party financing scandal of the christian democratic union and the demystification of the republic 's " eternal " political leading figure , former chancellor helmut kohl .
all those who claim that politics is a business like any other are wrong : politicians bear a special responsibility and have a special duty to integrity and independence .
citizens have a right to a " transparent representative , " who tells them what he earns and where his money comes from .
every politician should know that he can not ask citizens to be completely honest when it comes to taxes , but use - on good advice , in most cases - every possible loophole that he can find or has created himself .
credibility also gets lost when scandals are uncovered but have no ramifications .
roland koch , the " ruthless scout " with dubious involvement in the cdu 's financing scandal , is still state premier of hesse .
franz-josef jung , his former chief-of-staff , who stepped down because of the scandal in september 2000 , is now germany 's defense minister .
that 's not just frustrating .
it 's scandalous .
so who should fix it then ?
talk about the " failure of parties " is often followed by the demand to replace party politicians with experts .
after all , the latter are seen as impartial and have to know what 's really needed .
parties on the other hand are biased .
but how much objectivity can democracy stand ?
parties produce opinions , differing assessments , interpretations and conclusions about current facts and developments .
they do n't deliver " truths , " even if they like to pretend they do .
democratic pluralism is based on a multitude of more or less subjective opinions and assessments that citizens can choose from .
one can admittedly question to what extent parties currently fulfill that task .
if only experts decide on policy , the " objective truth " suddenly moves to the center of politics - a truth that only a small elite of specialists has knowledge about .
democracy would become an " expertocracy " that 's much less transparent and much harder for citizens to influence .
that 's why i can not imagine democracy without parties .
and still , democracy goes beyond the concept of parties .
some backroom party strategist may fantasize about taking complete control of democracy , but that wo n't happen .
our party system is n't static but mirrors societal changes .
the current weakening of peoples ' parties and the increasing number of five-party parliaments is proof of this .
in my opinion , it 's crucial to strengthen awareness for democratic freedom and values - within parties and within society .
if we manage to do that and if parties will be more open to new ideas and supporters than they have been so far , quite a few tired democrats might become wide awake again - and help to build party membership .

here , people , unfortunately , take these achievements for granted .
but taking things for granted usually leads to indifference .
" do n't talk to me about indifference , " some might say .
" we 're all staunch democrats , but we do n't have to pretend each day that democracy has to be reinvented . "
still , there are extreme situations in which democracy might not have to be reinvented , but certainly defended on a daily basis - for example , in light of the recurring right-wing extremist attacks on foreigners or people who appear foreign , which are , to put it mildly , " tolerated " by bystanders .
if we give right-wing extremists a free rein , we not only turn away and forfeit any kind of humanity and moral courage , we also question our democratic freedom and rights , as the ideology of right-wing extremists is founded on arbitrariness , hatred and violence .
today , they go against those who look different , tomorrow against those , who simply say what they think .
but i also miss civic participation to safeguard democratic values in less extreme situations - for example , when the current government increasingly wants to curtail civil rights and snoop around the privacy of citizens .
i still have n't heard the cry of protest from staunch democrats in cases such as limiting data protection by saving airplane passenger information , telecommunications data retention , online searches of private computers or insufficient protection for minorities .
" those who would give up essential liberty to purchase a little temporary safety , deserve neither liberty nor safety , " this quote attributed to benjamin franklin has been used a lot during the current discussion , but has rarely been heard .
democracy only works when there 's a balance of freedom and safety .
that 's why i think that a functioning democracy needs citizens who do n't grow tired of defending democratic values and freedoms .
democracy could do with a bit more heart and soul .
parties are commonly seen as the ground zero of all weariness when it comes to politics and democracy .
they are no longer trusted .
-lrb- were they ever ? -rrb-
they make a lot of promises and keep very few of them .
they are not able to solve the problems that lie ahead of us .
their work mainly concentrates on their own interests or those that they 've been drawn to by lobbyists .
their personnel is interested in power and status symbols , such as official cars , and has no scruples about enriching itself via regular pay raises that are taken from the public coffers .
this image has been around for quite some time .
considering the scandals that are regularly uncovered , it 's hard to counter this assessment of politicians and parties - just think of the party financing scandal of the christian democratic union and the demystification of the republic 's " eternal " political leading figure , former chancellor helmut kohl .
all those who claim that politics is a business like any other are wrong : politicians bear a special responsibility and have a special duty to integrity and independence .
citizens have a right to a " transparent representative , " who tells them what he earns and where his money comes from .
every politician should know that he can not ask citizens to be completely honest when it comes to taxes , but use - on good advice , in most cases - every possible loophole that he can find or has created himself .
credibility also gets lost when scandals are uncovered but have no ramifications .
roland koch , the " ruthless scout " with dubious involvement in the cdu 's financing scandal , is still state premier of hesse .
franz-josef jung , his former chief-of-staff , who stepped down because of the scandal in september 2000 , is now germany 's defense minister .
that 's not just frustrating .
it 's scandalous .
so who should fix it then ?
talk about the " failure of parties " is often followed by the demand to replace party politicians with experts .
after all , the latter are seen as impartial and have to know what 's really needed .
parties on the other hand are biased .
but how much objectivity can democracy stand ?
parties produce opinions , differing assessments , interpretations and conclusions about current facts and developments .
they do n't deliver " truths , " even if they like to pretend they do .
democratic pluralism is based on a multitude of more or less subjective opinions and assessments that citizens can choose from .
one can admittedly question to what extent parties currently fulfill that task .
if only experts decide on policy , the " objective truth " suddenly moves to the center of politics - a truth that only a small elite of specialists has knowledge about .
democracy would become an " expertocracy " that 's much less transparent and much harder for citizens to influence .
that 's why i can not imagine democracy without parties .
and still , democracy goes beyond the concept of parties .
some backroom party strategist may fantasize about taking complete control of democracy , but that wo n't happen .
our party system is n't static but mirrors societal changes .
the current weakening of peoples ' parties and the increasing number of five-party parliaments is proof of this .
in my opinion , it 's crucial to strengthen awareness for democratic freedom and values - within parties and within society .
if we manage to do that and if parties will be more open to new ideas and supporters than they have been so far , quite a few tired democrats might become wide awake again - and help to build party membership .

after all , the latter are seen as impartial and have to know what 's really needed .
parties on the other hand are biased .
but how much objectivity can democracy stand ?
parties produce opinions , differing assessments , interpretations and conclusions about current facts and developments .
they do n't deliver " truths , " even if they like to pretend they do .
democratic pluralism is based on a multitude of more or less subjective opinions and assessments that citizens can choose from .
one can admittedly question to what extent parties currently fulfill that task .
if only experts decide on policy , the " objective truth " suddenly moves to the center of politics - a truth that only a small elite of specialists has knowledge about .
democracy would become an " expertocracy " that 's much less transparent and much harder for citizens to influence .
that 's why i can not imagine democracy without parties .
and still , democracy goes beyond the concept of parties .
some backroom party strategist may fantasize about taking complete control of democracy , but that wo n't happen .
our party system is n't static but mirrors societal changes .
the current weakening of peoples ' parties and the increasing number of five-party parliaments is proof of this .
in my opinion , it 's crucial to strengthen awareness for democratic freedom and values - within parties and within society .
if we manage to do that and if parties will be more open to new ideas and supporters than they have been so far , quite a few tired democrats might become wide awake again - and help to build party membership .

it 's no secret that both the catholic and protestant churches in germany have long faced the problem of shrinking congregations , but has the nation irrevocably turned its back on its religious heritage ? in the past six decades , the number of german citizens belonging to one of the country 's two main churches has fallen from 94.4 to just shy of 62 percent .
and although the trend has slowed , there is no indication of a reversal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many young germans are alienated from religion carsten frerk who runs fowid , a research group on belief systems in germany , says the church has lost its power and , perhaps more crucially , it has lost the nation 's youth . " children in germany are no longer born into a religion in the way they used to be , " frerk said .
" young people are not forced into a religious culture anymore . " the younger generations have too many choices at their disposal and this is what keeps them away from making binding ideological decisions .
according to frerk , the rate at which young people break away from religious groups will soon put non-denominational germans in the majority . " one percent of christians are leaving the church every year , " he said .
" so in 20 years from now , they 'll be the minority . " europe 's christian identity but opinions divide on whether germany has irrevocably turned its back on religion . hubert seiwert , a professor of comparative religious studies , says that although there is a widespread belief that religion and all things modern stand in direct opposition to one another , the death knell has yet to toll for christianity in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is islam in europe making europeans more aware of their christian roots ?
at the moment , the tendency in german society is to talk about religion in the context of conflicts , but not otherwise . " take the islam issue for example , " seiwert said .
" that is something people are taking seriously . " but discussions about islam and its role in western , secular societies have prompted many germans to re-examine their own religious roots . " suddenly people are talking about europe having a christian identity , " he said . according to reinhard holmer , director of germany 's evangelische allianz , an association of evangelical christians , people are nowadays , in fact , beginning to ask more questions about what religion can offer . " religious issues are becoming more mainstream and people want to know what answers the church can provide , " holmer said . seeking spirituality elsewhere bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german mormons are welcoming new members to their church for many , those answers have not been satisfying enough to keep them coming back for more .
but just because people have left the largest church communities does n't always mean they have turned their backs on religion , or indeed christianity , entirely . " some people leave the church because it is too lackadaisical while they are looking for something more charismatic , " seiwert said . although such leaps of faith are the exception rather than the rule , seiwert claims a growing number of people are seeking spiritual fulfillment outside the mainstream churches .
and there are literally dozens of alternative religions - christian and otherwise - waiting to welcome new recruits into the fold .
some have to wait longer than others . small but steady growth ralf grünke , spokesman for germany 's church of the latter-day saints - also known as mormons - says 1,066 people of all denominations have joined its ranks over the past two years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smaller religious groups in germany are often looked upon with skepticism " the church is attractive to people of all backgrounds , " grünke said , " because it is lively and our sermons are conducted by laypeople rather than vicars . " the jehovah 's witnesses in germany record an average annual increase in membership of between 0.5 and 1.5 percent .
other groups , such as the bible fellowship church and the seventh-day adventists also claim to have witnessed a small increase of members over the past years . according to seiwert , memberships are unlikely to go up unless attitudes towards the lesser-known religions in germany are changed . " we are warned against smaller groups which are not a part of the main church , " he said .

23 , will be the first time the tibetan religious leader has been invited to the chancellery , government spokesman ulrich wilhelm said on friday , sept .

the meeting is one of a series between merkel and senior religious leaders , he added .
asked by reporters if china could be upset at the dalai lama being invited to the chancellery , wilhelm said the situation in tibet was regularly brought up during german-chinese consultations on human rights .
during his term in office , former german foreign minister joschka fischer courted chinese disapproval by meeting with the buddhist leader in berlin .
germany 's chance to support tibetans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is meeting with various religious leaders the german branch of the international campaign for tibet -lrb- ict -rrb- said the spiritual leader 's talks with merkel offered germany a chance to support the people of tibet .
" the meeting is an important sign of support for tibet and especially for the policies of the dalai lama , " ict germany head kai müller said on friday in berlin .
" tibetans need international support more than ever and germany can take an important leadership role , " he said .
exiled leader the dalai lama heads a tibetan " government in exile " based in india .
he fled tibet after it was taken over by chinese troops and was awarded the nobel peace prize in 1989 for his non-violent campaigning on behalf of his country .
in his frequent visits to europe , the dalai lama promotes the cause of tibet .
recently , however , he has backed off from calling for tibetan independence , encouraging instead the international community to push for " genuine autonomy " for the himalayan region .

14 , that the makers of " valkyrie , " a film about failed hitler assassin count claus von stauffenberg , starring cruise , will be allowed to shoot key scenes of the movie in a courtyard of the german defense ministry .
stauffenberg and his co-conspirators were executed there after the failed 1944 attempt to kill the nazi dictator . " there has been a change of mind at the defense ministry , " thorsten albig , a spokesman for the german finance ministry , which issues film permits at government buildings , told the paper .

" " i would have wished for the ministry to stick to its original decision , " said antje blumenthal , a member of jung 's christian democratic union , in a press statement on friday .
she added that she still believed that there were serious reasons to prohibit filming at the site , but said that she would respect the decision . in july , albig had told reporters that the memorial 's dignity would be compromised by allowing a film crew to use it . no nazi flags allowed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nazi flags at the german finance ministry in august according to a defense ministry spokesman , film director brian singer and ministry officials will jointly visit the memorial to decide what can be filmed there . bild reported that government officials will not allow the crew to display nazi flags at the site .
the crew was permitted to fly the flags at the german finance ministry , where filming took place in august . the tabloid said that the film script called for four scenes to be shot at the memorial , including stauffenberg 's execution . cruise feels " great responsibility " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cruise resembles stauffenberg in an interview with german celebrity magazine bunte in august , cruise had said he felt it was important that the movie was shot on original locations instead of a studio set . " we want the inner truth , so to speak , and location helps with that , " he said , adding that he urged his critics to wait until they had seen the film . " i carry a great responsibility to the germans , for whom a man like stauffenberg is of deep significance , and i feel this responsibility to the man himself . " in an interview with dw-world.de , one of stauffenberg 's sons said that he did n't like the fact that cruise was going to play his father , but added that he had taken no steps to prevent it from happening . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

14 , that the makers of " valkyrie , " a film about failed hitler assassin count claus von stauffenberg , starring cruise , will be allowed to shoot key scenes of the movie in a courtyard of the german defense ministry .
stauffenberg and his co-conspirators were executed there after the failed 1944 attempt to kill the nazi dictator . " there has been a change of mind at the defense ministry , " thorsten albig , a spokesman for the german finance ministry , which issues film permits at government buildings , told the paper .
" a new request by the film team has received a positive answer . " concerns about preserving memorial 's dignity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a statue honoring stauffenberg in the courtyard earlier this year , cruise 's plan to film at the bendlerblock memorial had been met with resistance from government officials . according to news reports , german defense minister franz josef jung had said that his ministry would not allow filming at the site after one of his party colleagues had voiced concern over cruise 's scientology membership . a lawmaker , who had originally urged government officials to deny any request by the filmmakers to use the memorial site , called the turnaround an " unfortunate decision . " " i would have wished for the ministry to stick to its original decision , " said antje blumenthal , a member of jung 's christian democratic union , in a press statement on friday .
she added that she still believed that there were serious reasons to prohibit filming at the site , but said that she would respect the decision . in july , albig had told reporters that the memorial 's dignity would be compromised by allowing a film crew to use it . no nazi flags allowed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nazi flags at the german finance ministry in august according to a defense ministry spokesman , film director brian singer and ministry officials will jointly visit the memorial to decide what can be filmed there . bild reported that government officials will not allow the crew to display nazi flags at the site .
the crew was permitted to fly the flags at the german finance ministry , where filming took place in august . the tabloid said that the film script called for four scenes to be shot at the memorial , including stauffenberg 's execution . cruise feels " great responsibility " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cruise resembles stauffenberg in an interview with german celebrity magazine bunte in august , cruise had said he felt it was important that the movie was shot on original locations instead of a studio set . " we want the inner truth , so to speak , and location helps with that , " he said , adding that he urged his critics to wait until they had seen the film . " i carry a great responsibility to the germans , for whom a man like stauffenberg is of deep significance , and i feel this responsibility to the man himself . " in an interview with dw-world.de , one of stauffenberg 's sons said that he did n't like the fact that cruise was going to play his father , but added that he had taken no steps to prevent it from happening . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it 's no secret that both the catholic and protestant churches in germany have long faced the problem of shrinking congregations , but has the nation irrevocably turned its back on its religious heritage ? in the past six decades , the number of german citizens belonging to one of the country 's two main churches has fallen from 94.4 to just shy of 62 percent .
and although the trend has slowed , there is no indication of a reversal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many young germans are alienated from religion carsten frerk who runs fowid , a research group on belief systems in germany , says the church has lost its power and , perhaps more crucially , it has lost the nation 's youth . " children in germany are no longer born into a religion in the way they used to be , " frerk said .
" young people are not forced into a religious culture anymore . " the younger generations have too many choices at their disposal and this is what keeps them away from making binding ideological decisions .
according to frerk , the rate at which young people break away from religious groups will soon put non-denominational germans in the majority . " one percent of christians are leaving the church every year , " he said .
" so in 20 years from now , they 'll be the minority . " europe 's christian identity but opinions divide on whether germany has irrevocably turned its back on religion . hubert seiwert , a professor of comparative religious studies , says that although there is a widespread belief that religion and all things modern stand in direct opposition to one another , the death knell has yet to toll for christianity in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is islam in europe making europeans more aware of their christian roots ?
at the moment , the tendency in german society is to talk about religion in the context of conflicts , but not otherwise . " take the islam issue for example , " seiwert said .
" that is something people are taking seriously . " but discussions about islam and its role in western , secular societies have prompted many germans to re-examine their own religious roots . " suddenly people are talking about europe having a christian identity , " he said . according to reinhard holmer , director of germany 's evangelische allianz , an association of evangelical christians , people are nowadays , in fact , beginning to ask more questions about what religion can offer . " religious issues are becoming more mainstream and people want to know what answers the church can provide , " holmer said . seeking spirituality elsewhere bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german mormons are welcoming new members to their church for many , those answers have not been satisfying enough to keep them coming back for more .
but just because people have left the largest church communities does n't always mean they have turned their backs on religion , or indeed christianity , entirely . " some people leave the church because it is too lackadaisical while they are looking for something more charismatic , " seiwert said . although such leaps of faith are the exception rather than the rule , seiwert claims a growing number of people are seeking spiritual fulfillment outside the mainstream churches .
and there are literally dozens of alternative religions - christian and otherwise - waiting to welcome new recruits into the fold .
some have to wait longer than others . small but steady growth ralf grünke , spokesman for germany 's church of the latter-day saints - also known as mormons - says 1,066 people of all denominations have joined its ranks over the past two years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smaller religious groups in germany are often looked upon with skepticism " the church is attractive to people of all backgrounds , " grünke said , " because it is lively and our sermons are conducted by laypeople rather than vicars . " the jehovah 's witnesses in germany record an average annual increase in membership of between 0.5 and 1.5 percent .
other groups , such as the bible fellowship church and the seventh-day adventists also claim to have witnessed a small increase of members over the past years . according to seiwert , memberships are unlikely to go up unless attitudes towards the lesser-known religions in germany are changed . " we are warned against smaller groups which are not a part of the main church , " he said .
" and decisions to join them are met with skepticism . " tamsin walker send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

14 , condemning us plans to base its missile defense shield on european soil . in what will be a massive blow to the united states ' plans to base its missile defense shield in central europe , left-wing leaders from the czech republic , poland , slovenia and slovakia plus austrian chancellor alfred gusenbauer and germany 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- chief kurt beck condemned the plan and issued a joint declaration stating their opposition in no uncertain terms .
" we are concerned about the decision to deploy the system and are at one with the large majority of our populations in rejecting it , " read the declaration .
the signatories called for the eu , nato and the nato-russia council to be involved in future missile defense talks .
" a decision to station the missiles must not be taken unilaterally or bilaterally , since this is a major issue affecting the security of the whole of europe , " they said .
no new arms race in europe , urges beck bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spd leader beck called for chancellor angela merkel to oppose the missile shield beck said the statement was also a message to conservative german chancellor angela merkel , with whom the social democrats jointly rule , aimed at convincing the chancellor to oppose the shield and any new arms race in europe .
" we agreed we are against any new arms build-up in europe , " the spd leader said .
the hungarian social democrats were the only invitees who refused to sign up to the wide-ranging rebuff of us attempts to site a tracking radar in the czech republic and 10 interceptor missiles in neighboring poland at a two-day meeting of party leaders in prague .
" the hungarian social democratic party believes that europe is exposed to a terrorist attack and we have to defend ourselves against it , " the hungarian statement issued by defense minister and deputy party chairman imre szekeres read .
" individual countries should decide on their cooperation in this area .
we recognize their right to do so . "
tensions rise over proposed bases on russian border since the plan was first revealed , it has been widely condemned .
russia has been particularly irked by plans by the us to expand the defense system along its borders .
russia opposes the plan , saying it would upset a delicate strategic balance between major powers and threaten its own security .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some poles have made their feelings known the us claims that the missiles would not be aimed at russia but positioned to intercept any chemical , biological or nuclear missile attack coming from iran or north korea .
washington is currently in talks with the conservative governments in poland - where it wants to put 10 ground-based interceptor missiles - and in the czech republic , which is meant to host a radar base .
the socialist movements in both countries have been vehemently opposed to the plan and signaled their position on friday by signing the declaration .
plan hits funding obstacles in washington while opposition in europe comes from the moral and political side of the argument , the missile shield has hit financial obstacles back home in the united states .
the $ 310.4 million -lrb- 223.8 million euro -rrb- funding request for the proposed missile shield for the fiscal year starting oct .
1 was recently cut by $ 85 million by the us senate appropriations committee .

the singer appeared unannounced at the start of the encore to sing a cover of the beatles ' the long and winding road , accompanied by prince on guitar .
afterwards , the two superstars embraced and prince said to the crowd : " you know who it is - sir elton john ! "
the collaboration clearly inspired the minneapolis musician , who crammed a further seven songs into his encore .
among them were his 1980s classics when doves cry and sign o ' the times .
the bbc 's john hand , who was at the concert , said : " sir elton has performed onstage with many of the top stars of the past three decades , including eminem and george michael , but this was still a surprise - albeit one which was much appreciated by the crowd . "
second encore earlier in the show , sir elton had drawn cheers and applause when the venue 's video screens pictured him in the audience .
the 60-year-old singer recently gave the uk premiere of his red piano show at the o2 on one of prince 's rare nights off .
fans who waited around at thursday night 's concert were given a second treat - as prince and his band returned to the stage for a second encore fifteen minutes after the house lights went up .
the 49-year-old then took to the stage at the o2 's more intimate second venue for an aftershow performance that lasted more than two hours .
playing into the small hours , prince covered another beatles track - come together - and led zeppelin 's whole lotta love .
the latter was a tribute to the hard rock band who , earlier this week , announced they were to reform for a one-off show at the venue in november .
prince 's 21-date residency at the o2 draws to a close next week .

the changes , which would not apply to those serving time for murder and other violent crimes , aim to deal with the huge problem of prison overcrowding .
nearly 17,000 inmates are housed in a prison system designed for just 7,000 .
given these figures , many salvadoreans say measures to tackle overcrowding in the jails are long overdue .
the public security and justice minister , rene figueroa , said the bill presented to parliament - to grant conditional releases to qualifying prisoners - would help ease the pressure in at least 18 of the country 's penal institutions .
but violent crime is a long-standing problem in el salvador and powerful drug gangs operate across the country .
as such , the head of the country 's penal system was quick to point out that the measure would not apply to all inmates and excluded those in jail for murder or other violent crimes .
in order to qualify , older and infirm inmates will also have to show evidence of good behaviour during their prison terms .
the government estimates that as many as 1,500 inmates could benefit from the proposal .
however , with police also trying to target the drug gangs , the country 's prison overcrowding problem is still one of the worst in latin america .

bbc news -pipe- business -pipe- northern rock : reaction home news sport radio tv weather languages low graphics -pipe- accessibility help one-minute world news news services your news when you want it news front page africa americas asia-pacific europe middle east south asia uk business market data economy companies health science & environment technology entertainment also in the news - video and audio - programmes have your say in pictures country profiles special reports related bbc sites sport weather on this day editors ' blog last updated : friday , 14 september 2007 , 07:36 gmt 08:36 uk e-mail this to a friend printable version northern rock : reaction the bank of england has agreed to give emergency financial support to the northern rock , one of the uk 's largest mortgage lenders .
in doing so , it has become the highest profile uk-based victim of the fallout from the global credit crunch , which stemmed from the sub-prime mortgage crisis in the us .
here is some reaction : hm treasury the financial services authority judges that northern rock is solvent , exceeds its regulatory capital requirement and has a good quality loan book .
the decision to provide a liquidity support facility to northern rock reflects the difficulties that it has had in accessing longer term funding and the mortgage securitisation market , on which northern rock is particularly reliant .
alistair darling , chancellor of the exchequer in order to create a stable banking system , the bank steps in , it makes facilities available to the northern rock , northern rock can draw on them when it requires , but it means it can carry on trading , people can use their accounts in the normal way , they carry on making their mortgage payments in the usual way , northern rock will be able to carry on its business .
john mcfall , treasury select committee chairman i do n't think customers of northern rock should be worried about their current accounts or mortgages .
the fact that the bank is willing to act as lender of last resort should be reassuring , because it means they think the problems are temporary .
robert peston , bbc business editor although the firm remains profitable , the fact that it has had to go cap in hand to the bank is the most tangible sign that the crisis in financial markets is spilling over into businesses that touch most of our lives .
professor charles goodhart , former advisor to the bank of england it 's a remarkable example of a relatively small problem in the united states feeding through the financial system in a weird and wonderful way and causing all kinds of markets to seize up .
justin urquhart-stewart , seven investment management it is a short-term cash flow problem .
it is unusual for them to be in this position .
this is the bank of england saying we support the banking system but do not take this as an indication of us propping up investment banks .
angela knight , chief executive british bankers ' association northern rock is not a reckless lender .
the mortgage lending it does well and it does in a high quality , high calibre way .
if i 'm a saver with the northern rock or i 'm a borrower from the northern rock then i can take huge confidence from what has actually happened .
vincent cable , liberal democrat treasury spokesman this is a very serious development indeed and it was entirely predictable since northern rock is one of those banks which has been aggressively increasing its market share by offering mortgages at multiples of income well in excess of prudent levels .
it is important the depositors are protected but the governor of the bank of england is absolutely right to insist that there should be no bail-out of institutions that have operated foolishly .
yvette cooper , housing minister the financial services authority today have said that they are very clear that northern rock is solvent and has a good loan book .
i think that is very important and i think this is really about the banking system , the bank of england and the fsa doing their job in response to short term liquidity problems , short term problems in the market .

the dutch entrepreneur who bought the address now offers a free domain name service in return for targeted ads .
the deal has allowed tokelau to add 10 % to its gdp as well as gain pcs and net access for residents .
icann doubt when joost zuurbier , the founder of dot tk , decided to invest in a country level domain name in 2001 he had a choice of four unregistered addresses including ones for palestine , east timor and pitcairn .
the south pacific .tk address was the most appealing but it was a long process to convince the overseer of the net 's addressing system - the internet corporation for assigned names and numbers -lrb- icann -rrb- - that they had a valid case .
" it was a four year process .
they did n't believe the contract or even the island were real and it was only because a member of the board had been to tokelau in 1978 that they finally agreed it was ok , " explained mr zuurbier .
now there are more than 1.6 million dot tk domain names registered and it is adding around 10,000 each day .
registering a .tk domain is free although users must agree to receive targeted banner and text advertising .
the .tk domain generates 10 % of tokelau 's wealth the dot tk company gives an undisclosed amount to tokelau from every .tk sales that has allowed the tiny nation to add 10 % to its economy .
for tokelau the partnership with dot tk has offered a new way of communication to a nation that had previously relied on expensive satellite telephony and , before 1994 , radios to speak to each other .
now many of the inhabitants use free voice-over ip telephony services .
" telephone revenue has gone down by 40 % because everyone is using skype , " said aukusitino vitale , the general manager of tokelau 's telecommunications company teletok .
teleconferencing tokelau used to have just 12 computers but now there are 200 , in internet cafes , classrooms and hospitals .
the broadband connection - which is received via satellite as the ocean is too deep to lay under-water cable - is not the best at just 384 kilobits per second but it has opened up a whole new world for the islanders .
according to ionatana o 'brien , tokelau 's minister of transport , energy and telecommunications , the inhabitants have discovered music downloads , youtube and myspace .
currently net access is free although the government is considering charging as more bandwidth is consumed .
the hospitals are able to receive much-needed medical expertise from overseas doctors via e-mail and still photographs .
there are plans to add video to this service .
the mayors of each island use teleconferencing to keep in touch .
there is also a project to connect islanders to the university of south pacific which might mean inhabitants would not have to go overseas to study .
with an estimated 8,000 islanders now living in new zealand , australia and the us , the issue of emigration is a serious one .
the group of three islands now also has a dedicated website , which allows family members living abroad to keep in what is happening back home .
" the website means news can be translated into their own language as well as giving exposure to our culture , " said mr vitale .

icann doubt when joost zuurbier , the founder of dot tk , decided to invest in a country level domain name in 2001 he had a choice of four unregistered addresses including ones for palestine , east timor and pitcairn .
the south pacific .tk address was the most appealing but it was a long process to convince the overseer of the net 's addressing system - the internet corporation for assigned names and numbers -lrb- icann -rrb- - that they had a valid case .
" it was a four year process .
they did n't believe the contract or even the island were real and it was only because a member of the board had been to tokelau in 1978 that they finally agreed it was ok , " explained mr zuurbier .
now there are more than 1.6 million dot tk domain names registered and it is adding around 10,000 each day .
registering a .tk domain is free although users must agree to receive targeted banner and text advertising .
the .tk domain generates 10 % of tokelau 's wealth making a .tk website the dot tk company gives an undisclosed amount to tokelau from every .tk sales that has allowed the tiny nation to add 10 % to its economy .
for tokelau the partnership with dot tk has offered a new way of communication to a nation that had previously relied on expensive satellite telephony and , before 1994 , radios to speak to each other .
now many of the inhabitants use free voice-over ip telephony services .
" telephone revenue has gone down by 40 % because everyone is using skype , " said aukusitino vitale , the general manager of tokelau 's telecommunications company teletok .
teleconferencing tokelau used to have just 12 computers but now there are 200 , in internet cafes , classrooms and hospitals .
the broadband connection - which is received via satellite as the ocean is too deep to lay under-water cable - is not the best at just 384 kilobits per second but it has opened up a whole new world for the islanders .
the tiny nation is in a remote part of the south pacific according to ionatana o 'brien , tokelau 's minister of transport , energy and telecommunications , the inhabitants have discovered music downloads , youtube and myspace .
currently net access is free although the government is considering charging as more bandwidth is consumed .
the hospitals are able to receive much-needed medical expertise from overseas doctors via e-mail and still photographs .
there are plans to add video to this service .
the mayors of each island use teleconferencing to keep in touch .
there is also a project to connect islanders to the university of south pacific which might mean inhabitants would not have to go overseas to study .
with an estimated 8,000 islanders now living in new zealand , australia and the us , the issue of emigration is a serious one .
the group of three islands now also has a dedicated website , which allows family members living abroad to keep in what is happening back home .
" the website means news can be translated into their own language as well as giving exposure to our culture , " said mr vitale .

pupil referral units are meant to be short stay centres for those taught outside regular school because of behavioural and other problems .
but ofsted found that placements seldom had end dates and that schools rarely offered places to units ' pupils .
in 2005-6 ofsted inspectors found one in eight prus were inadequate , but half were judged good or outstanding .
this latest report was based on return visits to 28 of those judged good or outstanding last year . "
too many pupil referral units are inadequate but they could offer a second chance to children " christine gilbert ofsted chief inspector although inspectors found a clear sense of purpose and good working relationships with local authorities in successful prus , ofsted said many faced common problems .
these often affected their ability to provide children and young people with a good education .
" these include inadequate accommodation , pupils of different ages with diverse needs arriving in an unplanned way , limited numbers of specialist staff and difficulties in reintegrating pupils into mainstream schools , " ofsted said .
the success of the unit depended on its ability to overcome these challenges and the support it got from local authorities .
inspectors said most of the prus they visited did not get enough information about the academic record of the pupils who came to them .
' weak link ' this prevented them from establishing what educational level the pupils had reached .
inspectors urged local authorities to ensure schools passed on appropriate information about pupils ' attainment and their behavioural , emotional and social needs .
they also called on them to work more closely with units when it came to pupils ' reintegration to mainstream education .
inspectors said although councils encouraged prus to ensure pupils , especially the younger ones , were reintegrated , many found this difficult to achieve .
schools simply did not readily offer places to pru pupils , even when there were good partnerships between the units and local authorities . "
from february , local authorities will be required to establish statutory management committees for their prus " kevin brennan children 's minister chief inspector christine gilbert said : " too many pupil referral units are inadequate but they could offer a second chance to children if they followed the example of the best units we have reported on today " .
children 's minister kevin brennan said prus often had to deal with some of the most challenging and vulnerable young people .
the report showed there was good work happening across the country , but this should be the case everywhere , he said .
" that is why , from february , local authorities will be required to establish statutory management committees for their prus .
" these committees will be made up of representatives of key stakeholders , including local schools , and be responsible for ensuring that the needs of all pupils are appropriately met . "
shadow schools minister nick gibb said it needed to be made easier for head teachers to exclude disruptive pupils , but that meant ensuring they were given proper support when excluded .
" this report makes it clear that prus are the weak link in the system and more needs to be done to raise the quality and the specialism of education for children with behavioural difficulties , " he added .
the general secretary of the association of school and college leaders , john dunford , said schools struggled to cope with disruptive pupils .
" while many students will return to mainstream school ready to learn and behave , there are those that fall back into their old ways .
" the only way to ensure this does n't happen is for schools and prus to establish close links and regular contact between staff . "

inspectors urged local authorities to ensure schools passed on appropriate information about pupils ' attainment and their behavioural , emotional and social needs .
they also called on them to work more closely with units when it came to pupils ' reintegration to mainstream education .
