while experts , representatives of social organizations , parliamentarians and politicians spent two days frankly speaking their minds to one another during the annual " st. petersburg dialogue , " there were conciliatory noises and the invocation of common values and partnership at the highest level .
the fact that german chancellor angela merkel and russian president vladimir putin have a good and trusting relationship might speak for their pragmatism - but it does not tell us anything about whether russian-german relations are generally good and based on trust .
merkel and putin worked their way through their agenda in a business-like manner , emphasizing , in a familiar fashion , the themes of business , trade and innovation as the most unproblematic areas , as the " heart " of russian-german relations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cornelia rabitz controversial issues , such as iran , kosovo and the russia 's democratic deficits , remained on the agenda but were skated around .
no breakthrough was to be expected in wiesbaden .
nevertheless , it still seems strange that obvious differences were played down - or rather ignored - to such an extent .
the rumors that an assassination attempt was allegedly being planned on putin in tehran and the talk about a possible cancellation of his trip to iran immediately after the russian-german summit only served to contribute to the confusion .
it also demonstrated that this summit was surrounded by an air of ambivalence from a lack of openness .
the term " strategic partnership " that angela merkel so enjoys using has become hackneyed and devoid of meaning .
putin 's repeated assertions that no one has anything to fear from russia do n't ring true .
anyone who follows the public debates and those of the german and russian elites , or who takes a look at opinion polls and the media in russia , gets a completely different picture .
russia 's relations to the west appear to be malfunctioning on many different levels .
some people have even been talking about fresh confrontation and a conflict of values and interests .
mutual recriminations , critique and frosty irritation are the name of the game .
it is clearly understandable that a german chancellor would not want to add fuel to the fire .
and her russian counterpart is a master at placating and whitewashing .
it is election time in russia , even if it is difficult to use the word " election " in this case .
the beaming victor has been clear for a long time .
his name is vladimir putin and he will continue to determine the fate of this big country , although it is not yet clear in exactly what function or in what way .
but the retention of power is definitely on the agenda , and he wo n't shy away from getting involved in shady maneuvers to secure it .
putin 's renewed emphasis in wiesbaden upon his allegiance to the constitution is just a matter of lip service .
putin is set to remain angela merkel 's discussion partner .
that may ultimately be the reason why the chancellor placed so much weight upon finding common ground .
after all , they will have to continue working together .
we are left with the message that the foundations are sound and everything else can be sorted out .
or in other words : let 's approach this in a more relaxed , less excitable manner .
maybe that is not such a bad idea .
it means , at least , that the desire for change in russia remains on the table . cornelia rabitz heads dw-radio 's russian service -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de religion -pipe- 16.10.2007 german consultancy combines profits with christian values großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kiwi consultancy advocates adding faith to the pursuit of profits a german catholic diocese has decided to apply its expertise in morality to the region 's powerful business landscape by creating a management-consulting brand based on church ethics . brutal layoffs , corruption scandals , executive pay hikes , hedge-fund hijinks - reading the business pages can be like following a soap opera .
but it is exactly this overlap between workplace capitalism and modern values that make kiwi , a management-consulting agency based on the tenets of the catholic church , so important , its founder said .
so can faith , hope and charity really shed light on pension funds and profit sharing ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drumm : sharing the faith with business leaders " at the current time , our lives are very strongly influenced by our economic surroundings , " said joachim drumm , a theologian who heads up the department of church and society within the catholic diocese of rottenburg-stuttgart , in southern germany .
so it was a short step from peddling ethics within church walls to spreading the word in the business world , drumm said .
" the leader of a bank that was undergoing tough consolidation changes came to me and said they were seeking a theologian who could advise them on making the right decisions , " he said .
a series of similar requests got drumm thinking that perhaps there was a market opportunity in the waiting .
along with a handful of other local church leaders , he created kiwi , which is short for kirche und wirtschaft , or " church and economy . "
' nobody wants to do business with thugs " kiwi offers three product lines : training and workshops , management consulting , and networking forums , drumm explained .
the advice is based on decision making in accordance with the seven heavenly virtues : justice , prudence , temperance , fortitude , faith , hope , and charity .
profitability and christian virtue are not strange bedfellows if businesses practice the kind of market economy with social considerations and long-term sustainability that kiwi espouses , drumm said .
" business without values would be unthinkable , " he added .
" nobody wants to do business with thugs . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turning heavenly virtues into sayings that would make bill gates proud indeed , kiwi has taken the heavenly virtues and cloaked them in management-speak more at home in a fortune 500 business statement than the local parish council meeting .
" a person with hope knows what he wants , is open to new things , and has a vision for the future , " drumm said , explaining how kiwi often expresses the virtue of hope .
similarly , leaders exhibiting the virtue of charity " are committing themselves to a corporate culture of solidarity rather than egotism . "
an unjust economy is not a lasting economy , and without temperance - or moderation - an economic model is doomed to fail eventually , drumm said .
" if companies go for double-digit profits and at the same time lay off thousands of people , that is the wrong way to go in the long term , " he said .
aiming at small- and midsize business drumm said he expects kiwi 's clients to come out of germany 's mittelstand - the many midsize businesses that make up the vast bulk of the german economy - and from small , family-run concerns , because " in general these companies have a stronger identification with their personnel . "
thus they have a greater interest in reaching long-term solutions to problems rather than just going for immediate financial gain , he said .
klaus reiners , spokesman for the german association of management consultants , said ethical behavior should be a consideration for all management advisers , not just those affiliated with the catholic church .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siemens is the latest german firm to be wrapped up in a slush fund scandal a glance at the business headlines tells you that ethics are always a topic business leaders and consultants need to be aware of , reiners said , naming siemens as merely the latest conglomerate to be tied up in corruption scandals .
" global firms have certain responsibilities toward their workers and consumers , " he said .
" a firm just ca n't say , ' well everyone is corrupt , so we can be corrupt as well . '
you have to hold to a certain line . "
if church teachings can be used to promote responsible behavior , reiners said , then he is all for it .
" church is part of life , and work is another part of life ; there is no reason to keep them apart , " he said .
according to drumm , two-thirds of the german population is a member of one of the two main christian churches .
spiritual hunger and the limits of consumerism " christians are a big part of the german economy , " drumm said , and noted that the catholic church itself - with its schools , hospitals , daycare centers and old-age homes - is one of the country 's biggest employers overall .
business leaders are increasingly interested in combining leadership and spirituality , drumm said , adding that society as a whole is beginning to realize the limitations of pure consumerism when it comes to increasing their quality of life .
" so many people are looking for spiritual depth in their lives , " he said .
" everything in our world is becoming faster and aimed at productivity - but we are losing quality of life at the same time .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 16.10.2007 opinion : berlin and moscow look to the future großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw 's cornelia rabitz argues that german chancellor angela merkel was keen not to rock the boat because russian president vladimir putin could well remain berlin 's discussion partner in the foreseeable future . what exactly was going on at the summit in wiesbaden ?
while experts , representatives of social organizations , parliamentarians and politicians spent two days frankly speaking their minds to one another during the annual " st. petersburg dialogue , " there were conciliatory noises and the invocation of common values and partnership at the highest level .
the fact that german chancellor angela merkel and russian president vladimir putin have a good and trusting relationship might speak for their pragmatism - but it does not tell us anything about whether russian-german relations are generally good and based on trust .
merkel and putin worked their way through their agenda in a business-like manner , emphasizing , in a familiar fashion , the themes of business , trade and innovation as the most unproblematic areas , as the " heart " of russian-german relations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cornelia rabitz controversial issues , such as iran , kosovo and the russia 's democratic deficits , remained on the agenda but were skated around .
no breakthrough was to be expected in wiesbaden .
nevertheless , it still seems strange that obvious differences were played down - or rather ignored - to such an extent .
the rumors that an assassination attempt was allegedly being planned on putin in tehran and the talk about a possible cancellation of his trip to iran immediately after the russian-german summit only served to contribute to the confusion .
it also demonstrated that this summit was surrounded by an air of ambivalence from a lack of openness .
the term " strategic partnership " that angela merkel so enjoys using has become hackneyed and devoid of meaning .
putin 's repeated assertions that no one has anything to fear from russia do n't ring true .
anyone who follows the public debates and those of the german and russian elites , or who takes a look at opinion polls and the media in russia , gets a completely different picture .
russia 's relations to the west appear to be malfunctioning on many different levels .
some people have even been talking about fresh confrontation and a conflict of values and interests .
mutual recriminations , critique and frosty irritation are the name of the game .
it is clearly understandable that a german chancellor would not want to add fuel to the fire .
and her russian counterpart is a master at placating and whitewashing .
it is election time in russia , even if it is difficult to use the word " election " in this case .
the beaming victor has been clear for a long time .
his name is vladimir putin and he will continue to determine the fate of this big country , although it is not yet clear in exactly what function or in what way .
but the retention of power is definitely on the agenda , and he wo n't shy away from getting involved in shady maneuvers to secure it .
putin 's renewed emphasis in wiesbaden upon his allegiance to the constitution is just a matter of lip service .
putin is set to remain angela merkel 's discussion partner .
that may ultimately be the reason why the chancellor placed so much weight upon finding common ground .
after all , they will have to continue working together .
we are left with the message that the foundations are sound and everything else can be sorted out .
or in other words : let 's approach this in a more relaxed , less excitable manner .
maybe that is not such a bad idea .
it means , at least , that the desire for change in russia remains on the table . cornelia rabitz heads dw-radio 's russian service -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

while experts , representatives of social organizations , parliamentarians and politicians spent two days frankly speaking their minds to one another during the annual " st. petersburg dialogue , " there were conciliatory noises and the invocation of common values and partnership at the highest level .
the fact that german chancellor angela merkel and russian president vladimir putin have a good and trusting relationship might speak for their pragmatism - but it does not tell us anything about whether russian-german relations are generally good and based on trust .
merkel and putin worked their way through their agenda in a business-like manner , emphasizing , in a familiar fashion , the themes of business , trade and innovation as the most unproblematic areas , as the " heart " of russian-german relations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cornelia rabitz controversial issues , such as iran , kosovo and the russia 's democratic deficits , remained on the agenda but were skated around .
no breakthrough was to be expected in wiesbaden .
nevertheless , it still seems strange that obvious differences were played down - or rather ignored - to such an extent .
the rumors that an assassination attempt was allegedly being planned on putin in tehran and the talk about a possible cancellation of his trip to iran immediately after the russian-german summit only served to contribute to the confusion .
it also demonstrated that this summit was surrounded by an air of ambivalence from a lack of openness .
the term " strategic partnership " that angela merkel so enjoys using has become hackneyed and devoid of meaning .
putin 's repeated assertions that no one has anything to fear from russia do n't ring true .
anyone who follows the public debates and those of the german and russian elites , or who takes a look at opinion polls and the media in russia , gets a completely different picture .
russia 's relations to the west appear to be malfunctioning on many different levels .
some people have even been talking about fresh confrontation and a conflict of values and interests .
mutual recriminations , critique and frosty irritation are the name of the game .
it is clearly understandable that a german chancellor would not want to add fuel to the fire .
and her russian counterpart is a master at placating and whitewashing .
it is election time in russia , even if it is difficult to use the word " election " in this case .
the beaming victor has been clear for a long time .
his name is vladimir putin and he will continue to determine the fate of this big country , although it is not yet clear in exactly what function or in what way .
but the retention of power is definitely on the agenda , and he wo n't shy away from getting involved in shady maneuvers to secure it .
putin 's renewed emphasis in wiesbaden upon his allegiance to the constitution is just a matter of lip service .
putin is set to remain angela merkel 's discussion partner .
that may ultimately be the reason why the chancellor placed so much weight upon finding common ground .
after all , they will have to continue working together .
we are left with the message that the foundations are sound and everything else can be sorted out .
or in other words : let 's approach this in a more relaxed , less excitable manner .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de religion -pipe- 16.10.2007 german consultancy combines profits with christian values großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kiwi consultancy advocates adding faith to the pursuit of profits a german catholic diocese has decided to apply its expertise in morality to the region 's powerful business landscape by creating a management-consulting brand based on church ethics . brutal layoffs , corruption scandals , executive pay hikes , hedge-fund hijinks - reading the business pages can be like following a soap opera .
but it is exactly this overlap between workplace capitalism and modern values that make kiwi , a management-consulting agency based on the tenets of the catholic church , so important , its founder said .
so can faith , hope and charity really shed light on pension funds and profit sharing ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drumm : sharing the faith with business leaders " at the current time , our lives are very strongly influenced by our economic surroundings , " said joachim drumm , a theologian who heads up the department of church and society within the catholic diocese of rottenburg-stuttgart , in southern germany .
so it was a short step from peddling ethics within church walls to spreading the word in the business world , drumm said .
" the leader of a bank that was undergoing tough consolidation changes came to me and said they were seeking a theologian who could advise them on making the right decisions , " he said .
a series of similar requests got drumm thinking that perhaps there was a market opportunity in the waiting .
along with a handful of other local church leaders , he created kiwi , which is short for kirche und wirtschaft , or " church and economy . "
' nobody wants to do business with thugs " kiwi offers three product lines : training and workshops , management consulting , and networking forums , drumm explained .
the advice is based on decision making in accordance with the seven heavenly virtues : justice , prudence , temperance , fortitude , faith , hope , and charity .
profitability and christian virtue are not strange bedfellows if businesses practice the kind of market economy with social considerations and long-term sustainability that kiwi espouses , drumm said .
" business without values would be unthinkable , " he added .
" nobody wants to do business with thugs . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turning heavenly virtues into sayings that would make bill gates proud indeed , kiwi has taken the heavenly virtues and cloaked them in management-speak more at home in a fortune 500 business statement than the local parish council meeting .
" a person with hope knows what he wants , is open to new things , and has a vision for the future , " drumm said , explaining how kiwi often expresses the virtue of hope .
similarly , leaders exhibiting the virtue of charity " are committing themselves to a corporate culture of solidarity rather than egotism . "
an unjust economy is not a lasting economy , and without temperance - or moderation - an economic model is doomed to fail eventually , drumm said .
" if companies go for double-digit profits and at the same time lay off thousands of people , that is the wrong way to go in the long term , " he said .
aiming at small- and midsize business drumm said he expects kiwi 's clients to come out of germany 's mittelstand - the many midsize businesses that make up the vast bulk of the german economy - and from small , family-run concerns , because " in general these companies have a stronger identification with their personnel . "
thus they have a greater interest in reaching long-term solutions to problems rather than just going for immediate financial gain , he said .
klaus reiners , spokesman for the german association of management consultants , said ethical behavior should be a consideration for all management advisers , not just those affiliated with the catholic church .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siemens is the latest german firm to be wrapped up in a slush fund scandal a glance at the business headlines tells you that ethics are always a topic business leaders and consultants need to be aware of , reiners said , naming siemens as merely the latest conglomerate to be tied up in corruption scandals .
" global firms have certain responsibilities toward their workers and consumers , " he said .
" a firm just ca n't say , ' well everyone is corrupt , so we can be corrupt as well . '
you have to hold to a certain line . "
if church teachings can be used to promote responsible behavior , reiners said , then he is all for it .
" church is part of life , and work is another part of life ; there is no reason to keep them apart , " he said .
according to drumm , two-thirds of the german population is a member of one of the two main christian churches .
spiritual hunger and the limits of consumerism " christians are a big part of the german economy , " drumm said , and noted that the catholic church itself - with its schools , hospitals , daycare centers and old-age homes - is one of the country 's biggest employers overall .
business leaders are increasingly interested in combining leadership and spirituality , drumm said , adding that society as a whole is beginning to realize the limitations of pure consumerism when it comes to increasing their quality of life .
" so many people are looking for spiritual depth in their lives , " he said .
" everything in our world is becoming faster and aimed at productivity - but we are losing quality of life at the same time .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de religion -pipe- 16.10.2007 german consultancy combines profits with christian values großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kiwi consultancy advocates adding faith to the pursuit of profits a german catholic diocese has decided to apply its expertise in morality to the region 's powerful business landscape by creating a management-consulting brand based on church ethics . brutal layoffs , corruption scandals , executive pay hikes , hedge-fund hijinks - reading the business pages can be like following a soap opera .
but it is exactly this overlap between workplace capitalism and modern values that make kiwi , a management-consulting agency based on the tenets of the catholic church , so important , its founder said .
so can faith , hope and charity really shed light on pension funds and profit sharing ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drumm : sharing the faith with business leaders " at the current time , our lives are very strongly influenced by our economic surroundings , " said joachim drumm , a theologian who heads up the department of church and society within the catholic diocese of rottenburg-stuttgart , in southern germany .
so it was a short step from peddling ethics within church walls to spreading the word in the business world , drumm said .
" the leader of a bank that was undergoing tough consolidation changes came to me and said they were seeking a theologian who could advise them on making the right decisions , " he said .
a series of similar requests got drumm thinking that perhaps there was a market opportunity in the waiting .
along with a handful of other local church leaders , he created kiwi , which is short for kirche und wirtschaft , or " church and economy . "
' nobody wants to do business with thugs " kiwi offers three product lines : training and workshops , management consulting , and networking forums , drumm explained .
the advice is based on decision making in accordance with the seven heavenly virtues : justice , prudence , temperance , fortitude , faith , hope , and charity .
profitability and christian virtue are not strange bedfellows if businesses practice the kind of market economy with social considerations and long-term sustainability that kiwi espouses , drumm said .
" business without values would be unthinkable , " he added .
" nobody wants to do business with thugs . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turning heavenly virtues into sayings that would make bill gates proud indeed , kiwi has taken the heavenly virtues and cloaked them in management-speak more at home in a fortune 500 business statement than the local parish council meeting .
" a person with hope knows what he wants , is open to new things , and has a vision for the future , " drumm said , explaining how kiwi often expresses the virtue of hope .
similarly , leaders exhibiting the virtue of charity " are committing themselves to a corporate culture of solidarity rather than egotism . "
an unjust economy is not a lasting economy , and without temperance - or moderation - an economic model is doomed to fail eventually , drumm said .
" if companies go for double-digit profits and at the same time lay off thousands of people , that is the wrong way to go in the long term , " he said .
aiming at small- and midsize business drumm said he expects kiwi 's clients to come out of germany 's mittelstand - the many midsize businesses that make up the vast bulk of the german economy - and from small , family-run concerns , because " in general these companies have a stronger identification with their personnel . "
thus they have a greater interest in reaching long-term solutions to problems rather than just going for immediate financial gain , he said .
klaus reiners , spokesman for the german association of management consultants , said ethical behavior should be a consideration for all management advisers , not just those affiliated with the catholic church .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siemens is the latest german firm to be wrapped up in a slush fund scandal a glance at the business headlines tells you that ethics are always a topic business leaders and consultants need to be aware of , reiners said , naming siemens as merely the latest conglomerate to be tied up in corruption scandals .
" global firms have certain responsibilities toward their workers and consumers , " he said .
" a firm just ca n't say , ' well everyone is corrupt , so we can be corrupt as well . '
you have to hold to a certain line . "
if church teachings can be used to promote responsible behavior , reiners said , then he is all for it .
" church is part of life , and work is another part of life ; there is no reason to keep them apart , " he said .
according to drumm , two-thirds of the german population is a member of one of the two main christian churches .
spiritual hunger and the limits of consumerism " christians are a big part of the german economy , " drumm said , and noted that the catholic church itself - with its schools , hospitals , daycare centers and old-age homes - is one of the country 's biggest employers overall .
business leaders are increasingly interested in combining leadership and spirituality , drumm said , adding that society as a whole is beginning to realize the limitations of pure consumerism when it comes to increasing their quality of life .
" so many people are looking for spiritual depth in their lives , " he said .
" everything in our world is becoming faster and aimed at productivity - but we are losing quality of life at the same time .

but it is exactly this overlap between workplace capitalism and modern values that make kiwi , a management-consulting agency based on the tenets of the catholic church , so important , its founder said .
so can faith , hope and charity really shed light on pension funds and profit sharing ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drumm : sharing the faith with business leaders " at the current time , our lives are very strongly influenced by our economic surroundings , " said joachim drumm , a theologian who heads up the department of church and society within the catholic diocese of rottenburg-stuttgart , in southern germany .
so it was a short step from peddling ethics within church walls to spreading the word in the business world , drumm said .
" the leader of a bank that was undergoing tough consolidation changes came to me and said they were seeking a theologian who could advise them on making the right decisions , " he said .
a series of similar requests got drumm thinking that perhaps there was a market opportunity in the waiting .
along with a handful of other local church leaders , he created kiwi , which is short for kirche und wirtschaft , or " church and economy . "
' nobody wants to do business with thugs " kiwi offers three product lines : training and workshops , management consulting , and networking forums , drumm explained .
the advice is based on decision making in accordance with the seven heavenly virtues : justice , prudence , temperance , fortitude , faith , hope , and charity .
profitability and christian virtue are not strange bedfellows if businesses practice the kind of market economy with social considerations and long-term sustainability that kiwi espouses , drumm said .
" business without values would be unthinkable , " he added .
" nobody wants to do business with thugs . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turning heavenly virtues into sayings that would make bill gates proud indeed , kiwi has taken the heavenly virtues and cloaked them in management-speak more at home in a fortune 500 business statement than the local parish council meeting .
" a person with hope knows what he wants , is open to new things , and has a vision for the future , " drumm said , explaining how kiwi often expresses the virtue of hope .
similarly , leaders exhibiting the virtue of charity " are committing themselves to a corporate culture of solidarity rather than egotism . "
an unjust economy is not a lasting economy , and without temperance - or moderation - an economic model is doomed to fail eventually , drumm said .
" if companies go for double-digit profits and at the same time lay off thousands of people , that is the wrong way to go in the long term , " he said .

while experts , representatives of social organizations , parliamentarians and politicians spent two days frankly speaking their minds to one another during the annual " st. petersburg dialogue , " there were conciliatory noises and the invocation of common values and partnership at the highest level .
the fact that german chancellor angela merkel and russian president vladimir putin have a good and trusting relationship might speak for their pragmatism - but it does not tell us anything about whether russian-german relations are generally good and based on trust .
merkel and putin worked their way through their agenda in a business-like manner , emphasizing , in a familiar fashion , the themes of business , trade and innovation as the most unproblematic areas , as the " heart " of russian-german relations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cornelia rabitz controversial issues , such as iran , kosovo and the russia 's democratic deficits , remained on the agenda but were skated around .
no breakthrough was to be expected in wiesbaden .
nevertheless , it still seems strange that obvious differences were played down - or rather ignored - to such an extent .
the rumors that an assassination attempt was allegedly being planned on putin in tehran and the talk about a possible cancellation of his trip to iran immediately after the russian-german summit only served to contribute to the confusion .
it also demonstrated that this summit was surrounded by an air of ambivalence from a lack of openness .
the term " strategic partnership " that angela merkel so enjoys using has become hackneyed and devoid of meaning .
putin 's repeated assertions that no one has anything to fear from russia do n't ring true .
anyone who follows the public debates and those of the german and russian elites , or who takes a look at opinion polls and the media in russia , gets a completely different picture .
russia 's relations to the west appear to be malfunctioning on many different levels .
some people have even been talking about fresh confrontation and a conflict of values and interests .
mutual recriminations , critique and frosty irritation are the name of the game .
it is clearly understandable that a german chancellor would not want to add fuel to the fire .
and her russian counterpart is a master at placating and whitewashing .
it is election time in russia , even if it is difficult to use the word " election " in this case .
the beaming victor has been clear for a long time .
his name is vladimir putin and he will continue to determine the fate of this big country , although it is not yet clear in exactly what function or in what way .
but the retention of power is definitely on the agenda , and he wo n't shy away from getting involved in shady maneuvers to secure it .
putin 's renewed emphasis in wiesbaden upon his allegiance to the constitution is just a matter of lip service .

while experts , representatives of social organizations , parliamentarians and politicians spent two days frankly speaking their minds to one another during the annual " st. petersburg dialogue , " there were conciliatory noises and the invocation of common values and partnership at the highest level .
the fact that german chancellor angela merkel and russian president vladimir putin have a good and trusting relationship might speak for their pragmatism - but it does not tell us anything about whether russian-german relations are generally good and based on trust .
merkel and putin worked their way through their agenda in a business-like manner , emphasizing , in a familiar fashion , the themes of business , trade and innovation as the most unproblematic areas , as the " heart " of russian-german relations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cornelia rabitz controversial issues , such as iran , kosovo and the russia 's democratic deficits , remained on the agenda but were skated around .
no breakthrough was to be expected in wiesbaden .
nevertheless , it still seems strange that obvious differences were played down - or rather ignored - to such an extent .
the rumors that an assassination attempt was allegedly being planned on putin in tehran and the talk about a possible cancellation of his trip to iran immediately after the russian-german summit only served to contribute to the confusion .
it also demonstrated that this summit was surrounded by an air of ambivalence from a lack of openness .
the term " strategic partnership " that angela merkel so enjoys using has become hackneyed and devoid of meaning .
putin 's repeated assertions that no one has anything to fear from russia do n't ring true .
anyone who follows the public debates and those of the german and russian elites , or who takes a look at opinion polls and the media in russia , gets a completely different picture .
russia 's relations to the west appear to be malfunctioning on many different levels .
some people have even been talking about fresh confrontation and a conflict of values and interests .
mutual recriminations , critique and frosty irritation are the name of the game .
it is clearly understandable that a german chancellor would not want to add fuel to the fire .
and her russian counterpart is a master at placating and whitewashing .
it is election time in russia , even if it is difficult to use the word " election " in this case .
the beaming victor has been clear for a long time .
his name is vladimir putin and he will continue to determine the fate of this big country , although it is not yet clear in exactly what function or in what way .
but the retention of power is definitely on the agenda , and he wo n't shy away from getting involved in shady maneuvers to secure it .
putin 's renewed emphasis in wiesbaden upon his allegiance to the constitution is just a matter of lip service .
putin is set to remain angela merkel 's discussion partner .
that may ultimately be the reason why the chancellor placed so much weight upon finding common ground .
after all , they will have to continue working together .
we are left with the message that the foundations are sound and everything else can be sorted out .
or in other words : let 's approach this in a more relaxed , less excitable manner .
maybe that is not such a bad idea .
it means , at least , that the desire for change in russia remains on the table . cornelia rabitz heads dw-radio 's russian service -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de religion -pipe- 16.10.2007 german consultancy combines profits with christian values großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kiwi consultancy advocates adding faith to the pursuit of profits a german catholic diocese has decided to apply its expertise in morality to the region 's powerful business landscape by creating a management-consulting brand based on church ethics . brutal layoffs , corruption scandals , executive pay hikes , hedge-fund hijinks - reading the business pages can be like following a soap opera .
but it is exactly this overlap between workplace capitalism and modern values that make kiwi , a management-consulting agency based on the tenets of the catholic church , so important , its founder said .
so can faith , hope and charity really shed light on pension funds and profit sharing ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drumm : sharing the faith with business leaders " at the current time , our lives are very strongly influenced by our economic surroundings , " said joachim drumm , a theologian who heads up the department of church and society within the catholic diocese of rottenburg-stuttgart , in southern germany .
so it was a short step from peddling ethics within church walls to spreading the word in the business world , drumm said .
" the leader of a bank that was undergoing tough consolidation changes came to me and said they were seeking a theologian who could advise them on making the right decisions , " he said .
a series of similar requests got drumm thinking that perhaps there was a market opportunity in the waiting .
along with a handful of other local church leaders , he created kiwi , which is short for kirche und wirtschaft , or " church and economy . "
' nobody wants to do business with thugs " kiwi offers three product lines : training and workshops , management consulting , and networking forums , drumm explained .
the advice is based on decision making in accordance with the seven heavenly virtues : justice , prudence , temperance , fortitude , faith , hope , and charity .
profitability and christian virtue are not strange bedfellows if businesses practice the kind of market economy with social considerations and long-term sustainability that kiwi espouses , drumm said .
" business without values would be unthinkable , " he added .
" nobody wants to do business with thugs . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turning heavenly virtues into sayings that would make bill gates proud indeed , kiwi has taken the heavenly virtues and cloaked them in management-speak more at home in a fortune 500 business statement than the local parish council meeting .
" a person with hope knows what he wants , is open to new things , and has a vision for the future , " drumm said , explaining how kiwi often expresses the virtue of hope .
similarly , leaders exhibiting the virtue of charity " are committing themselves to a corporate culture of solidarity rather than egotism . "
an unjust economy is not a lasting economy , and without temperance - or moderation - an economic model is doomed to fail eventually , drumm said .
" if companies go for double-digit profits and at the same time lay off thousands of people , that is the wrong way to go in the long term , " he said .
aiming at small- and midsize business drumm said he expects kiwi 's clients to come out of germany 's mittelstand - the many midsize businesses that make up the vast bulk of the german economy - and from small , family-run concerns , because " in general these companies have a stronger identification with their personnel . "
thus they have a greater interest in reaching long-term solutions to problems rather than just going for immediate financial gain , he said .
klaus reiners , spokesman for the german association of management consultants , said ethical behavior should be a consideration for all management advisers , not just those affiliated with the catholic church .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siemens is the latest german firm to be wrapped up in a slush fund scandal a glance at the business headlines tells you that ethics are always a topic business leaders and consultants need to be aware of , reiners said , naming siemens as merely the latest conglomerate to be tied up in corruption scandals .
" global firms have certain responsibilities toward their workers and consumers , " he said .
" a firm just ca n't say , ' well everyone is corrupt , so we can be corrupt as well . '
you have to hold to a certain line . "
if church teachings can be used to promote responsible behavior , reiners said , then he is all for it .
" church is part of life , and work is another part of life ; there is no reason to keep them apart , " he said .
according to drumm , two-thirds of the german population is a member of one of the two main christian churches .
spiritual hunger and the limits of consumerism " christians are a big part of the german economy , " drumm said , and noted that the catholic church itself - with its schools , hospitals , daycare centers and old-age homes - is one of the country 's biggest employers overall .
business leaders are increasingly interested in combining leadership and spirituality , drumm said , adding that society as a whole is beginning to realize the limitations of pure consumerism when it comes to increasing their quality of life .
" so many people are looking for spiritual depth in their lives , " he said .
" everything in our world is becoming faster and aimed at productivity - but we are losing quality of life at the same time .

16 , presented a unique study on the social environments of migrants in germany that they say will help improve the situation . the study is the first of its kind worldwide because it focuses on the current social environments of migrants rather than their backgrounds , said deputy family minister gerd hoofe , who presented the report on tuesday .
while factors such as ethnicity , religion and migration history do play a role for migrants , their current social environments are much more important in term of people 's identity , hoofe said .
the report is based on 104 extensive interviews and has distinguished eight migrant social environments , ranging from " religiously rooted " and based on conservative , strict moral values to " intellectual cosmopolitan " environments with an open-minded , tolerant attitude .
while hoofe said that detailed results of the study will not be ready until next summer , he added that the report " does away with negative cliches about migrants that exist in this country . "
" migrants are definitely ready to integrate , but they also do not want to forget their roots , " he said , adding that the level of education and urbanity played a role as well .
bodo flaig , a psychologist in charge of the study , added that the new research definitely showed that migrants ' lives were not dominated by religion .
merkel : migrant kids neglected in schools bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has received poor marks for the opportunities on offer children of non-german origin german chancellor angela merkel meanwhile said tuesday that germany had to take steps to make educational success less dependent on social backgrounds .

16 , presented a unique study on the social environments of migrants in germany that they say will help improve the situation . the study is the first of its kind worldwide because it focuses on the current social environments of migrants rather than their backgrounds , said deputy family minister gerd hoofe , who presented the report on tuesday .
while factors such as ethnicity , religion and migration history do play a role for migrants , their current social environments are much more important in term of people 's identity , hoofe said .
the report is based on 104 extensive interviews and has distinguished eight migrant social environments , ranging from " religiously rooted " and based on conservative , strict moral values to " intellectual cosmopolitan " environments with an open-minded , tolerant attitude .
while hoofe said that detailed results of the study will not be ready until next summer , he added that the report " does away with negative cliches about migrants that exist in this country . "
" migrants are definitely ready to integrate , but they also do not want to forget their roots , " he said , adding that the level of education and urbanity played a role as well .
bodo flaig , a psychologist in charge of the study , added that the new research definitely showed that migrants ' lives were not dominated by religion .

but it is exactly this overlap between workplace capitalism and modern values that make kiwi , a management-consulting agency based on the tenets of the catholic church , so important , its founder said .
so can faith , hope and charity really shed light on pension funds and profit sharing ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drumm : sharing the faith with business leaders " at the current time , our lives are very strongly influenced by our economic surroundings , " said joachim drumm , a theologian who heads up the department of church and society within the catholic diocese of rottenburg-stuttgart , in southern germany .
so it was a short step from peddling ethics within church walls to spreading the word in the business world , drumm said .
" the leader of a bank that was undergoing tough consolidation changes came to me and said they were seeking a theologian who could advise them on making the right decisions , " he said .
a series of similar requests got drumm thinking that perhaps there was a market opportunity in the waiting .
along with a handful of other local church leaders , he created kiwi , which is short for kirche und wirtschaft , or " church and economy . "
' nobody wants to do business with thugs " kiwi offers three product lines : training and workshops , management consulting , and networking forums , drumm explained .
the advice is based on decision making in accordance with the seven heavenly virtues : justice , prudence , temperance , fortitude , faith , hope , and charity .
profitability and christian virtue are not strange bedfellows if businesses practice the kind of market economy with social considerations and long-term sustainability that kiwi espouses , drumm said .
" business without values would be unthinkable , " he added .
" nobody wants to do business with thugs . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turning heavenly virtues into sayings that would make bill gates proud indeed , kiwi has taken the heavenly virtues and cloaked them in management-speak more at home in a fortune 500 business statement than the local parish council meeting .
" a person with hope knows what he wants , is open to new things , and has a vision for the future , " drumm said , explaining how kiwi often expresses the virtue of hope .
similarly , leaders exhibiting the virtue of charity " are committing themselves to a corporate culture of solidarity rather than egotism . "
an unjust economy is not a lasting economy , and without temperance - or moderation - an economic model is doomed to fail eventually , drumm said .
" if companies go for double-digit profits and at the same time lay off thousands of people , that is the wrong way to go in the long term , " he said .
aiming at small- and midsize business drumm said he expects kiwi 's clients to come out of germany 's mittelstand - the many midsize businesses that make up the vast bulk of the german economy - and from small , family-run concerns , because " in general these companies have a stronger identification with their personnel . "
thus they have a greater interest in reaching long-term solutions to problems rather than just going for immediate financial gain , he said .
klaus reiners , spokesman for the german association of management consultants , said ethical behavior should be a consideration for all management advisers , not just those affiliated with the catholic church .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siemens is the latest german firm to be wrapped up in a slush fund scandal a glance at the business headlines tells you that ethics are always a topic business leaders and consultants need to be aware of , reiners said , naming siemens as merely the latest conglomerate to be tied up in corruption scandals .
" global firms have certain responsibilities toward their workers and consumers , " he said .
" a firm just ca n't say , ' well everyone is corrupt , so we can be corrupt as well . '
you have to hold to a certain line . "
if church teachings can be used to promote responsible behavior , reiners said , then he is all for it .
" church is part of life , and work is another part of life ; there is no reason to keep them apart , " he said .
according to drumm , two-thirds of the german population is a member of one of the two main christian churches .
spiritual hunger and the limits of consumerism " christians are a big part of the german economy , " drumm said , and noted that the catholic church itself - with its schools , hospitals , daycare centers and old-age homes - is one of the country 's biggest employers overall .
business leaders are increasingly interested in combining leadership and spirituality , drumm said , adding that society as a whole is beginning to realize the limitations of pure consumerism when it comes to increasing their quality of life .
" so many people are looking for spiritual depth in their lives , " he said .
" everything in our world is becoming faster and aimed at productivity - but we are losing quality of life at the same time .

while experts , representatives of social organizations , parliamentarians and politicians spent two days frankly speaking their minds to one another during the annual " st. petersburg dialogue , " there were conciliatory noises and the invocation of common values and partnership at the highest level .
the fact that german chancellor angela merkel and russian president vladimir putin have a good and trusting relationship might speak for their pragmatism - but it does not tell us anything about whether russian-german relations are generally good and based on trust .
merkel and putin worked their way through their agenda in a business-like manner , emphasizing , in a familiar fashion , the themes of business , trade and innovation as the most unproblematic areas , as the " heart " of russian-german relations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cornelia rabitz controversial issues , such as iran , kosovo and the russia 's democratic deficits , remained on the agenda but were skated around .
no breakthrough was to be expected in wiesbaden .
nevertheless , it still seems strange that obvious differences were played down - or rather ignored - to such an extent .
the rumors that an assassination attempt was allegedly being planned on putin in tehran and the talk about a possible cancellation of his trip to iran immediately after the russian-german summit only served to contribute to the confusion .
it also demonstrated that this summit was surrounded by an air of ambivalence from a lack of openness .
the term " strategic partnership " that angela merkel so enjoys using has become hackneyed and devoid of meaning .
putin 's repeated assertions that no one has anything to fear from russia do n't ring true .
anyone who follows the public debates and those of the german and russian elites , or who takes a look at opinion polls and the media in russia , gets a completely different picture .
russia 's relations to the west appear to be malfunctioning on many different levels .
some people have even been talking about fresh confrontation and a conflict of values and interests .
mutual recriminations , critique and frosty irritation are the name of the game .
it is clearly understandable that a german chancellor would not want to add fuel to the fire .
and her russian counterpart is a master at placating and whitewashing .
it is election time in russia , even if it is difficult to use the word " election " in this case .
the beaming victor has been clear for a long time .
his name is vladimir putin and he will continue to determine the fate of this big country , although it is not yet clear in exactly what function or in what way .
but the retention of power is definitely on the agenda , and he wo n't shy away from getting involved in shady maneuvers to secure it .
putin 's renewed emphasis in wiesbaden upon his allegiance to the constitution is just a matter of lip service .
putin is set to remain angela merkel 's discussion partner .
that may ultimately be the reason why the chancellor placed so much weight upon finding common ground .
after all , they will have to continue working together .
we are left with the message that the foundations are sound and everything else can be sorted out .
or in other words : let 's approach this in a more relaxed , less excitable manner .

the watchdog organization listed germany as 20th in press freedom in its annual index . in reporters without borders ' -lrb- rsf -rrb- annual press freedom index , the international media watchdog gave 14 european countries the highest ranks , with iceland , norway and estonia leading the way . germany improved its ranking from 23rd place in 2006 to 20th place in this year 's index .
still , the paris-based organization cited the influence advertising sources have on german media as negative .
it also criticized changes in the german legal system , which make it harder for journalists and media to protect and ensure the anonymity of sources . some european journalists face threat of violence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany improved its standing only slightly the organization also pointed to german authorities ' investigations of journalists accused of violating state secrecy laws , and criticized the danger posed to german journalists researching topics like neo-nazism . all of the european union 's 27 member countries made it in the top 50 , except for bulgaria and poland , which placed 51st and 56th , respectively . in italy , which placed 35th , rsf said journalists continue to work under the threat of violence from mafia groups . the organization also said that the internet has become a major target of press freedom violations , with bloggers being arrested and news sites on the web shut down . " more and more governments have realized that the internet can play a key role in the fight for democracy , and they are establishing new methods of censoring it , " rsf said in a statement . " myanmar particularly worrying " rsf said at least 64 people worldwide were being held under arrest for what they posted on the internet , with the majority -lrb- 50 -rrb- of imprisoned cyber-dissidents and online journalists in china . myanmar , formerly known as burma , placed 164th on the survey of 169 countries .
the media watchdog said the country , which has been making headlines for weeks , was particularly worrying . " the military junta 's crackdown on demonstrations bodes ill for the future of basic freedoms in this country , " the media watchdog said . one japanese journalist is known to have been killed in myanmar 's crackdown on protestors during demonstrations . two g8 nations in top 20 bildunterschrift : iran 's leading reformist daily newspaper was shut down in august at the bottom of the annual index were iran -lrb- 166th -rrb- , turkmenistan -lrb- 167th -rrb- , north korea -lrb- 168th -rrb- and , finally , eritrea -lrb- 169th -rrb- . the united states placed 48th on the list , and only two of the group of eight most industrialized countries placed within the top 20 -lrb- canada , 18th , and germany -rrb- .

while experts , representatives of social organizations , parliamentarians and politicians spent two days frankly speaking their minds to one another during the annual " st. petersburg dialogue , " there were conciliatory noises and the invocation of common values and partnership at the highest level .
the fact that german chancellor angela merkel and russian president vladimir putin have a good and trusting relationship might speak for their pragmatism - but it does not tell us anything about whether russian-german relations are generally good and based on trust .
merkel and putin worked their way through their agenda in a business-like manner , emphasizing , in a familiar fashion , the themes of business , trade and innovation as the most unproblematic areas , as the " heart " of russian-german relations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cornelia rabitz controversial issues , such as iran , kosovo and the russia 's democratic deficits , remained on the agenda but were skated around .
no breakthrough was to be expected in wiesbaden .
nevertheless , it still seems strange that obvious differences were played down - or rather ignored - to such an extent .
the rumors that an assassination attempt was allegedly being planned on putin in tehran and the talk about a possible cancellation of his trip to iran immediately after the russian-german summit only served to contribute to the confusion .
it also demonstrated that this summit was surrounded by an air of ambivalence from a lack of openness .
the term " strategic partnership " that angela merkel so enjoys using has become hackneyed and devoid of meaning .
putin 's repeated assertions that no one has anything to fear from russia do n't ring true .
anyone who follows the public debates and those of the german and russian elites , or who takes a look at opinion polls and the media in russia , gets a completely different picture .
russia 's relations to the west appear to be malfunctioning on many different levels .
some people have even been talking about fresh confrontation and a conflict of values and interests .
mutual recriminations , critique and frosty irritation are the name of the game .
it is clearly understandable that a german chancellor would not want to add fuel to the fire .
and her russian counterpart is a master at placating and whitewashing .
it is election time in russia , even if it is difficult to use the word " election " in this case .
the beaming victor has been clear for a long time .
his name is vladimir putin and he will continue to determine the fate of this big country , although it is not yet clear in exactly what function or in what way .

16 , 1927 , in what was then the german city of danzig - now polish gdansk - made a name for himself as a writer in 1959 with his critically acclaimed first novel , die blechtrommel -lrb- " the tin drum " -rrb- .
like the two other works in the so-called " danzig trilogy " - katz und maus -lrb- " cat and mouse , " 1961 -rrb- and hundejahre -lrb- " dog years , " 1963 -rrb- - " the tin drum " draws on the author 's early life in the german-polish port . when he published " the tin drum , " " it was as if german literature had been granted a new beginning after decades of linguistic and moral destruction , " the nobel prize academy wrote when it named him a nobel laureate in literature in 1999 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the tin drum " was made into a successful film grass was the son of a grocer .
it was a desire to leave his lower-middle class catholic upbringing which inspired him to volunteer to join the german military .
grass was then conscripted , at the age of 17 , into the waffen ss combat troops , a fact he did n't disclose until 2006 . politically active the admission , revealed after more than half a century , caused a huge controversy , shattering both the widespread belief that grass had been too young during the war to have been seriously involved in nazi crimes and his image as a moral authority .
there were calls for him to be stripped of his nobel prize and to be deprived of the honorary citizenship of gdansk . over the decades , grass , whose work often contains a strong left-wing dimension , has used his prominence as a platform for political commentary . as the events which led to german reunification in 1990 began to unfold , grass was very vocal in his opposition and referred to it as an " annexation . " in 1995 , he wrote about german reunification in ein weites feld -lrb- " too far afield , " 1995 -rrb- . breaking taboos bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " crabwalk " was published in 2004 history and politics are closely intertwined in all of grass ' works .
in 2002 he published im krebsgang -lrb- " crabwalk " -rrb- , which broke a long-held taboo in german literature by focusing on the suffering of german expellees after world war ii . by highlighting a single event in 1945 , the sinking of the refugee ship " wilhelm gustloff " in the baltic sea , which killed some 9,000 people , grass traced the history of a few key characters through the generations up to the present-day portrayal of the tragedy on neo-nazi web sites .
like his earlier works , it underlines the author 's preoccupation with the way past and present are connected and perceived . grass , who refused to accept a german government honor in 1979 , voiced appreciation that german president horst köhler would be at the head of those congratulating him at an oct .
27 ceremony in the northern city of lübeck . " since i have suffered from a great deal of mockery and nastiness in recent years , it does me good to see my six decades of work recognized , not only in germany but abroad , " he told the german dpa news agency . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

16 , presented a unique study on the social environments of migrants in germany that they say will help improve the situation . the study is the first of its kind worldwide because it focuses on the current social environments of migrants rather than their backgrounds , said deputy family minister gerd hoofe , who presented the report on tuesday .
while factors such as ethnicity , religion and migration history do play a role for migrants , their current social environments are much more important in term of people 's identity , hoofe said .
the report is based on 104 extensive interviews and has distinguished eight migrant social environments , ranging from " religiously rooted " and based on conservative , strict moral values to " intellectual cosmopolitan " environments with an open-minded , tolerant attitude .
while hoofe said that detailed results of the study will not be ready until next summer , he added that the report " does away with negative cliches about migrants that exist in this country . "
" migrants are definitely ready to integrate , but they also do not want to forget their roots , " he said , adding that the level of education and urbanity played a role as well .
bodo flaig , a psychologist in charge of the study , added that the new research definitely showed that migrants ' lives were not dominated by religion .

" we can not neglect a single talent , " the chancellor said during a conference on integration and education in berlin , adding that children of migrant families were particularly disadvantaged in germany .
according to the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- , the german school system ranks last among those of 17 industrialized nations when it comes to supporting migrant children .
germany 's mediocre integration policies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an annual integration summit is designed to promote dialogue on a european level , germany ranks in mid-field when it comes to integrating foreign workers , according to a study released on monday .
it came in at no. 14 out of 28 countries studied for the migration integration policy index -lrb- mpiex -rrb- .
sweden was found to be the best at helping immigrants feel welcome , while latvia scored the worst .
taken as a whole , the 25 eu countries included in the study -lrb- all of the 27 eu member states except bulgaria and romania -rrb- scored an overall average of 53 percent .
generally , the study found that eu countries are good at helping immigrants become long-term residents , but do not make it easy for them to become full-fledged citizens .
the study 's authors said they did not want to engage in a " name and shame " exercise and instead called on national governments to use their findings as an instrument to guide their future integration policies .

16 , presented a unique study on the social environments of migrants in germany that they say will help improve the situation . the study is the first of its kind worldwide because it focuses on the current social environments of migrants rather than their backgrounds , said deputy family minister gerd hoofe , who presented the report on tuesday .
while factors such as ethnicity , religion and migration history do play a role for migrants , their current social environments are much more important in term of people 's identity , hoofe said .
the report is based on 104 extensive interviews and has distinguished eight migrant social environments , ranging from " religiously rooted " and based on conservative , strict moral values to " intellectual cosmopolitan " environments with an open-minded , tolerant attitude .
while hoofe said that detailed results of the study will not be ready until next summer , he added that the report " does away with negative cliches about migrants that exist in this country . "
" migrants are definitely ready to integrate , but they also do not want to forget their roots , " he said , adding that the level of education and urbanity played a role as well .
bodo flaig , a psychologist in charge of the study , added that the new research definitely showed that migrants ' lives were not dominated by religion .

while factors such as ethnicity , religion and migration history do play a role for migrants , their current social environments are much more important in term of people 's identity , hoofe said .
the report is based on 104 extensive interviews and has distinguished eight migrant social environments , ranging from " religiously rooted " and based on conservative , strict moral values to " intellectual cosmopolitan " environments with an open-minded , tolerant attitude .
while hoofe said that detailed results of the study will not be ready until next summer , he added that the report " does away with negative cliches about migrants that exist in this country . "
" migrants are definitely ready to integrate , but they also do not want to forget their roots , " he said , adding that the level of education and urbanity played a role as well .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de religion -pipe- 16.10.2007 german consultancy combines profits with christian values großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kiwi consultancy advocates adding faith to the pursuit of profits a german catholic diocese has decided to apply its expertise in morality to the region 's powerful business landscape by creating a management-consulting brand based on church ethics . brutal layoffs , corruption scandals , executive pay hikes , hedge-fund hijinks - reading the business pages can be like following a soap opera .
but it is exactly this overlap between workplace capitalism and modern values that make kiwi , a management-consulting agency based on the tenets of the catholic church , so important , its founder said .
so can faith , hope and charity really shed light on pension funds and profit sharing ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drumm : sharing the faith with business leaders " at the current time , our lives are very strongly influenced by our economic surroundings , " said joachim drumm , a theologian who heads up the department of church and society within the catholic diocese of rottenburg-stuttgart , in southern germany .
so it was a short step from peddling ethics within church walls to spreading the word in the business world , drumm said .
" the leader of a bank that was undergoing tough consolidation changes came to me and said they were seeking a theologian who could advise them on making the right decisions , " he said .
a series of similar requests got drumm thinking that perhaps there was a market opportunity in the waiting .
along with a handful of other local church leaders , he created kiwi , which is short for kirche und wirtschaft , or " church and economy . "
' nobody wants to do business with thugs " kiwi offers three product lines : training and workshops , management consulting , and networking forums , drumm explained .
the advice is based on decision making in accordance with the seven heavenly virtues : justice , prudence , temperance , fortitude , faith , hope , and charity .
profitability and christian virtue are not strange bedfellows if businesses practice the kind of market economy with social considerations and long-term sustainability that kiwi espouses , drumm said .
" business without values would be unthinkable , " he added .
" nobody wants to do business with thugs . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turning heavenly virtues into sayings that would make bill gates proud indeed , kiwi has taken the heavenly virtues and cloaked them in management-speak more at home in a fortune 500 business statement than the local parish council meeting .
" a person with hope knows what he wants , is open to new things , and has a vision for the future , " drumm said , explaining how kiwi often expresses the virtue of hope .
similarly , leaders exhibiting the virtue of charity " are committing themselves to a corporate culture of solidarity rather than egotism . "
an unjust economy is not a lasting economy , and without temperance - or moderation - an economic model is doomed to fail eventually , drumm said .
" if companies go for double-digit profits and at the same time lay off thousands of people , that is the wrong way to go in the long term , " he said .
aiming at small- and midsize business drumm said he expects kiwi 's clients to come out of germany 's mittelstand - the many midsize businesses that make up the vast bulk of the german economy - and from small , family-run concerns , because " in general these companies have a stronger identification with their personnel . "
thus they have a greater interest in reaching long-term solutions to problems rather than just going for immediate financial gain , he said .
klaus reiners , spokesman for the german association of management consultants , said ethical behavior should be a consideration for all management advisers , not just those affiliated with the catholic church .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siemens is the latest german firm to be wrapped up in a slush fund scandal a glance at the business headlines tells you that ethics are always a topic business leaders and consultants need to be aware of , reiners said , naming siemens as merely the latest conglomerate to be tied up in corruption scandals .
" global firms have certain responsibilities toward their workers and consumers , " he said .
" a firm just ca n't say , ' well everyone is corrupt , so we can be corrupt as well . '
you have to hold to a certain line . "
if church teachings can be used to promote responsible behavior , reiners said , then he is all for it .
" church is part of life , and work is another part of life ; there is no reason to keep them apart , " he said .
according to drumm , two-thirds of the german population is a member of one of the two main christian churches .
spiritual hunger and the limits of consumerism " christians are a big part of the german economy , " drumm said , and noted that the catholic church itself - with its schools , hospitals , daycare centers and old-age homes - is one of the country 's biggest employers overall .
business leaders are increasingly interested in combining leadership and spirituality , drumm said , adding that society as a whole is beginning to realize the limitations of pure consumerism when it comes to increasing their quality of life .
" so many people are looking for spiritual depth in their lives , " he said .
" everything in our world is becoming faster and aimed at productivity - but we are losing quality of life at the same time .

but it is exactly this overlap between workplace capitalism and modern values that make kiwi , a management-consulting agency based on the tenets of the catholic church , so important , its founder said .
so can faith , hope and charity really shed light on pension funds and profit sharing ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drumm : sharing the faith with business leaders " at the current time , our lives are very strongly influenced by our economic surroundings , " said joachim drumm , a theologian who heads up the department of church and society within the catholic diocese of rottenburg-stuttgart , in southern germany .
so it was a short step from peddling ethics within church walls to spreading the word in the business world , drumm said .
" the leader of a bank that was undergoing tough consolidation changes came to me and said they were seeking a theologian who could advise them on making the right decisions , " he said .
a series of similar requests got drumm thinking that perhaps there was a market opportunity in the waiting .
along with a handful of other local church leaders , he created kiwi , which is short for kirche und wirtschaft , or " church and economy . "
' nobody wants to do business with thugs " kiwi offers three product lines : training and workshops , management consulting , and networking forums , drumm explained .
the advice is based on decision making in accordance with the seven heavenly virtues : justice , prudence , temperance , fortitude , faith , hope , and charity .
profitability and christian virtue are not strange bedfellows if businesses practice the kind of market economy with social considerations and long-term sustainability that kiwi espouses , drumm said .
" business without values would be unthinkable , " he added .
" nobody wants to do business with thugs . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turning heavenly virtues into sayings that would make bill gates proud indeed , kiwi has taken the heavenly virtues and cloaked them in management-speak more at home in a fortune 500 business statement than the local parish council meeting .
" a person with hope knows what he wants , is open to new things , and has a vision for the future , " drumm said , explaining how kiwi often expresses the virtue of hope .
similarly , leaders exhibiting the virtue of charity " are committing themselves to a corporate culture of solidarity rather than egotism . "
an unjust economy is not a lasting economy , and without temperance - or moderation - an economic model is doomed to fail eventually , drumm said .
" if companies go for double-digit profits and at the same time lay off thousands of people , that is the wrong way to go in the long term , " he said .
aiming at small- and midsize business drumm said he expects kiwi 's clients to come out of germany 's mittelstand - the many midsize businesses that make up the vast bulk of the german economy - and from small , family-run concerns , because " in general these companies have a stronger identification with their personnel . "
thus they have a greater interest in reaching long-term solutions to problems rather than just going for immediate financial gain , he said .
klaus reiners , spokesman for the german association of management consultants , said ethical behavior should be a consideration for all management advisers , not just those affiliated with the catholic church .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siemens is the latest german firm to be wrapped up in a slush fund scandal a glance at the business headlines tells you that ethics are always a topic business leaders and consultants need to be aware of , reiners said , naming siemens as merely the latest conglomerate to be tied up in corruption scandals .
" global firms have certain responsibilities toward their workers and consumers , " he said .
" a firm just ca n't say , ' well everyone is corrupt , so we can be corrupt as well . '
you have to hold to a certain line . "
if church teachings can be used to promote responsible behavior , reiners said , then he is all for it .
" church is part of life , and work is another part of life ; there is no reason to keep them apart , " he said .
according to drumm , two-thirds of the german population is a member of one of the two main christian churches .
spiritual hunger and the limits of consumerism " christians are a big part of the german economy , " drumm said , and noted that the catholic church itself - with its schools , hospitals , daycare centers and old-age homes - is one of the country 's biggest employers overall .
business leaders are increasingly interested in combining leadership and spirituality , drumm said , adding that society as a whole is beginning to realize the limitations of pure consumerism when it comes to increasing their quality of life .
" so many people are looking for spiritual depth in their lives , " he said .
" everything in our world is becoming faster and aimed at productivity - but we are losing quality of life at the same time .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 16.10.2007 opinion : berlin and moscow look to the future großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw 's cornelia rabitz argues that german chancellor angela merkel was keen not to rock the boat because russian president vladimir putin could well remain berlin 's discussion partner in the foreseeable future . what exactly was going on at the summit in wiesbaden ?
while experts , representatives of social organizations , parliamentarians and politicians spent two days frankly speaking their minds to one another during the annual " st. petersburg dialogue , " there were conciliatory noises and the invocation of common values and partnership at the highest level .
the fact that german chancellor angela merkel and russian president vladimir putin have a good and trusting relationship might speak for their pragmatism - but it does not tell us anything about whether russian-german relations are generally good and based on trust .
merkel and putin worked their way through their agenda in a business-like manner , emphasizing , in a familiar fashion , the themes of business , trade and innovation as the most unproblematic areas , as the " heart " of russian-german relations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cornelia rabitz controversial issues , such as iran , kosovo and the russia 's democratic deficits , remained on the agenda but were skated around .
no breakthrough was to be expected in wiesbaden .
nevertheless , it still seems strange that obvious differences were played down - or rather ignored - to such an extent .
the rumors that an assassination attempt was allegedly being planned on putin in tehran and the talk about a possible cancellation of his trip to iran immediately after the russian-german summit only served to contribute to the confusion .
it also demonstrated that this summit was surrounded by an air of ambivalence from a lack of openness .
the term " strategic partnership " that angela merkel so enjoys using has become hackneyed and devoid of meaning .
putin 's repeated assertions that no one has anything to fear from russia do n't ring true .
anyone who follows the public debates and those of the german and russian elites , or who takes a look at opinion polls and the media in russia , gets a completely different picture .
russia 's relations to the west appear to be malfunctioning on many different levels .
some people have even been talking about fresh confrontation and a conflict of values and interests .
mutual recriminations , critique and frosty irritation are the name of the game .
it is clearly understandable that a german chancellor would not want to add fuel to the fire .
and her russian counterpart is a master at placating and whitewashing .
it is election time in russia , even if it is difficult to use the word " election " in this case .
the beaming victor has been clear for a long time .
his name is vladimir putin and he will continue to determine the fate of this big country , although it is not yet clear in exactly what function or in what way .
but the retention of power is definitely on the agenda , and he wo n't shy away from getting involved in shady maneuvers to secure it .
putin 's renewed emphasis in wiesbaden upon his allegiance to the constitution is just a matter of lip service .
putin is set to remain angela merkel 's discussion partner .
that may ultimately be the reason why the chancellor placed so much weight upon finding common ground .
after all , they will have to continue working together .
we are left with the message that the foundations are sound and everything else can be sorted out .
or in other words : let 's approach this in a more relaxed , less excitable manner .
maybe that is not such a bad idea .
it means , at least , that the desire for change in russia remains on the table . cornelia rabitz heads dw-radio 's russian service -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

while experts , representatives of social organizations , parliamentarians and politicians spent two days frankly speaking their minds to one another during the annual " st. petersburg dialogue , " there were conciliatory noises and the invocation of common values and partnership at the highest level .
the fact that german chancellor angela merkel and russian president vladimir putin have a good and trusting relationship might speak for their pragmatism - but it does not tell us anything about whether russian-german relations are generally good and based on trust .
merkel and putin worked their way through their agenda in a business-like manner , emphasizing , in a familiar fashion , the themes of business , trade and innovation as the most unproblematic areas , as the " heart " of russian-german relations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cornelia rabitz controversial issues , such as iran , kosovo and the russia 's democratic deficits , remained on the agenda but were skated around .
no breakthrough was to be expected in wiesbaden .
nevertheless , it still seems strange that obvious differences were played down - or rather ignored - to such an extent .
the rumors that an assassination attempt was allegedly being planned on putin in tehran and the talk about a possible cancellation of his trip to iran immediately after the russian-german summit only served to contribute to the confusion .
it also demonstrated that this summit was surrounded by an air of ambivalence from a lack of openness .
the term " strategic partnership " that angela merkel so enjoys using has become hackneyed and devoid of meaning .
putin 's repeated assertions that no one has anything to fear from russia do n't ring true .
anyone who follows the public debates and those of the german and russian elites , or who takes a look at opinion polls and the media in russia , gets a completely different picture .
russia 's relations to the west appear to be malfunctioning on many different levels .
some people have even been talking about fresh confrontation and a conflict of values and interests .
mutual recriminations , critique and frosty irritation are the name of the game .
it is clearly understandable that a german chancellor would not want to add fuel to the fire .
and her russian counterpart is a master at placating and whitewashing .
it is election time in russia , even if it is difficult to use the word " election " in this case .
the beaming victor has been clear for a long time .
his name is vladimir putin and he will continue to determine the fate of this big country , although it is not yet clear in exactly what function or in what way .
but the retention of power is definitely on the agenda , and he wo n't shy away from getting involved in shady maneuvers to secure it .
putin 's renewed emphasis in wiesbaden upon his allegiance to the constitution is just a matter of lip service .
putin is set to remain angela merkel 's discussion partner .
that may ultimately be the reason why the chancellor placed so much weight upon finding common ground .
after all , they will have to continue working together .
we are left with the message that the foundations are sound and everything else can be sorted out .
or in other words : let 's approach this in a more relaxed , less excitable manner .

while experts , representatives of social organizations , parliamentarians and politicians spent two days frankly speaking their minds to one another during the annual " st. petersburg dialogue , " there were conciliatory noises and the invocation of common values and partnership at the highest level .
the fact that german chancellor angela merkel and russian president vladimir putin have a good and trusting relationship might speak for their pragmatism - but it does not tell us anything about whether russian-german relations are generally good and based on trust .
merkel and putin worked their way through their agenda in a business-like manner , emphasizing , in a familiar fashion , the themes of business , trade and innovation as the most unproblematic areas , as the " heart " of russian-german relations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cornelia rabitz controversial issues , such as iran , kosovo and the russia 's democratic deficits , remained on the agenda but were skated around .
no breakthrough was to be expected in wiesbaden .
nevertheless , it still seems strange that obvious differences were played down - or rather ignored - to such an extent .
the rumors that an assassination attempt was allegedly being planned on putin in tehran and the talk about a possible cancellation of his trip to iran immediately after the russian-german summit only served to contribute to the confusion .
it also demonstrated that this summit was surrounded by an air of ambivalence from a lack of openness .
the term " strategic partnership " that angela merkel so enjoys using has become hackneyed and devoid of meaning .
putin 's repeated assertions that no one has anything to fear from russia do n't ring true .
anyone who follows the public debates and those of the german and russian elites , or who takes a look at opinion polls and the media in russia , gets a completely different picture .
russia 's relations to the west appear to be malfunctioning on many different levels .
some people have even been talking about fresh confrontation and a conflict of values and interests .
mutual recriminations , critique and frosty irritation are the name of the game .
it is clearly understandable that a german chancellor would not want to add fuel to the fire .
and her russian counterpart is a master at placating and whitewashing .
it is election time in russia , even if it is difficult to use the word " election " in this case .
the beaming victor has been clear for a long time .
his name is vladimir putin and he will continue to determine the fate of this big country , although it is not yet clear in exactly what function or in what way .
but the retention of power is definitely on the agenda , and he wo n't shy away from getting involved in shady maneuvers to secure it .
putin 's renewed emphasis in wiesbaden upon his allegiance to the constitution is just a matter of lip service .
putin is set to remain angela merkel 's discussion partner .
that may ultimately be the reason why the chancellor placed so much weight upon finding common ground .
after all , they will have to continue working together .
we are left with the message that the foundations are sound and everything else can be sorted out .
or in other words : let 's approach this in a more relaxed , less excitable manner .

while hoofe said that detailed results of the study will not be ready until next summer , he added that the report " does away with negative cliches about migrants that exist in this country . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de religion -pipe- 16.10.2007 german consultancy combines profits with christian values großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kiwi consultancy advocates adding faith to the pursuit of profits a german catholic diocese has decided to apply its expertise in morality to the region 's powerful business landscape by creating a management-consulting brand based on church ethics . brutal layoffs , corruption scandals , executive pay hikes , hedge-fund hijinks - reading the business pages can be like following a soap opera .
but it is exactly this overlap between workplace capitalism and modern values that make kiwi , a management-consulting agency based on the tenets of the catholic church , so important , its founder said .
so can faith , hope and charity really shed light on pension funds and profit sharing ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drumm : sharing the faith with business leaders " at the current time , our lives are very strongly influenced by our economic surroundings , " said joachim drumm , a theologian who heads up the department of church and society within the catholic diocese of rottenburg-stuttgart , in southern germany .
so it was a short step from peddling ethics within church walls to spreading the word in the business world , drumm said .
" the leader of a bank that was undergoing tough consolidation changes came to me and said they were seeking a theologian who could advise them on making the right decisions , " he said .
a series of similar requests got drumm thinking that perhaps there was a market opportunity in the waiting .
along with a handful of other local church leaders , he created kiwi , which is short for kirche und wirtschaft , or " church and economy . "
' nobody wants to do business with thugs " kiwi offers three product lines : training and workshops , management consulting , and networking forums , drumm explained .
the advice is based on decision making in accordance with the seven heavenly virtues : justice , prudence , temperance , fortitude , faith , hope , and charity .
profitability and christian virtue are not strange bedfellows if businesses practice the kind of market economy with social considerations and long-term sustainability that kiwi espouses , drumm said .
" business without values would be unthinkable , " he added .
" nobody wants to do business with thugs . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turning heavenly virtues into sayings that would make bill gates proud indeed , kiwi has taken the heavenly virtues and cloaked them in management-speak more at home in a fortune 500 business statement than the local parish council meeting .
" a person with hope knows what he wants , is open to new things , and has a vision for the future , " drumm said , explaining how kiwi often expresses the virtue of hope .
similarly , leaders exhibiting the virtue of charity " are committing themselves to a corporate culture of solidarity rather than egotism . "
an unjust economy is not a lasting economy , and without temperance - or moderation - an economic model is doomed to fail eventually , drumm said .
" if companies go for double-digit profits and at the same time lay off thousands of people , that is the wrong way to go in the long term , " he said .
aiming at small- and midsize business drumm said he expects kiwi 's clients to come out of germany 's mittelstand - the many midsize businesses that make up the vast bulk of the german economy - and from small , family-run concerns , because " in general these companies have a stronger identification with their personnel . "
thus they have a greater interest in reaching long-term solutions to problems rather than just going for immediate financial gain , he said .
klaus reiners , spokesman for the german association of management consultants , said ethical behavior should be a consideration for all management advisers , not just those affiliated with the catholic church .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siemens is the latest german firm to be wrapped up in a slush fund scandal a glance at the business headlines tells you that ethics are always a topic business leaders and consultants need to be aware of , reiners said , naming siemens as merely the latest conglomerate to be tied up in corruption scandals .
" global firms have certain responsibilities toward their workers and consumers , " he said .
" a firm just ca n't say , ' well everyone is corrupt , so we can be corrupt as well . '
you have to hold to a certain line . "
if church teachings can be used to promote responsible behavior , reiners said , then he is all for it .
" church is part of life , and work is another part of life ; there is no reason to keep them apart , " he said .
according to drumm , two-thirds of the german population is a member of one of the two main christian churches .
spiritual hunger and the limits of consumerism " christians are a big part of the german economy , " drumm said , and noted that the catholic church itself - with its schools , hospitals , daycare centers and old-age homes - is one of the country 's biggest employers overall .
business leaders are increasingly interested in combining leadership and spirituality , drumm said , adding that society as a whole is beginning to realize the limitations of pure consumerism when it comes to increasing their quality of life .
" so many people are looking for spiritual depth in their lives , " he said .
" everything in our world is becoming faster and aimed at productivity - but we are losing quality of life at the same time .

while experts , representatives of social organizations , parliamentarians and politicians spent two days frankly speaking their minds to one another during the annual " st. petersburg dialogue , " there were conciliatory noises and the invocation of common values and partnership at the highest level .
the fact that german chancellor angela merkel and russian president vladimir putin have a good and trusting relationship might speak for their pragmatism - but it does not tell us anything about whether russian-german relations are generally good and based on trust .

no breakthrough was to be expected in wiesbaden .
nevertheless , it still seems strange that obvious differences were played down - or rather ignored - to such an extent .
the rumors that an assassination attempt was allegedly being planned on putin in tehran and the talk about a possible cancellation of his trip to iran immediately after the russian-german summit only served to contribute to the confusion .

some people have even been talking about fresh confrontation and a conflict of values and interests .
mutual recriminations , critique and frosty irritation are the name of the game .
it is clearly understandable that a german chancellor would not want to add fuel to the fire .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de religion -pipe- 16.10.2007 german consultancy combines profits with christian values großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kiwi consultancy advocates adding faith to the pursuit of profits a german catholic diocese has decided to apply its expertise in morality to the region 's powerful business landscape by creating a management-consulting brand based on church ethics . brutal layoffs , corruption scandals , executive pay hikes , hedge-fund hijinks - reading the business pages can be like following a soap opera .
but it is exactly this overlap between workplace capitalism and modern values that make kiwi , a management-consulting agency based on the tenets of the catholic church , so important , its founder said .
so can faith , hope and charity really shed light on pension funds and profit sharing ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drumm : sharing the faith with business leaders " at the current time , our lives are very strongly influenced by our economic surroundings , " said joachim drumm , a theologian who heads up the department of church and society within the catholic diocese of rottenburg-stuttgart , in southern germany .
so it was a short step from peddling ethics within church walls to spreading the word in the business world , drumm said .
" the leader of a bank that was undergoing tough consolidation changes came to me and said they were seeking a theologian who could advise them on making the right decisions , " he said .
a series of similar requests got drumm thinking that perhaps there was a market opportunity in the waiting .
along with a handful of other local church leaders , he created kiwi , which is short for kirche und wirtschaft , or " church and economy . "
' nobody wants to do business with thugs " kiwi offers three product lines : training and workshops , management consulting , and networking forums , drumm explained .
the advice is based on decision making in accordance with the seven heavenly virtues : justice , prudence , temperance , fortitude , faith , hope , and charity .
profitability and christian virtue are not strange bedfellows if businesses practice the kind of market economy with social considerations and long-term sustainability that kiwi espouses , drumm said .
" business without values would be unthinkable , " he added .
" nobody wants to do business with thugs . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turning heavenly virtues into sayings that would make bill gates proud indeed , kiwi has taken the heavenly virtues and cloaked them in management-speak more at home in a fortune 500 business statement than the local parish council meeting .
" a person with hope knows what he wants , is open to new things , and has a vision for the future , " drumm said , explaining how kiwi often expresses the virtue of hope .
similarly , leaders exhibiting the virtue of charity " are committing themselves to a corporate culture of solidarity rather than egotism . "
an unjust economy is not a lasting economy , and without temperance - or moderation - an economic model is doomed to fail eventually , drumm said .
" if companies go for double-digit profits and at the same time lay off thousands of people , that is the wrong way to go in the long term , " he said .
aiming at small- and midsize business drumm said he expects kiwi 's clients to come out of germany 's mittelstand - the many midsize businesses that make up the vast bulk of the german economy - and from small , family-run concerns , because " in general these companies have a stronger identification with their personnel . "
thus they have a greater interest in reaching long-term solutions to problems rather than just going for immediate financial gain , he said .
klaus reiners , spokesman for the german association of management consultants , said ethical behavior should be a consideration for all management advisers , not just those affiliated with the catholic church .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siemens is the latest german firm to be wrapped up in a slush fund scandal a glance at the business headlines tells you that ethics are always a topic business leaders and consultants need to be aware of , reiners said , naming siemens as merely the latest conglomerate to be tied up in corruption scandals .
" global firms have certain responsibilities toward their workers and consumers , " he said .
" a firm just ca n't say , ' well everyone is corrupt , so we can be corrupt as well . '
you have to hold to a certain line . "
if church teachings can be used to promote responsible behavior , reiners said , then he is all for it .
" church is part of life , and work is another part of life ; there is no reason to keep them apart , " he said .
according to drumm , two-thirds of the german population is a member of one of the two main christian churches .
spiritual hunger and the limits of consumerism " christians are a big part of the german economy , " drumm said , and noted that the catholic church itself - with its schools , hospitals , daycare centers and old-age homes - is one of the country 's biggest employers overall .
business leaders are increasingly interested in combining leadership and spirituality , drumm said , adding that society as a whole is beginning to realize the limitations of pure consumerism when it comes to increasing their quality of life .
" so many people are looking for spiritual depth in their lives , " he said .
" everything in our world is becoming faster and aimed at productivity - but we are losing quality of life at the same time .

while experts , representatives of social organizations , parliamentarians and politicians spent two days frankly speaking their minds to one another during the annual " st. petersburg dialogue , " there were conciliatory noises and the invocation of common values and partnership at the highest level .
the fact that german chancellor angela merkel and russian president vladimir putin have a good and trusting relationship might speak for their pragmatism - but it does not tell us anything about whether russian-german relations are generally good and based on trust .
merkel and putin worked their way through their agenda in a business-like manner , emphasizing , in a familiar fashion , the themes of business , trade and innovation as the most unproblematic areas , as the " heart " of russian-german relations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cornelia rabitz controversial issues , such as iran , kosovo and the russia 's democratic deficits , remained on the agenda but were skated around .
no breakthrough was to be expected in wiesbaden .
nevertheless , it still seems strange that obvious differences were played down - or rather ignored - to such an extent .
the rumors that an assassination attempt was allegedly being planned on putin in tehran and the talk about a possible cancellation of his trip to iran immediately after the russian-german summit only served to contribute to the confusion .
it also demonstrated that this summit was surrounded by an air of ambivalence from a lack of openness .
the term " strategic partnership " that angela merkel so enjoys using has become hackneyed and devoid of meaning .
putin 's repeated assertions that no one has anything to fear from russia do n't ring true .
anyone who follows the public debates and those of the german and russian elites , or who takes a look at opinion polls and the media in russia , gets a completely different picture .
russia 's relations to the west appear to be malfunctioning on many different levels .
some people have even been talking about fresh confrontation and a conflict of values and interests .
mutual recriminations , critique and frosty irritation are the name of the game .
it is clearly understandable that a german chancellor would not want to add fuel to the fire .
and her russian counterpart is a master at placating and whitewashing .
it is election time in russia , even if it is difficult to use the word " election " in this case .
the beaming victor has been clear for a long time .
his name is vladimir putin and he will continue to determine the fate of this big country , although it is not yet clear in exactly what function or in what way .
but the retention of power is definitely on the agenda , and he wo n't shy away from getting involved in shady maneuvers to secure it .
putin 's renewed emphasis in wiesbaden upon his allegiance to the constitution is just a matter of lip service .
putin is set to remain angela merkel 's discussion partner .
that may ultimately be the reason why the chancellor placed so much weight upon finding common ground .
after all , they will have to continue working together .
we are left with the message that the foundations are sound and everything else can be sorted out .
or in other words : let 's approach this in a more relaxed , less excitable manner .

16 , presented a unique study on the social environments of migrants in germany that they say will help improve the situation . the study is the first of its kind worldwide because it focuses on the current social environments of migrants rather than their backgrounds , said deputy family minister gerd hoofe , who presented the report on tuesday .
while factors such as ethnicity , religion and migration history do play a role for migrants , their current social environments are much more important in term of people 's identity , hoofe said .
the report is based on 104 extensive interviews and has distinguished eight migrant social environments , ranging from " religiously rooted " and based on conservative , strict moral values to " intellectual cosmopolitan " environments with an open-minded , tolerant attitude .
while hoofe said that detailed results of the study will not be ready until next summer , he added that the report " does away with negative cliches about migrants that exist in this country . "
" migrants are definitely ready to integrate , but they also do not want to forget their roots , " he said , adding that the level of education and urbanity played a role as well .
bodo flaig , a psychologist in charge of the study , added that the new research definitely showed that migrants ' lives were not dominated by religion .

" we can not neglect a single talent , " the chancellor said during a conference on integration and education in berlin , adding that children of migrant families were particularly disadvantaged in germany .
according to the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- , the german school system ranks last among those of 17 industrialized nations when it comes to supporting migrant children .
germany 's mediocre integration policies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an annual integration summit is designed to promote dialogue on a european level , germany ranks in mid-field when it comes to integrating foreign workers , according to a study released on monday .
it came in at no. 14 out of 28 countries studied for the migration integration policy index -lrb- mpiex -rrb- .
sweden was found to be the best at helping immigrants feel welcome , while latvia scored the worst .
taken as a whole , the 25 eu countries included in the study -lrb- all of the 27 eu member states except bulgaria and romania -rrb- scored an overall average of 53 percent .
generally , the study found that eu countries are good at helping immigrants become long-term residents , but do not make it easy for them to become full-fledged citizens .
the study 's authors said they did not want to engage in a " name and shame " exercise and instead called on national governments to use their findings as an instrument to guide their future integration policies .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de religion -pipe- 16.10.2007 german consultancy combines profits with christian values großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kiwi consultancy advocates adding faith to the pursuit of profits a german catholic diocese has decided to apply its expertise in morality to the region 's powerful business landscape by creating a management-consulting brand based on church ethics . brutal layoffs , corruption scandals , executive pay hikes , hedge-fund hijinks - reading the business pages can be like following a soap opera .
but it is exactly this overlap between workplace capitalism and modern values that make kiwi , a management-consulting agency based on the tenets of the catholic church , so important , its founder said .
so can faith , hope and charity really shed light on pension funds and profit sharing ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drumm : sharing the faith with business leaders " at the current time , our lives are very strongly influenced by our economic surroundings , " said joachim drumm , a theologian who heads up the department of church and society within the catholic diocese of rottenburg-stuttgart , in southern germany .
so it was a short step from peddling ethics within church walls to spreading the word in the business world , drumm said .
" the leader of a bank that was undergoing tough consolidation changes came to me and said they were seeking a theologian who could advise them on making the right decisions , " he said .
a series of similar requests got drumm thinking that perhaps there was a market opportunity in the waiting .
along with a handful of other local church leaders , he created kiwi , which is short for kirche und wirtschaft , or " church and economy . "
' nobody wants to do business with thugs " kiwi offers three product lines : training and workshops , management consulting , and networking forums , drumm explained .
the advice is based on decision making in accordance with the seven heavenly virtues : justice , prudence , temperance , fortitude , faith , hope , and charity .
profitability and christian virtue are not strange bedfellows if businesses practice the kind of market economy with social considerations and long-term sustainability that kiwi espouses , drumm said .
" business without values would be unthinkable , " he added .
" nobody wants to do business with thugs . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turning heavenly virtues into sayings that would make bill gates proud indeed , kiwi has taken the heavenly virtues and cloaked them in management-speak more at home in a fortune 500 business statement than the local parish council meeting .
" a person with hope knows what he wants , is open to new things , and has a vision for the future , " drumm said , explaining how kiwi often expresses the virtue of hope .
similarly , leaders exhibiting the virtue of charity " are committing themselves to a corporate culture of solidarity rather than egotism . "
an unjust economy is not a lasting economy , and without temperance - or moderation - an economic model is doomed to fail eventually , drumm said .
" if companies go for double-digit profits and at the same time lay off thousands of people , that is the wrong way to go in the long term , " he said .
aiming at small- and midsize business drumm said he expects kiwi 's clients to come out of germany 's mittelstand - the many midsize businesses that make up the vast bulk of the german economy - and from small , family-run concerns , because " in general these companies have a stronger identification with their personnel . "
thus they have a greater interest in reaching long-term solutions to problems rather than just going for immediate financial gain , he said .
klaus reiners , spokesman for the german association of management consultants , said ethical behavior should be a consideration for all management advisers , not just those affiliated with the catholic church .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siemens is the latest german firm to be wrapped up in a slush fund scandal a glance at the business headlines tells you that ethics are always a topic business leaders and consultants need to be aware of , reiners said , naming siemens as merely the latest conglomerate to be tied up in corruption scandals .
" global firms have certain responsibilities toward their workers and consumers , " he said .
" a firm just ca n't say , ' well everyone is corrupt , so we can be corrupt as well . '
you have to hold to a certain line . "
if church teachings can be used to promote responsible behavior , reiners said , then he is all for it .
" church is part of life , and work is another part of life ; there is no reason to keep them apart , " he said .
according to drumm , two-thirds of the german population is a member of one of the two main christian churches .
spiritual hunger and the limits of consumerism " christians are a big part of the german economy , " drumm said , and noted that the catholic church itself - with its schools , hospitals , daycare centers and old-age homes - is one of the country 's biggest employers overall .
business leaders are increasingly interested in combining leadership and spirituality , drumm said , adding that society as a whole is beginning to realize the limitations of pure consumerism when it comes to increasing their quality of life .

while hoofe said that detailed results of the study will not be ready until next summer , he added that the report " does away with negative cliches about migrants that exist in this country . "

but it is exactly this overlap between workplace capitalism and modern values that make kiwi , a management-consulting agency based on the tenets of the catholic church , so important , its founder said .
so can faith , hope and charity really shed light on pension funds and profit sharing ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drumm : sharing the faith with business leaders " at the current time , our lives are very strongly influenced by our economic surroundings , " said joachim drumm , a theologian who heads up the department of church and society within the catholic diocese of rottenburg-stuttgart , in southern germany .
so it was a short step from peddling ethics within church walls to spreading the word in the business world , drumm said .
" the leader of a bank that was undergoing tough consolidation changes came to me and said they were seeking a theologian who could advise them on making the right decisions , " he said .
a series of similar requests got drumm thinking that perhaps there was a market opportunity in the waiting .
along with a handful of other local church leaders , he created kiwi , which is short for kirche und wirtschaft , or " church and economy . "
' nobody wants to do business with thugs " kiwi offers three product lines : training and workshops , management consulting , and networking forums , drumm explained .
the advice is based on decision making in accordance with the seven heavenly virtues : justice , prudence , temperance , fortitude , faith , hope , and charity .
profitability and christian virtue are not strange bedfellows if businesses practice the kind of market economy with social considerations and long-term sustainability that kiwi espouses , drumm said .

similarly , leaders exhibiting the virtue of charity " are committing themselves to a corporate culture of solidarity rather than egotism . "
an unjust economy is not a lasting economy , and without temperance - or moderation - an economic model is doomed to fail eventually , drumm said .
" if companies go for double-digit profits and at the same time lay off thousands of people , that is the wrong way to go in the long term , " he said .
aiming at small- and midsize business drumm said he expects kiwi 's clients to come out of germany 's mittelstand - the many midsize businesses that make up the vast bulk of the german economy - and from small , family-run concerns , because " in general these companies have a stronger identification with their personnel . "
thus they have a greater interest in reaching long-term solutions to problems rather than just going for immediate financial gain , he said .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siemens is the latest german firm to be wrapped up in a slush fund scandal a glance at the business headlines tells you that ethics are always a topic business leaders and consultants need to be aware of , reiners said , naming siemens as merely the latest conglomerate to be tied up in corruption scandals .
" global firms have certain responsibilities toward their workers and consumers , " he said .
" a firm just ca n't say , ' well everyone is corrupt , so we can be corrupt as well . '
you have to hold to a certain line . "
if church teachings can be used to promote responsible behavior , reiners said , then he is all for it .
" church is part of life , and work is another part of life ; there is no reason to keep them apart , " he said .
according to drumm , two-thirds of the german population is a member of one of the two main christian churches .
spiritual hunger and the limits of consumerism " christians are a big part of the german economy , " drumm said , and noted that the catholic church itself - with its schools , hospitals , daycare centers and old-age homes - is one of the country 's biggest employers overall .
business leaders are increasingly interested in combining leadership and spirituality , drumm said , adding that society as a whole is beginning to realize the limitations of pure consumerism when it comes to increasing their quality of life .
" so many people are looking for spiritual depth in their lives , " he said .
" everything in our world is becoming faster and aimed at productivity - but we are losing quality of life at the same time .

but it is exactly this overlap between workplace capitalism and modern values that make kiwi , a management-consulting agency based on the tenets of the catholic church , so important , its founder said .
so can faith , hope and charity really shed light on pension funds and profit sharing ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drumm : sharing the faith with business leaders " at the current time , our lives are very strongly influenced by our economic surroundings , " said joachim drumm , a theologian who heads up the department of church and society within the catholic diocese of rottenburg-stuttgart , in southern germany .
so it was a short step from peddling ethics within church walls to spreading the word in the business world , drumm said .
" the leader of a bank that was undergoing tough consolidation changes came to me and said they were seeking a theologian who could advise them on making the right decisions , " he said .
a series of similar requests got drumm thinking that perhaps there was a market opportunity in the waiting .
along with a handful of other local church leaders , he created kiwi , which is short for kirche und wirtschaft , or " church and economy . "
' nobody wants to do business with thugs " kiwi offers three product lines : training and workshops , management consulting , and networking forums , drumm explained .
the advice is based on decision making in accordance with the seven heavenly virtues : justice , prudence , temperance , fortitude , faith , hope , and charity .
profitability and christian virtue are not strange bedfellows if businesses practice the kind of market economy with social considerations and long-term sustainability that kiwi espouses , drumm said .
" business without values would be unthinkable , " he added .
" nobody wants to do business with thugs . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turning heavenly virtues into sayings that would make bill gates proud indeed , kiwi has taken the heavenly virtues and cloaked them in management-speak more at home in a fortune 500 business statement than the local parish council meeting .
" a person with hope knows what he wants , is open to new things , and has a vision for the future , " drumm said , explaining how kiwi often expresses the virtue of hope .
similarly , leaders exhibiting the virtue of charity " are committing themselves to a corporate culture of solidarity rather than egotism . "
an unjust economy is not a lasting economy , and without temperance - or moderation - an economic model is doomed to fail eventually , drumm said .
" if companies go for double-digit profits and at the same time lay off thousands of people , that is the wrong way to go in the long term , " he said .
aiming at small- and midsize business drumm said he expects kiwi 's clients to come out of germany 's mittelstand - the many midsize businesses that make up the vast bulk of the german economy - and from small , family-run concerns , because " in general these companies have a stronger identification with their personnel . "
thus they have a greater interest in reaching long-term solutions to problems rather than just going for immediate financial gain , he said .
klaus reiners , spokesman for the german association of management consultants , said ethical behavior should be a consideration for all management advisers , not just those affiliated with the catholic church .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siemens is the latest german firm to be wrapped up in a slush fund scandal a glance at the business headlines tells you that ethics are always a topic business leaders and consultants need to be aware of , reiners said , naming siemens as merely the latest conglomerate to be tied up in corruption scandals .

while factors such as ethnicity , religion and migration history do play a role for migrants , their current social environments are much more important in term of people 's identity , hoofe said .
the report is based on 104 extensive interviews and has distinguished eight migrant social environments , ranging from " religiously rooted " and based on conservative , strict moral values to " intellectual cosmopolitan " environments with an open-minded , tolerant attitude .
while hoofe said that detailed results of the study will not be ready until next summer , he added that the report " does away with negative cliches about migrants that exist in this country . "
" migrants are definitely ready to integrate , but they also do not want to forget their roots , " he said , adding that the level of education and urbanity played a role as well .

while experts , representatives of social organizations , parliamentarians and politicians spent two days frankly speaking their minds to one another during the annual " st. petersburg dialogue , " there were conciliatory noises and the invocation of common values and partnership at the highest level .

16 , 1927 , in what was then the german city of danzig - now polish gdansk - made a name for himself as a writer in 1959 with his critically acclaimed first novel , die blechtrommel -lrb- " the tin drum " -rrb- .
like the two other works in the so-called " danzig trilogy " - katz und maus -lrb- " cat and mouse , " 1961 -rrb- and hundejahre -lrb- " dog years , " 1963 -rrb- - " the tin drum " draws on the author 's early life in the german-polish port . when he published " the tin drum , " " it was as if german literature had been granted a new beginning after decades of linguistic and moral destruction , " the nobel prize academy wrote when it named him a nobel laureate in literature in 1999 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the tin drum " was made into a successful film grass was the son of a grocer .
it was a desire to leave his lower-middle class catholic upbringing which inspired him to volunteer to join the german military .
grass was then conscripted , at the age of 17 , into the waffen ss combat troops , a fact he did n't disclose until 2006 . politically active the admission , revealed after more than half a century , caused a huge controversy , shattering both the widespread belief that grass had been too young during the war to have been seriously involved in nazi crimes and his image as a moral authority .
there were calls for him to be stripped of his nobel prize and to be deprived of the honorary citizenship of gdansk . over the decades , grass , whose work often contains a strong left-wing dimension , has used his prominence as a platform for political commentary . as the events which led to german reunification in 1990 began to unfold , grass was very vocal in his opposition and referred to it as an " annexation . " in 1995 , he wrote about german reunification in ein weites feld -lrb- " too far afield , " 1995 -rrb- . breaking taboos bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " crabwalk " was published in 2004 history and politics are closely intertwined in all of grass ' works .
in 2002 he published im krebsgang -lrb- " crabwalk " -rrb- , which broke a long-held taboo in german literature by focusing on the suffering of german expellees after world war ii . by highlighting a single event in 1945 , the sinking of the refugee ship " wilhelm gustloff " in the baltic sea , which killed some 9,000 people , grass traced the history of a few key characters through the generations up to the present-day portrayal of the tragedy on neo-nazi web sites .
like his earlier works , it underlines the author 's preoccupation with the way past and present are connected and perceived . grass , who refused to accept a german government honor in 1979 , voiced appreciation that german president horst köhler would be at the head of those congratulating him at an oct .
27 ceremony in the northern city of lübeck . " since i have suffered from a great deal of mockery and nastiness in recent years , it does me good to see my six decades of work recognized , not only in germany but abroad , " he told the german dpa news agency . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

while experts , representatives of social organizations , parliamentarians and politicians spent two days frankly speaking their minds to one another during the annual " st. petersburg dialogue , " there were conciliatory noises and the invocation of common values and partnership at the highest level .
the fact that german chancellor angela merkel and russian president vladimir putin have a good and trusting relationship might speak for their pragmatism - but it does not tell us anything about whether russian-german relations are generally good and based on trust .
merkel and putin worked their way through their agenda in a business-like manner , emphasizing , in a familiar fashion , the themes of business , trade and innovation as the most unproblematic areas , as the " heart " of russian-german relations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cornelia rabitz controversial issues , such as iran , kosovo and the russia 's democratic deficits , remained on the agenda but were skated around .
no breakthrough was to be expected in wiesbaden .
nevertheless , it still seems strange that obvious differences were played down - or rather ignored - to such an extent .
the rumors that an assassination attempt was allegedly being planned on putin in tehran and the talk about a possible cancellation of his trip to iran immediately after the russian-german summit only served to contribute to the confusion .
it also demonstrated that this summit was surrounded by an air of ambivalence from a lack of openness .
the term " strategic partnership " that angela merkel so enjoys using has become hackneyed and devoid of meaning .
putin 's repeated assertions that no one has anything to fear from russia do n't ring true .
anyone who follows the public debates and those of the german and russian elites , or who takes a look at opinion polls and the media in russia , gets a completely different picture .
russia 's relations to the west appear to be malfunctioning on many different levels .
some people have even been talking about fresh confrontation and a conflict of values and interests .
mutual recriminations , critique and frosty irritation are the name of the game .
it is clearly understandable that a german chancellor would not want to add fuel to the fire .
and her russian counterpart is a master at placating and whitewashing .
it is election time in russia , even if it is difficult to use the word " election " in this case .
the beaming victor has been clear for a long time .
his name is vladimir putin and he will continue to determine the fate of this big country , although it is not yet clear in exactly what function or in what way .
but the retention of power is definitely on the agenda , and he wo n't shy away from getting involved in shady maneuvers to secure it .
putin 's renewed emphasis in wiesbaden upon his allegiance to the constitution is just a matter of lip service .
putin is set to remain angela merkel 's discussion partner .
that may ultimately be the reason why the chancellor placed so much weight upon finding common ground .
after all , they will have to continue working together .
we are left with the message that the foundations are sound and everything else can be sorted out .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de religion -pipe- 16.10.2007 german consultancy combines profits with christian values großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kiwi consultancy advocates adding faith to the pursuit of profits a german catholic diocese has decided to apply its expertise in morality to the region 's powerful business landscape by creating a management-consulting brand based on church ethics . brutal layoffs , corruption scandals , executive pay hikes , hedge-fund hijinks - reading the business pages can be like following a soap opera .
but it is exactly this overlap between workplace capitalism and modern values that make kiwi , a management-consulting agency based on the tenets of the catholic church , so important , its founder said .
so can faith , hope and charity really shed light on pension funds and profit sharing ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drumm : sharing the faith with business leaders " at the current time , our lives are very strongly influenced by our economic surroundings , " said joachim drumm , a theologian who heads up the department of church and society within the catholic diocese of rottenburg-stuttgart , in southern germany .
so it was a short step from peddling ethics within church walls to spreading the word in the business world , drumm said .
" the leader of a bank that was undergoing tough consolidation changes came to me and said they were seeking a theologian who could advise them on making the right decisions , " he said .
a series of similar requests got drumm thinking that perhaps there was a market opportunity in the waiting .
along with a handful of other local church leaders , he created kiwi , which is short for kirche und wirtschaft , or " church and economy . "
' nobody wants to do business with thugs " kiwi offers three product lines : training and workshops , management consulting , and networking forums , drumm explained .
the advice is based on decision making in accordance with the seven heavenly virtues : justice , prudence , temperance , fortitude , faith , hope , and charity .
profitability and christian virtue are not strange bedfellows if businesses practice the kind of market economy with social considerations and long-term sustainability that kiwi espouses , drumm said .
" business without values would be unthinkable , " he added .
" nobody wants to do business with thugs . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turning heavenly virtues into sayings that would make bill gates proud indeed , kiwi has taken the heavenly virtues and cloaked them in management-speak more at home in a fortune 500 business statement than the local parish council meeting .
" a person with hope knows what he wants , is open to new things , and has a vision for the future , " drumm said , explaining how kiwi often expresses the virtue of hope .
similarly , leaders exhibiting the virtue of charity " are committing themselves to a corporate culture of solidarity rather than egotism . "
an unjust economy is not a lasting economy , and without temperance - or moderation - an economic model is doomed to fail eventually , drumm said .
" if companies go for double-digit profits and at the same time lay off thousands of people , that is the wrong way to go in the long term , " he said .
aiming at small- and midsize business drumm said he expects kiwi 's clients to come out of germany 's mittelstand - the many midsize businesses that make up the vast bulk of the german economy - and from small , family-run concerns , because " in general these companies have a stronger identification with their personnel . "
thus they have a greater interest in reaching long-term solutions to problems rather than just going for immediate financial gain , he said .
klaus reiners , spokesman for the german association of management consultants , said ethical behavior should be a consideration for all management advisers , not just those affiliated with the catholic church .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siemens is the latest german firm to be wrapped up in a slush fund scandal a glance at the business headlines tells you that ethics are always a topic business leaders and consultants need to be aware of , reiners said , naming siemens as merely the latest conglomerate to be tied up in corruption scandals .
" global firms have certain responsibilities toward their workers and consumers , " he said .
" a firm just ca n't say , ' well everyone is corrupt , so we can be corrupt as well . '
you have to hold to a certain line . "
if church teachings can be used to promote responsible behavior , reiners said , then he is all for it .
" church is part of life , and work is another part of life ; there is no reason to keep them apart , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de religion -pipe- 16.10.2007 german consultancy combines profits with christian values großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kiwi consultancy advocates adding faith to the pursuit of profits a german catholic diocese has decided to apply its expertise in morality to the region 's powerful business landscape by creating a management-consulting brand based on church ethics . brutal layoffs , corruption scandals , executive pay hikes , hedge-fund hijinks - reading the business pages can be like following a soap opera .
but it is exactly this overlap between workplace capitalism and modern values that make kiwi , a management-consulting agency based on the tenets of the catholic church , so important , its founder said .
so can faith , hope and charity really shed light on pension funds and profit sharing ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drumm : sharing the faith with business leaders " at the current time , our lives are very strongly influenced by our economic surroundings , " said joachim drumm , a theologian who heads up the department of church and society within the catholic diocese of rottenburg-stuttgart , in southern germany .
so it was a short step from peddling ethics within church walls to spreading the word in the business world , drumm said .
" the leader of a bank that was undergoing tough consolidation changes came to me and said they were seeking a theologian who could advise them on making the right decisions , " he said .
a series of similar requests got drumm thinking that perhaps there was a market opportunity in the waiting .
along with a handful of other local church leaders , he created kiwi , which is short for kirche und wirtschaft , or " church and economy . "
' nobody wants to do business with thugs " kiwi offers three product lines : training and workshops , management consulting , and networking forums , drumm explained .
the advice is based on decision making in accordance with the seven heavenly virtues : justice , prudence , temperance , fortitude , faith , hope , and charity .
profitability and christian virtue are not strange bedfellows if businesses practice the kind of market economy with social considerations and long-term sustainability that kiwi espouses , drumm said .
" business without values would be unthinkable , " he added .
" nobody wants to do business with thugs . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turning heavenly virtues into sayings that would make bill gates proud indeed , kiwi has taken the heavenly virtues and cloaked them in management-speak more at home in a fortune 500 business statement than the local parish council meeting .
" a person with hope knows what he wants , is open to new things , and has a vision for the future , " drumm said , explaining how kiwi often expresses the virtue of hope .
similarly , leaders exhibiting the virtue of charity " are committing themselves to a corporate culture of solidarity rather than egotism . "
an unjust economy is not a lasting economy , and without temperance - or moderation - an economic model is doomed to fail eventually , drumm said .
" if companies go for double-digit profits and at the same time lay off thousands of people , that is the wrong way to go in the long term , " he said .
aiming at small- and midsize business drumm said he expects kiwi 's clients to come out of germany 's mittelstand - the many midsize businesses that make up the vast bulk of the german economy - and from small , family-run concerns , because " in general these companies have a stronger identification with their personnel . "
thus they have a greater interest in reaching long-term solutions to problems rather than just going for immediate financial gain , he said .
klaus reiners , spokesman for the german association of management consultants , said ethical behavior should be a consideration for all management advisers , not just those affiliated with the catholic church .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siemens is the latest german firm to be wrapped up in a slush fund scandal a glance at the business headlines tells you that ethics are always a topic business leaders and consultants need to be aware of , reiners said , naming siemens as merely the latest conglomerate to be tied up in corruption scandals .
" global firms have certain responsibilities toward their workers and consumers , " he said .
" a firm just ca n't say , ' well everyone is corrupt , so we can be corrupt as well . '
you have to hold to a certain line . "
if church teachings can be used to promote responsible behavior , reiners said , then he is all for it .
" church is part of life , and work is another part of life ; there is no reason to keep them apart , " he said .
according to drumm , two-thirds of the german population is a member of one of the two main christian churches .
spiritual hunger and the limits of consumerism " christians are a big part of the german economy , " drumm said , and noted that the catholic church itself - with its schools , hospitals , daycare centers and old-age homes - is one of the country 's biggest employers overall .
business leaders are increasingly interested in combining leadership and spirituality , drumm said , adding that society as a whole is beginning to realize the limitations of pure consumerism when it comes to increasing their quality of life .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de religion -pipe- 16.10.2007 german consultancy combines profits with christian values großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kiwi consultancy advocates adding faith to the pursuit of profits a german catholic diocese has decided to apply its expertise in morality to the region 's powerful business landscape by creating a management-consulting brand based on church ethics . brutal layoffs , corruption scandals , executive pay hikes , hedge-fund hijinks - reading the business pages can be like following a soap opera .
but it is exactly this overlap between workplace capitalism and modern values that make kiwi , a management-consulting agency based on the tenets of the catholic church , so important , its founder said .
so can faith , hope and charity really shed light on pension funds and profit sharing ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drumm : sharing the faith with business leaders " at the current time , our lives are very strongly influenced by our economic surroundings , " said joachim drumm , a theologian who heads up the department of church and society within the catholic diocese of rottenburg-stuttgart , in southern germany .
so it was a short step from peddling ethics within church walls to spreading the word in the business world , drumm said .
" the leader of a bank that was undergoing tough consolidation changes came to me and said they were seeking a theologian who could advise them on making the right decisions , " he said .
a series of similar requests got drumm thinking that perhaps there was a market opportunity in the waiting .
along with a handful of other local church leaders , he created kiwi , which is short for kirche und wirtschaft , or " church and economy . "
' nobody wants to do business with thugs " kiwi offers three product lines : training and workshops , management consulting , and networking forums , drumm explained .
the advice is based on decision making in accordance with the seven heavenly virtues : justice , prudence , temperance , fortitude , faith , hope , and charity .
profitability and christian virtue are not strange bedfellows if businesses practice the kind of market economy with social considerations and long-term sustainability that kiwi espouses , drumm said .
" business without values would be unthinkable , " he added .
" nobody wants to do business with thugs . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turning heavenly virtues into sayings that would make bill gates proud indeed , kiwi has taken the heavenly virtues and cloaked them in management-speak more at home in a fortune 500 business statement than the local parish council meeting .
" a person with hope knows what he wants , is open to new things , and has a vision for the future , " drumm said , explaining how kiwi often expresses the virtue of hope .
similarly , leaders exhibiting the virtue of charity " are committing themselves to a corporate culture of solidarity rather than egotism . "
an unjust economy is not a lasting economy , and without temperance - or moderation - an economic model is doomed to fail eventually , drumm said .
" if companies go for double-digit profits and at the same time lay off thousands of people , that is the wrong way to go in the long term , " he said .
aiming at small- and midsize business drumm said he expects kiwi 's clients to come out of germany 's mittelstand - the many midsize businesses that make up the vast bulk of the german economy - and from small , family-run concerns , because " in general these companies have a stronger identification with their personnel . "
thus they have a greater interest in reaching long-term solutions to problems rather than just going for immediate financial gain , he said .
klaus reiners , spokesman for the german association of management consultants , said ethical behavior should be a consideration for all management advisers , not just those affiliated with the catholic church .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siemens is the latest german firm to be wrapped up in a slush fund scandal a glance at the business headlines tells you that ethics are always a topic business leaders and consultants need to be aware of , reiners said , naming siemens as merely the latest conglomerate to be tied up in corruption scandals .
" global firms have certain responsibilities toward their workers and consumers , " he said .
" a firm just ca n't say , ' well everyone is corrupt , so we can be corrupt as well . '
you have to hold to a certain line . "
if church teachings can be used to promote responsible behavior , reiners said , then he is all for it .
" church is part of life , and work is another part of life ; there is no reason to keep them apart , " he said .
according to drumm , two-thirds of the german population is a member of one of the two main christian churches .
spiritual hunger and the limits of consumerism " christians are a big part of the german economy , " drumm said , and noted that the catholic church itself - with its schools , hospitals , daycare centers and old-age homes - is one of the country 's biggest employers overall .
business leaders are increasingly interested in combining leadership and spirituality , drumm said , adding that society as a whole is beginning to realize the limitations of pure consumerism when it comes to increasing their quality of life .
" so many people are looking for spiritual depth in their lives , " he said .
" everything in our world is becoming faster and aimed at productivity - but we are losing quality of life at the same time .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de religion -pipe- 16.10.2007 german consultancy combines profits with christian values großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kiwi consultancy advocates adding faith to the pursuit of profits a german catholic diocese has decided to apply its expertise in morality to the region 's powerful business landscape by creating a management-consulting brand based on church ethics . brutal layoffs , corruption scandals , executive pay hikes , hedge-fund hijinks - reading the business pages can be like following a soap opera .
but it is exactly this overlap between workplace capitalism and modern values that make kiwi , a management-consulting agency based on the tenets of the catholic church , so important , its founder said .
so can faith , hope and charity really shed light on pension funds and profit sharing ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drumm : sharing the faith with business leaders " at the current time , our lives are very strongly influenced by our economic surroundings , " said joachim drumm , a theologian who heads up the department of church and society within the catholic diocese of rottenburg-stuttgart , in southern germany .
so it was a short step from peddling ethics within church walls to spreading the word in the business world , drumm said .
" the leader of a bank that was undergoing tough consolidation changes came to me and said they were seeking a theologian who could advise them on making the right decisions , " he said .
a series of similar requests got drumm thinking that perhaps there was a market opportunity in the waiting .
along with a handful of other local church leaders , he created kiwi , which is short for kirche und wirtschaft , or " church and economy . "
' nobody wants to do business with thugs " kiwi offers three product lines : training and workshops , management consulting , and networking forums , drumm explained .
the advice is based on decision making in accordance with the seven heavenly virtues : justice , prudence , temperance , fortitude , faith , hope , and charity .
profitability and christian virtue are not strange bedfellows if businesses practice the kind of market economy with social considerations and long-term sustainability that kiwi espouses , drumm said .
" business without values would be unthinkable , " he added .
" nobody wants to do business with thugs . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turning heavenly virtues into sayings that would make bill gates proud indeed , kiwi has taken the heavenly virtues and cloaked them in management-speak more at home in a fortune 500 business statement than the local parish council meeting .
" a person with hope knows what he wants , is open to new things , and has a vision for the future , " drumm said , explaining how kiwi often expresses the virtue of hope .
similarly , leaders exhibiting the virtue of charity " are committing themselves to a corporate culture of solidarity rather than egotism . "
an unjust economy is not a lasting economy , and without temperance - or moderation - an economic model is doomed to fail eventually , drumm said .
" if companies go for double-digit profits and at the same time lay off thousands of people , that is the wrong way to go in the long term , " he said .
aiming at small- and midsize business drumm said he expects kiwi 's clients to come out of germany 's mittelstand - the many midsize businesses that make up the vast bulk of the german economy - and from small , family-run concerns , because " in general these companies have a stronger identification with their personnel . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de religion -pipe- 16.10.2007 german consultancy combines profits with christian values großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kiwi consultancy advocates adding faith to the pursuit of profits a german catholic diocese has decided to apply its expertise in morality to the region 's powerful business landscape by creating a management-consulting brand based on church ethics . brutal layoffs , corruption scandals , executive pay hikes , hedge-fund hijinks - reading the business pages can be like following a soap opera .
but it is exactly this overlap between workplace capitalism and modern values that make kiwi , a management-consulting agency based on the tenets of the catholic church , so important , its founder said .
so can faith , hope and charity really shed light on pension funds and profit sharing ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drumm : sharing the faith with business leaders " at the current time , our lives are very strongly influenced by our economic surroundings , " said joachim drumm , a theologian who heads up the department of church and society within the catholic diocese of rottenburg-stuttgart , in southern germany .
so it was a short step from peddling ethics within church walls to spreading the word in the business world , drumm said .
" the leader of a bank that was undergoing tough consolidation changes came to me and said they were seeking a theologian who could advise them on making the right decisions , " he said .
a series of similar requests got drumm thinking that perhaps there was a market opportunity in the waiting .
along with a handful of other local church leaders , he created kiwi , which is short for kirche und wirtschaft , or " church and economy . "
' nobody wants to do business with thugs " kiwi offers three product lines : training and workshops , management consulting , and networking forums , drumm explained .
the advice is based on decision making in accordance with the seven heavenly virtues : justice , prudence , temperance , fortitude , faith , hope , and charity .
profitability and christian virtue are not strange bedfellows if businesses practice the kind of market economy with social considerations and long-term sustainability that kiwi espouses , drumm said .
" business without values would be unthinkable , " he added .
" nobody wants to do business with thugs . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turning heavenly virtues into sayings that would make bill gates proud indeed , kiwi has taken the heavenly virtues and cloaked them in management-speak more at home in a fortune 500 business statement than the local parish council meeting .
" a person with hope knows what he wants , is open to new things , and has a vision for the future , " drumm said , explaining how kiwi often expresses the virtue of hope .
similarly , leaders exhibiting the virtue of charity " are committing themselves to a corporate culture of solidarity rather than egotism . "
an unjust economy is not a lasting economy , and without temperance - or moderation - an economic model is doomed to fail eventually , drumm said .
" if companies go for double-digit profits and at the same time lay off thousands of people , that is the wrong way to go in the long term , " he said .
aiming at small- and midsize business drumm said he expects kiwi 's clients to come out of germany 's mittelstand - the many midsize businesses that make up the vast bulk of the german economy - and from small , family-run concerns , because " in general these companies have a stronger identification with their personnel . "
thus they have a greater interest in reaching long-term solutions to problems rather than just going for immediate financial gain , he said .
klaus reiners , spokesman for the german association of management consultants , said ethical behavior should be a consideration for all management advisers , not just those affiliated with the catholic church .

16 , 1927 , in what was then the german city of danzig - now polish gdansk - made a name for himself as a writer in 1959 with his critically acclaimed first novel , die blechtrommel -lrb- " the tin drum " -rrb- .
like the two other works in the so-called " danzig trilogy " - katz und maus -lrb- " cat and mouse , " 1961 -rrb- and hundejahre -lrb- " dog years , " 1963 -rrb- - " the tin drum " draws on the author 's early life in the german-polish port . when he published " the tin drum , " " it was as if german literature had been granted a new beginning after decades of linguistic and moral destruction , " the nobel prize academy wrote when it named him a nobel laureate in literature in 1999 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the tin drum " was made into a successful film grass was the son of a grocer .
it was a desire to leave his lower-middle class catholic upbringing which inspired him to volunteer to join the german military .
grass was then conscripted , at the age of 17 , into the waffen ss combat troops , a fact he did n't disclose until 2006 . politically active the admission , revealed after more than half a century , caused a huge controversy , shattering both the widespread belief that grass had been too young during the war to have been seriously involved in nazi crimes and his image as a moral authority .
there were calls for him to be stripped of his nobel prize and to be deprived of the honorary citizenship of gdansk . over the decades , grass , whose work often contains a strong left-wing dimension , has used his prominence as a platform for political commentary . as the events which led to german reunification in 1990 began to unfold , grass was very vocal in his opposition and referred to it as an " annexation . " in 1995 , he wrote about german reunification in ein weites feld -lrb- " too far afield , " 1995 -rrb- . breaking taboos bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " crabwalk " was published in 2004 history and politics are closely intertwined in all of grass ' works .
in 2002 he published im krebsgang -lrb- " crabwalk " -rrb- , which broke a long-held taboo in german literature by focusing on the suffering of german expellees after world war ii . by highlighting a single event in 1945 , the sinking of the refugee ship " wilhelm gustloff " in the baltic sea , which killed some 9,000 people , grass traced the history of a few key characters through the generations up to the present-day portrayal of the tragedy on neo-nazi web sites .
like his earlier works , it underlines the author 's preoccupation with the way past and present are connected and perceived . grass , who refused to accept a german government honor in 1979 , voiced appreciation that german president horst köhler would be at the head of those congratulating him at an oct .
27 ceremony in the northern city of lübeck . " since i have suffered from a great deal of mockery and nastiness in recent years , it does me good to see my six decades of work recognized , not only in germany but abroad , " he told the german dpa news agency . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but it is exactly this overlap between workplace capitalism and modern values that make kiwi , a management-consulting agency based on the tenets of the catholic church , so important , its founder said .
so can faith , hope and charity really shed light on pension funds and profit sharing ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drumm : sharing the faith with business leaders " at the current time , our lives are very strongly influenced by our economic surroundings , " said joachim drumm , a theologian who heads up the department of church and society within the catholic diocese of rottenburg-stuttgart , in southern germany .
so it was a short step from peddling ethics within church walls to spreading the word in the business world , drumm said .
" the leader of a bank that was undergoing tough consolidation changes came to me and said they were seeking a theologian who could advise them on making the right decisions , " he said .
a series of similar requests got drumm thinking that perhaps there was a market opportunity in the waiting .
along with a handful of other local church leaders , he created kiwi , which is short for kirche und wirtschaft , or " church and economy . "
' nobody wants to do business with thugs " kiwi offers three product lines : training and workshops , management consulting , and networking forums , drumm explained .
the advice is based on decision making in accordance with the seven heavenly virtues : justice , prudence , temperance , fortitude , faith , hope , and charity .
profitability and christian virtue are not strange bedfellows if businesses practice the kind of market economy with social considerations and long-term sustainability that kiwi espouses , drumm said .
" business without values would be unthinkable , " he added .
" nobody wants to do business with thugs . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turning heavenly virtues into sayings that would make bill gates proud indeed , kiwi has taken the heavenly virtues and cloaked them in management-speak more at home in a fortune 500 business statement than the local parish council meeting .
" a person with hope knows what he wants , is open to new things , and has a vision for the future , " drumm said , explaining how kiwi often expresses the virtue of hope .
similarly , leaders exhibiting the virtue of charity " are committing themselves to a corporate culture of solidarity rather than egotism . "
an unjust economy is not a lasting economy , and without temperance - or moderation - an economic model is doomed to fail eventually , drumm said .
" if companies go for double-digit profits and at the same time lay off thousands of people , that is the wrong way to go in the long term , " he said .
aiming at small- and midsize business drumm said he expects kiwi 's clients to come out of germany 's mittelstand - the many midsize businesses that make up the vast bulk of the german economy - and from small , family-run concerns , because " in general these companies have a stronger identification with their personnel . "
thus they have a greater interest in reaching long-term solutions to problems rather than just going for immediate financial gain , he said .
klaus reiners , spokesman for the german association of management consultants , said ethical behavior should be a consideration for all management advisers , not just those affiliated with the catholic church .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siemens is the latest german firm to be wrapped up in a slush fund scandal a glance at the business headlines tells you that ethics are always a topic business leaders and consultants need to be aware of , reiners said , naming siemens as merely the latest conglomerate to be tied up in corruption scandals .
" global firms have certain responsibilities toward their workers and consumers , " he said .
" a firm just ca n't say , ' well everyone is corrupt , so we can be corrupt as well . '
you have to hold to a certain line . "
if church teachings can be used to promote responsible behavior , reiners said , then he is all for it .
" church is part of life , and work is another part of life ; there is no reason to keep them apart , " he said .
according to drumm , two-thirds of the german population is a member of one of the two main christian churches .
spiritual hunger and the limits of consumerism " christians are a big part of the german economy , " drumm said , and noted that the catholic church itself - with its schools , hospitals , daycare centers and old-age homes - is one of the country 's biggest employers overall .
business leaders are increasingly interested in combining leadership and spirituality , drumm said , adding that society as a whole is beginning to realize the limitations of pure consumerism when it comes to increasing their quality of life .
" so many people are looking for spiritual depth in their lives , " he said .
" everything in our world is becoming faster and aimed at productivity - but we are losing quality of life at the same time .

16 , 1927 , in what was then the german city of danzig - now polish gdansk - made a name for himself as a writer in 1959 with his critically acclaimed first novel , die blechtrommel -lrb- " the tin drum " -rrb- .
like the two other works in the so-called " danzig trilogy " - katz und maus -lrb- " cat and mouse , " 1961 -rrb- and hundejahre -lrb- " dog years , " 1963 -rrb- - " the tin drum " draws on the author 's early life in the german-polish port . when he published " the tin drum , " " it was as if german literature had been granted a new beginning after decades of linguistic and moral destruction , " the nobel prize academy wrote when it named him a nobel laureate in literature in 1999 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the tin drum " was made into a successful film grass was the son of a grocer .
it was a desire to leave his lower-middle class catholic upbringing which inspired him to volunteer to join the german military .
grass was then conscripted , at the age of 17 , into the waffen ss combat troops , a fact he did n't disclose until 2006 . politically active the admission , revealed after more than half a century , caused a huge controversy , shattering both the widespread belief that grass had been too young during the war to have been seriously involved in nazi crimes and his image as a moral authority .
there were calls for him to be stripped of his nobel prize and to be deprived of the honorary citizenship of gdansk . over the decades , grass , whose work often contains a strong left-wing dimension , has used his prominence as a platform for political commentary . as the events which led to german reunification in 1990 began to unfold , grass was very vocal in his opposition and referred to it as an " annexation . " in 1995 , he wrote about german reunification in ein weites feld -lrb- " too far afield , " 1995 -rrb- . breaking taboos bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " crabwalk " was published in 2004 history and politics are closely intertwined in all of grass ' works .
in 2002 he published im krebsgang -lrb- " crabwalk " -rrb- , which broke a long-held taboo in german literature by focusing on the suffering of german expellees after world war ii . by highlighting a single event in 1945 , the sinking of the refugee ship " wilhelm gustloff " in the baltic sea , which killed some 9,000 people , grass traced the history of a few key characters through the generations up to the present-day portrayal of the tragedy on neo-nazi web sites .

16 , 1927 , in what was then the german city of danzig - now polish gdansk - made a name for himself as a writer in 1959 with his critically acclaimed first novel , die blechtrommel -lrb- " the tin drum " -rrb- .
like the two other works in the so-called " danzig trilogy " - katz und maus -lrb- " cat and mouse , " 1961 -rrb- and hundejahre -lrb- " dog years , " 1963 -rrb- - " the tin drum " draws on the author 's early life in the german-polish port . when he published " the tin drum , " " it was as if german literature had been granted a new beginning after decades of linguistic and moral destruction , " the nobel prize academy wrote when it named him a nobel laureate in literature in 1999 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the tin drum " was made into a successful film grass was the son of a grocer .

there were calls for him to be stripped of his nobel prize and to be deprived of the honorary citizenship of gdansk . over the decades , grass , whose work often contains a strong left-wing dimension , has used his prominence as a platform for political commentary . as the events which led to german reunification in 1990 began to unfold , grass was very vocal in his opposition and referred to it as an " annexation .

while experts , representatives of social organizations , parliamentarians and politicians spent two days frankly speaking their minds to one another during the annual " st. petersburg dialogue , " there were conciliatory noises and the invocation of common values and partnership at the highest level .
the fact that german chancellor angela merkel and russian president vladimir putin have a good and trusting relationship might speak for their pragmatism - but it does not tell us anything about whether russian-german relations are generally good and based on trust .
merkel and putin worked their way through their agenda in a business-like manner , emphasizing , in a familiar fashion , the themes of business , trade and innovation as the most unproblematic areas , as the " heart " of russian-german relations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cornelia rabitz controversial issues , such as iran , kosovo and the russia 's democratic deficits , remained on the agenda but were skated around .
no breakthrough was to be expected in wiesbaden .
nevertheless , it still seems strange that obvious differences were played down - or rather ignored - to such an extent .
the rumors that an assassination attempt was allegedly being planned on putin in tehran and the talk about a possible cancellation of his trip to iran immediately after the russian-german summit only served to contribute to the confusion .
it also demonstrated that this summit was surrounded by an air of ambivalence from a lack of openness .
the term " strategic partnership " that angela merkel so enjoys using has become hackneyed and devoid of meaning .
putin 's repeated assertions that no one has anything to fear from russia do n't ring true .
anyone who follows the public debates and those of the german and russian elites , or who takes a look at opinion polls and the media in russia , gets a completely different picture .
russia 's relations to the west appear to be malfunctioning on many different levels .
some people have even been talking about fresh confrontation and a conflict of values and interests .
mutual recriminations , critique and frosty irritation are the name of the game .
it is clearly understandable that a german chancellor would not want to add fuel to the fire .
and her russian counterpart is a master at placating and whitewashing .
it is election time in russia , even if it is difficult to use the word " election " in this case .
the beaming victor has been clear for a long time .
his name is vladimir putin and he will continue to determine the fate of this big country , although it is not yet clear in exactly what function or in what way .
but the retention of power is definitely on the agenda , and he wo n't shy away from getting involved in shady maneuvers to secure it .
putin 's renewed emphasis in wiesbaden upon his allegiance to the constitution is just a matter of lip service .
putin is set to remain angela merkel 's discussion partner .
that may ultimately be the reason why the chancellor placed so much weight upon finding common ground .
after all , they will have to continue working together .
we are left with the message that the foundations are sound and everything else can be sorted out .
or in other words : let 's approach this in a more relaxed , less excitable manner .
maybe that is not such a bad idea .
it means , at least , that the desire for change in russia remains on the table . cornelia rabitz heads dw-radio 's russian service -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

16 , presented a unique study on the social environments of migrants in germany that they say will help improve the situation . the study is the first of its kind worldwide because it focuses on the current social environments of migrants rather than their backgrounds , said deputy family minister gerd hoofe , who presented the report on tuesday .
while factors such as ethnicity , religion and migration history do play a role for migrants , their current social environments are much more important in term of people 's identity , hoofe said .
the report is based on 104 extensive interviews and has distinguished eight migrant social environments , ranging from " religiously rooted " and based on conservative , strict moral values to " intellectual cosmopolitan " environments with an open-minded , tolerant attitude .
while hoofe said that detailed results of the study will not be ready until next summer , he added that the report " does away with negative cliches about migrants that exist in this country . "
" migrants are definitely ready to integrate , but they also do not want to forget their roots , " he said , adding that the level of education and urbanity played a role as well .
bodo flaig , a psychologist in charge of the study , added that the new research definitely showed that migrants ' lives were not dominated by religion .

" we can not neglect a single talent , " the chancellor said during a conference on integration and education in berlin , adding that children of migrant families were particularly disadvantaged in germany .
according to the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- , the german school system ranks last among those of 17 industrialized nations when it comes to supporting migrant children .
germany 's mediocre integration policies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an annual integration summit is designed to promote dialogue on a european level , germany ranks in mid-field when it comes to integrating foreign workers , according to a study released on monday .
it came in at no. 14 out of 28 countries studied for the migration integration policy index -lrb- mpiex -rrb- .
sweden was found to be the best at helping immigrants feel welcome , while latvia scored the worst .
taken as a whole , the 25 eu countries included in the study -lrb- all of the 27 eu member states except bulgaria and romania -rrb- scored an overall average of 53 percent .
generally , the study found that eu countries are good at helping immigrants become long-term residents , but do not make it easy for them to become full-fledged citizens .
the study 's authors said they did not want to engage in a " name and shame " exercise and instead called on national governments to use their findings as an instrument to guide their future integration policies .

while experts , representatives of social organizations , parliamentarians and politicians spent two days frankly speaking their minds to one another during the annual " st. petersburg dialogue , " there were conciliatory noises and the invocation of common values and partnership at the highest level .
the fact that german chancellor angela merkel and russian president vladimir putin have a good and trusting relationship might speak for their pragmatism - but it does not tell us anything about whether russian-german relations are generally good and based on trust .
merkel and putin worked their way through their agenda in a business-like manner , emphasizing , in a familiar fashion , the themes of business , trade and innovation as the most unproblematic areas , as the " heart " of russian-german relations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cornelia rabitz controversial issues , such as iran , kosovo and the russia 's democratic deficits , remained on the agenda but were skated around .
no breakthrough was to be expected in wiesbaden .
nevertheless , it still seems strange that obvious differences were played down - or rather ignored - to such an extent .
the rumors that an assassination attempt was allegedly being planned on putin in tehran and the talk about a possible cancellation of his trip to iran immediately after the russian-german summit only served to contribute to the confusion .
it also demonstrated that this summit was surrounded by an air of ambivalence from a lack of openness .
the term " strategic partnership " that angela merkel so enjoys using has become hackneyed and devoid of meaning .
putin 's repeated assertions that no one has anything to fear from russia do n't ring true .
anyone who follows the public debates and those of the german and russian elites , or who takes a look at opinion polls and the media in russia , gets a completely different picture .
russia 's relations to the west appear to be malfunctioning on many different levels .
some people have even been talking about fresh confrontation and a conflict of values and interests .
mutual recriminations , critique and frosty irritation are the name of the game .
it is clearly understandable that a german chancellor would not want to add fuel to the fire .
and her russian counterpart is a master at placating and whitewashing .
it is election time in russia , even if it is difficult to use the word " election " in this case .
the beaming victor has been clear for a long time .
his name is vladimir putin and he will continue to determine the fate of this big country , although it is not yet clear in exactly what function or in what way .
but the retention of power is definitely on the agenda , and he wo n't shy away from getting involved in shady maneuvers to secure it .
putin 's renewed emphasis in wiesbaden upon his allegiance to the constitution is just a matter of lip service .
putin is set to remain angela merkel 's discussion partner .
that may ultimately be the reason why the chancellor placed so much weight upon finding common ground .
after all , they will have to continue working together .
we are left with the message that the foundations are sound and everything else can be sorted out .
or in other words : let 's approach this in a more relaxed , less excitable manner .
maybe that is not such a bad idea .
it means , at least , that the desire for change in russia remains on the table . cornelia rabitz heads dw-radio 's russian service -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

16 , presented a unique study on the social environments of migrants in germany that they say will help improve the situation . the study is the first of its kind worldwide because it focuses on the current social environments of migrants rather than their backgrounds , said deputy family minister gerd hoofe , who presented the report on tuesday .
while factors such as ethnicity , religion and migration history do play a role for migrants , their current social environments are much more important in term of people 's identity , hoofe said .
the report is based on 104 extensive interviews and has distinguished eight migrant social environments , ranging from " religiously rooted " and based on conservative , strict moral values to " intellectual cosmopolitan " environments with an open-minded , tolerant attitude .
while hoofe said that detailed results of the study will not be ready until next summer , he added that the report " does away with negative cliches about migrants that exist in this country . "
" migrants are definitely ready to integrate , but they also do not want to forget their roots , " he said , adding that the level of education and urbanity played a role as well .
bodo flaig , a psychologist in charge of the study , added that the new research definitely showed that migrants ' lives were not dominated by religion .
merkel : migrant kids neglected in schools bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has received poor marks for the opportunities on offer children of non-german origin german chancellor angela merkel meanwhile said tuesday that germany had to take steps to make educational success less dependent on social backgrounds .
" we can not neglect a single talent , " the chancellor said during a conference on integration and education in berlin , adding that children of migrant families were particularly disadvantaged in germany .
according to the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- , the german school system ranks last among those of 17 industrialized nations when it comes to supporting migrant children .
germany 's mediocre integration policies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an annual integration summit is designed to promote dialogue on a european level , germany ranks in mid-field when it comes to integrating foreign workers , according to a study released on monday .
it came in at no. 14 out of 28 countries studied for the migration integration policy index -lrb- mpiex -rrb- .
sweden was found to be the best at helping immigrants feel welcome , while latvia scored the worst .
taken as a whole , the 25 eu countries included in the study -lrb- all of the 27 eu member states except bulgaria and romania -rrb- scored an overall average of 53 percent .
generally , the study found that eu countries are good at helping immigrants become long-term residents , but do not make it easy for them to become full-fledged citizens .
the study 's authors said they did not want to engage in a " name and shame " exercise and instead called on national governments to use their findings as an instrument to guide their future integration policies .

the £ 16bn crossrail plan was approved by the prime minister last week .
it will run from maidenhead , berkshire , through to essex , but the superlink group wants it to start in reading and terminate at stansted airport .
crossrail said superlink 's proposals had been analysed by experts before the route was finalised .
construction of the route is expected to start in 2010 with trains running from about 2017 .
it will provide 24 trains an hour into the heart of london from the east and west , improving rail links to the west end , the city and docklands .
the proposed new line would also have spurs off to heathrow and to south london .
but among changes superlink would like to see are an extension as far west as reading in berkshire , a link to heathrow 's new terminal 5 , and a branch line from canary wharf in east london to cambridge via stansted airport .
the group also wants to see extensions taking in woking and guildford in surrey , basingstoke in hampshire , as well as links to barking and tilbury in essex .
superlink chairman john prideaux - a former british rail intercity boss - said : " we remain concerned that so much money is being spent on a rail scheme that does so little for so few .
" extending crossrail to basingstoke , milton keynes , reading , stansted , cambridge , ipswich and southend would add about £ 3bn to the cost but would be more than self-financing - generating much greater passenger revenues . "
crossrail 's lasting ' legacy ' crossrail splits fans and foes a crossrail spokeswoman said superlink had promoted several alternatives to crossrail for many years including the longer-distance " regional " services .
she said : " compared to the crossrail scheme superlink 's concept would be considerably more expensive , entail major environmental difficulties , offer fewer regeneration benefits and present considerable operational difficulties .
" it offers limited congestion relief to the most crowded sections of the existing underground network .
" it was partly on this basis that the crossrail scheme was submitted to parliament in the crossrail bill in 2005 and it is this scheme that is now being taken forward , with full funding and full government support . "
the government is providing a third of the money with the rest made up from borrowing against future fares and a levy on london business rates .

the £ 16bn crossrail plan was approved by the prime minister last week .
it will run from maidenhead , berkshire , through to essex , but the superlink group wants it to start in reading and terminate at stansted airport .
crossrail said superlink 's proposals had been analysed by experts before the route was finalised .
construction of the route is expected to start in 2010 with trains running from about 2017 .
it will provide 24 trains an hour into the heart of london from the east and west , improving rail links to the west end , the city and docklands .
see details of crossrail route through central london enlarge map the proposed new line would also have spurs off to heathrow and to south london .
but among changes superlink would like to see are an extension as far west as reading in berkshire , a link to heathrow 's new terminal 5 , and a branch line from canary wharf in east london to cambridge via stansted airport .
the group also wants to see extensions taking in woking and guildford in surrey , basingstoke in hampshire , as well as links to barking and tilbury in essex .
superlink chairman john prideaux - a former british rail intercity boss - said : " we remain concerned that so much money is being spent on a rail scheme that does so little for so few .
" extending crossrail to basingstoke , milton keynes , reading , stansted , cambridge , ipswich and southend would add about £ 3bn to the cost but would be more than self-financing - generating much greater passenger revenues . "
crossrail 's lasting ' legacy ' crossrail splits fans and foes a crossrail spokeswoman said superlink had promoted several alternatives to crossrail for many years including the longer-distance " regional " services .
she said : " compared to the crossrail scheme superlink 's concept would be considerably more expensive , entail major environmental difficulties , offer fewer regeneration benefits and present considerable operational difficulties .
" it offers limited congestion relief to the most crowded sections of the existing underground network .
" it was partly on this basis that the crossrail scheme was submitted to parliament in the crossrail bill in 2005 and it is this scheme that is now being taken forward , with full funding and full government support . "
the government is providing a third of the money with the rest made up from borrowing against future fares and a levy on london business rates .

an economic strategy drawn up by cardiff council says the capital should be competing with successful european cities like dublin and prague by 2012 .
it aims to establish the city as an international business location and build on its reputation for quality of life and sporting and cultural events .
but the report stresses cardiff must improve transport systems to succeed .
have your say it has a world class stadium . the city needs a bit of a tidy up , and some decent advertising .
ifancyapint your comments on cardiff mark stephens , cardiff council 's executive member for economic development and finance , said : " the strategy provides a platform to move cardiff forward on many fronts and sets out a long term vision for the city .
" it will enable us to position cardiff as a competitive european capital city . "
the report - competitive capital - says current developments in the city , including the st david 's 2 shopping centre , the new cardiff city stadium and the sports village in cardiff bay , will bring future investment to the capital and its surrounding regions .
it identifies opportunities for the city over the next five years , including events such as the ashes test in 2009 and the ryder cup in 2010 .
the report also says there is an opportunity too for a second phase of regeneration in cardiff bay .
" as the waterfront matures , it is important to provide a continued programme of action to ensure the bay further develops as a vibrant business and leisure destination , " it says .
according to the report , cardiff experienced the highest percentage increase in total employment of any of the uk core cities , such as liverpool and manchester , with an increase of 26.9 % between 1998 and 2004 .
city challenges to increase the competitiveness of cardiff as a leading international capital city to become a widely recognised international business location that encourages growth and innovation in thriving sectors to create a highly skilled and qualified workforce to tackle deprivation and regenerating local communities to ensure that cardiff has a modern , world-class transport infrastructure to build on cardiff 's reputation as a " quality of life " city source : competitive capital , the cardiff economic strategy 2007-2012 from cardiff council it also says it has a highly skilled workforce which outperforms the national average .
the city 's size - " small and compact in design " - is also a plus point , with the report noting that " there is growing evidence of the future will be the smaller cities - those with human scale and a closer relationship to the natural environment " .
expansions but the report highlights a number of problems the city must overcome to reach its full potential .
these include a shortage of office space and the absence of an international business park , although there are hopes this could be addressed by 2012 .
one of the main problems identified is the " polarisation of skills " between cardiff and the south wales valleys which needs to be addressed .
however , it says as many households in the capital are living below the poverty line than in merthyr and blaenau gwent put together .
deprivation the reduction of this deprivation , particularly in inner city areas like butetown , grangetown and riverside , is a " critical factor " in cardiff 's future success , the report concluded .
deprivation in butetown must be addressed , the report says the report also says that with 70,000 commuters to the city , and traffic growing at 2.5 % year , cardiff is facing " considerable pressure " on the existing road network and public transport .
an over-reliance on the private car and associated heavy commuting between the valleys and coastal belt has added to growing pressure on the city 's transport infrastructure , it stated .
the city needs to develop an efficient integrated public transport and " real alternatives " to the car by 2012 , but is " facing huge challenges , " the report said .
russell goodway , the former leader of cardiff council and current chief executive of the city 's chamber of commerce , said transport was the key to ensuring the capital continues to improve .
" we can build a superlative capital but it needs to spread out to the regions , " he said .
" there 's some antagonism towards cardiff as they -lsb- the regions -rsb- see it getting everything .
we need to ensure they feel part of that success and that they benefit from that success .
that 's what a capital city does .
improving transport is the way to do that . "
the report also raises concern at links to cardiff international airport , with " under-utilisation and under-capacity " needing to be addressed .
the report pulls together various studies , including a review of the city 's economic competitiveness by professor michael parkinson , of the european institute of urban affairs .

an economic strategy drawn up by cardiff council says the capital should be competing with successful european cities like dublin and prague by 2012 .
it aims to establish the city as an international business location and build on its reputation for quality of life and sporting and cultural events .
but the report stresses cardiff must improve transport systems to succeed .
have your say " it has a world class stadium . the city needs a bit of a tidy up , and some decent advertising . "
ifancyapint your comments on cardiff mark stephens , cardiff council 's executive member for economic development and finance , said : " the strategy provides a platform to move cardiff forward on many fronts and sets out a long term vision for the city .
" it will enable us to position cardiff as a competitive european capital city . "
the report - competitive capital - says current developments in the city , including the st david 's 2 shopping centre , the new cardiff city stadium and the sports village in cardiff bay , will bring future investment to the capital and its surrounding regions .
it identifies opportunities for the city over the next five years , including events such as the ashes test in 2009 and the ryder cup in 2010 .
the report also says there is an opportunity too for a second phase of regeneration in cardiff bay .
" as the waterfront matures , it is important to provide a continued programme of action to ensure the bay further develops as a vibrant business and leisure destination , " it says .
according to the report , cardiff experienced the highest percentage increase in total employment of any of the uk core cities , such as liverpool and manchester , with an increase of 26.9 % between 1998 and 2004 .
city challenges to increase the competitiveness of cardiff as a leading international capital city to become a widely recognised international business location that encourages growth and innovation in thriving sectors to create a highly skilled and qualified workforce to tackle deprivation and regenerating local communities to ensure that cardiff has a modern , world-class transport infrastructure to build on cardiff 's reputation as a " quality of life " city source : competitive capital , the cardiff economic strategy 2007-2012 from cardiff council it also says it has a highly skilled workforce which outperforms the national average .
the city 's size - " small and compact in design " - is also a plus point , with the report noting that " there is growing evidence of the future will be the smaller cities - those with human scale and a closer relationship to the natural environment " .
expansions but the report highlights a number of problems the city must overcome to reach its full potential .
these include a shortage of office space and the absence of an international business park , although there are hopes this could be addressed by 2012 .
one of the main problems identified is the " polarisation of skills " between cardiff and the south wales valleys which needs to be addressed .
however , it says as many households in the capital are living below the poverty line than in merthyr and blaenau gwent put together .
deprivation the reduction of this deprivation , particularly in inner city areas like butetown , grangetown and riverside , is a " critical factor " in cardiff 's future success , the report concluded .
the report also says that with 70,000 commuters to the city , and traffic growing at 2.5 % year , cardiff is facing " considerable pressure " on the existing road network and public transport .
an over-reliance on the private car and associated heavy commuting between the valleys and coastal belt has added to growing pressure on the city 's transport infrastructure , it stated .
the city needs to develop an efficient integrated public transport and " real alternatives " to the car by 2012 , but is " facing huge challenges , " the report said .
russell goodway , the former leader of cardiff council and current chief executive of the city 's chamber of commerce , said transport was the key to ensuring the capital continues to improve .
" we can build a superlative capital but it needs to spread out to the regions , " he said .
" there 's some antagonism towards cardiff as they -lsb- the regions -rsb- see it getting everything .
we need to ensure they feel part of that success and that they benefit from that success .
that 's what a capital city does .
improving transport is the way to do that . "
the report also raises concern at links to cardiff international airport , with " under-utilisation and under-capacity " needing to be addressed .
the report pulls together various studies , including a review of the city 's economic competitiveness by professor michael parkinson , of the european institute of urban affairs .

a club spokesman said : " the club is extremely hopeful that a deal with either the portuguese or another third party will go through any day now . "
' new reality ' " best holdings -lsb- the portuguese consortium -rsb- continue to assert that they are interested in completing the deal and the club would be delighted if they did so , " he added .
" however , the club has considered it prudent to commence discussions with other interested parties . "
mr davis said : " we were told in august that the consortium had taken over .
" people had reservations but accepted it as the new reality .
" then we were told it was not quite done and now it appears to have fallen apart .
" the board and the -lsb- portuguese representative -rsb- say it has not .
i am happy to be proved wrong . "
at the open forum , held on monday , fans voted to protest at the weekend 's game .
last week , some 150 fans protested at the club 's home game against cheltenham town .
the club still owes about £ 900,000 to creditors .

the aim of the vanco arctic survey is to establish how long a year-round ice cap at the north pole will continue .

the actress , who joined the cast in 2005 , dreads the thought of being killed off - but fantasises about how she would go .
q : can you describe your character and what the role is in the series ?
a : i play jo portman , whose full title is the junior officer in the field office .
i was recruited two years ago in the middle of series four .
she 's sort of come up through the ranks gradually since joining from being a reporter .
now she 's much tougher , particularly in this series .
she 's much more in the thick of it , right in the action this time too .
q : do you like playing her ?
a : i love playing her !
she 's a really fun character who has developed so much since i got the role .
q : did you have to do any research for the role ?
a : i think the producers discreetly met members of mi5 and other people who were quite keen to talk to them .
we were given literature and stories and a history of honey traps .
we 've had weapons training too .
q : you joined spooks in 2005 - what was it like working on an already established show ?
a : the cast were brilliant .
at the time there was a girl who was playing adam 's wife fiona and i 'd been to drama school with her .
that made it much easier to join .
peter firth has played harry from the first series peter firth is a kind of a daddy .
he 's had such an extraordinary career .
he 's been nominated for an oscar .
there are no egos around him because if anyone was going to have an ego it would be him , and he does n't .
everything is quite down to earth and there 's lots of joking on set .
we 're always mucking about .
q : can you give us any hints or teases as to what we can expect in the new series ?
a : well as far as jo is concerned she gets a little bit of loving this series .
there is a new character , who is played by gemma jones and she 's absolutely brilliant .
she plays connie who 's a tough ex-mi5 officer who is re-recruited by harry .
she plays it so well .
q : did you do your own stunts ?
a : yes - apart from one moment in episode four where there was a double used .
that was more of an insurance thing than anything else .
i prefer doing fights with stunt people because they always know exactly what they 're doing and they 're a lot safer .
gemma jones joins spooks as connie , a retired mi5 officer sometimes when you 're with actors they get a bit nervous and maybe overstep a mark by a couple of inches and you do get clocked occasionally .
q : did you get hurt ?
a : i did , i had three weeks off filming because i was hurt in a sequence which was part of episode six .
i tripped on a step and i hit my face on a metal door which was locked .
i had six stitches and my eye really swelled up .
i had quite an impressive black eye that went from above my eyebrow to half way down my neck .
there was quite a lot of swelling afterwards so there was lots of make up and they had to film my left side quite a lot .
so that was quite horrible and it was all on camera too .
q : main characters in spooks always seem to meet gruesome endings after a couple of series - are you worried about what the future holds for you ?
a : always - it 's not quite as bad as reading the scripts and wondering if it 's you going to be you next .
i 've heard that you get a call from a producer saying " can i come over ? "
you can pretty much guarantee that it 's not going not be good news .
i 'll just try and stay friends with everybody and suck up .
q : as an actress is it hard not to take that personally ?
a : very hard i think so .
of course you think it 's that because you have n't had a good response from the public .
you imagine the sort of conversations that have gone on .
if people leave because they 're going on to do other things then of course the dynamic of the whole team has to change .
it must be quite difficult though , it is hard on the ego to be told we 're not having you back .
q : how would you like to be killed off ?
a : it would have to be dramatic .
saving the world .
it would be jumping in the way of some bullet that 's about to clock harry or adam , and jo just manages to leap in the way of it .
then she has a brilliant dying speech which would make another director see it and go , " wow i 've got to have her in this movie " .
nobody wants to go in a boring way .
i think it 's a bit of an insult if you do .
there was one character that was written out and they just said " oh , she 's under sedation " or something and that was it .
you do n't want to be that person .
spooks airs on tuesdays at 2100 on bbc one .
miranda raison was talking to bbc news entertainment reporter fiona pryor .
