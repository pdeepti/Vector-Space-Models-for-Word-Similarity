he deserves respect and acknowledgement for doing so .
a primate stanislaw wielgus would have harmed the credibility of the roman church and would have become a serious burden . he would have been compared with the former primate stefan wyszynski , who was jailed by communists for years ; wielgus would have been compared to pope john paul ii , who always stood up to the totalitarian dictatorship with courage .
considering this , wielgus did the right thing - even if he took his time . what 's known so far shows that wielgus never was a secret police agent within the church , but - rather - a cleric , who was forced to cooperate with the secret police .
no one should use this case to reinterpret historical facts : the churches in eastern europe where victims , not perpetrators , during the cold war .
that 's true for catholic , protestant and orthodox churches . in the stalinist soviet union alone , hundreds of thousands of pastors , bishops , monks , nuns and simple church members were murdered , jailed and tortured simply because of their faith .
kgb members were the so-called executive organs during the largest persecution of churches in history .
it 's understandable that church representatives in the former eastern bloc gave in to the pressure of secret police until 1991 .
only a few are born to be heroes . by now , communism is history and churches look to the future .
they have a future .
they have an important , ethical role in building a democratic civil society .
they could - and should - be a moral compass for all those , who are looking for spiritual orientation following the fall of socialism . the churches will only meet this challenge , if they apply the highest moral standards for themselves .
to put it bluntly : anyone , who - like archbishop wielgus - has obviously cooperated with the secret police , must not occupy a higher office in church hierarchy . for the new eu members bulgaria and romania , that also means that bishops , who will soon choose the respective patriarchs , should pick someone , who comes with a clean background .
the same is true for other countries in eastern and southeastern europe , such as serbia . in russia , an increasing number of top positions in state and society are filled with former secret service members .

he deserves respect and acknowledgement for doing so .
a primate stanislaw wielgus would have harmed the credibility of the roman church and would have become a serious burden . he would have been compared with the former primate stefan wyszynski , who was jailed by communists for years ; wielgus would have been compared to pope john paul ii , who always stood up to the totalitarian dictatorship with courage .
considering this , wielgus did the right thing - even if he took his time . what 's known so far shows that wielgus never was a secret police agent within the church , but - rather - a cleric , who was forced to cooperate with the secret police .
no one should use this case to reinterpret historical facts : the churches in eastern europe where victims , not perpetrators , during the cold war .
that 's true for catholic , protestant and orthodox churches . in the stalinist soviet union alone , hundreds of thousands of pastors , bishops , monks , nuns and simple church members were murdered , jailed and tortured simply because of their faith .
kgb members were the so-called executive organs during the largest persecution of churches in history .
it 's understandable that church representatives in the former eastern bloc gave in to the pressure of secret police until 1991 .
only a few are born to be heroes . by now , communism is history and churches look to the future .
they have a future .
they have an important , ethical role in building a democratic civil society .
they could - and should - be a moral compass for all those , who are looking for spiritual orientation following the fall of socialism . the churches will only meet this challenge , if they apply the highest moral standards for themselves .
to put it bluntly : anyone , who - like archbishop wielgus - has obviously cooperated with the secret police , must not occupy a higher office in church hierarchy . for the new eu members bulgaria and romania , that also means that bishops , who will soon choose the respective patriarchs , should pick someone , who comes with a clean background .
the same is true for other countries in eastern and southeastern europe , such as serbia . in russia , an increasing number of top positions in state and society are filled with former secret service members .
instead of being ashamed of their dark past , they flaunt it and cozy up to the church in front of tv cameras .

in pravetz , the hometown of bulgaria 's former communist dictator todor zhivkov , residents are only half-heartedly welcoming the change . joining the eu is , after all , seen as the last nail in the coffin of a communist system that at least provided jobs .
in the town cafe , a bunch of youngsters said they are sceptical and not cheering over the eu accession as " prices will rise but salaries will not .
" during zhivkov 's time , my parents had jobs and we went to the seaside every summer , " said 16-year-old lyubomir dyakov , who lives in pravetz with his grandmother .
" now my mother is a waitress in bahrain and my father is a driver in france .
i will also leave bulgaria as soon as i finish my tourism studies . "
a european town ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zhivkov was the town 's most famous resident pravetz celebrated eu accession along with the coming of the new year on its central square , which is named for zhivkov , who fell from power along with communism in 1989 after ruling for 35 years .
at the town 's entrance , an overhead banner framed by bulgarian and european flags reads : " pravetz , a european town . "
" we are awaiting the eu accession with enthusiasm and hopes for a better life for us and the young , " pravetz mayor krasimir zhivkov , who is also a distant relative of the dictator , said before the new year .
" european funds will help develop the infrastructure , " he added , praising his town 's future as " a tourist destination and an educational center . "
a us university correspondence program in business administration is already functioning in this small town west of sofia .
convicted for embezzlement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu accession was greeted with a big party on sofia 's main square formerly a small village , stuck at the foot of the balkan mountains and at one point with no sewage facilities or electricity , pravetz blossomed after zhivkov 's rise to power in 1954 and was officially declared a town in 1981 .
the town 's microprocessor plant once shipped its eight-megabyte " pravetz " computers to the whole soviet bloc .
now the plant is closed after a series of unsuccessful privatizations .
after being ousted in 1989 , zhivkov was arrested and brought to court for embezzlement of government funds .
but he was never prosecuted since bulgaria 's constitution rules that a former head of state can only be tried for treason .
the man who was moscow 's staunchest ally spent the last years of his life under house arrest in his daughter 's suburban villa outside sofia .
he died in 1998 .
moving away now the dictator 's modest home in pravetz has become a museum and his statue stands in the town 's public gardens .
pravetz suffered when communist money stopped pouring in but it is now recovering thanks to investment by former communist faithful turned businessmen .
still , a quarter of pravetz ' 5,000 residents have moved abroad , seeking jobs in italy and spain .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 07.01.2007 opinion : the burden of the past großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland 's stanlislaw wielgus did the right thing sunday when he declined to take up a new post as warsaw 's archbishop after admitting that he cooperated with the communist secret police , says dw 's miodrag soric . poland 's catholic church , the former bastion against the totalitarian , communist dictatorship , has been thrown into a deep crisis because of this case : one of her highest dignitaries , who was nearly consecrated as primate on sunday , has obviously collaborated with the former communist secret police . bildunterschrift : archbishop stanslaw wielgus stepped down immediately before taking office , giving up the designated post as poland 's highest-ranking cleric after weeks of public pressure and new revelations .
he deserves respect and acknowledgement for doing so .
a primate stanislaw wielgus would have harmed the credibility of the roman church and would have become a serious burden . he would have been compared with the former primate stefan wyszynski , who was jailed by communists for years ; wielgus would have been compared to pope john paul ii , who always stood up to the totalitarian dictatorship with courage .
considering this , wielgus did the right thing - even if he took his time . what 's known so far shows that wielgus never was a secret police agent within the church , but - rather - a cleric , who was forced to cooperate with the secret police .
no one should use this case to reinterpret historical facts : the churches in eastern europe where victims , not perpetrators , during the cold war .
that 's true for catholic , protestant and orthodox churches . in the stalinist soviet union alone , hundreds of thousands of pastors , bishops , monks , nuns and simple church members were murdered , jailed and tortured simply because of their faith .
kgb members were the so-called executive organs during the largest persecution of churches in history .
it 's understandable that church representatives in the former eastern bloc gave in to the pressure of secret police until 1991 .
only a few are born to be heroes . by now , communism is history and churches look to the future .
they have a future .
they have an important , ethical role in building a democratic civil society .
they could - and should - be a moral compass for all those , who are looking for spiritual orientation following the fall of socialism . the churches will only meet this challenge , if they apply the highest moral standards for themselves .
to put it bluntly : anyone , who - like archbishop wielgus - has obviously cooperated with the secret police , must not occupy a higher office in church hierarchy . for the new eu members bulgaria and romania , that also means that bishops , who will soon choose the respective patriarchs , should pick someone , who comes with a clean background .
the same is true for other countries in eastern and southeastern europe , such as serbia . in russia , an increasing number of top positions in state and society are filled with former secret service members .
instead of being ashamed of their dark past , they flaunt it and cozy up to the church in front of tv cameras .
jesus christ already warned about the wolf in sheep 's clothing .
the bishops in moscow should n't forget the words of this good shepherd . miodrag soric is dw-radio 's editor-in-chief -lrb- win -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de former eastern bloc clergy grapple with communist legacy after east germany , hungary and the czech republic , poland is the latest country from the former eastern european bloc to confront revelations that some of its clergy collaborated with communists .

in pravetz , the hometown of bulgaria 's former communist dictator todor zhivkov , residents are only half-heartedly welcoming the change . joining the eu is , after all , seen as the last nail in the coffin of a communist system that at least provided jobs .
in the town cafe , a bunch of youngsters said they are sceptical and not cheering over the eu accession as " prices will rise but salaries will not .
" during zhivkov 's time , my parents had jobs and we went to the seaside every summer , " said 16-year-old lyubomir dyakov , who lives in pravetz with his grandmother .
" now my mother is a waitress in bahrain and my father is a driver in france .
i will also leave bulgaria as soon as i finish my tourism studies . "

at the town 's entrance , an overhead banner framed by bulgarian and european flags reads : " pravetz , a european town . "
" we are awaiting the eu accession with enthusiasm and hopes for a better life for us and the young , " pravetz mayor krasimir zhivkov , who is also a distant relative of the dictator , said before the new year .

the town 's microprocessor plant once shipped its eight-megabyte " pravetz " computers to the whole soviet bloc .
now the plant is closed after a series of unsuccessful privatizations .
after being ousted in 1989 , zhivkov was arrested and brought to court for embezzlement of government funds .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de education -pipe- 07.01.2007 joint university brings german know-how to oman großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : university students in the halls of learning in muscat , oman 's capital oman 's strong demand for higher learning in the sciences has led to a collaboration with a german technical college to establish the first joint university in the sultanate . in a major boost for german-omani relations , an agreement to establish the first joint university in muscat , the capital of the sultanate , was recently sealed .
the oman german university of technology -lrb- og tech -rrb- , which plans to open in september , is a collaborative effort between a group of private omani investors , the sultanate 's educational ministry , and the rhine-westphalia technical college -lrb- rwth -rrb- in the western german city of aachen . aachen 's rwth is one of europe 's oldest and most prestigious educational institutions .
the degrees conferred by og tech will be recognized in the european union , providing its graduates with a wide range of options . ogtech was the brainchild of michael jansen , a professor at rwth , who was conducting a study on urban planning and archaelogy in the medieval port city al baleed during his first visit to the sultanate 11 years ago .
from there , he drew on the inspiration to set up a partnership with sultan qaboos university . strong demand for technology and science bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german universities are reknowned for their technical know-how " it all started with a research project , supported by unesco , and then evolved into what college instructors traditionally do , which is to seek cooperation with another university , " said jansen , who spearheaded an academic exchange program that enabled german and oman students to study in each other 's countries .
" after that , it snowballed into the idea of establishing a separate university . " there is a strong demand for higher learning in technical subjects in oman , so the partnership with rwth to transfer technical know-how to an independent institution financed by private investors was a good fit , according to jansen . the aachen institution is internationally renowned for its research strengths and collaboration with various european universities , such as the imperial college in london and the paris institute for technology . bachelor of science programs on offer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oman lacks research-oriented programs leading to an advanced degree after many years in the planning stages , christoph hilgers , who is project manager of og tech , established an academic curriculum that was approved by the omani educational ministry .
next year the university will offer bachelor of science programs in mechanical engineering , applied geosciences , information technology , regional management and tourism , as well as urban design and planning , in conjunction with a pre-university program equivalent to the german high school diploma that will be launched in september with an initial enrollment of 360 students . " the main focus is on the quality of education , not on the quantity and breadth of offerings , which means operating on a smaller scale , at least initially , " hilgers said . the teaching staff and professors will be selected by aachen 's rwth with the language of instruction being english .
considering the demand for a premium education in the sultanate , jansen added that he wants to set a high standard for oman and the gulf region . programs leading to an advanced degree " there are plenty of universities that offer the bachelor 's program , " jansen said .
" what has been lacking in oman , even at the sultan qaboos university , is research-oriented approach in higher education that leads to an advanced degree .
oman is also well situated for being the center of research geographically , with iran , india and the arabian peninsula at its periphery . " in 2009 master and doctorate programs will be added to the curriculum , and by 2012 an enrolment of 2,100 students is planned , with an expansion at a later stage of up to 15,000 envisaged . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany chooses munich , karlsruhe as elite universities germany 's three best , most promising universities are all located in the country 's south , a panel of experts has determined .

in pravetz , the hometown of bulgaria 's former communist dictator todor zhivkov , residents are only half-heartedly welcoming the change . joining the eu is , after all , seen as the last nail in the coffin of a communist system that at least provided jobs .
in the town cafe , a bunch of youngsters said they are sceptical and not cheering over the eu accession as " prices will rise but salaries will not .
" during zhivkov 's time , my parents had jobs and we went to the seaside every summer , " said 16-year-old lyubomir dyakov , who lives in pravetz with his grandmother .
" now my mother is a waitress in bahrain and my father is a driver in france .
i will also leave bulgaria as soon as i finish my tourism studies . "
a european town ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zhivkov was the town 's most famous resident pravetz celebrated eu accession along with the coming of the new year on its central square , which is named for zhivkov , who fell from power along with communism in 1989 after ruling for 35 years .
at the town 's entrance , an overhead banner framed by bulgarian and european flags reads : " pravetz , a european town . "
" we are awaiting the eu accession with enthusiasm and hopes for a better life for us and the young , " pravetz mayor krasimir zhivkov , who is also a distant relative of the dictator , said before the new year .

the town 's microprocessor plant once shipped its eight-megabyte " pravetz " computers to the whole soviet bloc .
now the plant is closed after a series of unsuccessful privatizations .
after being ousted in 1989 , zhivkov was arrested and brought to court for embezzlement of government funds .
but he was never prosecuted since bulgaria 's constitution rules that a former head of state can only be tried for treason .
the man who was moscow 's staunchest ally spent the last years of his life under house arrest in his daughter 's suburban villa outside sofia .
he died in 1998 .
moving away now the dictator 's modest home in pravetz has become a museum and his statue stands in the town 's public gardens .
pravetz suffered when communist money stopped pouring in but it is now recovering thanks to investment by former communist faithful turned businessmen .

he deserves respect and acknowledgement for doing so .
a primate stanislaw wielgus would have harmed the credibility of the roman church and would have become a serious burden . he would have been compared with the former primate stefan wyszynski , who was jailed by communists for years ; wielgus would have been compared to pope john paul ii , who always stood up to the totalitarian dictatorship with courage .
considering this , wielgus did the right thing - even if he took his time . what 's known so far shows that wielgus never was a secret police agent within the church , but - rather - a cleric , who was forced to cooperate with the secret police .
no one should use this case to reinterpret historical facts : the churches in eastern europe where victims , not perpetrators , during the cold war .
that 's true for catholic , protestant and orthodox churches . in the stalinist soviet union alone , hundreds of thousands of pastors , bishops , monks , nuns and simple church members were murdered , jailed and tortured simply because of their faith .
kgb members were the so-called executive organs during the largest persecution of churches in history .
it 's understandable that church representatives in the former eastern bloc gave in to the pressure of secret police until 1991 .
only a few are born to be heroes . by now , communism is history and churches look to the future .
they have a future .
they have an important , ethical role in building a democratic civil society .
they could - and should - be a moral compass for all those , who are looking for spiritual orientation following the fall of socialism . the churches will only meet this challenge , if they apply the highest moral standards for themselves .
to put it bluntly : anyone , who - like archbishop wielgus - has obviously cooperated with the secret police , must not occupy a higher office in church hierarchy . for the new eu members bulgaria and romania , that also means that bishops , who will soon choose the respective patriarchs , should pick someone , who comes with a clean background .
the same is true for other countries in eastern and southeastern europe , such as serbia . in russia , an increasing number of top positions in state and society are filled with former secret service members .

he deserves respect and acknowledgement for doing so .
a primate stanislaw wielgus would have harmed the credibility of the roman church and would have become a serious burden . he would have been compared with the former primate stefan wyszynski , who was jailed by communists for years ; wielgus would have been compared to pope john paul ii , who always stood up to the totalitarian dictatorship with courage .
considering this , wielgus did the right thing - even if he took his time . what 's known so far shows that wielgus never was a secret police agent within the church , but - rather - a cleric , who was forced to cooperate with the secret police .
no one should use this case to reinterpret historical facts : the churches in eastern europe where victims , not perpetrators , during the cold war .
that 's true for catholic , protestant and orthodox churches . in the stalinist soviet union alone , hundreds of thousands of pastors , bishops , monks , nuns and simple church members were murdered , jailed and tortured simply because of their faith .
kgb members were the so-called executive organs during the largest persecution of churches in history .

in pravetz , the hometown of bulgaria 's former communist dictator todor zhivkov , residents are only half-heartedly welcoming the change . joining the eu is , after all , seen as the last nail in the coffin of a communist system that at least provided jobs .
in the town cafe , a bunch of youngsters said they are sceptical and not cheering over the eu accession as " prices will rise but salaries will not .
" during zhivkov 's time , my parents had jobs and we went to the seaside every summer , " said 16-year-old lyubomir dyakov , who lives in pravetz with his grandmother .
" now my mother is a waitress in bahrain and my father is a driver in france .
i will also leave bulgaria as soon as i finish my tourism studies . "
a european town ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zhivkov was the town 's most famous resident pravetz celebrated eu accession along with the coming of the new year on its central square , which is named for zhivkov , who fell from power along with communism in 1989 after ruling for 35 years .
at the town 's entrance , an overhead banner framed by bulgarian and european flags reads : " pravetz , a european town . "
" we are awaiting the eu accession with enthusiasm and hopes for a better life for us and the young , " pravetz mayor krasimir zhivkov , who is also a distant relative of the dictator , said before the new year .
" european funds will help develop the infrastructure , " he added , praising his town 's future as " a tourist destination and an educational center . "
a us university correspondence program in business administration is already functioning in this small town west of sofia .
convicted for embezzlement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu accession was greeted with a big party on sofia 's main square formerly a small village , stuck at the foot of the balkan mountains and at one point with no sewage facilities or electricity , pravetz blossomed after zhivkov 's rise to power in 1954 and was officially declared a town in 1981 .
the town 's microprocessor plant once shipped its eight-megabyte " pravetz " computers to the whole soviet bloc .
now the plant is closed after a series of unsuccessful privatizations .
after being ousted in 1989 , zhivkov was arrested and brought to court for embezzlement of government funds .
but he was never prosecuted since bulgaria 's constitution rules that a former head of state can only be tried for treason .
the man who was moscow 's staunchest ally spent the last years of his life under house arrest in his daughter 's suburban villa outside sofia .
he died in 1998 .
moving away now the dictator 's modest home in pravetz has become a museum and his statue stands in the town 's public gardens .
pravetz suffered when communist money stopped pouring in but it is now recovering thanks to investment by former communist faithful turned businessmen .
still , a quarter of pravetz ' 5,000 residents have moved abroad , seeking jobs in italy and spain .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bulgaria had to shut off its nuclear reactors before jan .
1 " unemployment chased away my two sisters who are now babysitters in italy , " said one town resident .
" i have seen what a european union country looks like - nothing to do with the bulgarian reality . "
" people there go grocery shopping for 200 euros -lrb- $ 262 -rrb- and not for two leva -lrb- one euro -rrb- like here , " said albena ivanova , a grocer whose monthly salary stands at 81 euros .
one of her clients complained she had to start a cleaning job after years as a communist administration secretary .
" there is no longer central heating in pravetz as nobody can pay for that , " she said .
" i now once again use my coal stove .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 07.01.2007 opinion : the burden of the past großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland 's stanlislaw wielgus did the right thing sunday when he declined to take up a new post as warsaw 's archbishop after admitting that he cooperated with the communist secret police , says dw 's miodrag soric . poland 's catholic church , the former bastion against the totalitarian , communist dictatorship , has been thrown into a deep crisis because of this case : one of her highest dignitaries , who was nearly consecrated as primate on sunday , has obviously collaborated with the former communist secret police . bildunterschrift : archbishop stanslaw wielgus stepped down immediately before taking office , giving up the designated post as poland 's highest-ranking cleric after weeks of public pressure and new revelations .
he deserves respect and acknowledgement for doing so .
a primate stanislaw wielgus would have harmed the credibility of the roman church and would have become a serious burden . he would have been compared with the former primate stefan wyszynski , who was jailed by communists for years ; wielgus would have been compared to pope john paul ii , who always stood up to the totalitarian dictatorship with courage .
considering this , wielgus did the right thing - even if he took his time . what 's known so far shows that wielgus never was a secret police agent within the church , but - rather - a cleric , who was forced to cooperate with the secret police .
no one should use this case to reinterpret historical facts : the churches in eastern europe where victims , not perpetrators , during the cold war .
that 's true for catholic , protestant and orthodox churches . in the stalinist soviet union alone , hundreds of thousands of pastors , bishops , monks , nuns and simple church members were murdered , jailed and tortured simply because of their faith .
kgb members were the so-called executive organs during the largest persecution of churches in history .
it 's understandable that church representatives in the former eastern bloc gave in to the pressure of secret police until 1991 .
only a few are born to be heroes . by now , communism is history and churches look to the future .
they have a future .
they have an important , ethical role in building a democratic civil society .
they could - and should - be a moral compass for all those , who are looking for spiritual orientation following the fall of socialism . the churches will only meet this challenge , if they apply the highest moral standards for themselves .
to put it bluntly : anyone , who - like archbishop wielgus - has obviously cooperated with the secret police , must not occupy a higher office in church hierarchy . for the new eu members bulgaria and romania , that also means that bishops , who will soon choose the respective patriarchs , should pick someone , who comes with a clean background .
the same is true for other countries in eastern and southeastern europe , such as serbia . in russia , an increasing number of top positions in state and society are filled with former secret service members .
instead of being ashamed of their dark past , they flaunt it and cozy up to the church in front of tv cameras .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de education -pipe- 07.01.2007 joint university brings german know-how to oman großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : university students in the halls of learning in muscat , oman 's capital oman 's strong demand for higher learning in the sciences has led to a collaboration with a german technical college to establish the first joint university in the sultanate . in a major boost for german-omani relations , an agreement to establish the first joint university in muscat , the capital of the sultanate , was recently sealed .
the oman german university of technology -lrb- og tech -rrb- , which plans to open in september , is a collaborative effort between a group of private omani investors , the sultanate 's educational ministry , and the rhine-westphalia technical college -lrb- rwth -rrb- in the western german city of aachen . aachen 's rwth is one of europe 's oldest and most prestigious educational institutions .
the degrees conferred by og tech will be recognized in the european union , providing its graduates with a wide range of options . ogtech was the brainchild of michael jansen , a professor at rwth , who was conducting a study on urban planning and archaelogy in the medieval port city al baleed during his first visit to the sultanate 11 years ago .
from there , he drew on the inspiration to set up a partnership with sultan qaboos university . strong demand for technology and science bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german universities are reknowned for their technical know-how " it all started with a research project , supported by unesco , and then evolved into what college instructors traditionally do , which is to seek cooperation with another university , " said jansen , who spearheaded an academic exchange program that enabled german and oman students to study in each other 's countries .
" after that , it snowballed into the idea of establishing a separate university . " there is a strong demand for higher learning in technical subjects in oman , so the partnership with rwth to transfer technical know-how to an independent institution financed by private investors was a good fit , according to jansen . the aachen institution is internationally renowned for its research strengths and collaboration with various european universities , such as the imperial college in london and the paris institute for technology . bachelor of science programs on offer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oman lacks research-oriented programs leading to an advanced degree after many years in the planning stages , christoph hilgers , who is project manager of og tech , established an academic curriculum that was approved by the omani educational ministry .
next year the university will offer bachelor of science programs in mechanical engineering , applied geosciences , information technology , regional management and tourism , as well as urban design and planning , in conjunction with a pre-university program equivalent to the german high school diploma that will be launched in september with an initial enrollment of 360 students . " the main focus is on the quality of education , not on the quantity and breadth of offerings , which means operating on a smaller scale , at least initially , " hilgers said . the teaching staff and professors will be selected by aachen 's rwth with the language of instruction being english .
considering the demand for a premium education in the sultanate , jansen added that he wants to set a high standard for oman and the gulf region . programs leading to an advanced degree " there are plenty of universities that offer the bachelor 's program , " jansen said .
" what has been lacking in oman , even at the sultan qaboos university , is research-oriented approach in higher education that leads to an advanced degree .
oman is also well situated for being the center of research geographically , with iran , india and the arabian peninsula at its periphery . " in 2009 master and doctorate programs will be added to the curriculum , and by 2012 an enrolment of 2,100 students is planned , with an expansion at a later stage of up to 15,000 envisaged . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany chooses munich , karlsruhe as elite universities germany 's three best , most promising universities are all located in the country 's south , a panel of experts has determined .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 07.01.2007 opinion : the burden of the past großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland 's stanlislaw wielgus did the right thing sunday when he declined to take up a new post as warsaw 's archbishop after admitting that he cooperated with the communist secret police , says dw 's miodrag soric . poland 's catholic church , the former bastion against the totalitarian , communist dictatorship , has been thrown into a deep crisis because of this case : one of her highest dignitaries , who was nearly consecrated as primate on sunday , has obviously collaborated with the former communist secret police . bildunterschrift : archbishop stanslaw wielgus stepped down immediately before taking office , giving up the designated post as poland 's highest-ranking cleric after weeks of public pressure and new revelations .
he deserves respect and acknowledgement for doing so .
a primate stanislaw wielgus would have harmed the credibility of the roman church and would have become a serious burden . he would have been compared with the former primate stefan wyszynski , who was jailed by communists for years ; wielgus would have been compared to pope john paul ii , who always stood up to the totalitarian dictatorship with courage .
considering this , wielgus did the right thing - even if he took his time . what 's known so far shows that wielgus never was a secret police agent within the church , but - rather - a cleric , who was forced to cooperate with the secret police .
no one should use this case to reinterpret historical facts : the churches in eastern europe where victims , not perpetrators , during the cold war .
that 's true for catholic , protestant and orthodox churches . in the stalinist soviet union alone , hundreds of thousands of pastors , bishops , monks , nuns and simple church members were murdered , jailed and tortured simply because of their faith .
kgb members were the so-called executive organs during the largest persecution of churches in history .
it 's understandable that church representatives in the former eastern bloc gave in to the pressure of secret police until 1991 .
only a few are born to be heroes . by now , communism is history and churches look to the future .
they have a future .
they have an important , ethical role in building a democratic civil society .
they could - and should - be a moral compass for all those , who are looking for spiritual orientation following the fall of socialism . the churches will only meet this challenge , if they apply the highest moral standards for themselves .
to put it bluntly : anyone , who - like archbishop wielgus - has obviously cooperated with the secret police , must not occupy a higher office in church hierarchy . for the new eu members bulgaria and romania , that also means that bishops , who will soon choose the respective patriarchs , should pick someone , who comes with a clean background .
the same is true for other countries in eastern and southeastern europe , such as serbia . in russia , an increasing number of top positions in state and society are filled with former secret service members .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 07.01.2007 opinion : the burden of the past großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland 's stanlislaw wielgus did the right thing sunday when he declined to take up a new post as warsaw 's archbishop after admitting that he cooperated with the communist secret police , says dw 's miodrag soric . poland 's catholic church , the former bastion against the totalitarian , communist dictatorship , has been thrown into a deep crisis because of this case : one of her highest dignitaries , who was nearly consecrated as primate on sunday , has obviously collaborated with the former communist secret police . bildunterschrift : archbishop stanslaw wielgus stepped down immediately before taking office , giving up the designated post as poland 's highest-ranking cleric after weeks of public pressure and new revelations .
he deserves respect and acknowledgement for doing so .
a primate stanislaw wielgus would have harmed the credibility of the roman church and would have become a serious burden . he would have been compared with the former primate stefan wyszynski , who was jailed by communists for years ; wielgus would have been compared to pope john paul ii , who always stood up to the totalitarian dictatorship with courage .
considering this , wielgus did the right thing - even if he took his time . what 's known so far shows that wielgus never was a secret police agent within the church , but - rather - a cleric , who was forced to cooperate with the secret police .
no one should use this case to reinterpret historical facts : the churches in eastern europe where victims , not perpetrators , during the cold war .
that 's true for catholic , protestant and orthodox churches . in the stalinist soviet union alone , hundreds of thousands of pastors , bishops , monks , nuns and simple church members were murdered , jailed and tortured simply because of their faith .
kgb members were the so-called executive organs during the largest persecution of churches in history .
it 's understandable that church representatives in the former eastern bloc gave in to the pressure of secret police until 1991 .
only a few are born to be heroes . by now , communism is history and churches look to the future .
they have a future .
they have an important , ethical role in building a democratic civil society .
they could - and should - be a moral compass for all those , who are looking for spiritual orientation following the fall of socialism . the churches will only meet this challenge , if they apply the highest moral standards for themselves .
to put it bluntly : anyone , who - like archbishop wielgus - has obviously cooperated with the secret police , must not occupy a higher office in church hierarchy . for the new eu members bulgaria and romania , that also means that bishops , who will soon choose the respective patriarchs , should pick someone , who comes with a clean background .
the same is true for other countries in eastern and southeastern europe , such as serbia . in russia , an increasing number of top positions in state and society are filled with former secret service members .
instead of being ashamed of their dark past , they flaunt it and cozy up to the church in front of tv cameras .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de education -pipe- 07.01.2007 joint university brings german know-how to oman großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : university students in the halls of learning in muscat , oman 's capital oman 's strong demand for higher learning in the sciences has led to a collaboration with a german technical college to establish the first joint university in the sultanate . in a major boost for german-omani relations , an agreement to establish the first joint university in muscat , the capital of the sultanate , was recently sealed .
the oman german university of technology -lrb- og tech -rrb- , which plans to open in september , is a collaborative effort between a group of private omani investors , the sultanate 's educational ministry , and the rhine-westphalia technical college -lrb- rwth -rrb- in the western german city of aachen . aachen 's rwth is one of europe 's oldest and most prestigious educational institutions .
the degrees conferred by og tech will be recognized in the european union , providing its graduates with a wide range of options . ogtech was the brainchild of michael jansen , a professor at rwth , who was conducting a study on urban planning and archaelogy in the medieval port city al baleed during his first visit to the sultanate 11 years ago .
from there , he drew on the inspiration to set up a partnership with sultan qaboos university . strong demand for technology and science bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german universities are reknowned for their technical know-how " it all started with a research project , supported by unesco , and then evolved into what college instructors traditionally do , which is to seek cooperation with another university , " said jansen , who spearheaded an academic exchange program that enabled german and oman students to study in each other 's countries .
" after that , it snowballed into the idea of establishing a separate university . " there is a strong demand for higher learning in technical subjects in oman , so the partnership with rwth to transfer technical know-how to an independent institution financed by private investors was a good fit , according to jansen . the aachen institution is internationally renowned for its research strengths and collaboration with various european universities , such as the imperial college in london and the paris institute for technology . bachelor of science programs on offer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oman lacks research-oriented programs leading to an advanced degree after many years in the planning stages , christoph hilgers , who is project manager of og tech , established an academic curriculum that was approved by the omani educational ministry .
next year the university will offer bachelor of science programs in mechanical engineering , applied geosciences , information technology , regional management and tourism , as well as urban design and planning , in conjunction with a pre-university program equivalent to the german high school diploma that will be launched in september with an initial enrollment of 360 students . " the main focus is on the quality of education , not on the quantity and breadth of offerings , which means operating on a smaller scale , at least initially , " hilgers said . the teaching staff and professors will be selected by aachen 's rwth with the language of instruction being english .
considering the demand for a premium education in the sultanate , jansen added that he wants to set a high standard for oman and the gulf region . programs leading to an advanced degree " there are plenty of universities that offer the bachelor 's program , " jansen said .
" what has been lacking in oman , even at the sultan qaboos university , is research-oriented approach in higher education that leads to an advanced degree .
oman is also well situated for being the center of research geographically , with iran , india and the arabian peninsula at its periphery . " in 2009 master and doctorate programs will be added to the curriculum , and by 2012 an enrolment of 2,100 students is planned , with an expansion at a later stage of up to 15,000 envisaged . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany chooses munich , karlsruhe as elite universities germany 's three best , most promising universities are all located in the country 's south , a panel of experts has determined .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de education -pipe- 07.01.2007 joint university brings german know-how to oman großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : university students in the halls of learning in muscat , oman 's capital oman 's strong demand for higher learning in the sciences has led to a collaboration with a german technical college to establish the first joint university in the sultanate . in a major boost for german-omani relations , an agreement to establish the first joint university in muscat , the capital of the sultanate , was recently sealed .
the oman german university of technology -lrb- og tech -rrb- , which plans to open in september , is a collaborative effort between a group of private omani investors , the sultanate 's educational ministry , and the rhine-westphalia technical college -lrb- rwth -rrb- in the western german city of aachen . aachen 's rwth is one of europe 's oldest and most prestigious educational institutions .
the degrees conferred by og tech will be recognized in the european union , providing its graduates with a wide range of options . ogtech was the brainchild of michael jansen , a professor at rwth , who was conducting a study on urban planning and archaelogy in the medieval port city al baleed during his first visit to the sultanate 11 years ago .
from there , he drew on the inspiration to set up a partnership with sultan qaboos university . strong demand for technology and science bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german universities are reknowned for their technical know-how " it all started with a research project , supported by unesco , and then evolved into what college instructors traditionally do , which is to seek cooperation with another university , " said jansen , who spearheaded an academic exchange program that enabled german and oman students to study in each other 's countries .
" after that , it snowballed into the idea of establishing a separate university . " there is a strong demand for higher learning in technical subjects in oman , so the partnership with rwth to transfer technical know-how to an independent institution financed by private investors was a good fit , according to jansen . the aachen institution is internationally renowned for its research strengths and collaboration with various european universities , such as the imperial college in london and the paris institute for technology . bachelor of science programs on offer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oman lacks research-oriented programs leading to an advanced degree after many years in the planning stages , christoph hilgers , who is project manager of og tech , established an academic curriculum that was approved by the omani educational ministry .
next year the university will offer bachelor of science programs in mechanical engineering , applied geosciences , information technology , regional management and tourism , as well as urban design and planning , in conjunction with a pre-university program equivalent to the german high school diploma that will be launched in september with an initial enrollment of 360 students . " the main focus is on the quality of education , not on the quantity and breadth of offerings , which means operating on a smaller scale , at least initially , " hilgers said . the teaching staff and professors will be selected by aachen 's rwth with the language of instruction being english .
considering the demand for a premium education in the sultanate , jansen added that he wants to set a high standard for oman and the gulf region . programs leading to an advanced degree " there are plenty of universities that offer the bachelor 's program , " jansen said .
" what has been lacking in oman , even at the sultan qaboos university , is research-oriented approach in higher education that leads to an advanced degree .
oman is also well situated for being the center of research geographically , with iran , india and the arabian peninsula at its periphery . " in 2009 master and doctorate programs will be added to the curriculum , and by 2012 an enrolment of 2,100 students is planned , with an expansion at a later stage of up to 15,000 envisaged . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany chooses munich , karlsruhe as elite universities germany 's three best , most promising universities are all located in the country 's south , a panel of experts has determined .

in the town cafe , a bunch of youngsters said they are sceptical and not cheering over the eu accession as " prices will rise but salaries will not .

" we are awaiting the eu accession with enthusiasm and hopes for a better life for us and the young , " pravetz mayor krasimir zhivkov , who is also a distant relative of the dictator , said before the new year .

the town 's microprocessor plant once shipped its eight-megabyte " pravetz " computers to the whole soviet bloc .
now the plant is closed after a series of unsuccessful privatizations .
after being ousted in 1989 , zhivkov was arrested and brought to court for embezzlement of government funds .
but he was never prosecuted since bulgaria 's constitution rules that a former head of state can only be tried for treason .
the man who was moscow 's staunchest ally spent the last years of his life under house arrest in his daughter 's suburban villa outside sofia .
he died in 1998 .

" we are awaiting the eu accession with enthusiasm and hopes for a better life for us and the young , " pravetz mayor krasimir zhivkov , who is also a distant relative of the dictator , said before the new year .

the town 's microprocessor plant once shipped its eight-megabyte " pravetz " computers to the whole soviet bloc .
now the plant is closed after a series of unsuccessful privatizations .
after being ousted in 1989 , zhivkov was arrested and brought to court for embezzlement of government funds .

he deserves respect and acknowledgement for doing so .
a primate stanislaw wielgus would have harmed the credibility of the roman church and would have become a serious burden . he would have been compared with the former primate stefan wyszynski , who was jailed by communists for years ; wielgus would have been compared to pope john paul ii , who always stood up to the totalitarian dictatorship with courage .
considering this , wielgus did the right thing - even if he took his time . what 's known so far shows that wielgus never was a secret police agent within the church , but - rather - a cleric , who was forced to cooperate with the secret police .
no one should use this case to reinterpret historical facts : the churches in eastern europe where victims , not perpetrators , during the cold war .
that 's true for catholic , protestant and orthodox churches . in the stalinist soviet union alone , hundreds of thousands of pastors , bishops , monks , nuns and simple church members were murdered , jailed and tortured simply because of their faith .
kgb members were the so-called executive organs during the largest persecution of churches in history .
it 's understandable that church representatives in the former eastern bloc gave in to the pressure of secret police until 1991 .
only a few are born to be heroes . by now , communism is history and churches look to the future .
they have a future .
they have an important , ethical role in building a democratic civil society .
they could - and should - be a moral compass for all those , who are looking for spiritual orientation following the fall of socialism . the churches will only meet this challenge , if they apply the highest moral standards for themselves .
to put it bluntly : anyone , who - like archbishop wielgus - has obviously cooperated with the secret police , must not occupy a higher office in church hierarchy . for the new eu members bulgaria and romania , that also means that bishops , who will soon choose the respective patriarchs , should pick someone , who comes with a clean background .
the same is true for other countries in eastern and southeastern europe , such as serbia . in russia , an increasing number of top positions in state and society are filled with former secret service members .
instead of being ashamed of their dark past , they flaunt it and cozy up to the church in front of tv cameras .

he deserves respect and acknowledgement for doing so .
a primate stanislaw wielgus would have harmed the credibility of the roman church and would have become a serious burden . he would have been compared with the former primate stefan wyszynski , who was jailed by communists for years ; wielgus would have been compared to pope john paul ii , who always stood up to the totalitarian dictatorship with courage .
considering this , wielgus did the right thing - even if he took his time . what 's known so far shows that wielgus never was a secret police agent within the church , but - rather - a cleric , who was forced to cooperate with the secret police .
no one should use this case to reinterpret historical facts : the churches in eastern europe where victims , not perpetrators , during the cold war .
that 's true for catholic , protestant and orthodox churches . in the stalinist soviet union alone , hundreds of thousands of pastors , bishops , monks , nuns and simple church members were murdered , jailed and tortured simply because of their faith .
kgb members were the so-called executive organs during the largest persecution of churches in history .
it 's understandable that church representatives in the former eastern bloc gave in to the pressure of secret police until 1991 .
only a few are born to be heroes . by now , communism is history and churches look to the future .
they have a future .
they have an important , ethical role in building a democratic civil society .
they could - and should - be a moral compass for all those , who are looking for spiritual orientation following the fall of socialism . the churches will only meet this challenge , if they apply the highest moral standards for themselves .
to put it bluntly : anyone , who - like archbishop wielgus - has obviously cooperated with the secret police , must not occupy a higher office in church hierarchy . for the new eu members bulgaria and romania , that also means that bishops , who will soon choose the respective patriarchs , should pick someone , who comes with a clean background .
the same is true for other countries in eastern and southeastern europe , such as serbia . in russia , an increasing number of top positions in state and society are filled with former secret service members .
instead of being ashamed of their dark past , they flaunt it and cozy up to the church in front of tv cameras .
jesus christ already warned about the wolf in sheep 's clothing .

the oman german university of technology -lrb- og tech -rrb- , which plans to open in september , is a collaborative effort between a group of private omani investors , the sultanate 's educational ministry , and the rhine-westphalia technical college -lrb- rwth -rrb- in the western german city of aachen . aachen 's rwth is one of europe 's oldest and most prestigious educational institutions .
the degrees conferred by og tech will be recognized in the european union , providing its graduates with a wide range of options . ogtech was the brainchild of michael jansen , a professor at rwth , who was conducting a study on urban planning and archaelogy in the medieval port city al baleed during his first visit to the sultanate 11 years ago .
from there , he drew on the inspiration to set up a partnership with sultan qaboos university . strong demand for technology and science bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german universities are reknowned for their technical know-how " it all started with a research project , supported by unesco , and then evolved into what college instructors traditionally do , which is to seek cooperation with another university , " said jansen , who spearheaded an academic exchange program that enabled german and oman students to study in each other 's countries .
" after that , it snowballed into the idea of establishing a separate university . " there is a strong demand for higher learning in technical subjects in oman , so the partnership with rwth to transfer technical know-how to an independent institution financed by private investors was a good fit , according to jansen . the aachen institution is internationally renowned for its research strengths and collaboration with various european universities , such as the imperial college in london and the paris institute for technology . bachelor of science programs on offer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oman lacks research-oriented programs leading to an advanced degree after many years in the planning stages , christoph hilgers , who is project manager of og tech , established an academic curriculum that was approved by the omani educational ministry .
next year the university will offer bachelor of science programs in mechanical engineering , applied geosciences , information technology , regional management and tourism , as well as urban design and planning , in conjunction with a pre-university program equivalent to the german high school diploma that will be launched in september with an initial enrollment of 360 students . " the main focus is on the quality of education , not on the quantity and breadth of offerings , which means operating on a smaller scale , at least initially , " hilgers said . the teaching staff and professors will be selected by aachen 's rwth with the language of instruction being english .
considering the demand for a premium education in the sultanate , jansen added that he wants to set a high standard for oman and the gulf region . programs leading to an advanced degree " there are plenty of universities that offer the bachelor 's program , " jansen said .
" what has been lacking in oman , even at the sultan qaboos university , is research-oriented approach in higher education that leads to an advanced degree .
oman is also well situated for being the center of research geographically , with iran , india and the arabian peninsula at its periphery . " in 2009 master and doctorate programs will be added to the curriculum , and by 2012 an enrolment of 2,100 students is planned , with an expansion at a later stage of up to 15,000 envisaged . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany chooses munich , karlsruhe as elite universities germany 's three best , most promising universities are all located in the country 's south , a panel of experts has determined .

in pravetz , the hometown of bulgaria 's former communist dictator todor zhivkov , residents are only half-heartedly welcoming the change . joining the eu is , after all , seen as the last nail in the coffin of a communist system that at least provided jobs .
in the town cafe , a bunch of youngsters said they are sceptical and not cheering over the eu accession as " prices will rise but salaries will not .
" during zhivkov 's time , my parents had jobs and we went to the seaside every summer , " said 16-year-old lyubomir dyakov , who lives in pravetz with his grandmother .
" now my mother is a waitress in bahrain and my father is a driver in france .
i will also leave bulgaria as soon as i finish my tourism studies . "
a european town ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zhivkov was the town 's most famous resident pravetz celebrated eu accession along with the coming of the new year on its central square , which is named for zhivkov , who fell from power along with communism in 1989 after ruling for 35 years .
at the town 's entrance , an overhead banner framed by bulgarian and european flags reads : " pravetz , a european town . "
" we are awaiting the eu accession with enthusiasm and hopes for a better life for us and the young , " pravetz mayor krasimir zhivkov , who is also a distant relative of the dictator , said before the new year .
" european funds will help develop the infrastructure , " he added , praising his town 's future as " a tourist destination and an educational center . "
a us university correspondence program in business administration is already functioning in this small town west of sofia .
convicted for embezzlement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu accession was greeted with a big party on sofia 's main square formerly a small village , stuck at the foot of the balkan mountains and at one point with no sewage facilities or electricity , pravetz blossomed after zhivkov 's rise to power in 1954 and was officially declared a town in 1981 .
the town 's microprocessor plant once shipped its eight-megabyte " pravetz " computers to the whole soviet bloc .
now the plant is closed after a series of unsuccessful privatizations .
after being ousted in 1989 , zhivkov was arrested and brought to court for embezzlement of government funds .
but he was never prosecuted since bulgaria 's constitution rules that a former head of state can only be tried for treason .
the man who was moscow 's staunchest ally spent the last years of his life under house arrest in his daughter 's suburban villa outside sofia .
he died in 1998 .
moving away now the dictator 's modest home in pravetz has become a museum and his statue stands in the town 's public gardens .
pravetz suffered when communist money stopped pouring in but it is now recovering thanks to investment by former communist faithful turned businessmen .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 07.01.2007 opinion : the burden of the past großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland 's stanlislaw wielgus did the right thing sunday when he declined to take up a new post as warsaw 's archbishop after admitting that he cooperated with the communist secret police , says dw 's miodrag soric . poland 's catholic church , the former bastion against the totalitarian , communist dictatorship , has been thrown into a deep crisis because of this case : one of her highest dignitaries , who was nearly consecrated as primate on sunday , has obviously collaborated with the former communist secret police . bildunterschrift : archbishop stanslaw wielgus stepped down immediately before taking office , giving up the designated post as poland 's highest-ranking cleric after weeks of public pressure and new revelations .
he deserves respect and acknowledgement for doing so .
a primate stanislaw wielgus would have harmed the credibility of the roman church and would have become a serious burden . he would have been compared with the former primate stefan wyszynski , who was jailed by communists for years ; wielgus would have been compared to pope john paul ii , who always stood up to the totalitarian dictatorship with courage .
considering this , wielgus did the right thing - even if he took his time . what 's known so far shows that wielgus never was a secret police agent within the church , but - rather - a cleric , who was forced to cooperate with the secret police .
no one should use this case to reinterpret historical facts : the churches in eastern europe where victims , not perpetrators , during the cold war .
that 's true for catholic , protestant and orthodox churches . in the stalinist soviet union alone , hundreds of thousands of pastors , bishops , monks , nuns and simple church members were murdered , jailed and tortured simply because of their faith .
kgb members were the so-called executive organs during the largest persecution of churches in history .
it 's understandable that church representatives in the former eastern bloc gave in to the pressure of secret police until 1991 .
only a few are born to be heroes . by now , communism is history and churches look to the future .
they have a future .
they have an important , ethical role in building a democratic civil society .
they could - and should - be a moral compass for all those , who are looking for spiritual orientation following the fall of socialism . the churches will only meet this challenge , if they apply the highest moral standards for themselves .
to put it bluntly : anyone , who - like archbishop wielgus - has obviously cooperated with the secret police , must not occupy a higher office in church hierarchy . for the new eu members bulgaria and romania , that also means that bishops , who will soon choose the respective patriarchs , should pick someone , who comes with a clean background .
the same is true for other countries in eastern and southeastern europe , such as serbia . in russia , an increasing number of top positions in state and society are filled with former secret service members .
instead of being ashamed of their dark past , they flaunt it and cozy up to the church in front of tv cameras .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zhivkov was the town 's most famous resident pravetz celebrated eu accession along with the coming of the new year on its central square , which is named for zhivkov , who fell from power along with communism in 1989 after ruling for 35 years .
at the town 's entrance , an overhead banner framed by bulgarian and european flags reads : " pravetz , a european town . "
" we are awaiting the eu accession with enthusiasm and hopes for a better life for us and the young , " pravetz mayor krasimir zhivkov , who is also a distant relative of the dictator , said before the new year .
" european funds will help develop the infrastructure , " he added , praising his town 's future as " a tourist destination and an educational center . "
a us university correspondence program in business administration is already functioning in this small town west of sofia .
convicted for embezzlement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu accession was greeted with a big party on sofia 's main square formerly a small village , stuck at the foot of the balkan mountains and at one point with no sewage facilities or electricity , pravetz blossomed after zhivkov 's rise to power in 1954 and was officially declared a town in 1981 .
the town 's microprocessor plant once shipped its eight-megabyte " pravetz " computers to the whole soviet bloc .
now the plant is closed after a series of unsuccessful privatizations .
after being ousted in 1989 , zhivkov was arrested and brought to court for embezzlement of government funds .
but he was never prosecuted since bulgaria 's constitution rules that a former head of state can only be tried for treason .
the man who was moscow 's staunchest ally spent the last years of his life under house arrest in his daughter 's suburban villa outside sofia .
he died in 1998 .
moving away now the dictator 's modest home in pravetz has become a museum and his statue stands in the town 's public gardens .
pravetz suffered when communist money stopped pouring in but it is now recovering thanks to investment by former communist faithful turned businessmen .
still , a quarter of pravetz ' 5,000 residents have moved abroad , seeking jobs in italy and spain .

" people there go grocery shopping for 200 euros -lrb- $ 262 -rrb- and not for two leva -lrb- one euro -rrb- like here , " said albena ivanova , a grocer whose monthly salary stands at 81 euros .
one of her clients complained she had to start a cleaning job after years as a communist administration secretary .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de education -pipe- 07.01.2007 joint university brings german know-how to oman großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : university students in the halls of learning in muscat , oman 's capital oman 's strong demand for higher learning in the sciences has led to a collaboration with a german technical college to establish the first joint university in the sultanate . in a major boost for german-omani relations , an agreement to establish the first joint university in muscat , the capital of the sultanate , was recently sealed .
the oman german university of technology -lrb- og tech -rrb- , which plans to open in september , is a collaborative effort between a group of private omani investors , the sultanate 's educational ministry , and the rhine-westphalia technical college -lrb- rwth -rrb- in the western german city of aachen . aachen 's rwth is one of europe 's oldest and most prestigious educational institutions .
the degrees conferred by og tech will be recognized in the european union , providing its graduates with a wide range of options . ogtech was the brainchild of michael jansen , a professor at rwth , who was conducting a study on urban planning and archaelogy in the medieval port city al baleed during his first visit to the sultanate 11 years ago .
from there , he drew on the inspiration to set up a partnership with sultan qaboos university . strong demand for technology and science bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german universities are reknowned for their technical know-how " it all started with a research project , supported by unesco , and then evolved into what college instructors traditionally do , which is to seek cooperation with another university , " said jansen , who spearheaded an academic exchange program that enabled german and oman students to study in each other 's countries .
" after that , it snowballed into the idea of establishing a separate university . " there is a strong demand for higher learning in technical subjects in oman , so the partnership with rwth to transfer technical know-how to an independent institution financed by private investors was a good fit , according to jansen . the aachen institution is internationally renowned for its research strengths and collaboration with various european universities , such as the imperial college in london and the paris institute for technology . bachelor of science programs on offer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oman lacks research-oriented programs leading to an advanced degree after many years in the planning stages , christoph hilgers , who is project manager of og tech , established an academic curriculum that was approved by the omani educational ministry .
next year the university will offer bachelor of science programs in mechanical engineering , applied geosciences , information technology , regional management and tourism , as well as urban design and planning , in conjunction with a pre-university program equivalent to the german high school diploma that will be launched in september with an initial enrollment of 360 students . " the main focus is on the quality of education , not on the quantity and breadth of offerings , which means operating on a smaller scale , at least initially , " hilgers said . the teaching staff and professors will be selected by aachen 's rwth with the language of instruction being english .
considering the demand for a premium education in the sultanate , jansen added that he wants to set a high standard for oman and the gulf region . programs leading to an advanced degree " there are plenty of universities that offer the bachelor 's program , " jansen said .
" what has been lacking in oman , even at the sultan qaboos university , is research-oriented approach in higher education that leads to an advanced degree .
oman is also well situated for being the center of research geographically , with iran , india and the arabian peninsula at its periphery . " in 2009 master and doctorate programs will be added to the curriculum , and by 2012 an enrolment of 2,100 students is planned , with an expansion at a later stage of up to 15,000 envisaged . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany chooses munich , karlsruhe as elite universities germany 's three best , most promising universities are all located in the country 's south , a panel of experts has determined .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 07.01.2007 opinion : the burden of the past großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland 's stanlislaw wielgus did the right thing sunday when he declined to take up a new post as warsaw 's archbishop after admitting that he cooperated with the communist secret police , says dw 's miodrag soric . poland 's catholic church , the former bastion against the totalitarian , communist dictatorship , has been thrown into a deep crisis because of this case : one of her highest dignitaries , who was nearly consecrated as primate on sunday , has obviously collaborated with the former communist secret police . bildunterschrift : archbishop stanslaw wielgus stepped down immediately before taking office , giving up the designated post as poland 's highest-ranking cleric after weeks of public pressure and new revelations .
he deserves respect and acknowledgement for doing so .
a primate stanislaw wielgus would have harmed the credibility of the roman church and would have become a serious burden . he would have been compared with the former primate stefan wyszynski , who was jailed by communists for years ; wielgus would have been compared to pope john paul ii , who always stood up to the totalitarian dictatorship with courage .
considering this , wielgus did the right thing - even if he took his time . what 's known so far shows that wielgus never was a secret police agent within the church , but - rather - a cleric , who was forced to cooperate with the secret police .
no one should use this case to reinterpret historical facts : the churches in eastern europe where victims , not perpetrators , during the cold war .
that 's true for catholic , protestant and orthodox churches . in the stalinist soviet union alone , hundreds of thousands of pastors , bishops , monks , nuns and simple church members were murdered , jailed and tortured simply because of their faith .

he deserves respect and acknowledgement for doing so .
a primate stanislaw wielgus would have harmed the credibility of the roman church and would have become a serious burden . he would have been compared with the former primate stefan wyszynski , who was jailed by communists for years ; wielgus would have been compared to pope john paul ii , who always stood up to the totalitarian dictatorship with courage .
considering this , wielgus did the right thing - even if he took his time . what 's known so far shows that wielgus never was a secret police agent within the church , but - rather - a cleric , who was forced to cooperate with the secret police .
no one should use this case to reinterpret historical facts : the churches in eastern europe where victims , not perpetrators , during the cold war .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 07.01.2007 opinion : the burden of the past großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland 's stanlislaw wielgus did the right thing sunday when he declined to take up a new post as warsaw 's archbishop after admitting that he cooperated with the communist secret police , says dw 's miodrag soric . poland 's catholic church , the former bastion against the totalitarian , communist dictatorship , has been thrown into a deep crisis because of this case : one of her highest dignitaries , who was nearly consecrated as primate on sunday , has obviously collaborated with the former communist secret police . bildunterschrift : archbishop stanslaw wielgus stepped down immediately before taking office , giving up the designated post as poland 's highest-ranking cleric after weeks of public pressure and new revelations .
he deserves respect and acknowledgement for doing so .
a primate stanislaw wielgus would have harmed the credibility of the roman church and would have become a serious burden . he would have been compared with the former primate stefan wyszynski , who was jailed by communists for years ; wielgus would have been compared to pope john paul ii , who always stood up to the totalitarian dictatorship with courage .
considering this , wielgus did the right thing - even if he took his time . what 's known so far shows that wielgus never was a secret police agent within the church , but - rather - a cleric , who was forced to cooperate with the secret police .
no one should use this case to reinterpret historical facts : the churches in eastern europe where victims , not perpetrators , during the cold war .
that 's true for catholic , protestant and orthodox churches . in the stalinist soviet union alone , hundreds of thousands of pastors , bishops , monks , nuns and simple church members were murdered , jailed and tortured simply because of their faith .
kgb members were the so-called executive organs during the largest persecution of churches in history .
it 's understandable that church representatives in the former eastern bloc gave in to the pressure of secret police until 1991 .
only a few are born to be heroes . by now , communism is history and churches look to the future .
they have a future .
they have an important , ethical role in building a democratic civil society .
they could - and should - be a moral compass for all those , who are looking for spiritual orientation following the fall of socialism . the churches will only meet this challenge , if they apply the highest moral standards for themselves .
to put it bluntly : anyone , who - like archbishop wielgus - has obviously cooperated with the secret police , must not occupy a higher office in church hierarchy . for the new eu members bulgaria and romania , that also means that bishops , who will soon choose the respective patriarchs , should pick someone , who comes with a clean background .
the same is true for other countries in eastern and southeastern europe , such as serbia . in russia , an increasing number of top positions in state and society are filled with former secret service members .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de education -pipe- 07.01.2007 joint university brings german know-how to oman großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : university students in the halls of learning in muscat , oman 's capital oman 's strong demand for higher learning in the sciences has led to a collaboration with a german technical college to establish the first joint university in the sultanate . in a major boost for german-omani relations , an agreement to establish the first joint university in muscat , the capital of the sultanate , was recently sealed .
the oman german university of technology -lrb- og tech -rrb- , which plans to open in september , is a collaborative effort between a group of private omani investors , the sultanate 's educational ministry , and the rhine-westphalia technical college -lrb- rwth -rrb- in the western german city of aachen . aachen 's rwth is one of europe 's oldest and most prestigious educational institutions .
the degrees conferred by og tech will be recognized in the european union , providing its graduates with a wide range of options . ogtech was the brainchild of michael jansen , a professor at rwth , who was conducting a study on urban planning and archaelogy in the medieval port city al baleed during his first visit to the sultanate 11 years ago .
from there , he drew on the inspiration to set up a partnership with sultan qaboos university . strong demand for technology and science bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german universities are reknowned for their technical know-how " it all started with a research project , supported by unesco , and then evolved into what college instructors traditionally do , which is to seek cooperation with another university , " said jansen , who spearheaded an academic exchange program that enabled german and oman students to study in each other 's countries .
" after that , it snowballed into the idea of establishing a separate university . " there is a strong demand for higher learning in technical subjects in oman , so the partnership with rwth to transfer technical know-how to an independent institution financed by private investors was a good fit , according to jansen . the aachen institution is internationally renowned for its research strengths and collaboration with various european universities , such as the imperial college in london and the paris institute for technology . bachelor of science programs on offer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oman lacks research-oriented programs leading to an advanced degree after many years in the planning stages , christoph hilgers , who is project manager of og tech , established an academic curriculum that was approved by the omani educational ministry .
next year the university will offer bachelor of science programs in mechanical engineering , applied geosciences , information technology , regional management and tourism , as well as urban design and planning , in conjunction with a pre-university program equivalent to the german high school diploma that will be launched in september with an initial enrollment of 360 students . " the main focus is on the quality of education , not on the quantity and breadth of offerings , which means operating on a smaller scale , at least initially , " hilgers said . the teaching staff and professors will be selected by aachen 's rwth with the language of instruction being english .
considering the demand for a premium education in the sultanate , jansen added that he wants to set a high standard for oman and the gulf region . programs leading to an advanced degree " there are plenty of universities that offer the bachelor 's program , " jansen said .
" what has been lacking in oman , even at the sultan qaboos university , is research-oriented approach in higher education that leads to an advanced degree .
oman is also well situated for being the center of research geographically , with iran , india and the arabian peninsula at its periphery . " in 2009 master and doctorate programs will be added to the curriculum , and by 2012 an enrolment of 2,100 students is planned , with an expansion at a later stage of up to 15,000 envisaged . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany chooses munich , karlsruhe as elite universities germany 's three best , most promising universities are all located in the country 's south , a panel of experts has determined .

in pravetz , the hometown of bulgaria 's former communist dictator todor zhivkov , residents are only half-heartedly welcoming the change . joining the eu is , after all , seen as the last nail in the coffin of a communist system that at least provided jobs .
in the town cafe , a bunch of youngsters said they are sceptical and not cheering over the eu accession as " prices will rise but salaries will not .
" during zhivkov 's time , my parents had jobs and we went to the seaside every summer , " said 16-year-old lyubomir dyakov , who lives in pravetz with his grandmother .
" now my mother is a waitress in bahrain and my father is a driver in france .
i will also leave bulgaria as soon as i finish my tourism studies . "
a european town ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zhivkov was the town 's most famous resident pravetz celebrated eu accession along with the coming of the new year on its central square , which is named for zhivkov , who fell from power along with communism in 1989 after ruling for 35 years .
at the town 's entrance , an overhead banner framed by bulgarian and european flags reads : " pravetz , a european town . "
" we are awaiting the eu accession with enthusiasm and hopes for a better life for us and the young , " pravetz mayor krasimir zhivkov , who is also a distant relative of the dictator , said before the new year .
" european funds will help develop the infrastructure , " he added , praising his town 's future as " a tourist destination and an educational center . "
a us university correspondence program in business administration is already functioning in this small town west of sofia .
convicted for embezzlement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu accession was greeted with a big party on sofia 's main square formerly a small village , stuck at the foot of the balkan mountains and at one point with no sewage facilities or electricity , pravetz blossomed after zhivkov 's rise to power in 1954 and was officially declared a town in 1981 .
the town 's microprocessor plant once shipped its eight-megabyte " pravetz " computers to the whole soviet bloc .
now the plant is closed after a series of unsuccessful privatizations .
after being ousted in 1989 , zhivkov was arrested and brought to court for embezzlement of government funds .
but he was never prosecuted since bulgaria 's constitution rules that a former head of state can only be tried for treason .
the man who was moscow 's staunchest ally spent the last years of his life under house arrest in his daughter 's suburban villa outside sofia .
he died in 1998 .
moving away now the dictator 's modest home in pravetz has become a museum and his statue stands in the town 's public gardens .
pravetz suffered when communist money stopped pouring in but it is now recovering thanks to investment by former communist faithful turned businessmen .
still , a quarter of pravetz ' 5,000 residents have moved abroad , seeking jobs in italy and spain .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bulgaria had to shut off its nuclear reactors before jan .

" i have seen what a european union country looks like - nothing to do with the bulgarian reality . "
" people there go grocery shopping for 200 euros -lrb- $ 262 -rrb- and not for two leva -lrb- one euro -rrb- like here , " said albena ivanova , a grocer whose monthly salary stands at 81 euros .
one of her clients complained she had to start a cleaning job after years as a communist administration secretary .
" there is no longer central heating in pravetz as nobody can pay for that , " she said .

he deserves respect and acknowledgement for doing so .
a primate stanislaw wielgus would have harmed the credibility of the roman church and would have become a serious burden . he would have been compared with the former primate stefan wyszynski , who was jailed by communists for years ; wielgus would have been compared to pope john paul ii , who always stood up to the totalitarian dictatorship with courage .
considering this , wielgus did the right thing - even if he took his time . what 's known so far shows that wielgus never was a secret police agent within the church , but - rather - a cleric , who was forced to cooperate with the secret police .
no one should use this case to reinterpret historical facts : the churches in eastern europe where victims , not perpetrators , during the cold war .
that 's true for catholic , protestant and orthodox churches . in the stalinist soviet union alone , hundreds of thousands of pastors , bishops , monks , nuns and simple church members were murdered , jailed and tortured simply because of their faith .
kgb members were the so-called executive organs during the largest persecution of churches in history .
it 's understandable that church representatives in the former eastern bloc gave in to the pressure of secret police until 1991 .
only a few are born to be heroes . by now , communism is history and churches look to the future .
they have a future .
they have an important , ethical role in building a democratic civil society .
they could - and should - be a moral compass for all those , who are looking for spiritual orientation following the fall of socialism . the churches will only meet this challenge , if they apply the highest moral standards for themselves .
to put it bluntly : anyone , who - like archbishop wielgus - has obviously cooperated with the secret police , must not occupy a higher office in church hierarchy . for the new eu members bulgaria and romania , that also means that bishops , who will soon choose the respective patriarchs , should pick someone , who comes with a clean background .
the same is true for other countries in eastern and southeastern europe , such as serbia . in russia , an increasing number of top positions in state and society are filled with former secret service members .
instead of being ashamed of their dark past , they flaunt it and cozy up to the church in front of tv cameras .

the oman german university of technology -lrb- og tech -rrb- , which plans to open in september , is a collaborative effort between a group of private omani investors , the sultanate 's educational ministry , and the rhine-westphalia technical college -lrb- rwth -rrb- in the western german city of aachen . aachen 's rwth is one of europe 's oldest and most prestigious educational institutions .
the degrees conferred by og tech will be recognized in the european union , providing its graduates with a wide range of options . ogtech was the brainchild of michael jansen , a professor at rwth , who was conducting a study on urban planning and archaelogy in the medieval port city al baleed during his first visit to the sultanate 11 years ago .
from there , he drew on the inspiration to set up a partnership with sultan qaboos university . strong demand for technology and science bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german universities are reknowned for their technical know-how " it all started with a research project , supported by unesco , and then evolved into what college instructors traditionally do , which is to seek cooperation with another university , " said jansen , who spearheaded an academic exchange program that enabled german and oman students to study in each other 's countries .
" after that , it snowballed into the idea of establishing a separate university . " there is a strong demand for higher learning in technical subjects in oman , so the partnership with rwth to transfer technical know-how to an independent institution financed by private investors was a good fit , according to jansen . the aachen institution is internationally renowned for its research strengths and collaboration with various european universities , such as the imperial college in london and the paris institute for technology . bachelor of science programs on offer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oman lacks research-oriented programs leading to an advanced degree after many years in the planning stages , christoph hilgers , who is project manager of og tech , established an academic curriculum that was approved by the omani educational ministry .
next year the university will offer bachelor of science programs in mechanical engineering , applied geosciences , information technology , regional management and tourism , as well as urban design and planning , in conjunction with a pre-university program equivalent to the german high school diploma that will be launched in september with an initial enrollment of 360 students . " the main focus is on the quality of education , not on the quantity and breadth of offerings , which means operating on a smaller scale , at least initially , " hilgers said . the teaching staff and professors will be selected by aachen 's rwth with the language of instruction being english .
considering the demand for a premium education in the sultanate , jansen added that he wants to set a high standard for oman and the gulf region . programs leading to an advanced degree " there are plenty of universities that offer the bachelor 's program , " jansen said .
" what has been lacking in oman , even at the sultan qaboos university , is research-oriented approach in higher education that leads to an advanced degree .
oman is also well situated for being the center of research geographically , with iran , india and the arabian peninsula at its periphery . " in 2009 master and doctorate programs will be added to the curriculum , and by 2012 an enrolment of 2,100 students is planned , with an expansion at a later stage of up to 15,000 envisaged . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany chooses munich , karlsruhe as elite universities germany 's three best , most promising universities are all located in the country 's south , a panel of experts has determined .

in pravetz , the hometown of bulgaria 's former communist dictator todor zhivkov , residents are only half-heartedly welcoming the change . joining the eu is , after all , seen as the last nail in the coffin of a communist system that at least provided jobs .
in the town cafe , a bunch of youngsters said they are sceptical and not cheering over the eu accession as " prices will rise but salaries will not .
" during zhivkov 's time , my parents had jobs and we went to the seaside every summer , " said 16-year-old lyubomir dyakov , who lives in pravetz with his grandmother .
" now my mother is a waitress in bahrain and my father is a driver in france .
i will also leave bulgaria as soon as i finish my tourism studies . "
a european town ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zhivkov was the town 's most famous resident pravetz celebrated eu accession along with the coming of the new year on its central square , which is named for zhivkov , who fell from power along with communism in 1989 after ruling for 35 years .
at the town 's entrance , an overhead banner framed by bulgarian and european flags reads : " pravetz , a european town . "
" we are awaiting the eu accession with enthusiasm and hopes for a better life for us and the young , " pravetz mayor krasimir zhivkov , who is also a distant relative of the dictator , said before the new year .
" european funds will help develop the infrastructure , " he added , praising his town 's future as " a tourist destination and an educational center . "
a us university correspondence program in business administration is already functioning in this small town west of sofia .
convicted for embezzlement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu accession was greeted with a big party on sofia 's main square formerly a small village , stuck at the foot of the balkan mountains and at one point with no sewage facilities or electricity , pravetz blossomed after zhivkov 's rise to power in 1954 and was officially declared a town in 1981 .
the town 's microprocessor plant once shipped its eight-megabyte " pravetz " computers to the whole soviet bloc .
now the plant is closed after a series of unsuccessful privatizations .
after being ousted in 1989 , zhivkov was arrested and brought to court for embezzlement of government funds .
but he was never prosecuted since bulgaria 's constitution rules that a former head of state can only be tried for treason .
the man who was moscow 's staunchest ally spent the last years of his life under house arrest in his daughter 's suburban villa outside sofia .
he died in 1998 .
moving away now the dictator 's modest home in pravetz has become a museum and his statue stands in the town 's public gardens .
pravetz suffered when communist money stopped pouring in but it is now recovering thanks to investment by former communist faithful turned businessmen .
still , a quarter of pravetz ' 5,000 residents have moved abroad , seeking jobs in italy and spain .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bulgaria had to shut off its nuclear reactors before jan .
1 " unemployment chased away my two sisters who are now babysitters in italy , " said one town resident .
" i have seen what a european union country looks like - nothing to do with the bulgarian reality . "
" people there go grocery shopping for 200 euros -lrb- $ 262 -rrb- and not for two leva -lrb- one euro -rrb- like here , " said albena ivanova , a grocer whose monthly salary stands at 81 euros .
one of her clients complained she had to start a cleaning job after years as a communist administration secretary .
" there is no longer central heating in pravetz as nobody can pay for that , " she said .

he deserves respect and acknowledgement for doing so .
a primate stanislaw wielgus would have harmed the credibility of the roman church and would have become a serious burden . he would have been compared with the former primate stefan wyszynski , who was jailed by communists for years ; wielgus would have been compared to pope john paul ii , who always stood up to the totalitarian dictatorship with courage .
considering this , wielgus did the right thing - even if he took his time . what 's known so far shows that wielgus never was a secret police agent within the church , but - rather - a cleric , who was forced to cooperate with the secret police .
no one should use this case to reinterpret historical facts : the churches in eastern europe where victims , not perpetrators , during the cold war .
that 's true for catholic , protestant and orthodox churches . in the stalinist soviet union alone , hundreds of thousands of pastors , bishops , monks , nuns and simple church members were murdered , jailed and tortured simply because of their faith .
kgb members were the so-called executive organs during the largest persecution of churches in history .
it 's understandable that church representatives in the former eastern bloc gave in to the pressure of secret police until 1991 .
only a few are born to be heroes . by now , communism is history and churches look to the future .
they have a future .
they have an important , ethical role in building a democratic civil society .
they could - and should - be a moral compass for all those , who are looking for spiritual orientation following the fall of socialism . the churches will only meet this challenge , if they apply the highest moral standards for themselves .
to put it bluntly : anyone , who - like archbishop wielgus - has obviously cooperated with the secret police , must not occupy a higher office in church hierarchy . for the new eu members bulgaria and romania , that also means that bishops , who will soon choose the respective patriarchs , should pick someone , who comes with a clean background .
the same is true for other countries in eastern and southeastern europe , such as serbia . in russia , an increasing number of top positions in state and society are filled with former secret service members .
instead of being ashamed of their dark past , they flaunt it and cozy up to the church in front of tv cameras .

he deserves respect and acknowledgement for doing so .
a primate stanislaw wielgus would have harmed the credibility of the roman church and would have become a serious burden . he would have been compared with the former primate stefan wyszynski , who was jailed by communists for years ; wielgus would have been compared to pope john paul ii , who always stood up to the totalitarian dictatorship with courage .
considering this , wielgus did the right thing - even if he took his time . what 's known so far shows that wielgus never was a secret police agent within the church , but - rather - a cleric , who was forced to cooperate with the secret police .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de education -pipe- 07.01.2007 joint university brings german know-how to oman großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : university students in the halls of learning in muscat , oman 's capital oman 's strong demand for higher learning in the sciences has led to a collaboration with a german technical college to establish the first joint university in the sultanate . in a major boost for german-omani relations , an agreement to establish the first joint university in muscat , the capital of the sultanate , was recently sealed .
the oman german university of technology -lrb- og tech -rrb- , which plans to open in september , is a collaborative effort between a group of private omani investors , the sultanate 's educational ministry , and the rhine-westphalia technical college -lrb- rwth -rrb- in the western german city of aachen . aachen 's rwth is one of europe 's oldest and most prestigious educational institutions .
the degrees conferred by og tech will be recognized in the european union , providing its graduates with a wide range of options . ogtech was the brainchild of michael jansen , a professor at rwth , who was conducting a study on urban planning and archaelogy in the medieval port city al baleed during his first visit to the sultanate 11 years ago .
from there , he drew on the inspiration to set up a partnership with sultan qaboos university . strong demand for technology and science bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german universities are reknowned for their technical know-how " it all started with a research project , supported by unesco , and then evolved into what college instructors traditionally do , which is to seek cooperation with another university , " said jansen , who spearheaded an academic exchange program that enabled german and oman students to study in each other 's countries .
" after that , it snowballed into the idea of establishing a separate university . " there is a strong demand for higher learning in technical subjects in oman , so the partnership with rwth to transfer technical know-how to an independent institution financed by private investors was a good fit , according to jansen . the aachen institution is internationally renowned for its research strengths and collaboration with various european universities , such as the imperial college in london and the paris institute for technology . bachelor of science programs on offer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oman lacks research-oriented programs leading to an advanced degree after many years in the planning stages , christoph hilgers , who is project manager of og tech , established an academic curriculum that was approved by the omani educational ministry .
next year the university will offer bachelor of science programs in mechanical engineering , applied geosciences , information technology , regional management and tourism , as well as urban design and planning , in conjunction with a pre-university program equivalent to the german high school diploma that will be launched in september with an initial enrollment of 360 students . " the main focus is on the quality of education , not on the quantity and breadth of offerings , which means operating on a smaller scale , at least initially , " hilgers said . the teaching staff and professors will be selected by aachen 's rwth with the language of instruction being english .
considering the demand for a premium education in the sultanate , jansen added that he wants to set a high standard for oman and the gulf region . programs leading to an advanced degree " there are plenty of universities that offer the bachelor 's program , " jansen said .
" what has been lacking in oman , even at the sultan qaboos university , is research-oriented approach in higher education that leads to an advanced degree .
oman is also well situated for being the center of research geographically , with iran , india and the arabian peninsula at its periphery . " in 2009 master and doctorate programs will be added to the curriculum , and by 2012 an enrolment of 2,100 students is planned , with an expansion at a later stage of up to 15,000 envisaged . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany chooses munich , karlsruhe as elite universities germany 's three best , most promising universities are all located in the country 's south , a panel of experts has determined .

in pravetz , the hometown of bulgaria 's former communist dictator todor zhivkov , residents are only half-heartedly welcoming the change . joining the eu is , after all , seen as the last nail in the coffin of a communist system that at least provided jobs .
in the town cafe , a bunch of youngsters said they are sceptical and not cheering over the eu accession as " prices will rise but salaries will not .

now the plant is closed after a series of unsuccessful privatizations .
after being ousted in 1989 , zhivkov was arrested and brought to court for embezzlement of government funds .
but he was never prosecuted since bulgaria 's constitution rules that a former head of state can only be tried for treason .

he died in 1998 .

stanislaw wielgus has been at the centre of a communist-era spying row , and recently admitted collaborating with the secret police .
he announced the decision in person at a special mass for his installation , to a mixture of applause and shouting .
the vatican 's mission in poland said in a statement that pope benedict xvi had accepted the archbishop 's resignation .
the pope has asked cardinal jozef glemp , archbishop wielgus ' predecessor , to return to his post temporarily " until further decisions have been taken concerning the archdiocese " , the brief statement added .
the bbc 's david willey in rome says the archbishop was under tremendous pressure to resign , but the decision to step down minutes before his lavish inauguration is unprecedented .
poland 's president was expected to attend the event , which has now been turned into a service in honour of cardinal glemp .
shocking archbishop wielgus was consecrated in a closed-door ceremony on friday .
in pictures : archbishop quits profile : stanislaw wielgus but he publicly admitted his collaboration , and a statement acknowledging he had not been truthful about the matter in the past was read out in churches throughout poland on saturday .
he announced his resignation on sunday morning , following urgent talks between polish and vatican officials overnight .
announcing his decision at the service with tears in his eyes , the archbishop said he had reached the decision after much reflection .
there was an immediate reaction from the congregation with applause , cheers and shouting .
people who had expected to see him inaugurated reacted by saying : " no , you ca n't do this . "
the bbc 's adam easton in warsaw says that in a country where the catholic church plays such an important role , this scandal could hardly have been more shocking .
the polish church has launched a series of investigations in recent years to identify collaborators .
krakow archbishop stanislaw dziwisz , who heads an investigation in his home diocese , said the communist era had been " a time of persecution of the church , often bloody and brutal " .
' no informing ' the decision to appoint archbishop wielgus divided opinion in the staunchly catholic country .
in one survey , two-thirds of people asked , said archbishop wielgus should resign .
his admission came after a church commission acknowledged he had collaborated with the communist secret police .
archbishop wielgus said he had had contacts with security agents , but denied informing on priests .
he said documents suggesting otherwise were drawn up only by communist " functionaries " .
pope benedict xvi made the appointment last month .
just before christmas , the vatican released a statement insisting the pope had been fully briefed on archbishop wielgus ' past and supported his appointment .
the church plays a very prominent role in polish society and was highly esteemed because of its leading role in the fight against communism in poland and worldwide , particularly during the time of polish pope john paul ii .
but historians estimate that up to 15 % of polish clergy agreed to inform on their colleagues in the communist era .

the chancellor outlined a " patriotic vision " of governing , involving " responsible , active citizens " more .
key challenges ahead included an " unprecedented " security situation , the environment and the economy , he said .
although widely tipped to take over from pm tony blair later this year , mr brown told the bbc he was " not making any assumptions " about his future .
asked on bbc one 's sunday am if he had " had that conversation " about whether he would take over before or after may 's local elections , mr brown said : " no , and it is not for me to make that announcement or decision . "
mr blair announced at the labour party conference in september that it would be his last as prime minister , but he has yet to set a date for his departure .
mr brown sidestepped questions about the day-to-day operations of leadership , such as whether he would use the prime minister 's chequers residence . "
it needs a new kind of politics in the country and it needs a new style of government for the future " gordon brown chancellor brown vow on forces homes " i 'm not interested in the trappings of office , i 'm interested in what you can do to help people , " he said .
" i think there is a job to be done for the future of britain .
the next 10 years will have challenges that are quite different from the last 10 years , " he said .
" it needs a new kind of politics in the country and it needs a new style of government for the future . "
' servant state ' he said a new approach would involve " the talents of the wider community in government " .
" it 's going to have to be for the future of our country - that 's why this is a patriotic vision .
" the idea of the state being an overbearing state , which a lot of people have associated with the governments of the past , that can not be the government of the future . "
instead he described the state as being " the servant state " prepared to listen to the people .
education , described by mr brown as his " passion " , would be a priority .
" we used to talk about education , education , education .
now it 's excellence , excellence , excellence . "
he said investment in education would increase , there were be " more choice " in the classroom and children should be kept in education until they are 18 years old .
' sofa cabinet ' mr brown defended mr blair 's style of government , often referred to by critics as a " sofa cabinet " where a select group of advisers gather in an informal setting to make decisions .
" i do n't accept that , i think that 's unfair to tony blair who has been a brilliant prime minister and an excellent leader of the labour party , and who has taken very brave and difficult decisions on so many occasions for which he should be applauded , " mr brown said .
he also said he " will be frank " when dealing with the us administration , emphasising that " the british national interest is what i and my colleagues are about . "
left-winger john mcdonnell is the only person who has publicly declared an intention to contend the pm vacancy , which is due to come by next august at the latest .

the chancellor outlined a " patriotic vision " of governing , involving " responsible , active citizens " more .
key challenges ahead included an " unprecedented " security situation , the environment and the economy , he said .
although widely tipped to take over from pm tony blair later this year , mr brown told the bbc he was " not making any assumptions " about his future .
asked on bbc one 's sunday am if he had " had that conversation " about whether he would take over before or after may 's local elections , mr brown said : " no , and it is not for me to make that announcement or decision . "
mr blair announced at the labour party conference in september that it would be his last as prime minister , but he has yet to set a date for his departure .
mr brown sidestepped questions about the day-to-day operations of leadership , such as whether he would use the prime minister 's chequers residence .
it needs a new kind of politics in the country and it needs a new style of government for the future gordon brown chancellor brown vow on forces homes " i 'm not interested in the trappings of office , i 'm interested in what you can do to help people , " he said .
" i think there is a job to be done for the future of britain .
the next 10 years will have challenges that are quite different from the last 10 years , " he said .
" it needs a new kind of politics in the country and it needs a new style of government for the future . "
' servant state ' he said a new approach would involve " the talents of the wider community in government " .
" it 's going to have to be for the future of our country - that 's why this is a patriotic vision .
" the idea of the state being an overbearing state , which a lot of people have associated with the governments of the past , that can not be the government of the future . "
instead he described the state as being " the servant state " prepared to listen to the people .
education , described by mr brown as his " passion " , would be a priority .
" we used to talk about education , education , education .
now it 's excellence , excellence , excellence . "
he said investment in education would increase , there were be " more choice " in the classroom and children should be kept in education until they are 18 years old .
' sofa cabinet ' mr brown defended mr blair 's style of government , often referred to by critics as a " sofa cabinet " where a select group of advisers gather in an informal setting to make decisions .
" i do n't accept that , i think that 's unfair to tony blair who has been a brilliant prime minister and an excellent leader of the labour party , and who has taken very brave and difficult decisions on so many occasions for which he should be applauded , " mr brown said .
he also said he " will be frank " when dealing with the us administration , emphasising that " the british national interest is what i and my colleagues are about . "
left-winger john mcdonnell is the only person who has publicly declared an intention to contend the pm vacancy , which is due to come by next august at the latest .

bishop wielgus became the focus of a furore over his past which has shocked and divided polish public opinion since he was appointed archbishop by pope benedict xvi .
he has publicly admitted that he worked with the secret service , the sluzba bezpieczenstwa -lrb- sb -rrb- , but denied that he was an informer and said he never hurt anyone .
he insisted he collaborated only in order to travel abroad and further his career .
however , his admissions have not been enough to prevent him from losing his post .
fifty meetings stanislaw wielgus was born in the village of wierzchowiska near the city of lublin , months before poland was invaded and partitioned by nazi germany and soviet russia at the start of world war ii .
he was ordained as a priest in 1962 , and it was as a philosophy student at lublin 's catholic university that he was first approached by the sb five years later .
according to archive documents made public since the fall of communism , he worked with the sb for five years and " shared his personal views and opinions with the sb officer increasingly more freely " .
in more than 50 meetings with agents he " identified candidates for operational talks from among the clergy and roman catholic academics " , the documents say .
now a professor at the university , he was granted a scholarship in munich in 1973 and began working for polish foreign intelligence .
the documents say the service tried to use him to infiltrate radio free europe .
this happened in 1978 , the year that the anti-communist polish cardinal karol wojtyla - who wielgus has described as an inspiration since his youth - became pope john paul ii .
detailed file the extent of wielgus ' collaboration in the remaining years of communism is unclear but he continued his successful academic and church career .
he became rector of lublin catholic university in 1989 and was appointed bishop of plock in central poland by the pope 10 years later .
his secret service role was first revealed by the right-wing newspaper gazeta polska in december last year , after the vatican announced his appointment as archbishop .
the paper later published the 68-page file detailing his intelligence work .
pope benedict xvi stood by the appointment , but the move divided public opinion and polls suggested a majority of poles wanted him to resign .

bishop wielgus became the focus of a furore over his past which has shocked and divided polish public opinion since he was appointed archbishop by pope benedict xvi .
he has publicly admitted that he worked with the secret service , the sluzba bezpieczenstwa -lrb- sb -rrb- , but denied that he was an informer and said he never hurt anyone .
he insisted he collaborated only in order to travel abroad and further his career .
however , his admissions have not been enough to prevent him from losing his post .
fifty meetings stanislaw wielgus was born in the village of wierzchowiska near the city of lublin , months before poland was invaded and partitioned by nazi germany and soviet russia at the start of world war ii .
he was ordained as a priest in 1962 , and it was as a philosophy student at lublin 's catholic university that he was first approached by the sb five years later .
according to archive documents made public since the fall of communism , he worked with the sb for five years and " shared his personal views and opinions with the sb officer increasingly more freely " .
in more than 50 meetings with agents he " identified candidates for operational talks from among the clergy and roman catholic academics " , the documents say .
now a professor at the university , he was granted a scholarship in munich in 1973 and began working for polish foreign intelligence .
the documents say the service tried to use him to infiltrate radio free europe .
this happened in 1978 , the year that the anti-communist polish cardinal karol wojtyla - who wielgus has described as an inspiration since his youth - became pope john paul ii .
detailed file the extent of wielgus ' collaboration in the remaining years of communism is unclear but he continued his successful academic and church career .
he became rector of lublin catholic university in 1989 and was appointed bishop of plock in central poland by the pope 10 years later .
his secret service role was first revealed by the right-wing newspaper gazeta polska in december last year , after the vatican announced his appointment as archbishop .
the paper later published the 68-page file detailing his intelligence work .
pope benedict xvi stood by the appointment , but the move divided public opinion and polls suggested a majority of poles wanted him to resign .
