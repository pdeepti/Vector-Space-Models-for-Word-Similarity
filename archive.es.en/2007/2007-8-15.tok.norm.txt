a proposal by a german government spokesman to include moderate taliban representatives in the afghan peace process has been criticized by a conservative foreign policy expert in parliament . it remained unclear how an explosion wednesday that reportedly claimed the lives of three germans would influence the current dialog debate . according to news reports , deputy government spokesman thomas steg on monday suggested that " moderate , reasonable " taliban representatives should be included in the reconstruction and reconciliation process in afghanistan . the suggestion has been criticized by karl-theodor zu guttenberg , a parliamentarian and foreign policy expert for bavaria 's conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , the sister party of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de children and families -pipe- 15.08.2007 more german fathers opting to take parental leave großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stay-at-home dads can now spend more quality time with their children in germany , recent reports show a new , more remunerative plan to encourage recent fathers to take paid parenting leave is starting to have an effect . since the beginning of the year , germany has seen a leap in the number of fathers who take time off to stay home with their young children .
the reason : a sweeping change in how parents are paid for what germans refer to as the “ babypause , ” or parental leave .
in january , germany changed its parental-leave laws to give new parents 67 percent of their salary for up to 12 months or up to 14 months if at least two months of the “ pause ” is taken by the father .
the percentage has an upper cap of 1,800 euros -lrb- $ 2,425 -rrb- a month .
previously , stay-at-home parents were given a lump sum of up to 300 euros per month , if they were eligible at all .
playing catch-up “ the fact that parental-leave payments are now based on earnings rather than a lump sum is an immense improvement over the earlier plan , ” said eberhard schaefer , a consultant and founder of the papa institute , which advises politicians , businesses and individuals on issues surrounding fathers and fatherhood .
“ germany is finally catching up with other european countries - especially in scandinavia , but others as well , " he said .
as a result of these changes , the german state approved some 200,000 applications for paid parental leave in 2007 , german family minister ursula von der leyen said in berlin on wednesday .
and the number of applications more than doubled from the first to the second quarters , from 60,000 to 140,000 per quarter .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the plan steers mothers back to the workplace “ clearly , this parental-leave policy is a hit , ” said von der leyen , whose mission to ease the road for working parents in germany has made her a controversial figure here since she took office in 2005 .
“ i am especially thrilled with the growing number of fathers who take paid parental leave , ” added von der leyen , herself a career woman with seven children .
financial effect last year , just 3.5 percent of fathers across germany took paid leave after their children were born .
today , that number is up to 8.5 percent .
the states with the highest quotas of applicants for “ papa leave ” include berlin , brandenburg , bavaria and hamburg , all of which were above the average .
at 8.5 births per 1,000 inhabitants , germany has the lowest birth rate in europe .
many observers believe this will only change when attitudes and policies become friendlier toward working parents .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von der leyen - happy with her plan 's results “ over the years i have heard from families and fathers that they couldn ’ t afford to stop working for those few months , " said papa institute 's schaefer .
" now , they are only losing 33 percent of their income , so many fathers and mothers say , ‘ ok , we can afford to do this for ourselves . ”
“ they do it gladly because they don ’ t want to lose the opportunity , ” he adds .
susanne seyda , an analyst in family economics at the institute for business -lrb- iw -rrb- in cologne , said the new regulation may simply have given more men the ability to ask for something they may have wanted all along .
previously , men may have worried about what staying home with their child would do to their career , seyda argues .
“ now they are in a stronger bargaining position when they go to ask for the time off .
the employer knows there is financial incentive , and they find it easier to understand . "
back to the work force , quicker the pro-business think tank stands behind the new plan , seyda said , because they think it could both boost german birth rates , and help get women back into the work force more quickly .
“ the opportunity costs are lower because parents don ’ t lose as much income , ” seyda noted .
“ highly qualified couples are more likely to have more children . ”
beyond that , under the new regulation , the government assistance runs out after 12 months - or 14 if the father takes two months .
then , for the mother , its back to the work force - or the assistance runs out .
under the old plan , assistance continued for three years .
“ that means women ’ s working responsibilities will grow and there will not be such a great loss of human capital , ” seyda said .
but birth rates and economic improvement is not as important as the effect such a change could have on german society , papa institute 's schaefer says .
he points out that studies have shown that fathers who spend time with their infants continue to spend more time with them as they grow up “ which could only be seen as a positive . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more fun than a day at the office ?
furthermore , experience with his own clients show that fathers don ’ t want their role to be solely that of breadwinner , or extra helper for the mother , who does the real job of raising the children .
“ they want to be seen as independent , responsible parents , ” which is often hard to negotiate when the mother has the sole , day-to-day responsibility with the children , he added .
" ca n't call for mommy " clearly , schaefer is on to something : the average length of paid leave taken by fathers so far is 4.3 months , well beyond the two months required to get the extra pay .
dieter fichter , a senior consultant at siemens in frankfurt , is beyond the “ babypause ” years .
his two children are 9 and 14 years old , and when they were infants he often put in long hours at work .
but , he said , colleagues of his now are taking the paid-leave offer , albeit just the minimum two months required to get the extra pay .
it isn ’ t seen as something that would damage their careers , he said .
“ missing two months of work is not too long , its nothing , ” fichter said .
moreover , he said , if such an offer had been available to him to him at the time , he would have taken it .
“ i think it would give you a closer relationship with your child , ” he said .
" you have a better understanding of what it means to be the person who has to take care of a child all day long , and know what its needs are , " fichter said .
" you ’ re not just with the child for a few hours on weekends .
and you can ’ t call for help from mommy if the baby is crying . ” jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

his religious-conservative party colleagues will dominate politics for years , but they should n't become complacent , says dw 's baha güngör . there 's no doubt that abdullah gül - backed by an absolute majority of parliamentarians and after three rounds of voting on aug .
28 - will become his country 's 11th president and occupy the highest office .
turkish premier erdogan 's governing religious-conservative party for justice and development -lrb- akp -rrb- has a clear majority in the national assembly with 341 of 550 seats .
since the nationalists have said that they 'll attend the first two rounds of voting on aug .
20 and aug .
24 , the two-thirds quorum mandated by the constitutional court will be present .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baha güngör the akp 's victory in the july 22 parliamentary elections was too obvious : 46 percent of votes is a clear message .
the army 's indirect coup threats and the desperate attempts of secular elites failed to prevent gül - and with him the first first lady with a headscarf in the presidential palace .
gül 's candidacy has sound democratic legitimacy and the akp will lift him into the highest office on aug .
28 - two days before the traditional " day of defense forces . "
last week , erdogan reached out to the secular opposition , during the election of the parliament 's president , by nominating köksal toptan , a compromise candidate , who was elected with an overwhelming 450 votes .
this sparked hope that erdogan would forego gül , the polarizing presidential candidate , or that the latter would simply take himself out of the race .
but gül had no intention of doing so .
why should he ?
the army , the secular elite , the constitutional court and incumbent president ahmet necedet all tried to prevent gül 's presidency by employing tactics that were hardly tolerable from a democratic point of view .
as a result , the electorate punished them severely .
gül will therefore become turkey 's highest-ranking civilian representative until 2014 .
it 's safe to bet that erdogan will do everything to replace him as the first president elected by popular vote .
on oct .
21 , turks will decide in a referendum whether the next president will be chosen by the people rather than by parliament .
if the july 22 election victory will be repeated , there 's no doubt that this change will take place - just as there 's no doubt that in seven years ' time , erdogan will be elected president of a country that has gone through an adjustment to a presidential political system by then .
it 's perfectly superfluous to restart the outdated debate about what the army will have to say about this development .
the generals ' reputation as guardians of secularism and democracy was damaged long before the indirect coup threat on april 27 in reaction to gül 's first candidacy .
since 1960 , four interventions by the military have all thrown back the country while established secular parties , led by incompetent , power-hungry politicians have surpassed each other in terms of democratic amateurism .
it remains to be seen whether erdogan and his akp will be able to handle the success and refrain from shooting themselves in the foot by rejecting a needed democratic culture of compromise and thinking that they 're infallible .
in 1983 , the religious-conservative motherland party won 45 percent of the vote after three years of military rule despite contrary " advice " for voters by the generals .
today , this party has been relegated to the sidelines outside parliament .
it 's hard to gauge turkish voters : just one year before the motherland party 's grandiose election victory , a constitution dictated by the military had been accepted in a referendum with 92 percent of votes .

a proposal by a german government spokesman to include moderate taliban representatives in the afghan peace process has been criticized by a conservative foreign policy expert in parliament . it remained unclear how an explosion wednesday that reportedly claimed the lives of three germans would influence the current dialog debate . according to news reports , deputy government spokesman thomas steg on monday suggested that " moderate , reasonable " taliban representatives should be included in the reconstruction and reconciliation process in afghanistan . the suggestion has been criticized by karl-theodor zu guttenberg , a parliamentarian and foreign policy expert for bavaria 's conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , the sister party of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- . " the taliban were and are supporters of an inhuman terror regime , " guttenberg said in a press statement .
" they have knowingly supported international terrorism and al qaeda .
these connections still exist today . " more civic participation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some boycotted a recent peace conference in kabul because taliban were not invited guttenberg added that taliban fighters should be reintegrated into afghan society , but he said that there were no signs that moderate , let alone reasonable , taliban existed . " that 's why it 's so important to continue the work against the taliban by the afghan government and the international community , " he said .
" to involve the taliban in the stabilization and reconstruction of the country would be a preposterous turn away from reality . " the chairman of the parliament 's foreign affairs committee , ruprecht polenz -lrb- cdu -rrb- , also warned against undermining the moral basis for the german and international mission in afghanistan . in an interview with the daily frankfurter rundschau , he said that including certain insurgent groups in talks would have to lead to rule of law and more civic participation for afghans - " ergo the opposite of the taliban 's terror regime until 2001 . " mutually exclusive ? berlin 's der tagesspiegel in an editorial also said steg 's comments seemed strange . " if there are -lsb- moderate , reasonable taliban -rsb- - sure , talking ca n't hurt , " the daily wrote .
" but so far , it seemed that the two things were mutually exclusive : someone is either a taliban - or reasonable . " in april , a similar controversy arose when kurt beck , the leader of germany 's social democratic party , which forms a coalition with the cdu / csu , suggested that taliban representatives should be invited to peace talks .
at the time , afghan president hamid karzai had confirmed that he was doing just that . article based on news reports -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de children and families -pipe- 15.08.2007 more german fathers opting to take parental leave großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stay-at-home dads can now spend more quality time with their children in germany , recent reports show a new , more remunerative plan to encourage recent fathers to take paid parenting leave is starting to have an effect . since the beginning of the year , germany has seen a leap in the number of fathers who take time off to stay home with their young children .
the reason : a sweeping change in how parents are paid for what germans refer to as the “ babypause , ” or parental leave .
in january , germany changed its parental-leave laws to give new parents 67 percent of their salary for up to 12 months or up to 14 months if at least two months of the “ pause ” is taken by the father .
the percentage has an upper cap of 1,800 euros -lrb- $ 2,425 -rrb- a month .
previously , stay-at-home parents were given a lump sum of up to 300 euros per month , if they were eligible at all .
playing catch-up “ the fact that parental-leave payments are now based on earnings rather than a lump sum is an immense improvement over the earlier plan , ” said eberhard schaefer , a consultant and founder of the papa institute , which advises politicians , businesses and individuals on issues surrounding fathers and fatherhood .
“ germany is finally catching up with other european countries - especially in scandinavia , but others as well , " he said .
as a result of these changes , the german state approved some 200,000 applications for paid parental leave in 2007 , german family minister ursula von der leyen said in berlin on wednesday .
and the number of applications more than doubled from the first to the second quarters , from 60,000 to 140,000 per quarter .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the plan steers mothers back to the workplace “ clearly , this parental-leave policy is a hit , ” said von der leyen , whose mission to ease the road for working parents in germany has made her a controversial figure here since she took office in 2005 .
“ i am especially thrilled with the growing number of fathers who take paid parental leave , ” added von der leyen , herself a career woman with seven children .
financial effect last year , just 3.5 percent of fathers across germany took paid leave after their children were born .
today , that number is up to 8.5 percent .
the states with the highest quotas of applicants for “ papa leave ” include berlin , brandenburg , bavaria and hamburg , all of which were above the average .
at 8.5 births per 1,000 inhabitants , germany has the lowest birth rate in europe .
many observers believe this will only change when attitudes and policies become friendlier toward working parents .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von der leyen - happy with her plan 's results “ over the years i have heard from families and fathers that they couldn ’ t afford to stop working for those few months , " said papa institute 's schaefer .
" now , they are only losing 33 percent of their income , so many fathers and mothers say , ‘ ok , we can afford to do this for ourselves . ”
“ they do it gladly because they don ’ t want to lose the opportunity , ” he adds .
susanne seyda , an analyst in family economics at the institute for business -lrb- iw -rrb- in cologne , said the new regulation may simply have given more men the ability to ask for something they may have wanted all along .
previously , men may have worried about what staying home with their child would do to their career , seyda argues .
“ now they are in a stronger bargaining position when they go to ask for the time off .
the employer knows there is financial incentive , and they find it easier to understand . "
back to the work force , quicker the pro-business think tank stands behind the new plan , seyda said , because they think it could both boost german birth rates , and help get women back into the work force more quickly .
“ the opportunity costs are lower because parents don ’ t lose as much income , ” seyda noted .
“ highly qualified couples are more likely to have more children . ”
beyond that , under the new regulation , the government assistance runs out after 12 months - or 14 if the father takes two months .
then , for the mother , its back to the work force - or the assistance runs out .
under the old plan , assistance continued for three years .
“ that means women ’ s working responsibilities will grow and there will not be such a great loss of human capital , ” seyda said .
but birth rates and economic improvement is not as important as the effect such a change could have on german society , papa institute 's schaefer says .
he points out that studies have shown that fathers who spend time with their infants continue to spend more time with them as they grow up “ which could only be seen as a positive . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more fun than a day at the office ?
furthermore , experience with his own clients show that fathers don ’ t want their role to be solely that of breadwinner , or extra helper for the mother , who does the real job of raising the children .
“ they want to be seen as independent , responsible parents , ” which is often hard to negotiate when the mother has the sole , day-to-day responsibility with the children , he added .
" ca n't call for mommy " clearly , schaefer is on to something : the average length of paid leave taken by fathers so far is 4.3 months , well beyond the two months required to get the extra pay .
dieter fichter , a senior consultant at siemens in frankfurt , is beyond the “ babypause ” years .
his two children are 9 and 14 years old , and when they were infants he often put in long hours at work .
but , he said , colleagues of his now are taking the paid-leave offer , albeit just the minimum two months required to get the extra pay .
it isn ’ t seen as something that would damage their careers , he said .
“ missing two months of work is not too long , its nothing , ” fichter said .
moreover , he said , if such an offer had been available to him to him at the time , he would have taken it .
“ i think it would give you a closer relationship with your child , ” he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de turkey -pipe- 15.08.2007 opinion : turkey 's unpredictable electorate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's foreign minister is set to become his country 's next president .
his religious-conservative party colleagues will dominate politics for years , but they should n't become complacent , says dw 's baha güngör . there 's no doubt that abdullah gül - backed by an absolute majority of parliamentarians and after three rounds of voting on aug .
28 - will become his country 's 11th president and occupy the highest office .
turkish premier erdogan 's governing religious-conservative party for justice and development -lrb- akp -rrb- has a clear majority in the national assembly with 341 of 550 seats .
since the nationalists have said that they 'll attend the first two rounds of voting on aug .
20 and aug .
24 , the two-thirds quorum mandated by the constitutional court will be present .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baha güngör the akp 's victory in the july 22 parliamentary elections was too obvious : 46 percent of votes is a clear message .
the army 's indirect coup threats and the desperate attempts of secular elites failed to prevent gül - and with him the first first lady with a headscarf in the presidential palace .
gül 's candidacy has sound democratic legitimacy and the akp will lift him into the highest office on aug .
28 - two days before the traditional " day of defense forces . "
last week , erdogan reached out to the secular opposition , during the election of the parliament 's president , by nominating köksal toptan , a compromise candidate , who was elected with an overwhelming 450 votes .
this sparked hope that erdogan would forego gül , the polarizing presidential candidate , or that the latter would simply take himself out of the race .
but gül had no intention of doing so .
why should he ?
the army , the secular elite , the constitutional court and incumbent president ahmet necedet all tried to prevent gül 's presidency by employing tactics that were hardly tolerable from a democratic point of view .
as a result , the electorate punished them severely .
gül will therefore become turkey 's highest-ranking civilian representative until 2014 .
it 's safe to bet that erdogan will do everything to replace him as the first president elected by popular vote .
on oct .
21 , turks will decide in a referendum whether the next president will be chosen by the people rather than by parliament .
if the july 22 election victory will be repeated , there 's no doubt that this change will take place - just as there 's no doubt that in seven years ' time , erdogan will be elected president of a country that has gone through an adjustment to a presidential political system by then .
it 's perfectly superfluous to restart the outdated debate about what the army will have to say about this development .
the generals ' reputation as guardians of secularism and democracy was damaged long before the indirect coup threat on april 27 in reaction to gül 's first candidacy .
since 1960 , four interventions by the military have all thrown back the country while established secular parties , led by incompetent , power-hungry politicians have surpassed each other in terms of democratic amateurism .
it remains to be seen whether erdogan and his akp will be able to handle the success and refrain from shooting themselves in the foot by rejecting a needed democratic culture of compromise and thinking that they 're infallible .
in 1983 , the religious-conservative motherland party won 45 percent of the vote after three years of military rule despite contrary " advice " for voters by the generals .
today , this party has been relegated to the sidelines outside parliament .
it 's hard to gauge turkish voters : just one year before the motherland party 's grandiose election victory , a constitution dictated by the military had been accepted in a referendum with 92 percent of votes .

the reason : a sweeping change in how parents are paid for what germans refer to as the “ babypause , ” or parental leave .
in january , germany changed its parental-leave laws to give new parents 67 percent of their salary for up to 12 months or up to 14 months if at least two months of the “ pause ” is taken by the father .
the percentage has an upper cap of 1,800 euros -lrb- $ 2,425 -rrb- a month .
previously , stay-at-home parents were given a lump sum of up to 300 euros per month , if they were eligible at all .
playing catch-up “ the fact that parental-leave payments are now based on earnings rather than a lump sum is an immense improvement over the earlier plan , ” said eberhard schaefer , a consultant and founder of the papa institute , which advises politicians , businesses and individuals on issues surrounding fathers and fatherhood .
“ germany is finally catching up with other european countries - especially in scandinavia , but others as well , " he said .
as a result of these changes , the german state approved some 200,000 applications for paid parental leave in 2007 , german family minister ursula von der leyen said in berlin on wednesday .
and the number of applications more than doubled from the first to the second quarters , from 60,000 to 140,000 per quarter .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the plan steers mothers back to the workplace “ clearly , this parental-leave policy is a hit , ” said von der leyen , whose mission to ease the road for working parents in germany has made her a controversial figure here since she took office in 2005 .
“ i am especially thrilled with the growing number of fathers who take paid parental leave , ” added von der leyen , herself a career woman with seven children .
financial effect last year , just 3.5 percent of fathers across germany took paid leave after their children were born .
today , that number is up to 8.5 percent .
the states with the highest quotas of applicants for “ papa leave ” include berlin , brandenburg , bavaria and hamburg , all of which were above the average .
at 8.5 births per 1,000 inhabitants , germany has the lowest birth rate in europe .
many observers believe this will only change when attitudes and policies become friendlier toward working parents .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von der leyen - happy with her plan 's results “ over the years i have heard from families and fathers that they couldn ’ t afford to stop working for those few months , " said papa institute 's schaefer .
" now , they are only losing 33 percent of their income , so many fathers and mothers say , ‘ ok , we can afford to do this for ourselves . ”
“ they do it gladly because they don ’ t want to lose the opportunity , ” he adds .
susanne seyda , an analyst in family economics at the institute for business -lrb- iw -rrb- in cologne , said the new regulation may simply have given more men the ability to ask for something they may have wanted all along .
previously , men may have worried about what staying home with their child would do to their career , seyda argues .
“ now they are in a stronger bargaining position when they go to ask for the time off .
the employer knows there is financial incentive , and they find it easier to understand . "
back to the work force , quicker the pro-business think tank stands behind the new plan , seyda said , because they think it could both boost german birth rates , and help get women back into the work force more quickly .
“ the opportunity costs are lower because parents don ’ t lose as much income , ” seyda noted .
“ highly qualified couples are more likely to have more children . ”
beyond that , under the new regulation , the government assistance runs out after 12 months - or 14 if the father takes two months .
then , for the mother , its back to the work force - or the assistance runs out .
under the old plan , assistance continued for three years .
“ that means women ’ s working responsibilities will grow and there will not be such a great loss of human capital , ” seyda said .
but birth rates and economic improvement is not as important as the effect such a change could have on german society , papa institute 's schaefer says .
he points out that studies have shown that fathers who spend time with their infants continue to spend more time with them as they grow up “ which could only be seen as a positive . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more fun than a day at the office ?
furthermore , experience with his own clients show that fathers don ’ t want their role to be solely that of breadwinner , or extra helper for the mother , who does the real job of raising the children .
“ they want to be seen as independent , responsible parents , ” which is often hard to negotiate when the mother has the sole , day-to-day responsibility with the children , he added .
" ca n't call for mommy " clearly , schaefer is on to something : the average length of paid leave taken by fathers so far is 4.3 months , well beyond the two months required to get the extra pay .
dieter fichter , a senior consultant at siemens in frankfurt , is beyond the “ babypause ” years .
his two children are 9 and 14 years old , and when they were infants he often put in long hours at work .
but , he said , colleagues of his now are taking the paid-leave offer , albeit just the minimum two months required to get the extra pay .
it isn ’ t seen as something that would damage their careers , he said .
“ missing two months of work is not too long , its nothing , ” fichter said .
moreover , he said , if such an offer had been available to him to him at the time , he would have taken it .
“ i think it would give you a closer relationship with your child , ” he said .
" you have a better understanding of what it means to be the person who has to take care of a child all day long , and know what its needs are , " fichter said .
" you ’ re not just with the child for a few hours on weekends .
and you can ’ t call for help from mommy if the baby is crying . ” jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a proposal by a german government spokesman to include moderate taliban representatives in the afghan peace process has been criticized by a conservative foreign policy expert in parliament . it remained unclear how an explosion wednesday that reportedly claimed the lives of three germans would influence the current dialog debate . according to news reports , deputy government spokesman thomas steg on monday suggested that " moderate , reasonable " taliban representatives should be included in the reconstruction and reconciliation process in afghanistan . the suggestion has been criticized by karl-theodor zu guttenberg , a parliamentarian and foreign policy expert for bavaria 's conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , the sister party of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- . " the taliban were and are supporters of an inhuman terror regime , " guttenberg said in a press statement .
" they have knowingly supported international terrorism and al qaeda .
these connections still exist today . " more civic participation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some boycotted a recent peace conference in kabul because taliban were not invited guttenberg added that taliban fighters should be reintegrated into afghan society , but he said that there were no signs that moderate , let alone reasonable , taliban existed . " that 's why it 's so important to continue the work against the taliban by the afghan government and the international community , " he said .
" to involve the taliban in the stabilization and reconstruction of the country would be a preposterous turn away from reality . " the chairman of the parliament 's foreign affairs committee , ruprecht polenz -lrb- cdu -rrb- , also warned against undermining the moral basis for the german and international mission in afghanistan . in an interview with the daily frankfurter rundschau , he said that including certain insurgent groups in talks would have to lead to rule of law and more civic participation for afghans - " ergo the opposite of the taliban 's terror regime until 2001 . " mutually exclusive ? berlin 's der tagesspiegel in an editorial also said steg 's comments seemed strange . " if there are -lsb- moderate , reasonable taliban -rsb- - sure , talking ca n't hurt , " the daily wrote .
" but so far , it seemed that the two things were mutually exclusive : someone is either a taliban - or reasonable . " in april , a similar controversy arose when kurt beck , the leader of germany 's social democratic party , which forms a coalition with the cdu / csu , suggested that taliban representatives should be invited to peace talks .

after only three days of talks , the troika said it could no longer rule out a division of kosovo into albanian and serbian sectors .
on dec .
10 , the troika is due to present a report to the un on the way forward .
erhard busek of austria has been the eu coordinator of the stability pact for south-eastern europe since 2002 .
dw-radio : in view of the resistance from kosovo albanians , how realistic is the concept of a division of kosovo ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erhard busek erhard busek : at the moment there are only proposals to which someone has expressed opposition .
if you act on that assumption , then there 's no proposal whatsoever , but that 's not a solution .
any compromise that comes about wo n't receive the agreement of both disputing parties , but there must of course be a solution with which one can live , and that must be the assumption .
of all the bad solutions , that is at least a possible one .
there 's only the possibility of either reaching a virtual rapprochement or to decide in one way or another in conflict , with all the consequences that involves .
many observers have indicated that a compromise is n't at all possible .
what perspective do you see for the current 120-day attempt at dialogue ?
the perspective is rather clear .
if there is some area where the parties at least come close , where the distance diminishes , then there is a possibility .
it will hardly be a solution , where one can speak of great agreements .
the other " solution " is of course that it could cause a unilateral process of recognition .
that , however , brings up its own problems .
that starts already within the european union .
the mandates of the united nations mission in kosovo -lrb- unmik -rrb- and nato 's kosovo force -lrb- kfor -rrb- stem from un resolution 1244 .
these institutions can hardly go beyond their means .
unilateral recognition would in any case occur without the un .
everyone has to be clear on that .
many are of course scared of by that - and with good reason .
there 's also the problem that the eu plays a significant role in the development of institutions in kosovo - but on the basis of what mandate should it then do that ?
that 's where the resulting problems begin .
what would happen to kfor if the un was no longer involved ?
you have to ask those in favor of unilateral recognition .
do you think that unilateral recognition is n't doable , or is n't desirable ?
not desirable .
everything is doable , for , politics is , as you know , the art of the possible .
the six-nation contract group , composed of the us , britain , france , germany , italy and russia , has so far rejected division as one of its basic principles .
can the troika , which was named by the contact group , move away from the principles ?
here , too , politics is the art of the possible .
the principles have been mentioned repeatedly due to the " parallel cases . "
i think you have to very clearly establish that the kosovo question in itself does n't produce any solutions for parallel cases , but rather poses a unique problem .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo 's premier ceku , second left , with the troika members it is after all the only case of a nato intervention .
that has never happened before in such a manner .
to that extent , drawing parallels is exceedingly problematic .
here the question is more on the side of the security council .
there were definitely also serbian views that could imagine a sort of division under certain conditions .
in this respect , the troika surely had a reason for the proposal to resurface again .
many observers have cited republika srpska as a precedent .
you do n't see it that way ?
i do n't see a precedent there at all , since it was a different situation .
in tito 's yugoslavia , bosnia and herzegovina was also a constituent republic .
that had a different , deeply rooted tradition .
on the other hand , i did n't always have the impression that people in belgrade would be so enthusiastic if that problem were also to arise .
a clear geographical division of kosovo is n't even possible .
that 's right , that 's a majority solution .
serbs in other parts of kosovo would stay behind .
one should n't underestimate that then , albanians in the presevo valley would also express wishes when it comes to serbia and demand adjustments to the border .
in any case , it means opening a pandora 's box .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de turkey -pipe- 15.08.2007 opinion : turkey 's unpredictable electorate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's foreign minister is set to become his country 's next president .
his religious-conservative party colleagues will dominate politics for years , but they should n't become complacent , says dw 's baha güngör . there 's no doubt that abdullah gül - backed by an absolute majority of parliamentarians and after three rounds of voting on aug .
28 - will become his country 's 11th president and occupy the highest office .
turkish premier erdogan 's governing religious-conservative party for justice and development -lrb- akp -rrb- has a clear majority in the national assembly with 341 of 550 seats .
since the nationalists have said that they 'll attend the first two rounds of voting on aug .
20 and aug .
24 , the two-thirds quorum mandated by the constitutional court will be present .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baha güngör the akp 's victory in the july 22 parliamentary elections was too obvious : 46 percent of votes is a clear message .
the army 's indirect coup threats and the desperate attempts of secular elites failed to prevent gül - and with him the first first lady with a headscarf in the presidential palace .
gül 's candidacy has sound democratic legitimacy and the akp will lift him into the highest office on aug .
28 - two days before the traditional " day of defense forces . "
last week , erdogan reached out to the secular opposition , during the election of the parliament 's president , by nominating köksal toptan , a compromise candidate , who was elected with an overwhelming 450 votes .
this sparked hope that erdogan would forego gül , the polarizing presidential candidate , or that the latter would simply take himself out of the race .
but gül had no intention of doing so .
why should he ?
the army , the secular elite , the constitutional court and incumbent president ahmet necedet all tried to prevent gül 's presidency by employing tactics that were hardly tolerable from a democratic point of view .
as a result , the electorate punished them severely .
gül will therefore become turkey 's highest-ranking civilian representative until 2014 .
it 's safe to bet that erdogan will do everything to replace him as the first president elected by popular vote .
on oct .
21 , turks will decide in a referendum whether the next president will be chosen by the people rather than by parliament .
if the july 22 election victory will be repeated , there 's no doubt that this change will take place - just as there 's no doubt that in seven years ' time , erdogan will be elected president of a country that has gone through an adjustment to a presidential political system by then .
it 's perfectly superfluous to restart the outdated debate about what the army will have to say about this development .
the generals ' reputation as guardians of secularism and democracy was damaged long before the indirect coup threat on april 27 in reaction to gül 's first candidacy .
since 1960 , four interventions by the military have all thrown back the country while established secular parties , led by incompetent , power-hungry politicians have surpassed each other in terms of democratic amateurism .
it remains to be seen whether erdogan and his akp will be able to handle the success and refrain from shooting themselves in the foot by rejecting a needed democratic culture of compromise and thinking that they 're infallible .
in 1983 , the religious-conservative motherland party won 45 percent of the vote after three years of military rule despite contrary " advice " for voters by the generals .
today , this party has been relegated to the sidelines outside parliament .
it 's hard to gauge turkish voters : just one year before the motherland party 's grandiose election victory , a constitution dictated by the military had been accepted in a referendum with 92 percent of votes .

in january , germany changed its parental-leave laws to give new parents 67 percent of their salary for up to 12 months or up to 14 months if at least two months of the “ pause ” is taken by the father .
the percentage has an upper cap of 1,800 euros -lrb- $ 2,425 -rrb- a month .
previously , stay-at-home parents were given a lump sum of up to 300 euros per month , if they were eligible at all .
playing catch-up “ the fact that parental-leave payments are now based on earnings rather than a lump sum is an immense improvement over the earlier plan , ” said eberhard schaefer , a consultant and founder of the papa institute , which advises politicians , businesses and individuals on issues surrounding fathers and fatherhood .
“ germany is finally catching up with other european countries - especially in scandinavia , but others as well , " he said .
as a result of these changes , the german state approved some 200,000 applications for paid parental leave in 2007 , german family minister ursula von der leyen said in berlin on wednesday .
and the number of applications more than doubled from the first to the second quarters , from 60,000 to 140,000 per quarter .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the plan steers mothers back to the workplace “ clearly , this parental-leave policy is a hit , ” said von der leyen , whose mission to ease the road for working parents in germany has made her a controversial figure here since she took office in 2005 .
“ i am especially thrilled with the growing number of fathers who take paid parental leave , ” added von der leyen , herself a career woman with seven children .
financial effect last year , just 3.5 percent of fathers across germany took paid leave after their children were born .
today , that number is up to 8.5 percent .
the states with the highest quotas of applicants for “ papa leave ” include berlin , brandenburg , bavaria and hamburg , all of which were above the average .
at 8.5 births per 1,000 inhabitants , germany has the lowest birth rate in europe .
many observers believe this will only change when attitudes and policies become friendlier toward working parents .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von der leyen - happy with her plan 's results “ over the years i have heard from families and fathers that they couldn ’ t afford to stop working for those few months , " said papa institute 's schaefer .
" now , they are only losing 33 percent of their income , so many fathers and mothers say , ‘ ok , we can afford to do this for ourselves . ”
“ they do it gladly because they don ’ t want to lose the opportunity , ” he adds .
susanne seyda , an analyst in family economics at the institute for business -lrb- iw -rrb- in cologne , said the new regulation may simply have given more men the ability to ask for something they may have wanted all along .
previously , men may have worried about what staying home with their child would do to their career , seyda argues .
“ now they are in a stronger bargaining position when they go to ask for the time off .
the employer knows there is financial incentive , and they find it easier to understand . "
back to the work force , quicker the pro-business think tank stands behind the new plan , seyda said , because they think it could both boost german birth rates , and help get women back into the work force more quickly .
“ the opportunity costs are lower because parents don ’ t lose as much income , ” seyda noted .
“ highly qualified couples are more likely to have more children . ”
beyond that , under the new regulation , the government assistance runs out after 12 months - or 14 if the father takes two months .
then , for the mother , its back to the work force - or the assistance runs out .
under the old plan , assistance continued for three years .
“ that means women ’ s working responsibilities will grow and there will not be such a great loss of human capital , ” seyda said .
but birth rates and economic improvement is not as important as the effect such a change could have on german society , papa institute 's schaefer says .
he points out that studies have shown that fathers who spend time with their infants continue to spend more time with them as they grow up “ which could only be seen as a positive . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more fun than a day at the office ?
furthermore , experience with his own clients show that fathers don ’ t want their role to be solely that of breadwinner , or extra helper for the mother , who does the real job of raising the children .
“ they want to be seen as independent , responsible parents , ” which is often hard to negotiate when the mother has the sole , day-to-day responsibility with the children , he added .
" ca n't call for mommy " clearly , schaefer is on to something : the average length of paid leave taken by fathers so far is 4.3 months , well beyond the two months required to get the extra pay .
dieter fichter , a senior consultant at siemens in frankfurt , is beyond the “ babypause ” years .
his two children are 9 and 14 years old , and when they were infants he often put in long hours at work .
but , he said , colleagues of his now are taking the paid-leave offer , albeit just the minimum two months required to get the extra pay .
it isn ’ t seen as something that would damage their careers , he said .
“ missing two months of work is not too long , its nothing , ” fichter said .
moreover , he said , if such an offer had been available to him to him at the time , he would have taken it .
“ i think it would give you a closer relationship with your child , ” he said .
" you have a better understanding of what it means to be the person who has to take care of a child all day long , and know what its needs are , " fichter said .
" you ’ re not just with the child for a few hours on weekends .
and you can ’ t call for help from mommy if the baby is crying . ” jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erhard busek erhard busek : at the moment there are only proposals to which someone has expressed opposition .
if you act on that assumption , then there 's no proposal whatsoever , but that 's not a solution .
any compromise that comes about wo n't receive the agreement of both disputing parties , but there must of course be a solution with which one can live , and that must be the assumption .
of all the bad solutions , that is at least a possible one .
there 's only the possibility of either reaching a virtual rapprochement or to decide in one way or another in conflict , with all the consequences that involves .
many observers have indicated that a compromise is n't at all possible .
what perspective do you see for the current 120-day attempt at dialogue ?
the perspective is rather clear .
if there is some area where the parties at least come close , where the distance diminishes , then there is a possibility .
it will hardly be a solution , where one can speak of great agreements .
the other " solution " is of course that it could cause a unilateral process of recognition .
that , however , brings up its own problems .
that starts already within the european union .

these institutions can hardly go beyond their means .
unilateral recognition would in any case occur without the un .
everyone has to be clear on that .
many are of course scared of by that - and with good reason .

that 's where the resulting problems begin .
what would happen to kfor if the un was no longer involved ?
you have to ask those in favor of unilateral recognition .
do you think that unilateral recognition is n't doable , or is n't desirable ?
not desirable .
everything is doable , for , politics is , as you know , the art of the possible .

can the troika , which was named by the contact group , move away from the principles ?

after only three days of talks , the troika said it could no longer rule out a division of kosovo into albanian and serbian sectors .
on dec .
10 , the troika is due to present a report to the un on the way forward .
erhard busek of austria has been the eu coordinator of the stability pact for south-eastern europe since 2002 .
dw-radio : in view of the resistance from kosovo albanians , how realistic is the concept of a division of kosovo ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erhard busek erhard busek : at the moment there are only proposals to which someone has expressed opposition .
if you act on that assumption , then there 's no proposal whatsoever , but that 's not a solution .
any compromise that comes about wo n't receive the agreement of both disputing parties , but there must of course be a solution with which one can live , and that must be the assumption .
of all the bad solutions , that is at least a possible one .
there 's only the possibility of either reaching a virtual rapprochement or to decide in one way or another in conflict , with all the consequences that involves .
many observers have indicated that a compromise is n't at all possible .
what perspective do you see for the current 120-day attempt at dialogue ?
the perspective is rather clear .
if there is some area where the parties at least come close , where the distance diminishes , then there is a possibility .
it will hardly be a solution , where one can speak of great agreements .
the other " solution " is of course that it could cause a unilateral process of recognition .
that , however , brings up its own problems .
that starts already within the european union .
the mandates of the united nations mission in kosovo -lrb- unmik -rrb- and nato 's kosovo force -lrb- kfor -rrb- stem from un resolution 1244 .
these institutions can hardly go beyond their means .
unilateral recognition would in any case occur without the un .
everyone has to be clear on that .
many are of course scared of by that - and with good reason .
there 's also the problem that the eu plays a significant role in the development of institutions in kosovo - but on the basis of what mandate should it then do that ?
that 's where the resulting problems begin .
what would happen to kfor if the un was no longer involved ?
you have to ask those in favor of unilateral recognition .
do you think that unilateral recognition is n't doable , or is n't desirable ?
not desirable .
everything is doable , for , politics is , as you know , the art of the possible .
the six-nation contract group , composed of the us , britain , france , germany , italy and russia , has so far rejected division as one of its basic principles .
can the troika , which was named by the contact group , move away from the principles ?
here , too , politics is the art of the possible .
the principles have been mentioned repeatedly due to the " parallel cases . "
i think you have to very clearly establish that the kosovo question in itself does n't produce any solutions for parallel cases , but rather poses a unique problem .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo 's premier ceku , second left , with the troika members it is after all the only case of a nato intervention .
that has never happened before in such a manner .
to that extent , drawing parallels is exceedingly problematic .
here the question is more on the side of the security council .
there were definitely also serbian views that could imagine a sort of division under certain conditions .
in this respect , the troika surely had a reason for the proposal to resurface again .
many observers have cited republika srpska as a precedent .
you do n't see it that way ?
i do n't see a precedent there at all , since it was a different situation .
in tito 's yugoslavia , bosnia and herzegovina was also a constituent republic .
that had a different , deeply rooted tradition .
on the other hand , i did n't always have the impression that people in belgrade would be so enthusiastic if that problem were also to arise .
a clear geographical division of kosovo is n't even possible .
that 's right , that 's a majority solution .
serbs in other parts of kosovo would stay behind .
one should n't underestimate that then , albanians in the presevo valley would also express wishes when it comes to serbia and demand adjustments to the border .
in any case , it means opening a pandora 's box .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de turkey -pipe- 15.08.2007 opinion : turkey 's unpredictable electorate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's foreign minister is set to become his country 's next president .
his religious-conservative party colleagues will dominate politics for years , but they should n't become complacent , says dw 's baha güngör . there 's no doubt that abdullah gül - backed by an absolute majority of parliamentarians and after three rounds of voting on aug .
28 - will become his country 's 11th president and occupy the highest office .
turkish premier erdogan 's governing religious-conservative party for justice and development -lrb- akp -rrb- has a clear majority in the national assembly with 341 of 550 seats .
since the nationalists have said that they 'll attend the first two rounds of voting on aug .
20 and aug .
24 , the two-thirds quorum mandated by the constitutional court will be present .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baha güngör the akp 's victory in the july 22 parliamentary elections was too obvious : 46 percent of votes is a clear message .
the army 's indirect coup threats and the desperate attempts of secular elites failed to prevent gül - and with him the first first lady with a headscarf in the presidential palace .
gül 's candidacy has sound democratic legitimacy and the akp will lift him into the highest office on aug .
28 - two days before the traditional " day of defense forces . "
last week , erdogan reached out to the secular opposition , during the election of the parliament 's president , by nominating köksal toptan , a compromise candidate , who was elected with an overwhelming 450 votes .
this sparked hope that erdogan would forego gül , the polarizing presidential candidate , or that the latter would simply take himself out of the race .
but gül had no intention of doing so .
why should he ?
the army , the secular elite , the constitutional court and incumbent president ahmet necedet all tried to prevent gül 's presidency by employing tactics that were hardly tolerable from a democratic point of view .
as a result , the electorate punished them severely .
gül will therefore become turkey 's highest-ranking civilian representative until 2014 .
it 's safe to bet that erdogan will do everything to replace him as the first president elected by popular vote .
on oct .
21 , turks will decide in a referendum whether the next president will be chosen by the people rather than by parliament .
if the july 22 election victory will be repeated , there 's no doubt that this change will take place - just as there 's no doubt that in seven years ' time , erdogan will be elected president of a country that has gone through an adjustment to a presidential political system by then .
it 's perfectly superfluous to restart the outdated debate about what the army will have to say about this development .
the generals ' reputation as guardians of secularism and democracy was damaged long before the indirect coup threat on april 27 in reaction to gül 's first candidacy .
since 1960 , four interventions by the military have all thrown back the country while established secular parties , led by incompetent , power-hungry politicians have surpassed each other in terms of democratic amateurism .
it remains to be seen whether erdogan and his akp will be able to handle the success and refrain from shooting themselves in the foot by rejecting a needed democratic culture of compromise and thinking that they 're infallible .
in 1983 , the religious-conservative motherland party won 45 percent of the vote after three years of military rule despite contrary " advice " for voters by the generals .
today , this party has been relegated to the sidelines outside parliament .
it 's hard to gauge turkish voters : just one year before the motherland party 's grandiose election victory , a constitution dictated by the military had been accepted in a referendum with 92 percent of votes .

a proposal by a german government spokesman to include moderate taliban representatives in the afghan peace process has been criticized by a conservative foreign policy expert in parliament . it remained unclear how an explosion wednesday that reportedly claimed the lives of three germans would influence the current dialog debate . according to news reports , deputy government spokesman thomas steg on monday suggested that " moderate , reasonable " taliban representatives should be included in the reconstruction and reconciliation process in afghanistan . the suggestion has been criticized by karl-theodor zu guttenberg , a parliamentarian and foreign policy expert for bavaria 's conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , the sister party of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- .

after only three days of talks , the troika said it could no longer rule out a division of kosovo into albanian and serbian sectors .
on dec .
10 , the troika is due to present a report to the un on the way forward .
erhard busek of austria has been the eu coordinator of the stability pact for south-eastern europe since 2002 .
dw-radio : in view of the resistance from kosovo albanians , how realistic is the concept of a division of kosovo ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erhard busek erhard busek : at the moment there are only proposals to which someone has expressed opposition .
if you act on that assumption , then there 's no proposal whatsoever , but that 's not a solution .
any compromise that comes about wo n't receive the agreement of both disputing parties , but there must of course be a solution with which one can live , and that must be the assumption .
of all the bad solutions , that is at least a possible one .
there 's only the possibility of either reaching a virtual rapprochement or to decide in one way or another in conflict , with all the consequences that involves .
many observers have indicated that a compromise is n't at all possible .
what perspective do you see for the current 120-day attempt at dialogue ?
the perspective is rather clear .
if there is some area where the parties at least come close , where the distance diminishes , then there is a possibility .
it will hardly be a solution , where one can speak of great agreements .
the other " solution " is of course that it could cause a unilateral process of recognition .
that , however , brings up its own problems .
that starts already within the european union .
the mandates of the united nations mission in kosovo -lrb- unmik -rrb- and nato 's kosovo force -lrb- kfor -rrb- stem from un resolution 1244 .
these institutions can hardly go beyond their means .
unilateral recognition would in any case occur without the un .
everyone has to be clear on that .
many are of course scared of by that - and with good reason .
there 's also the problem that the eu plays a significant role in the development of institutions in kosovo - but on the basis of what mandate should it then do that ?
that 's where the resulting problems begin .
what would happen to kfor if the un was no longer involved ?
you have to ask those in favor of unilateral recognition .
do you think that unilateral recognition is n't doable , or is n't desirable ?
not desirable .
everything is doable , for , politics is , as you know , the art of the possible .
the six-nation contract group , composed of the us , britain , france , germany , italy and russia , has so far rejected division as one of its basic principles .
can the troika , which was named by the contact group , move away from the principles ?
here , too , politics is the art of the possible .
the principles have been mentioned repeatedly due to the " parallel cases . "
i think you have to very clearly establish that the kosovo question in itself does n't produce any solutions for parallel cases , but rather poses a unique problem .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo 's premier ceku , second left , with the troika members it is after all the only case of a nato intervention .
that has never happened before in such a manner .
to that extent , drawing parallels is exceedingly problematic .
here the question is more on the side of the security council .
there were definitely also serbian views that could imagine a sort of division under certain conditions .
in this respect , the troika surely had a reason for the proposal to resurface again .
many observers have cited republika srpska as a precedent .
you do n't see it that way ?
i do n't see a precedent there at all , since it was a different situation .
in tito 's yugoslavia , bosnia and herzegovina was also a constituent republic .
that had a different , deeply rooted tradition .
on the other hand , i did n't always have the impression that people in belgrade would be so enthusiastic if that problem were also to arise .
a clear geographical division of kosovo is n't even possible .
that 's right , that 's a majority solution .
serbs in other parts of kosovo would stay behind .
one should n't underestimate that then , albanians in the presevo valley would also express wishes when it comes to serbia and demand adjustments to the border .

after only three days of talks , the troika said it could no longer rule out a division of kosovo into albanian and serbian sectors .
on dec .
10 , the troika is due to present a report to the un on the way forward .
erhard busek of austria has been the eu coordinator of the stability pact for south-eastern europe since 2002 .
dw-radio : in view of the resistance from kosovo albanians , how realistic is the concept of a division of kosovo ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erhard busek erhard busek : at the moment there are only proposals to which someone has expressed opposition .
if you act on that assumption , then there 's no proposal whatsoever , but that 's not a solution .
any compromise that comes about wo n't receive the agreement of both disputing parties , but there must of course be a solution with which one can live , and that must be the assumption .
of all the bad solutions , that is at least a possible one .
there 's only the possibility of either reaching a virtual rapprochement or to decide in one way or another in conflict , with all the consequences that involves .
many observers have indicated that a compromise is n't at all possible .
what perspective do you see for the current 120-day attempt at dialogue ?
the perspective is rather clear .
if there is some area where the parties at least come close , where the distance diminishes , then there is a possibility .
it will hardly be a solution , where one can speak of great agreements .
the other " solution " is of course that it could cause a unilateral process of recognition .
that , however , brings up its own problems .
that starts already within the european union .
the mandates of the united nations mission in kosovo -lrb- unmik -rrb- and nato 's kosovo force -lrb- kfor -rrb- stem from un resolution 1244 .
these institutions can hardly go beyond their means .
unilateral recognition would in any case occur without the un .
everyone has to be clear on that .
many are of course scared of by that - and with good reason .
there 's also the problem that the eu plays a significant role in the development of institutions in kosovo - but on the basis of what mandate should it then do that ?
that 's where the resulting problems begin .
what would happen to kfor if the un was no longer involved ?
you have to ask those in favor of unilateral recognition .
do you think that unilateral recognition is n't doable , or is n't desirable ?
not desirable .
everything is doable , for , politics is , as you know , the art of the possible .
the six-nation contract group , composed of the us , britain , france , germany , italy and russia , has so far rejected division as one of its basic principles .
can the troika , which was named by the contact group , move away from the principles ?
here , too , politics is the art of the possible .
the principles have been mentioned repeatedly due to the " parallel cases . "
i think you have to very clearly establish that the kosovo question in itself does n't produce any solutions for parallel cases , but rather poses a unique problem .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo 's premier ceku , second left , with the troika members it is after all the only case of a nato intervention .
that has never happened before in such a manner .
to that extent , drawing parallels is exceedingly problematic .
here the question is more on the side of the security council .
there were definitely also serbian views that could imagine a sort of division under certain conditions .
in this respect , the troika surely had a reason for the proposal to resurface again .
many observers have cited republika srpska as a precedent .
you do n't see it that way ?
i do n't see a precedent there at all , since it was a different situation .
in tito 's yugoslavia , bosnia and herzegovina was also a constituent republic .
that had a different , deeply rooted tradition .
on the other hand , i did n't always have the impression that people in belgrade would be so enthusiastic if that problem were also to arise .
a clear geographical division of kosovo is n't even possible .
that 's right , that 's a majority solution .
serbs in other parts of kosovo would stay behind .
one should n't underestimate that then , albanians in the presevo valley would also express wishes when it comes to serbia and demand adjustments to the border .
in any case , it means opening a pandora 's box .

" the calabria mafia has a significant presence in germany , but until now they have always tried to keep a low profile , " de sena told italian news service ansa . grasso said the six men had probably been sent to duisburg in a bid to escape the consequences of the vendetta . in germany , local police spokesman hermann-josef helmich said the men were aged between 16 and 39 . police were quizzing family members of the victims and an autopsy was being conducted to determine the exact cause of death .

the reason : a sweeping change in how parents are paid for what germans refer to as the “ babypause , ” or parental leave .
in january , germany changed its parental-leave laws to give new parents 67 percent of their salary for up to 12 months or up to 14 months if at least two months of the “ pause ” is taken by the father .
the percentage has an upper cap of 1,800 euros -lrb- $ 2,425 -rrb- a month .
previously , stay-at-home parents were given a lump sum of up to 300 euros per month , if they were eligible at all .
playing catch-up “ the fact that parental-leave payments are now based on earnings rather than a lump sum is an immense improvement over the earlier plan , ” said eberhard schaefer , a consultant and founder of the papa institute , which advises politicians , businesses and individuals on issues surrounding fathers and fatherhood .
“ germany is finally catching up with other european countries - especially in scandinavia , but others as well , " he said .
as a result of these changes , the german state approved some 200,000 applications for paid parental leave in 2007 , german family minister ursula von der leyen said in berlin on wednesday .
and the number of applications more than doubled from the first to the second quarters , from 60,000 to 140,000 per quarter .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the plan steers mothers back to the workplace “ clearly , this parental-leave policy is a hit , ” said von der leyen , whose mission to ease the road for working parents in germany has made her a controversial figure here since she took office in 2005 .
“ i am especially thrilled with the growing number of fathers who take paid parental leave , ” added von der leyen , herself a career woman with seven children .
financial effect last year , just 3.5 percent of fathers across germany took paid leave after their children were born .
today , that number is up to 8.5 percent .
the states with the highest quotas of applicants for “ papa leave ” include berlin , brandenburg , bavaria and hamburg , all of which were above the average .
at 8.5 births per 1,000 inhabitants , germany has the lowest birth rate in europe .
many observers believe this will only change when attitudes and policies become friendlier toward working parents .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von der leyen - happy with her plan 's results “ over the years i have heard from families and fathers that they couldn ’ t afford to stop working for those few months , " said papa institute 's schaefer .
" now , they are only losing 33 percent of their income , so many fathers and mothers say , ‘ ok , we can afford to do this for ourselves . ”
“ they do it gladly because they don ’ t want to lose the opportunity , ” he adds .
susanne seyda , an analyst in family economics at the institute for business -lrb- iw -rrb- in cologne , said the new regulation may simply have given more men the ability to ask for something they may have wanted all along .
previously , men may have worried about what staying home with their child would do to their career , seyda argues .
“ now they are in a stronger bargaining position when they go to ask for the time off .
the employer knows there is financial incentive , and they find it easier to understand . "
back to the work force , quicker the pro-business think tank stands behind the new plan , seyda said , because they think it could both boost german birth rates , and help get women back into the work force more quickly .
“ the opportunity costs are lower because parents don ’ t lose as much income , ” seyda noted .
“ highly qualified couples are more likely to have more children . ”
beyond that , under the new regulation , the government assistance runs out after 12 months - or 14 if the father takes two months .
then , for the mother , its back to the work force - or the assistance runs out .
under the old plan , assistance continued for three years .
“ that means women ’ s working responsibilities will grow and there will not be such a great loss of human capital , ” seyda said .
but birth rates and economic improvement is not as important as the effect such a change could have on german society , papa institute 's schaefer says .
he points out that studies have shown that fathers who spend time with their infants continue to spend more time with them as they grow up “ which could only be seen as a positive . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more fun than a day at the office ?
furthermore , experience with his own clients show that fathers don ’ t want their role to be solely that of breadwinner , or extra helper for the mother , who does the real job of raising the children .
“ they want to be seen as independent , responsible parents , ” which is often hard to negotiate when the mother has the sole , day-to-day responsibility with the children , he added .
" ca n't call for mommy " clearly , schaefer is on to something : the average length of paid leave taken by fathers so far is 4.3 months , well beyond the two months required to get the extra pay .
dieter fichter , a senior consultant at siemens in frankfurt , is beyond the “ babypause ” years .
his two children are 9 and 14 years old , and when they were infants he often put in long hours at work .
but , he said , colleagues of his now are taking the paid-leave offer , albeit just the minimum two months required to get the extra pay .
it isn ’ t seen as something that would damage their careers , he said .
“ missing two months of work is not too long , its nothing , ” fichter said .
moreover , he said , if such an offer had been available to him to him at the time , he would have taken it .
“ i think it would give you a closer relationship with your child , ” he said .
" you have a better understanding of what it means to be the person who has to take care of a child all day long , and know what its needs are , " fichter said .
" you ’ re not just with the child for a few hours on weekends .
and you can ’ t call for help from mommy if the baby is crying . ” jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the reason : a sweeping change in how parents are paid for what germans refer to as the “ babypause , ” or parental leave .
in january , germany changed its parental-leave laws to give new parents 67 percent of their salary for up to 12 months or up to 14 months if at least two months of the “ pause ” is taken by the father .
the percentage has an upper cap of 1,800 euros -lrb- $ 2,425 -rrb- a month .
previously , stay-at-home parents were given a lump sum of up to 300 euros per month , if they were eligible at all .
playing catch-up “ the fact that parental-leave payments are now based on earnings rather than a lump sum is an immense improvement over the earlier plan , ” said eberhard schaefer , a consultant and founder of the papa institute , which advises politicians , businesses and individuals on issues surrounding fathers and fatherhood .
“ germany is finally catching up with other european countries - especially in scandinavia , but others as well , " he said .
as a result of these changes , the german state approved some 200,000 applications for paid parental leave in 2007 , german family minister ursula von der leyen said in berlin on wednesday .
and the number of applications more than doubled from the first to the second quarters , from 60,000 to 140,000 per quarter .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the plan steers mothers back to the workplace “ clearly , this parental-leave policy is a hit , ” said von der leyen , whose mission to ease the road for working parents in germany has made her a controversial figure here since she took office in 2005 .
“ i am especially thrilled with the growing number of fathers who take paid parental leave , ” added von der leyen , herself a career woman with seven children .
financial effect last year , just 3.5 percent of fathers across germany took paid leave after their children were born .
today , that number is up to 8.5 percent .
the states with the highest quotas of applicants for “ papa leave ” include berlin , brandenburg , bavaria and hamburg , all of which were above the average .
at 8.5 births per 1,000 inhabitants , germany has the lowest birth rate in europe .
many observers believe this will only change when attitudes and policies become friendlier toward working parents .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von der leyen - happy with her plan 's results “ over the years i have heard from families and fathers that they couldn ’ t afford to stop working for those few months , " said papa institute 's schaefer .
" now , they are only losing 33 percent of their income , so many fathers and mothers say , ‘ ok , we can afford to do this for ourselves . ”
“ they do it gladly because they don ’ t want to lose the opportunity , ” he adds .
susanne seyda , an analyst in family economics at the institute for business -lrb- iw -rrb- in cologne , said the new regulation may simply have given more men the ability to ask for something they may have wanted all along .
previously , men may have worried about what staying home with their child would do to their career , seyda argues .
“ now they are in a stronger bargaining position when they go to ask for the time off .
the employer knows there is financial incentive , and they find it easier to understand . "
back to the work force , quicker the pro-business think tank stands behind the new plan , seyda said , because they think it could both boost german birth rates , and help get women back into the work force more quickly .
“ the opportunity costs are lower because parents don ’ t lose as much income , ” seyda noted .
“ highly qualified couples are more likely to have more children . ”
beyond that , under the new regulation , the government assistance runs out after 12 months - or 14 if the father takes two months .
then , for the mother , its back to the work force - or the assistance runs out .
under the old plan , assistance continued for three years .
“ that means women ’ s working responsibilities will grow and there will not be such a great loss of human capital , ” seyda said .
but birth rates and economic improvement is not as important as the effect such a change could have on german society , papa institute 's schaefer says .
he points out that studies have shown that fathers who spend time with their infants continue to spend more time with them as they grow up “ which could only be seen as a positive . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more fun than a day at the office ?
furthermore , experience with his own clients show that fathers don ’ t want their role to be solely that of breadwinner , or extra helper for the mother , who does the real job of raising the children .
“ they want to be seen as independent , responsible parents , ” which is often hard to negotiate when the mother has the sole , day-to-day responsibility with the children , he added .
" ca n't call for mommy " clearly , schaefer is on to something : the average length of paid leave taken by fathers so far is 4.3 months , well beyond the two months required to get the extra pay .
dieter fichter , a senior consultant at siemens in frankfurt , is beyond the “ babypause ” years .
his two children are 9 and 14 years old , and when they were infants he often put in long hours at work .
but , he said , colleagues of his now are taking the paid-leave offer , albeit just the minimum two months required to get the extra pay .
it isn ’ t seen as something that would damage their careers , he said .
“ missing two months of work is not too long , its nothing , ” fichter said .
moreover , he said , if such an offer had been available to him to him at the time , he would have taken it .
“ i think it would give you a closer relationship with your child , ” he said .
" you have a better understanding of what it means to be the person who has to take care of a child all day long , and know what its needs are , " fichter said .
" you ’ re not just with the child for a few hours on weekends .
and you can ’ t call for help from mommy if the baby is crying . ” jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a proposal by a german government spokesman to include moderate taliban representatives in the afghan peace process has been criticized by a conservative foreign policy expert in parliament . it remained unclear how an explosion wednesday that reportedly claimed the lives of three germans would influence the current dialog debate . according to news reports , deputy government spokesman thomas steg on monday suggested that " moderate , reasonable " taliban representatives should be included in the reconstruction and reconciliation process in afghanistan . the suggestion has been criticized by karl-theodor zu guttenberg , a parliamentarian and foreign policy expert for bavaria 's conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , the sister party of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- . " the taliban were and are supporters of an inhuman terror regime , " guttenberg said in a press statement .
" they have knowingly supported international terrorism and al qaeda .
these connections still exist today . " more civic participation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some boycotted a recent peace conference in kabul because taliban were not invited guttenberg added that taliban fighters should be reintegrated into afghan society , but he said that there were no signs that moderate , let alone reasonable , taliban existed . " that 's why it 's so important to continue the work against the taliban by the afghan government and the international community , " he said .
" to involve the taliban in the stabilization and reconstruction of the country would be a preposterous turn away from reality . " the chairman of the parliament 's foreign affairs committee , ruprecht polenz -lrb- cdu -rrb- , also warned against undermining the moral basis for the german and international mission in afghanistan . in an interview with the daily frankfurter rundschau , he said that including certain insurgent groups in talks would have to lead to rule of law and more civic participation for afghans - " ergo the opposite of the taliban 's terror regime until 2001 . " mutually exclusive ? berlin 's der tagesspiegel in an editorial also said steg 's comments seemed strange . " if there are -lsb- moderate , reasonable taliban -rsb- - sure , talking ca n't hurt , " the daily wrote .
" but so far , it seemed that the two things were mutually exclusive : someone is either a taliban - or reasonable .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de children and families -pipe- 15.08.2007 more german fathers opting to take parental leave großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stay-at-home dads can now spend more quality time with their children in germany , recent reports show a new , more remunerative plan to encourage recent fathers to take paid parenting leave is starting to have an effect . since the beginning of the year , germany has seen a leap in the number of fathers who take time off to stay home with their young children .
the reason : a sweeping change in how parents are paid for what germans refer to as the “ babypause , ” or parental leave .
in january , germany changed its parental-leave laws to give new parents 67 percent of their salary for up to 12 months or up to 14 months if at least two months of the “ pause ” is taken by the father .
the percentage has an upper cap of 1,800 euros -lrb- $ 2,425 -rrb- a month .
previously , stay-at-home parents were given a lump sum of up to 300 euros per month , if they were eligible at all .
playing catch-up “ the fact that parental-leave payments are now based on earnings rather than a lump sum is an immense improvement over the earlier plan , ” said eberhard schaefer , a consultant and founder of the papa institute , which advises politicians , businesses and individuals on issues surrounding fathers and fatherhood .
“ germany is finally catching up with other european countries - especially in scandinavia , but others as well , " he said .
as a result of these changes , the german state approved some 200,000 applications for paid parental leave in 2007 , german family minister ursula von der leyen said in berlin on wednesday .
and the number of applications more than doubled from the first to the second quarters , from 60,000 to 140,000 per quarter .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the plan steers mothers back to the workplace “ clearly , this parental-leave policy is a hit , ” said von der leyen , whose mission to ease the road for working parents in germany has made her a controversial figure here since she took office in 2005 .
“ i am especially thrilled with the growing number of fathers who take paid parental leave , ” added von der leyen , herself a career woman with seven children .
financial effect last year , just 3.5 percent of fathers across germany took paid leave after their children were born .
today , that number is up to 8.5 percent .
the states with the highest quotas of applicants for “ papa leave ” include berlin , brandenburg , bavaria and hamburg , all of which were above the average .
at 8.5 births per 1,000 inhabitants , germany has the lowest birth rate in europe .
many observers believe this will only change when attitudes and policies become friendlier toward working parents .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von der leyen - happy with her plan 's results “ over the years i have heard from families and fathers that they couldn ’ t afford to stop working for those few months , " said papa institute 's schaefer .
" now , they are only losing 33 percent of their income , so many fathers and mothers say , ‘ ok , we can afford to do this for ourselves . ”
“ they do it gladly because they don ’ t want to lose the opportunity , ” he adds .
susanne seyda , an analyst in family economics at the institute for business -lrb- iw -rrb- in cologne , said the new regulation may simply have given more men the ability to ask for something they may have wanted all along .
previously , men may have worried about what staying home with their child would do to their career , seyda argues .
“ now they are in a stronger bargaining position when they go to ask for the time off .
the employer knows there is financial incentive , and they find it easier to understand . "
back to the work force , quicker the pro-business think tank stands behind the new plan , seyda said , because they think it could both boost german birth rates , and help get women back into the work force more quickly .
“ the opportunity costs are lower because parents don ’ t lose as much income , ” seyda noted .
“ highly qualified couples are more likely to have more children . ”
beyond that , under the new regulation , the government assistance runs out after 12 months - or 14 if the father takes two months .
then , for the mother , its back to the work force - or the assistance runs out .
under the old plan , assistance continued for three years .
“ that means women ’ s working responsibilities will grow and there will not be such a great loss of human capital , ” seyda said .
but birth rates and economic improvement is not as important as the effect such a change could have on german society , papa institute 's schaefer says .
he points out that studies have shown that fathers who spend time with their infants continue to spend more time with them as they grow up “ which could only be seen as a positive . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more fun than a day at the office ?
furthermore , experience with his own clients show that fathers don ’ t want their role to be solely that of breadwinner , or extra helper for the mother , who does the real job of raising the children .
“ they want to be seen as independent , responsible parents , ” which is often hard to negotiate when the mother has the sole , day-to-day responsibility with the children , he added .
" ca n't call for mommy " clearly , schaefer is on to something : the average length of paid leave taken by fathers so far is 4.3 months , well beyond the two months required to get the extra pay .
dieter fichter , a senior consultant at siemens in frankfurt , is beyond the “ babypause ” years .
his two children are 9 and 14 years old , and when they were infants he often put in long hours at work .
but , he said , colleagues of his now are taking the paid-leave offer , albeit just the minimum two months required to get the extra pay .
it isn ’ t seen as something that would damage their careers , he said .
“ missing two months of work is not too long , its nothing , ” fichter said .
moreover , he said , if such an offer had been available to him to him at the time , he would have taken it .
“ i think it would give you a closer relationship with your child , ” he said .
" you have a better understanding of what it means to be the person who has to take care of a child all day long , and know what its needs are , " fichter said .
" you ’ re not just with the child for a few hours on weekends .

the reason : a sweeping change in how parents are paid for what germans refer to as the “ babypause , ” or parental leave .
in january , germany changed its parental-leave laws to give new parents 67 percent of their salary for up to 12 months or up to 14 months if at least two months of the “ pause ” is taken by the father .
the percentage has an upper cap of 1,800 euros -lrb- $ 2,425 -rrb- a month .
previously , stay-at-home parents were given a lump sum of up to 300 euros per month , if they were eligible at all .
playing catch-up “ the fact that parental-leave payments are now based on earnings rather than a lump sum is an immense improvement over the earlier plan , ” said eberhard schaefer , a consultant and founder of the papa institute , which advises politicians , businesses and individuals on issues surrounding fathers and fatherhood .
“ germany is finally catching up with other european countries - especially in scandinavia , but others as well , " he said .
as a result of these changes , the german state approved some 200,000 applications for paid parental leave in 2007 , german family minister ursula von der leyen said in berlin on wednesday .
and the number of applications more than doubled from the first to the second quarters , from 60,000 to 140,000 per quarter .

after only three days of talks , the troika said it could no longer rule out a division of kosovo into albanian and serbian sectors .
on dec .
10 , the troika is due to present a report to the un on the way forward .
erhard busek of austria has been the eu coordinator of the stability pact for south-eastern europe since 2002 .
dw-radio : in view of the resistance from kosovo albanians , how realistic is the concept of a division of kosovo ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erhard busek erhard busek : at the moment there are only proposals to which someone has expressed opposition .
if you act on that assumption , then there 's no proposal whatsoever , but that 's not a solution .
any compromise that comes about wo n't receive the agreement of both disputing parties , but there must of course be a solution with which one can live , and that must be the assumption .
of all the bad solutions , that is at least a possible one .
there 's only the possibility of either reaching a virtual rapprochement or to decide in one way or another in conflict , with all the consequences that involves .
many observers have indicated that a compromise is n't at all possible .
what perspective do you see for the current 120-day attempt at dialogue ?
the perspective is rather clear .
if there is some area where the parties at least come close , where the distance diminishes , then there is a possibility .
it will hardly be a solution , where one can speak of great agreements .
the other " solution " is of course that it could cause a unilateral process of recognition .
that , however , brings up its own problems .
that starts already within the european union .
the mandates of the united nations mission in kosovo -lrb- unmik -rrb- and nato 's kosovo force -lrb- kfor -rrb- stem from un resolution 1244 .
these institutions can hardly go beyond their means .
unilateral recognition would in any case occur without the un .
everyone has to be clear on that .
many are of course scared of by that - and with good reason .
there 's also the problem that the eu plays a significant role in the development of institutions in kosovo - but on the basis of what mandate should it then do that ?
that 's where the resulting problems begin .
what would happen to kfor if the un was no longer involved ?
you have to ask those in favor of unilateral recognition .
do you think that unilateral recognition is n't doable , or is n't desirable ?
not desirable .
everything is doable , for , politics is , as you know , the art of the possible .
the six-nation contract group , composed of the us , britain , france , germany , italy and russia , has so far rejected division as one of its basic principles .
can the troika , which was named by the contact group , move away from the principles ?
here , too , politics is the art of the possible .
the principles have been mentioned repeatedly due to the " parallel cases . "
i think you have to very clearly establish that the kosovo question in itself does n't produce any solutions for parallel cases , but rather poses a unique problem .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo 's premier ceku , second left , with the troika members it is after all the only case of a nato intervention .
that has never happened before in such a manner .
to that extent , drawing parallels is exceedingly problematic .
here the question is more on the side of the security council .
there were definitely also serbian views that could imagine a sort of division under certain conditions .
in this respect , the troika surely had a reason for the proposal to resurface again .
many observers have cited republika srpska as a precedent .
you do n't see it that way ?
i do n't see a precedent there at all , since it was a different situation .
in tito 's yugoslavia , bosnia and herzegovina was also a constituent republic .
that had a different , deeply rooted tradition .
on the other hand , i did n't always have the impression that people in belgrade would be so enthusiastic if that problem were also to arise .
a clear geographical division of kosovo is n't even possible .
that 's right , that 's a majority solution .
serbs in other parts of kosovo would stay behind .
one should n't underestimate that then , albanians in the presevo valley would also express wishes when it comes to serbia and demand adjustments to the border .
in any case , it means opening a pandora 's box .

i do n't think humorous perspectives are necessarily negative , as long as people do n't stop thinking . "
indeed , while they may be fun to look at , westphal 's photos offer a subtle criticism of today 's culture of cosmetic surgery , the insistence on trying to make the food we consume - to say nothing of the way we look physically - conform to artificial standards of normality and beauty .
the mutatoes remind viewers that deviating from the norm is healthy .

there , amidst the usual farmers catering to lifestyle-conscious yuppies , shoppers were shocked to find 27-year-old uli westphal with a display of peppers and potatoes , cucumbers and carrots that looked like they had just landed from outer space . " the idea for the mutatoes came one day when i was shopping , " westphal told dw-world.de.
" a little more than a year ago , i found a five-headed eggplant at a farmers ' market and then , a few stalls further on , some bell peppers that resembled props from a science-fiction film .
since then , i 've kept my eyes opens for such finds . " bildunterschrift : mutatoes come in various shapes , sizes and colors the idea behind the 500-plus collection of organic curiosities , which westphal photographs and archives on his web site , is to point out the artificial standardization of the products we buy in mass supermarkets .
the mutations are all natural - not the result of radiation or genetic manipulation . and they 're surprisingly aesthetic , as visitors to the berlin market found out . " there were people who wanted to buy my vegetables , businessmen who compared them with henry moore sculptures and vendors who brought me some examples of their own , " westphal said . art or food ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : artist uli westphal and his mutatoes at the farmers ' market the mutatoes ' fame quickly began to spread via the internet , starting with the new-york-based blog swissmiss . " his unusual market stand made me look , " said tina roth eisenberg , who was in berlin for westphal 's " opening . "
" when i approached it and saw the sign ' not for sale , ' i was scratching my head .
i think his collection was particularly surprising as he was showcasing it in the context of ' real , ' normal food stands . " in particular , fashion and graphic designers have taken to the freaky fruit and veg .
westphal 's photos have been featured on the web site of the diesel clothing label , and the discovery channel has been interested in using the images as well . " designers find inspiration in all kinds of things , " said darius a. monsef iv , who runs the blog colour lovers .
" while most people might not see it , one of these mutatoes might end up inspiring the next piece of furniture or fashion trend . "
westphal has been somewhat caught off guard by all the interest .
" in the past few weeks , several hundred blogs and web sites have reported on the project , " he said .
" it 's really fascinating to see the different contexts in which my project has appeared - everything from industrial designers , chemical firms , recipe pages , shoe manufacturers and environmental activists to pornographic sites and forums for pregnant women . " easy on the eye , yummy in the tummy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an eggplant with henry moore quality the phallic quality of a handful of westphal 's specimens does indeed give rise to some prurient giggles .
but westphal is n't too terribly bothered , if some people see his mutatoes as just the latest on-line joke .
" of course , there are a lot of people who treat the project as a gag , " westphal said .
" but i 've been pleased that there have also been serious discussions .
i do n't think humorous perspectives are necessarily negative , as long as people do n't stop thinking . "
indeed , while they may be fun to look at , westphal 's photos offer a subtle criticism of today 's culture of cosmetic surgery , the insistence on trying to make the food we consume - to say nothing of the way we look physically - conform to artificial standards of normality and beauty .
the mutatoes remind viewers that deviating from the norm is healthy .
though westphal 's mutants may look bizarre , they 're arguably better for you than the standardized products that occupy most supermarkets ' shelves .
the proof is the artist himself .
" after i 'm done with the photographs , i usually eat the mutatoes , " westphal said .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erhard busek erhard busek : at the moment there are only proposals to which someone has expressed opposition .
if you act on that assumption , then there 's no proposal whatsoever , but that 's not a solution .
any compromise that comes about wo n't receive the agreement of both disputing parties , but there must of course be a solution with which one can live , and that must be the assumption .
of all the bad solutions , that is at least a possible one .
there 's only the possibility of either reaching a virtual rapprochement or to decide in one way or another in conflict , with all the consequences that involves .
many observers have indicated that a compromise is n't at all possible .
what perspective do you see for the current 120-day attempt at dialogue ?
the perspective is rather clear .
if there is some area where the parties at least come close , where the distance diminishes , then there is a possibility .
it will hardly be a solution , where one can speak of great agreements .
the other " solution " is of course that it could cause a unilateral process of recognition .
that , however , brings up its own problems .
that starts already within the european union .

these institutions can hardly go beyond their means .
unilateral recognition would in any case occur without the un .
everyone has to be clear on that .
many are of course scared of by that - and with good reason .
there 's also the problem that the eu plays a significant role in the development of institutions in kosovo - but on the basis of what mandate should it then do that ?
that 's where the resulting problems begin .
what would happen to kfor if the un was no longer involved ?
you have to ask those in favor of unilateral recognition .
do you think that unilateral recognition is n't doable , or is n't desirable ?
not desirable .
everything is doable , for , politics is , as you know , the art of the possible .
the six-nation contract group , composed of the us , britain , france , germany , italy and russia , has so far rejected division as one of its basic principles .
can the troika , which was named by the contact group , move away from the principles ?
here , too , politics is the art of the possible .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de turkey -pipe- 15.08.2007 opinion : turkey 's unpredictable electorate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's foreign minister is set to become his country 's next president .
his religious-conservative party colleagues will dominate politics for years , but they should n't become complacent , says dw 's baha güngör . there 's no doubt that abdullah gül - backed by an absolute majority of parliamentarians and after three rounds of voting on aug .
28 - will become his country 's 11th president and occupy the highest office .
turkish premier erdogan 's governing religious-conservative party for justice and development -lrb- akp -rrb- has a clear majority in the national assembly with 341 of 550 seats .
since the nationalists have said that they 'll attend the first two rounds of voting on aug .
20 and aug .
24 , the two-thirds quorum mandated by the constitutional court will be present .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baha güngör the akp 's victory in the july 22 parliamentary elections was too obvious : 46 percent of votes is a clear message .
the army 's indirect coup threats and the desperate attempts of secular elites failed to prevent gül - and with him the first first lady with a headscarf in the presidential palace .
gül 's candidacy has sound democratic legitimacy and the akp will lift him into the highest office on aug .
28 - two days before the traditional " day of defense forces . "
last week , erdogan reached out to the secular opposition , during the election of the parliament 's president , by nominating köksal toptan , a compromise candidate , who was elected with an overwhelming 450 votes .
this sparked hope that erdogan would forego gül , the polarizing presidential candidate , or that the latter would simply take himself out of the race .
but gül had no intention of doing so .
why should he ?
the army , the secular elite , the constitutional court and incumbent president ahmet necedet all tried to prevent gül 's presidency by employing tactics that were hardly tolerable from a democratic point of view .
as a result , the electorate punished them severely .
gül will therefore become turkey 's highest-ranking civilian representative until 2014 .
it 's safe to bet that erdogan will do everything to replace him as the first president elected by popular vote .
on oct .
21 , turks will decide in a referendum whether the next president will be chosen by the people rather than by parliament .
if the july 22 election victory will be repeated , there 's no doubt that this change will take place - just as there 's no doubt that in seven years ' time , erdogan will be elected president of a country that has gone through an adjustment to a presidential political system by then .
it 's perfectly superfluous to restart the outdated debate about what the army will have to say about this development .
the generals ' reputation as guardians of secularism and democracy was damaged long before the indirect coup threat on april 27 in reaction to gül 's first candidacy .
since 1960 , four interventions by the military have all thrown back the country while established secular parties , led by incompetent , power-hungry politicians have surpassed each other in terms of democratic amateurism .
it remains to be seen whether erdogan and his akp will be able to handle the success and refrain from shooting themselves in the foot by rejecting a needed democratic culture of compromise and thinking that they 're infallible .
in 1983 , the religious-conservative motherland party won 45 percent of the vote after three years of military rule despite contrary " advice " for voters by the generals .
today , this party has been relegated to the sidelines outside parliament .
it 's hard to gauge turkish voters : just one year before the motherland party 's grandiose election victory , a constitution dictated by the military had been accepted in a referendum with 92 percent of votes .

a proposal by a german government spokesman to include moderate taliban representatives in the afghan peace process has been criticized by a conservative foreign policy expert in parliament . it remained unclear how an explosion wednesday that reportedly claimed the lives of three germans would influence the current dialog debate . according to news reports , deputy government spokesman thomas steg on monday suggested that " moderate , reasonable " taliban representatives should be included in the reconstruction and reconciliation process in afghanistan . the suggestion has been criticized by karl-theodor zu guttenberg , a parliamentarian and foreign policy expert for bavaria 's conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , the sister party of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- . " the taliban were and are supporters of an inhuman terror regime , " guttenberg said in a press statement .
" they have knowingly supported international terrorism and al qaeda .
these connections still exist today . " more civic participation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some boycotted a recent peace conference in kabul because taliban were not invited guttenberg added that taliban fighters should be reintegrated into afghan society , but he said that there were no signs that moderate , let alone reasonable , taliban existed . " that 's why it 's so important to continue the work against the taliban by the afghan government and the international community , " he said .
" to involve the taliban in the stabilization and reconstruction of the country would be a preposterous turn away from reality . " the chairman of the parliament 's foreign affairs committee , ruprecht polenz -lrb- cdu -rrb- , also warned against undermining the moral basis for the german and international mission in afghanistan . in an interview with the daily frankfurter rundschau , he said that including certain insurgent groups in talks would have to lead to rule of law and more civic participation for afghans - " ergo the opposite of the taliban 's terror regime until 2001 . " mutually exclusive ? berlin 's der tagesspiegel in an editorial also said steg 's comments seemed strange . " if there are -lsb- moderate , reasonable taliban -rsb- - sure , talking ca n't hurt , " the daily wrote .
" but so far , it seemed that the two things were mutually exclusive : someone is either a taliban - or reasonable . " in april , a similar controversy arose when kurt beck , the leader of germany 's social democratic party , which forms a coalition with the cdu / csu , suggested that taliban representatives should be invited to peace talks .

his religious-conservative party colleagues will dominate politics for years , but they should n't become complacent , says dw 's baha güngör . there 's no doubt that abdullah gül - backed by an absolute majority of parliamentarians and after three rounds of voting on aug .
28 - will become his country 's 11th president and occupy the highest office .
turkish premier erdogan 's governing religious-conservative party for justice and development -lrb- akp -rrb- has a clear majority in the national assembly with 341 of 550 seats .
since the nationalists have said that they 'll attend the first two rounds of voting on aug .
20 and aug .
24 , the two-thirds quorum mandated by the constitutional court will be present .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baha güngör the akp 's victory in the july 22 parliamentary elections was too obvious : 46 percent of votes is a clear message .
the army 's indirect coup threats and the desperate attempts of secular elites failed to prevent gül - and with him the first first lady with a headscarf in the presidential palace .
gül 's candidacy has sound democratic legitimacy and the akp will lift him into the highest office on aug .
28 - two days before the traditional " day of defense forces . "
last week , erdogan reached out to the secular opposition , during the election of the parliament 's president , by nominating köksal toptan , a compromise candidate , who was elected with an overwhelming 450 votes .
this sparked hope that erdogan would forego gül , the polarizing presidential candidate , or that the latter would simply take himself out of the race .
but gül had no intention of doing so .
why should he ?
the army , the secular elite , the constitutional court and incumbent president ahmet necedet all tried to prevent gül 's presidency by employing tactics that were hardly tolerable from a democratic point of view .
as a result , the electorate punished them severely .
gül will therefore become turkey 's highest-ranking civilian representative until 2014 .
it 's safe to bet that erdogan will do everything to replace him as the first president elected by popular vote .
on oct .
21 , turks will decide in a referendum whether the next president will be chosen by the people rather than by parliament .
if the july 22 election victory will be repeated , there 's no doubt that this change will take place - just as there 's no doubt that in seven years ' time , erdogan will be elected president of a country that has gone through an adjustment to a presidential political system by then .
it 's perfectly superfluous to restart the outdated debate about what the army will have to say about this development .
the generals ' reputation as guardians of secularism and democracy was damaged long before the indirect coup threat on april 27 in reaction to gül 's first candidacy .
since 1960 , four interventions by the military have all thrown back the country while established secular parties , led by incompetent , power-hungry politicians have surpassed each other in terms of democratic amateurism .
it remains to be seen whether erdogan and his akp will be able to handle the success and refrain from shooting themselves in the foot by rejecting a needed democratic culture of compromise and thinking that they 're infallible .
in 1983 , the religious-conservative motherland party won 45 percent of the vote after three years of military rule despite contrary " advice " for voters by the generals .
today , this party has been relegated to the sidelines outside parliament .
it 's hard to gauge turkish voters : just one year before the motherland party 's grandiose election victory , a constitution dictated by the military had been accepted in a referendum with 92 percent of votes .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de turkey -pipe- 15.08.2007 opinion : turkey 's unpredictable electorate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's foreign minister is set to become his country 's next president .
his religious-conservative party colleagues will dominate politics for years , but they should n't become complacent , says dw 's baha güngör . there 's no doubt that abdullah gül - backed by an absolute majority of parliamentarians and after three rounds of voting on aug .
28 - will become his country 's 11th president and occupy the highest office .
turkish premier erdogan 's governing religious-conservative party for justice and development -lrb- akp -rrb- has a clear majority in the national assembly with 341 of 550 seats .
since the nationalists have said that they 'll attend the first two rounds of voting on aug .
20 and aug .
24 , the two-thirds quorum mandated by the constitutional court will be present .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baha güngör the akp 's victory in the july 22 parliamentary elections was too obvious : 46 percent of votes is a clear message .
the army 's indirect coup threats and the desperate attempts of secular elites failed to prevent gül - and with him the first first lady with a headscarf in the presidential palace .
gül 's candidacy has sound democratic legitimacy and the akp will lift him into the highest office on aug .
28 - two days before the traditional " day of defense forces . "
last week , erdogan reached out to the secular opposition , during the election of the parliament 's president , by nominating köksal toptan , a compromise candidate , who was elected with an overwhelming 450 votes .
this sparked hope that erdogan would forego gül , the polarizing presidential candidate , or that the latter would simply take himself out of the race .
but gül had no intention of doing so .
why should he ?
the army , the secular elite , the constitutional court and incumbent president ahmet necedet all tried to prevent gül 's presidency by employing tactics that were hardly tolerable from a democratic point of view .
as a result , the electorate punished them severely .
gül will therefore become turkey 's highest-ranking civilian representative until 2014 .
it 's safe to bet that erdogan will do everything to replace him as the first president elected by popular vote .
on oct .
21 , turks will decide in a referendum whether the next president will be chosen by the people rather than by parliament .
if the july 22 election victory will be repeated , there 's no doubt that this change will take place - just as there 's no doubt that in seven years ' time , erdogan will be elected president of a country that has gone through an adjustment to a presidential political system by then .
it 's perfectly superfluous to restart the outdated debate about what the army will have to say about this development .
the generals ' reputation as guardians of secularism and democracy was damaged long before the indirect coup threat on april 27 in reaction to gül 's first candidacy .
since 1960 , four interventions by the military have all thrown back the country while established secular parties , led by incompetent , power-hungry politicians have surpassed each other in terms of democratic amateurism .
it remains to be seen whether erdogan and his akp will be able to handle the success and refrain from shooting themselves in the foot by rejecting a needed democratic culture of compromise and thinking that they 're infallible .
in 1983 , the religious-conservative motherland party won 45 percent of the vote after three years of military rule despite contrary " advice " for voters by the generals .
today , this party has been relegated to the sidelines outside parliament .
it 's hard to gauge turkish voters : just one year before the motherland party 's grandiose election victory , a constitution dictated by the military had been accepted in a referendum with 92 percent of votes .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de diplomacy -pipe- 15.08.2007 balkans expert says kosovo division undesirable but possible großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the two sides have been obstinately unwilling to compromise deutsche welle spoke with erhard busek , the eu coordinator of the stability pact for south-eastern europe , about the kosovo troika 's mission and the future of the troubled province . the troika of kosovo negotiators , made up of eu , us and russian envoys , last week started 120 days of talks meant to encourage belgrade and pristina to resolve the issue of the province 's undetermined status .
after only three days of talks , the troika said it could no longer rule out a division of kosovo into albanian and serbian sectors .
on dec .
10 , the troika is due to present a report to the un on the way forward .
erhard busek of austria has been the eu coordinator of the stability pact for south-eastern europe since 2002 .
dw-radio : in view of the resistance from kosovo albanians , how realistic is the concept of a division of kosovo ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erhard busek erhard busek : at the moment there are only proposals to which someone has expressed opposition .
if you act on that assumption , then there 's no proposal whatsoever , but that 's not a solution .
any compromise that comes about wo n't receive the agreement of both disputing parties , but there must of course be a solution with which one can live , and that must be the assumption .
of all the bad solutions , that is at least a possible one .
there 's only the possibility of either reaching a virtual rapprochement or to decide in one way or another in conflict , with all the consequences that involves .
many observers have indicated that a compromise is n't at all possible .
what perspective do you see for the current 120-day attempt at dialogue ?
the perspective is rather clear .
if there is some area where the parties at least come close , where the distance diminishes , then there is a possibility .
it will hardly be a solution , where one can speak of great agreements .
the other " solution " is of course that it could cause a unilateral process of recognition .
that , however , brings up its own problems .
that starts already within the european union .
the mandates of the united nations mission in kosovo -lrb- unmik -rrb- and nato 's kosovo force -lrb- kfor -rrb- stem from un resolution 1244 .
these institutions can hardly go beyond their means .
unilateral recognition would in any case occur without the un .
everyone has to be clear on that .
many are of course scared of by that - and with good reason .
there 's also the problem that the eu plays a significant role in the development of institutions in kosovo - but on the basis of what mandate should it then do that ?
that 's where the resulting problems begin .
what would happen to kfor if the un was no longer involved ?
you have to ask those in favor of unilateral recognition .
do you think that unilateral recognition is n't doable , or is n't desirable ?
not desirable .
everything is doable , for , politics is , as you know , the art of the possible .
the six-nation contract group , composed of the us , britain , france , germany , italy and russia , has so far rejected division as one of its basic principles .
can the troika , which was named by the contact group , move away from the principles ?
here , too , politics is the art of the possible .
the principles have been mentioned repeatedly due to the " parallel cases . "
i think you have to very clearly establish that the kosovo question in itself does n't produce any solutions for parallel cases , but rather poses a unique problem .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo 's premier ceku , second left , with the troika members it is after all the only case of a nato intervention .
that has never happened before in such a manner .
to that extent , drawing parallels is exceedingly problematic .
here the question is more on the side of the security council .
there were definitely also serbian views that could imagine a sort of division under certain conditions .
in this respect , the troika surely had a reason for the proposal to resurface again .
many observers have cited republika srpska as a precedent .
you do n't see it that way ?
i do n't see a precedent there at all , since it was a different situation .
in tito 's yugoslavia , bosnia and herzegovina was also a constituent republic .
that had a different , deeply rooted tradition .
on the other hand , i did n't always have the impression that people in belgrade would be so enthusiastic if that problem were also to arise .
a clear geographical division of kosovo is n't even possible .
that 's right , that 's a majority solution .
serbs in other parts of kosovo would stay behind .
one should n't underestimate that then , albanians in the presevo valley would also express wishes when it comes to serbia and demand adjustments to the border .
in any case , it means opening a pandora 's box .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de children and families -pipe- 15.08.2007 more german fathers opting to take parental leave großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stay-at-home dads can now spend more quality time with their children in germany , recent reports show a new , more remunerative plan to encourage recent fathers to take paid parenting leave is starting to have an effect . since the beginning of the year , germany has seen a leap in the number of fathers who take time off to stay home with their young children .
the reason : a sweeping change in how parents are paid for what germans refer to as the “ babypause , ” or parental leave .
in january , germany changed its parental-leave laws to give new parents 67 percent of their salary for up to 12 months or up to 14 months if at least two months of the “ pause ” is taken by the father .
the percentage has an upper cap of 1,800 euros -lrb- $ 2,425 -rrb- a month .
previously , stay-at-home parents were given a lump sum of up to 300 euros per month , if they were eligible at all .
playing catch-up “ the fact that parental-leave payments are now based on earnings rather than a lump sum is an immense improvement over the earlier plan , ” said eberhard schaefer , a consultant and founder of the papa institute , which advises politicians , businesses and individuals on issues surrounding fathers and fatherhood .
“ germany is finally catching up with other european countries - especially in scandinavia , but others as well , " he said .
as a result of these changes , the german state approved some 200,000 applications for paid parental leave in 2007 , german family minister ursula von der leyen said in berlin on wednesday .
and the number of applications more than doubled from the first to the second quarters , from 60,000 to 140,000 per quarter .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the plan steers mothers back to the workplace “ clearly , this parental-leave policy is a hit , ” said von der leyen , whose mission to ease the road for working parents in germany has made her a controversial figure here since she took office in 2005 .
“ i am especially thrilled with the growing number of fathers who take paid parental leave , ” added von der leyen , herself a career woman with seven children .
financial effect last year , just 3.5 percent of fathers across germany took paid leave after their children were born .
today , that number is up to 8.5 percent .
the states with the highest quotas of applicants for “ papa leave ” include berlin , brandenburg , bavaria and hamburg , all of which were above the average .
at 8.5 births per 1,000 inhabitants , germany has the lowest birth rate in europe .
many observers believe this will only change when attitudes and policies become friendlier toward working parents .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von der leyen - happy with her plan 's results “ over the years i have heard from families and fathers that they couldn ’ t afford to stop working for those few months , " said papa institute 's schaefer .
" now , they are only losing 33 percent of their income , so many fathers and mothers say , ‘ ok , we can afford to do this for ourselves . ”
“ they do it gladly because they don ’ t want to lose the opportunity , ” he adds .
susanne seyda , an analyst in family economics at the institute for business -lrb- iw -rrb- in cologne , said the new regulation may simply have given more men the ability to ask for something they may have wanted all along .
previously , men may have worried about what staying home with their child would do to their career , seyda argues .
“ now they are in a stronger bargaining position when they go to ask for the time off .
the employer knows there is financial incentive , and they find it easier to understand . "
back to the work force , quicker the pro-business think tank stands behind the new plan , seyda said , because they think it could both boost german birth rates , and help get women back into the work force more quickly .
“ the opportunity costs are lower because parents don ’ t lose as much income , ” seyda noted .
“ highly qualified couples are more likely to have more children . ”
beyond that , under the new regulation , the government assistance runs out after 12 months - or 14 if the father takes two months .
then , for the mother , its back to the work force - or the assistance runs out .
under the old plan , assistance continued for three years .
“ that means women ’ s working responsibilities will grow and there will not be such a great loss of human capital , ” seyda said .
but birth rates and economic improvement is not as important as the effect such a change could have on german society , papa institute 's schaefer says .
he points out that studies have shown that fathers who spend time with their infants continue to spend more time with them as they grow up “ which could only be seen as a positive . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more fun than a day at the office ?
furthermore , experience with his own clients show that fathers don ’ t want their role to be solely that of breadwinner , or extra helper for the mother , who does the real job of raising the children .
“ they want to be seen as independent , responsible parents , ” which is often hard to negotiate when the mother has the sole , day-to-day responsibility with the children , he added .
" ca n't call for mommy " clearly , schaefer is on to something : the average length of paid leave taken by fathers so far is 4.3 months , well beyond the two months required to get the extra pay .
dieter fichter , a senior consultant at siemens in frankfurt , is beyond the “ babypause ” years .
his two children are 9 and 14 years old , and when they were infants he often put in long hours at work .
but , he said , colleagues of his now are taking the paid-leave offer , albeit just the minimum two months required to get the extra pay .
it isn ’ t seen as something that would damage their careers , he said .
“ missing two months of work is not too long , its nothing , ” fichter said .
moreover , he said , if such an offer had been available to him to him at the time , he would have taken it .
“ i think it would give you a closer relationship with your child , ” he said .
" you have a better understanding of what it means to be the person who has to take care of a child all day long , and know what its needs are , " fichter said .
" you ’ re not just with the child for a few hours on weekends .

the reason : a sweeping change in how parents are paid for what germans refer to as the “ babypause , ” or parental leave .
in january , germany changed its parental-leave laws to give new parents 67 percent of their salary for up to 12 months or up to 14 months if at least two months of the “ pause ” is taken by the father .
the percentage has an upper cap of 1,800 euros -lrb- $ 2,425 -rrb- a month .
previously , stay-at-home parents were given a lump sum of up to 300 euros per month , if they were eligible at all .
playing catch-up “ the fact that parental-leave payments are now based on earnings rather than a lump sum is an immense improvement over the earlier plan , ” said eberhard schaefer , a consultant and founder of the papa institute , which advises politicians , businesses and individuals on issues surrounding fathers and fatherhood .
“ germany is finally catching up with other european countries - especially in scandinavia , but others as well , " he said .
as a result of these changes , the german state approved some 200,000 applications for paid parental leave in 2007 , german family minister ursula von der leyen said in berlin on wednesday .
and the number of applications more than doubled from the first to the second quarters , from 60,000 to 140,000 per quarter .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the plan steers mothers back to the workplace “ clearly , this parental-leave policy is a hit , ” said von der leyen , whose mission to ease the road for working parents in germany has made her a controversial figure here since she took office in 2005 .
“ i am especially thrilled with the growing number of fathers who take paid parental leave , ” added von der leyen , herself a career woman with seven children .
financial effect last year , just 3.5 percent of fathers across germany took paid leave after their children were born .
today , that number is up to 8.5 percent .
the states with the highest quotas of applicants for “ papa leave ” include berlin , brandenburg , bavaria and hamburg , all of which were above the average .
at 8.5 births per 1,000 inhabitants , germany has the lowest birth rate in europe .
many observers believe this will only change when attitudes and policies become friendlier toward working parents .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von der leyen - happy with her plan 's results “ over the years i have heard from families and fathers that they couldn ’ t afford to stop working for those few months , " said papa institute 's schaefer .
" now , they are only losing 33 percent of their income , so many fathers and mothers say , ‘ ok , we can afford to do this for ourselves . ”
“ they do it gladly because they don ’ t want to lose the opportunity , ” he adds .
susanne seyda , an analyst in family economics at the institute for business -lrb- iw -rrb- in cologne , said the new regulation may simply have given more men the ability to ask for something they may have wanted all along .
previously , men may have worried about what staying home with their child would do to their career , seyda argues .
“ now they are in a stronger bargaining position when they go to ask for the time off .
the employer knows there is financial incentive , and they find it easier to understand . "
back to the work force , quicker the pro-business think tank stands behind the new plan , seyda said , because they think it could both boost german birth rates , and help get women back into the work force more quickly .
“ the opportunity costs are lower because parents don ’ t lose as much income , ” seyda noted .
“ highly qualified couples are more likely to have more children . ”
beyond that , under the new regulation , the government assistance runs out after 12 months - or 14 if the father takes two months .
then , for the mother , its back to the work force - or the assistance runs out .
under the old plan , assistance continued for three years .
“ that means women ’ s working responsibilities will grow and there will not be such a great loss of human capital , ” seyda said .
but birth rates and economic improvement is not as important as the effect such a change could have on german society , papa institute 's schaefer says .
he points out that studies have shown that fathers who spend time with their infants continue to spend more time with them as they grow up “ which could only be seen as a positive . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more fun than a day at the office ?
furthermore , experience with his own clients show that fathers don ’ t want their role to be solely that of breadwinner , or extra helper for the mother , who does the real job of raising the children .
“ they want to be seen as independent , responsible parents , ” which is often hard to negotiate when the mother has the sole , day-to-day responsibility with the children , he added .
" ca n't call for mommy " clearly , schaefer is on to something : the average length of paid leave taken by fathers so far is 4.3 months , well beyond the two months required to get the extra pay .
dieter fichter , a senior consultant at siemens in frankfurt , is beyond the “ babypause ” years .
his two children are 9 and 14 years old , and when they were infants he often put in long hours at work .
but , he said , colleagues of his now are taking the paid-leave offer , albeit just the minimum two months required to get the extra pay .
it isn ’ t seen as something that would damage their careers , he said .
“ missing two months of work is not too long , its nothing , ” fichter said .
moreover , he said , if such an offer had been available to him to him at the time , he would have taken it .
“ i think it would give you a closer relationship with your child , ” he said .
" you have a better understanding of what it means to be the person who has to take care of a child all day long , and know what its needs are , " fichter said .
" you ’ re not just with the child for a few hours on weekends .

previously , stay-at-home parents were given a lump sum of up to 300 euros per month , if they were eligible at all .
playing catch-up “ the fact that parental-leave payments are now based on earnings rather than a lump sum is an immense improvement over the earlier plan , ” said eberhard schaefer , a consultant and founder of the papa institute , which advises politicians , businesses and individuals on issues surrounding fathers and fatherhood .
“ germany is finally catching up with other european countries - especially in scandinavia , but others as well , " he said .
as a result of these changes , the german state approved some 200,000 applications for paid parental leave in 2007 , german family minister ursula von der leyen said in berlin on wednesday .
and the number of applications more than doubled from the first to the second quarters , from 60,000 to 140,000 per quarter .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the plan steers mothers back to the workplace “ clearly , this parental-leave policy is a hit , ” said von der leyen , whose mission to ease the road for working parents in germany has made her a controversial figure here since she took office in 2005 .
“ i am especially thrilled with the growing number of fathers who take paid parental leave , ” added von der leyen , herself a career woman with seven children .
financial effect last year , just 3.5 percent of fathers across germany took paid leave after their children were born .
today , that number is up to 8.5 percent .
the states with the highest quotas of applicants for “ papa leave ” include berlin , brandenburg , bavaria and hamburg , all of which were above the average .
at 8.5 births per 1,000 inhabitants , germany has the lowest birth rate in europe .
many observers believe this will only change when attitudes and policies become friendlier toward working parents .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von der leyen - happy with her plan 's results “ over the years i have heard from families and fathers that they couldn ’ t afford to stop working for those few months , " said papa institute 's schaefer .
" now , they are only losing 33 percent of their income , so many fathers and mothers say , ‘ ok , we can afford to do this for ourselves . ”
“ they do it gladly because they don ’ t want to lose the opportunity , ” he adds .
susanne seyda , an analyst in family economics at the institute for business -lrb- iw -rrb- in cologne , said the new regulation may simply have given more men the ability to ask for something they may have wanted all along .
previously , men may have worried about what staying home with their child would do to their career , seyda argues .
“ now they are in a stronger bargaining position when they go to ask for the time off .
the employer knows there is financial incentive , and they find it easier to understand . "
back to the work force , quicker the pro-business think tank stands behind the new plan , seyda said , because they think it could both boost german birth rates , and help get women back into the work force more quickly .
“ the opportunity costs are lower because parents don ’ t lose as much income , ” seyda noted .
“ highly qualified couples are more likely to have more children . ”
beyond that , under the new regulation , the government assistance runs out after 12 months - or 14 if the father takes two months .
then , for the mother , its back to the work force - or the assistance runs out .
under the old plan , assistance continued for three years .
“ that means women ’ s working responsibilities will grow and there will not be such a great loss of human capital , ” seyda said .
but birth rates and economic improvement is not as important as the effect such a change could have on german society , papa institute 's schaefer says .
he points out that studies have shown that fathers who spend time with their infants continue to spend more time with them as they grow up “ which could only be seen as a positive . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more fun than a day at the office ?
furthermore , experience with his own clients show that fathers don ’ t want their role to be solely that of breadwinner , or extra helper for the mother , who does the real job of raising the children .
“ they want to be seen as independent , responsible parents , ” which is often hard to negotiate when the mother has the sole , day-to-day responsibility with the children , he added .
" ca n't call for mommy " clearly , schaefer is on to something : the average length of paid leave taken by fathers so far is 4.3 months , well beyond the two months required to get the extra pay .
dieter fichter , a senior consultant at siemens in frankfurt , is beyond the “ babypause ” years .
his two children are 9 and 14 years old , and when they were infants he often put in long hours at work .
but , he said , colleagues of his now are taking the paid-leave offer , albeit just the minimum two months required to get the extra pay .
it isn ’ t seen as something that would damage their careers , he said .
“ missing two months of work is not too long , its nothing , ” fichter said .
moreover , he said , if such an offer had been available to him to him at the time , he would have taken it .
“ i think it would give you a closer relationship with your child , ” he said .
" you have a better understanding of what it means to be the person who has to take care of a child all day long , and know what its needs are , " fichter said .
" you ’ re not just with the child for a few hours on weekends .
and you can ’ t call for help from mommy if the baby is crying . ” jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he points out that studies have shown that fathers who spend time with their infants continue to spend more time with them as they grow up “ which could only be seen as a positive . ”

furthermore , experience with his own clients show that fathers don ’ t want their role to be solely that of breadwinner , or extra helper for the mother , who does the real job of raising the children .
“ they want to be seen as independent , responsible parents , ” which is often hard to negotiate when the mother has the sole , day-to-day responsibility with the children , he added .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de children and families -pipe- 15.08.2007 more german fathers opting to take parental leave großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stay-at-home dads can now spend more quality time with their children in germany , recent reports show a new , more remunerative plan to encourage recent fathers to take paid parenting leave is starting to have an effect . since the beginning of the year , germany has seen a leap in the number of fathers who take time off to stay home with their young children .
the reason : a sweeping change in how parents are paid for what germans refer to as the “ babypause , ” or parental leave .
in january , germany changed its parental-leave laws to give new parents 67 percent of their salary for up to 12 months or up to 14 months if at least two months of the “ pause ” is taken by the father .
the percentage has an upper cap of 1,800 euros -lrb- $ 2,425 -rrb- a month .
previously , stay-at-home parents were given a lump sum of up to 300 euros per month , if they were eligible at all .
playing catch-up “ the fact that parental-leave payments are now based on earnings rather than a lump sum is an immense improvement over the earlier plan , ” said eberhard schaefer , a consultant and founder of the papa institute , which advises politicians , businesses and individuals on issues surrounding fathers and fatherhood .
“ germany is finally catching up with other european countries - especially in scandinavia , but others as well , " he said .
as a result of these changes , the german state approved some 200,000 applications for paid parental leave in 2007 , german family minister ursula von der leyen said in berlin on wednesday .
and the number of applications more than doubled from the first to the second quarters , from 60,000 to 140,000 per quarter .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the plan steers mothers back to the workplace “ clearly , this parental-leave policy is a hit , ” said von der leyen , whose mission to ease the road for working parents in germany has made her a controversial figure here since she took office in 2005 .
“ i am especially thrilled with the growing number of fathers who take paid parental leave , ” added von der leyen , herself a career woman with seven children .
financial effect last year , just 3.5 percent of fathers across germany took paid leave after their children were born .
today , that number is up to 8.5 percent .
the states with the highest quotas of applicants for “ papa leave ” include berlin , brandenburg , bavaria and hamburg , all of which were above the average .
at 8.5 births per 1,000 inhabitants , germany has the lowest birth rate in europe .
many observers believe this will only change when attitudes and policies become friendlier toward working parents .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von der leyen - happy with her plan 's results “ over the years i have heard from families and fathers that they couldn ’ t afford to stop working for those few months , " said papa institute 's schaefer .
" now , they are only losing 33 percent of their income , so many fathers and mothers say , ‘ ok , we can afford to do this for ourselves . ”
“ they do it gladly because they don ’ t want to lose the opportunity , ” he adds .
susanne seyda , an analyst in family economics at the institute for business -lrb- iw -rrb- in cologne , said the new regulation may simply have given more men the ability to ask for something they may have wanted all along .
previously , men may have worried about what staying home with their child would do to their career , seyda argues .
“ now they are in a stronger bargaining position when they go to ask for the time off .
the employer knows there is financial incentive , and they find it easier to understand . "
back to the work force , quicker the pro-business think tank stands behind the new plan , seyda said , because they think it could both boost german birth rates , and help get women back into the work force more quickly .
“ the opportunity costs are lower because parents don ’ t lose as much income , ” seyda noted .
“ highly qualified couples are more likely to have more children . ”
beyond that , under the new regulation , the government assistance runs out after 12 months - or 14 if the father takes two months .
then , for the mother , its back to the work force - or the assistance runs out .
under the old plan , assistance continued for three years .
“ that means women ’ s working responsibilities will grow and there will not be such a great loss of human capital , ” seyda said .
but birth rates and economic improvement is not as important as the effect such a change could have on german society , papa institute 's schaefer says .

his religious-conservative party colleagues will dominate politics for years , but they should n't become complacent , says dw 's baha güngör . there 's no doubt that abdullah gül - backed by an absolute majority of parliamentarians and after three rounds of voting on aug .
28 - will become his country 's 11th president and occupy the highest office .
turkish premier erdogan 's governing religious-conservative party for justice and development -lrb- akp -rrb- has a clear majority in the national assembly with 341 of 550 seats .
since the nationalists have said that they 'll attend the first two rounds of voting on aug .
20 and aug .
24 , the two-thirds quorum mandated by the constitutional court will be present .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baha güngör the akp 's victory in the july 22 parliamentary elections was too obvious : 46 percent of votes is a clear message .
the army 's indirect coup threats and the desperate attempts of secular elites failed to prevent gül - and with him the first first lady with a headscarf in the presidential palace .
gül 's candidacy has sound democratic legitimacy and the akp will lift him into the highest office on aug .
28 - two days before the traditional " day of defense forces . "
last week , erdogan reached out to the secular opposition , during the election of the parliament 's president , by nominating köksal toptan , a compromise candidate , who was elected with an overwhelming 450 votes .
this sparked hope that erdogan would forego gül , the polarizing presidential candidate , or that the latter would simply take himself out of the race .
but gül had no intention of doing so .
why should he ?
the army , the secular elite , the constitutional court and incumbent president ahmet necedet all tried to prevent gül 's presidency by employing tactics that were hardly tolerable from a democratic point of view .
as a result , the electorate punished them severely .
gül will therefore become turkey 's highest-ranking civilian representative until 2014 .
it 's safe to bet that erdogan will do everything to replace him as the first president elected by popular vote .
on oct .
21 , turks will decide in a referendum whether the next president will be chosen by the people rather than by parliament .
if the july 22 election victory will be repeated , there 's no doubt that this change will take place - just as there 's no doubt that in seven years ' time , erdogan will be elected president of a country that has gone through an adjustment to a presidential political system by then .
it 's perfectly superfluous to restart the outdated debate about what the army will have to say about this development .
the generals ' reputation as guardians of secularism and democracy was damaged long before the indirect coup threat on april 27 in reaction to gül 's first candidacy .
since 1960 , four interventions by the military have all thrown back the country while established secular parties , led by incompetent , power-hungry politicians have surpassed each other in terms of democratic amateurism .
it remains to be seen whether erdogan and his akp will be able to handle the success and refrain from shooting themselves in the foot by rejecting a needed democratic culture of compromise and thinking that they 're infallible .
in 1983 , the religious-conservative motherland party won 45 percent of the vote after three years of military rule despite contrary " advice " for voters by the generals .
today , this party has been relegated to the sidelines outside parliament .
it 's hard to gauge turkish voters : just one year before the motherland party 's grandiose election victory , a constitution dictated by the military had been accepted in a referendum with 92 percent of votes .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de turkey -pipe- 15.08.2007 opinion : turkey 's unpredictable electorate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's foreign minister is set to become his country 's next president .
his religious-conservative party colleagues will dominate politics for years , but they should n't become complacent , says dw 's baha güngör . there 's no doubt that abdullah gül - backed by an absolute majority of parliamentarians and after three rounds of voting on aug .
28 - will become his country 's 11th president and occupy the highest office .
turkish premier erdogan 's governing religious-conservative party for justice and development -lrb- akp -rrb- has a clear majority in the national assembly with 341 of 550 seats .
since the nationalists have said that they 'll attend the first two rounds of voting on aug .
20 and aug .
24 , the two-thirds quorum mandated by the constitutional court will be present .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baha güngör the akp 's victory in the july 22 parliamentary elections was too obvious : 46 percent of votes is a clear message .
the army 's indirect coup threats and the desperate attempts of secular elites failed to prevent gül - and with him the first first lady with a headscarf in the presidential palace .
gül 's candidacy has sound democratic legitimacy and the akp will lift him into the highest office on aug .
28 - two days before the traditional " day of defense forces . "
last week , erdogan reached out to the secular opposition , during the election of the parliament 's president , by nominating köksal toptan , a compromise candidate , who was elected with an overwhelming 450 votes .
this sparked hope that erdogan would forego gül , the polarizing presidential candidate , or that the latter would simply take himself out of the race .
but gül had no intention of doing so .
why should he ?
the army , the secular elite , the constitutional court and incumbent president ahmet necedet all tried to prevent gül 's presidency by employing tactics that were hardly tolerable from a democratic point of view .
as a result , the electorate punished them severely .
gül will therefore become turkey 's highest-ranking civilian representative until 2014 .
it 's safe to bet that erdogan will do everything to replace him as the first president elected by popular vote .
on oct .
21 , turks will decide in a referendum whether the next president will be chosen by the people rather than by parliament .
if the july 22 election victory will be repeated , there 's no doubt that this change will take place - just as there 's no doubt that in seven years ' time , erdogan will be elected president of a country that has gone through an adjustment to a presidential political system by then .
it 's perfectly superfluous to restart the outdated debate about what the army will have to say about this development .
the generals ' reputation as guardians of secularism and democracy was damaged long before the indirect coup threat on april 27 in reaction to gül 's first candidacy .
since 1960 , four interventions by the military have all thrown back the country while established secular parties , led by incompetent , power-hungry politicians have surpassed each other in terms of democratic amateurism .
it remains to be seen whether erdogan and his akp will be able to handle the success and refrain from shooting themselves in the foot by rejecting a needed democratic culture of compromise and thinking that they 're infallible .
in 1983 , the religious-conservative motherland party won 45 percent of the vote after three years of military rule despite contrary " advice " for voters by the generals .
today , this party has been relegated to the sidelines outside parliament .
it 's hard to gauge turkish voters : just one year before the motherland party 's grandiose election victory , a constitution dictated by the military had been accepted in a referendum with 92 percent of votes .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baha güngör the akp 's victory in the july 22 parliamentary elections was too obvious : 46 percent of votes is a clear message .
the army 's indirect coup threats and the desperate attempts of secular elites failed to prevent gül - and with him the first first lady with a headscarf in the presidential palace .
gül 's candidacy has sound democratic legitimacy and the akp will lift him into the highest office on aug .
28 - two days before the traditional " day of defense forces . "
last week , erdogan reached out to the secular opposition , during the election of the parliament 's president , by nominating köksal toptan , a compromise candidate , who was elected with an overwhelming 450 votes .
this sparked hope that erdogan would forego gül , the polarizing presidential candidate , or that the latter would simply take himself out of the race .
but gül had no intention of doing so .
why should he ?
the army , the secular elite , the constitutional court and incumbent president ahmet necedet all tried to prevent gül 's presidency by employing tactics that were hardly tolerable from a democratic point of view .
as a result , the electorate punished them severely .
gül will therefore become turkey 's highest-ranking civilian representative until 2014 .
it 's safe to bet that erdogan will do everything to replace him as the first president elected by popular vote .
on oct .
21 , turks will decide in a referendum whether the next president will be chosen by the people rather than by parliament .
if the july 22 election victory will be repeated , there 's no doubt that this change will take place - just as there 's no doubt that in seven years ' time , erdogan will be elected president of a country that has gone through an adjustment to a presidential political system by then .
it 's perfectly superfluous to restart the outdated debate about what the army will have to say about this development .
the generals ' reputation as guardians of secularism and democracy was damaged long before the indirect coup threat on april 27 in reaction to gül 's first candidacy .
since 1960 , four interventions by the military have all thrown back the country while established secular parties , led by incompetent , power-hungry politicians have surpassed each other in terms of democratic amateurism .
it remains to be seen whether erdogan and his akp will be able to handle the success and refrain from shooting themselves in the foot by rejecting a needed democratic culture of compromise and thinking that they 're infallible .
in 1983 , the religious-conservative motherland party won 45 percent of the vote after three years of military rule despite contrary " advice " for voters by the generals .
today , this party has been relegated to the sidelines outside parliament .
it 's hard to gauge turkish voters : just one year before the motherland party 's grandiose election victory , a constitution dictated by the military had been accepted in a referendum with 92 percent of votes .

" we are now trying to prevent a similar tragedy -lrb- in calabria -rrb- , " amato told a news conference . italy 's deputy director of police , luigi de sena , and anti-mafia prosecutor pietro grasso meanwhile said such killings in another country were unprecedented . " the calabria mafia has a significant presence in germany , but until now they have always tried to keep a low profile , " de sena told italian news service ansa . grasso said the six men had probably been sent to duisburg in a bid to escape the consequences of the vendetta . in germany , local police spokesman hermann-josef helmich said the men were aged between 16 and 39 . police were quizzing family members of the victims and an autopsy was being conducted to determine the exact cause of death .
execution-style murders bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medics look on as one of the victims is brought to a hearse the execution-style killings took place in front of an italian restaurant .
police said the shots appeared to have been fired through the windscreens of the vehicles .
one car had duisburg license planes and the other was registered in the town of pforzheim . police spokesman reinhard pape said cctv footage from a nearby public building was being studied , and police were looking into reports that two men had been seen in the area at the time of the shooting . police said they were alerted at around 2:30 a.m. by a woman who had heard gunshots . the victims were found in the neudorf part of the city on a main thoroughfare some 100 meters -lrb- 100 yards -rrb- from the central station .
police immediately cordoned off the entire area .
similar killings in february the killings drew comparisons with the murder of seven asians in an armed robbery at a chinese restaurant in the northern german town of sittensen in february . five staff members from malaysia , thailand , vietnam and hong kong were tied up and shot dead along with popular local restaurant owner danny wing hong fan , 36 , and his 28-year-old wife , both british citizens .
only their baby survived . the case comes to trial in the nearby town of stade next week .

" the idea for the mutatoes came one day when i was shopping , " westphal told dw-world.de.

" bildunterschrift : mutatoes come in various shapes , sizes and colors the idea behind the 500-plus collection of organic curiosities , which westphal photographs and archives on his web site , is to point out the artificial standardization of the products we buy in mass supermarkets .

" of course , there are a lot of people who treat the project as a gag , " westphal said .
" but i 've been pleased that there have also been serious discussions .
i do n't think humorous perspectives are necessarily negative , as long as people do n't stop thinking . "
indeed , while they may be fun to look at , westphal 's photos offer a subtle criticism of today 's culture of cosmetic surgery , the insistence on trying to make the food we consume - to say nothing of the way we look physically - conform to artificial standards of normality and beauty .

a proposal by a german government spokesman to include moderate taliban representatives in the afghan peace process has been criticized by a conservative foreign policy expert in parliament . it remained unclear how an explosion wednesday that reportedly claimed the lives of three germans would influence the current dialog debate . according to news reports , deputy government spokesman thomas steg on monday suggested that " moderate , reasonable " taliban representatives should be included in the reconstruction and reconciliation process in afghanistan . the suggestion has been criticized by karl-theodor zu guttenberg , a parliamentarian and foreign policy expert for bavaria 's conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , the sister party of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- .

" we are now trying to prevent a similar tragedy -lrb- in calabria -rrb- , " amato told a news conference . italy 's deputy director of police , luigi de sena , and anti-mafia prosecutor pietro grasso meanwhile said such killings in another country were unprecedented . " the calabria mafia has a significant presence in germany , but until now they have always tried to keep a low profile , " de sena told italian news service ansa . grasso said the six men had probably been sent to duisburg in a bid to escape the consequences of the vendetta . in germany , local police spokesman hermann-josef helmich said the men were aged between 16 and 39 . police were quizzing family members of the victims and an autopsy was being conducted to determine the exact cause of death .

" the calabria mafia has a significant presence in germany , but until now they have always tried to keep a low profile , " de sena told italian news service ansa . grasso said the six men had probably been sent to duisburg in a bid to escape the consequences of the vendetta . in germany , local police spokesman hermann-josef helmich said the men were aged between 16 and 39 . police were quizzing family members of the victims and an autopsy was being conducted to determine the exact cause of death .

a proposal by a german government spokesman to include moderate taliban representatives in the afghan peace process has been criticized by a conservative foreign policy expert in parliament . it remained unclear how an explosion wednesday that reportedly claimed the lives of three germans would influence the current dialog debate . according to news reports , deputy government spokesman thomas steg on monday suggested that " moderate , reasonable " taliban representatives should be included in the reconstruction and reconciliation process in afghanistan . the suggestion has been criticized by karl-theodor zu guttenberg , a parliamentarian and foreign policy expert for bavaria 's conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , the sister party of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- . " the taliban were and are supporters of an inhuman terror regime , " guttenberg said in a press statement .
" they have knowingly supported international terrorism and al qaeda .
these connections still exist today . " more civic participation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some boycotted a recent peace conference in kabul because taliban were not invited guttenberg added that taliban fighters should be reintegrated into afghan society , but he said that there were no signs that moderate , let alone reasonable , taliban existed . " that 's why it 's so important to continue the work against the taliban by the afghan government and the international community , " he said .
" to involve the taliban in the stabilization and reconstruction of the country would be a preposterous turn away from reality . " the chairman of the parliament 's foreign affairs committee , ruprecht polenz -lrb- cdu -rrb- , also warned against undermining the moral basis for the german and international mission in afghanistan . in an interview with the daily frankfurter rundschau , he said that including certain insurgent groups in talks would have to lead to rule of law and more civic participation for afghans - " ergo the opposite of the taliban 's terror regime until 2001 . " mutually exclusive ? berlin 's der tagesspiegel in an editorial also said steg 's comments seemed strange . " if there are -lsb- moderate , reasonable taliban -rsb- - sure , talking ca n't hurt , " the daily wrote .
" but so far , it seemed that the two things were mutually exclusive : someone is either a taliban - or reasonable . " in april , a similar controversy arose when kurt beck , the leader of germany 's social democratic party , which forms a coalition with the cdu / csu , suggested that taliban representatives should be invited to peace talks .
at the time , afghan president hamid karzai had confirmed that he was doing just that . article based on news reports -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

after only three days of talks , the troika said it could no longer rule out a division of kosovo into albanian and serbian sectors .
on dec .
10 , the troika is due to present a report to the un on the way forward .
erhard busek of austria has been the eu coordinator of the stability pact for south-eastern europe since 2002 .
dw-radio : in view of the resistance from kosovo albanians , how realistic is the concept of a division of kosovo ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erhard busek erhard busek : at the moment there are only proposals to which someone has expressed opposition .
if you act on that assumption , then there 's no proposal whatsoever , but that 's not a solution .
any compromise that comes about wo n't receive the agreement of both disputing parties , but there must of course be a solution with which one can live , and that must be the assumption .
of all the bad solutions , that is at least a possible one .
there 's only the possibility of either reaching a virtual rapprochement or to decide in one way or another in conflict , with all the consequences that involves .
many observers have indicated that a compromise is n't at all possible .
what perspective do you see for the current 120-day attempt at dialogue ?
the perspective is rather clear .
if there is some area where the parties at least come close , where the distance diminishes , then there is a possibility .
it will hardly be a solution , where one can speak of great agreements .
the other " solution " is of course that it could cause a unilateral process of recognition .
that , however , brings up its own problems .
that starts already within the european union .
the mandates of the united nations mission in kosovo -lrb- unmik -rrb- and nato 's kosovo force -lrb- kfor -rrb- stem from un resolution 1244 .
these institutions can hardly go beyond their means .
unilateral recognition would in any case occur without the un .
everyone has to be clear on that .
many are of course scared of by that - and with good reason .
there 's also the problem that the eu plays a significant role in the development of institutions in kosovo - but on the basis of what mandate should it then do that ?
that 's where the resulting problems begin .
what would happen to kfor if the un was no longer involved ?
you have to ask those in favor of unilateral recognition .
do you think that unilateral recognition is n't doable , or is n't desirable ?
not desirable .
everything is doable , for , politics is , as you know , the art of the possible .
the six-nation contract group , composed of the us , britain , france , germany , italy and russia , has so far rejected division as one of its basic principles .
can the troika , which was named by the contact group , move away from the principles ?
here , too , politics is the art of the possible .
the principles have been mentioned repeatedly due to the " parallel cases . "
i think you have to very clearly establish that the kosovo question in itself does n't produce any solutions for parallel cases , but rather poses a unique problem .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo 's premier ceku , second left , with the troika members it is after all the only case of a nato intervention .
that has never happened before in such a manner .
to that extent , drawing parallels is exceedingly problematic .
here the question is more on the side of the security council .
there were definitely also serbian views that could imagine a sort of division under certain conditions .
in this respect , the troika surely had a reason for the proposal to resurface again .
many observers have cited republika srpska as a precedent .
you do n't see it that way ?
i do n't see a precedent there at all , since it was a different situation .
in tito 's yugoslavia , bosnia and herzegovina was also a constituent republic .
that had a different , deeply rooted tradition .
on the other hand , i did n't always have the impression that people in belgrade would be so enthusiastic if that problem were also to arise .
a clear geographical division of kosovo is n't even possible .
that 's right , that 's a majority solution .
serbs in other parts of kosovo would stay behind .
one should n't underestimate that then , albanians in the presevo valley would also express wishes when it comes to serbia and demand adjustments to the border .
in any case , it means opening a pandora 's box .

there , amidst the usual farmers catering to lifestyle-conscious yuppies , shoppers were shocked to find 27-year-old uli westphal with a display of peppers and potatoes , cucumbers and carrots that looked like they had just landed from outer space . " the idea for the mutatoes came one day when i was shopping , " westphal told dw-world.de.
" a little more than a year ago , i found a five-headed eggplant at a farmers ' market and then , a few stalls further on , some bell peppers that resembled props from a science-fiction film .
since then , i 've kept my eyes opens for such finds . " bildunterschrift : mutatoes come in various shapes , sizes and colors the idea behind the 500-plus collection of organic curiosities , which westphal photographs and archives on his web site , is to point out the artificial standardization of the products we buy in mass supermarkets .
the mutations are all natural - not the result of radiation or genetic manipulation . and they 're surprisingly aesthetic , as visitors to the berlin market found out . " there were people who wanted to buy my vegetables , businessmen who compared them with henry moore sculptures and vendors who brought me some examples of their own , " westphal said . art or food ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : artist uli westphal and his mutatoes at the farmers ' market the mutatoes ' fame quickly began to spread via the internet , starting with the new-york-based blog swissmiss . " his unusual market stand made me look , " said tina roth eisenberg , who was in berlin for westphal 's " opening . "
" when i approached it and saw the sign ' not for sale , ' i was scratching my head .
i think his collection was particularly surprising as he was showcasing it in the context of ' real , ' normal food stands . " in particular , fashion and graphic designers have taken to the freaky fruit and veg .
westphal 's photos have been featured on the web site of the diesel clothing label , and the discovery channel has been interested in using the images as well . " designers find inspiration in all kinds of things , " said darius a. monsef iv , who runs the blog colour lovers .
" while most people might not see it , one of these mutatoes might end up inspiring the next piece of furniture or fashion trend . "
westphal has been somewhat caught off guard by all the interest .
" in the past few weeks , several hundred blogs and web sites have reported on the project , " he said .
" it 's really fascinating to see the different contexts in which my project has appeared - everything from industrial designers , chemical firms , recipe pages , shoe manufacturers and environmental activists to pornographic sites and forums for pregnant women . " easy on the eye , yummy in the tummy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an eggplant with henry moore quality the phallic quality of a handful of westphal 's specimens does indeed give rise to some prurient giggles .
but westphal is n't too terribly bothered , if some people see his mutatoes as just the latest on-line joke .
" of course , there are a lot of people who treat the project as a gag , " westphal said .
" but i 've been pleased that there have also been serious discussions .
i do n't think humorous perspectives are necessarily negative , as long as people do n't stop thinking . "
indeed , while they may be fun to look at , westphal 's photos offer a subtle criticism of today 's culture of cosmetic surgery , the insistence on trying to make the food we consume - to say nothing of the way we look physically - conform to artificial standards of normality and beauty .
the mutatoes remind viewers that deviating from the norm is healthy .
though westphal 's mutants may look bizarre , they 're arguably better for you than the standardized products that occupy most supermarkets ' shelves .
the proof is the artist himself .
" after i 'm done with the photographs , i usually eat the mutatoes , " westphal said .

after only three days of talks , the troika said it could no longer rule out a division of kosovo into albanian and serbian sectors .
on dec .
10 , the troika is due to present a report to the un on the way forward .
erhard busek of austria has been the eu coordinator of the stability pact for south-eastern europe since 2002 .
dw-radio : in view of the resistance from kosovo albanians , how realistic is the concept of a division of kosovo ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erhard busek erhard busek : at the moment there are only proposals to which someone has expressed opposition .
if you act on that assumption , then there 's no proposal whatsoever , but that 's not a solution .
any compromise that comes about wo n't receive the agreement of both disputing parties , but there must of course be a solution with which one can live , and that must be the assumption .
of all the bad solutions , that is at least a possible one .
there 's only the possibility of either reaching a virtual rapprochement or to decide in one way or another in conflict , with all the consequences that involves .
many observers have indicated that a compromise is n't at all possible .
what perspective do you see for the current 120-day attempt at dialogue ?
the perspective is rather clear .
if there is some area where the parties at least come close , where the distance diminishes , then there is a possibility .
it will hardly be a solution , where one can speak of great agreements .
the other " solution " is of course that it could cause a unilateral process of recognition .
that , however , brings up its own problems .
that starts already within the european union .
the mandates of the united nations mission in kosovo -lrb- unmik -rrb- and nato 's kosovo force -lrb- kfor -rrb- stem from un resolution 1244 .
these institutions can hardly go beyond their means .
unilateral recognition would in any case occur without the un .
everyone has to be clear on that .
many are of course scared of by that - and with good reason .
there 's also the problem that the eu plays a significant role in the development of institutions in kosovo - but on the basis of what mandate should it then do that ?
that 's where the resulting problems begin .
what would happen to kfor if the un was no longer involved ?
you have to ask those in favor of unilateral recognition .
do you think that unilateral recognition is n't doable , or is n't desirable ?
not desirable .
everything is doable , for , politics is , as you know , the art of the possible .
the six-nation contract group , composed of the us , britain , france , germany , italy and russia , has so far rejected division as one of its basic principles .
can the troika , which was named by the contact group , move away from the principles ?
here , too , politics is the art of the possible .
the principles have been mentioned repeatedly due to the " parallel cases . "
i think you have to very clearly establish that the kosovo question in itself does n't produce any solutions for parallel cases , but rather poses a unique problem .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo 's premier ceku , second left , with the troika members it is after all the only case of a nato intervention .
that has never happened before in such a manner .
to that extent , drawing parallels is exceedingly problematic .
here the question is more on the side of the security council .
there were definitely also serbian views that could imagine a sort of division under certain conditions .
in this respect , the troika surely had a reason for the proposal to resurface again .
many observers have cited republika srpska as a precedent .
you do n't see it that way ?
i do n't see a precedent there at all , since it was a different situation .
in tito 's yugoslavia , bosnia and herzegovina was also a constituent republic .
that had a different , deeply rooted tradition .
on the other hand , i did n't always have the impression that people in belgrade would be so enthusiastic if that problem were also to arise .
a clear geographical division of kosovo is n't even possible .
that 's right , that 's a majority solution .
serbs in other parts of kosovo would stay behind .
one should n't underestimate that then , albanians in the presevo valley would also express wishes when it comes to serbia and demand adjustments to the border .
in any case , it means opening a pandora 's box .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erhard busek erhard busek : at the moment there are only proposals to which someone has expressed opposition .
if you act on that assumption , then there 's no proposal whatsoever , but that 's not a solution .
any compromise that comes about wo n't receive the agreement of both disputing parties , but there must of course be a solution with which one can live , and that must be the assumption .
of all the bad solutions , that is at least a possible one .
there 's only the possibility of either reaching a virtual rapprochement or to decide in one way or another in conflict , with all the consequences that involves .
many observers have indicated that a compromise is n't at all possible .
what perspective do you see for the current 120-day attempt at dialogue ?
the perspective is rather clear .
if there is some area where the parties at least come close , where the distance diminishes , then there is a possibility .
it will hardly be a solution , where one can speak of great agreements .
the other " solution " is of course that it could cause a unilateral process of recognition .
that , however , brings up its own problems .
that starts already within the european union .

these institutions can hardly go beyond their means .
unilateral recognition would in any case occur without the un .
everyone has to be clear on that .
many are of course scared of by that - and with good reason .
there 's also the problem that the eu plays a significant role in the development of institutions in kosovo - but on the basis of what mandate should it then do that ?
that 's where the resulting problems begin .
what would happen to kfor if the un was no longer involved ?
you have to ask those in favor of unilateral recognition .
do you think that unilateral recognition is n't doable , or is n't desirable ?
not desirable .
everything is doable , for , politics is , as you know , the art of the possible .
the six-nation contract group , composed of the us , britain , france , germany , italy and russia , has so far rejected division as one of its basic principles .
can the troika , which was named by the contact group , move away from the principles ?
here , too , politics is the art of the possible .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de turkey -pipe- 15.08.2007 opinion : turkey 's unpredictable electorate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's foreign minister is set to become his country 's next president .
his religious-conservative party colleagues will dominate politics for years , but they should n't become complacent , says dw 's baha güngör . there 's no doubt that abdullah gül - backed by an absolute majority of parliamentarians and after three rounds of voting on aug .
28 - will become his country 's 11th president and occupy the highest office .
turkish premier erdogan 's governing religious-conservative party for justice and development -lrb- akp -rrb- has a clear majority in the national assembly with 341 of 550 seats .
since the nationalists have said that they 'll attend the first two rounds of voting on aug .
20 and aug .
24 , the two-thirds quorum mandated by the constitutional court will be present .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baha güngör the akp 's victory in the july 22 parliamentary elections was too obvious : 46 percent of votes is a clear message .
the army 's indirect coup threats and the desperate attempts of secular elites failed to prevent gül - and with him the first first lady with a headscarf in the presidential palace .
gül 's candidacy has sound democratic legitimacy and the akp will lift him into the highest office on aug .
28 - two days before the traditional " day of defense forces . "
last week , erdogan reached out to the secular opposition , during the election of the parliament 's president , by nominating köksal toptan , a compromise candidate , who was elected with an overwhelming 450 votes .
this sparked hope that erdogan would forego gül , the polarizing presidential candidate , or that the latter would simply take himself out of the race .
but gül had no intention of doing so .
why should he ?
the army , the secular elite , the constitutional court and incumbent president ahmet necedet all tried to prevent gül 's presidency by employing tactics that were hardly tolerable from a democratic point of view .
as a result , the electorate punished them severely .
gül will therefore become turkey 's highest-ranking civilian representative until 2014 .
it 's safe to bet that erdogan will do everything to replace him as the first president elected by popular vote .
on oct .
21 , turks will decide in a referendum whether the next president will be chosen by the people rather than by parliament .
if the july 22 election victory will be repeated , there 's no doubt that this change will take place - just as there 's no doubt that in seven years ' time , erdogan will be elected president of a country that has gone through an adjustment to a presidential political system by then .
it 's perfectly superfluous to restart the outdated debate about what the army will have to say about this development .
the generals ' reputation as guardians of secularism and democracy was damaged long before the indirect coup threat on april 27 in reaction to gül 's first candidacy .
since 1960 , four interventions by the military have all thrown back the country while established secular parties , led by incompetent , power-hungry politicians have surpassed each other in terms of democratic amateurism .
it remains to be seen whether erdogan and his akp will be able to handle the success and refrain from shooting themselves in the foot by rejecting a needed democratic culture of compromise and thinking that they 're infallible .

his religious-conservative party colleagues will dominate politics for years , but they should n't become complacent , says dw 's baha güngör . there 's no doubt that abdullah gül - backed by an absolute majority of parliamentarians and after three rounds of voting on aug .
28 - will become his country 's 11th president and occupy the highest office .
turkish premier erdogan 's governing religious-conservative party for justice and development -lrb- akp -rrb- has a clear majority in the national assembly with 341 of 550 seats .
since the nationalists have said that they 'll attend the first two rounds of voting on aug .
20 and aug .
24 , the two-thirds quorum mandated by the constitutional court will be present .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baha güngör the akp 's victory in the july 22 parliamentary elections was too obvious : 46 percent of votes is a clear message .
the army 's indirect coup threats and the desperate attempts of secular elites failed to prevent gül - and with him the first first lady with a headscarf in the presidential palace .
gül 's candidacy has sound democratic legitimacy and the akp will lift him into the highest office on aug .
28 - two days before the traditional " day of defense forces . "
last week , erdogan reached out to the secular opposition , during the election of the parliament 's president , by nominating köksal toptan , a compromise candidate , who was elected with an overwhelming 450 votes .
this sparked hope that erdogan would forego gül , the polarizing presidential candidate , or that the latter would simply take himself out of the race .
but gül had no intention of doing so .
why should he ?
the army , the secular elite , the constitutional court and incumbent president ahmet necedet all tried to prevent gül 's presidency by employing tactics that were hardly tolerable from a democratic point of view .
as a result , the electorate punished them severely .
gül will therefore become turkey 's highest-ranking civilian representative until 2014 .
it 's safe to bet that erdogan will do everything to replace him as the first president elected by popular vote .
on oct .
21 , turks will decide in a referendum whether the next president will be chosen by the people rather than by parliament .
if the july 22 election victory will be repeated , there 's no doubt that this change will take place - just as there 's no doubt that in seven years ' time , erdogan will be elected president of a country that has gone through an adjustment to a presidential political system by then .
it 's perfectly superfluous to restart the outdated debate about what the army will have to say about this development .
the generals ' reputation as guardians of secularism and democracy was damaged long before the indirect coup threat on april 27 in reaction to gül 's first candidacy .
since 1960 , four interventions by the military have all thrown back the country while established secular parties , led by incompetent , power-hungry politicians have surpassed each other in terms of democratic amateurism .
it remains to be seen whether erdogan and his akp will be able to handle the success and refrain from shooting themselves in the foot by rejecting a needed democratic culture of compromise and thinking that they 're infallible .

turkish premier erdogan 's governing religious-conservative party for justice and development -lrb- akp -rrb- has a clear majority in the national assembly with 341 of 550 seats .
since the nationalists have said that they 'll attend the first two rounds of voting on aug .
20 and aug .
24 , the two-thirds quorum mandated by the constitutional court will be present .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baha güngör the akp 's victory in the july 22 parliamentary elections was too obvious : 46 percent of votes is a clear message .
the army 's indirect coup threats and the desperate attempts of secular elites failed to prevent gül - and with him the first first lady with a headscarf in the presidential palace .
gül 's candidacy has sound democratic legitimacy and the akp will lift him into the highest office on aug .
28 - two days before the traditional " day of defense forces . "
last week , erdogan reached out to the secular opposition , during the election of the parliament 's president , by nominating köksal toptan , a compromise candidate , who was elected with an overwhelming 450 votes .
this sparked hope that erdogan would forego gül , the polarizing presidential candidate , or that the latter would simply take himself out of the race .
but gül had no intention of doing so .
why should he ?
the army , the secular elite , the constitutional court and incumbent president ahmet necedet all tried to prevent gül 's presidency by employing tactics that were hardly tolerable from a democratic point of view .
as a result , the electorate punished them severely .
gül will therefore become turkey 's highest-ranking civilian representative until 2014 .
it 's safe to bet that erdogan will do everything to replace him as the first president elected by popular vote .
on oct .
21 , turks will decide in a referendum whether the next president will be chosen by the people rather than by parliament .
if the july 22 election victory will be repeated , there 's no doubt that this change will take place - just as there 's no doubt that in seven years ' time , erdogan will be elected president of a country that has gone through an adjustment to a presidential political system by then .
it 's perfectly superfluous to restart the outdated debate about what the army will have to say about this development .
the generals ' reputation as guardians of secularism and democracy was damaged long before the indirect coup threat on april 27 in reaction to gül 's first candidacy .
since 1960 , four interventions by the military have all thrown back the country while established secular parties , led by incompetent , power-hungry politicians have surpassed each other in terms of democratic amateurism .
it remains to be seen whether erdogan and his akp will be able to handle the success and refrain from shooting themselves in the foot by rejecting a needed democratic culture of compromise and thinking that they 're infallible .
in 1983 , the religious-conservative motherland party won 45 percent of the vote after three years of military rule despite contrary " advice " for voters by the generals .
today , this party has been relegated to the sidelines outside parliament .
it 's hard to gauge turkish voters : just one year before the motherland party 's grandiose election victory , a constitution dictated by the military had been accepted in a referendum with 92 percent of votes .

after only three days of talks , the troika said it could no longer rule out a division of kosovo into albanian and serbian sectors .
on dec .
10 , the troika is due to present a report to the un on the way forward .
erhard busek of austria has been the eu coordinator of the stability pact for south-eastern europe since 2002 .
dw-radio : in view of the resistance from kosovo albanians , how realistic is the concept of a division of kosovo ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erhard busek erhard busek : at the moment there are only proposals to which someone has expressed opposition .
if you act on that assumption , then there 's no proposal whatsoever , but that 's not a solution .
any compromise that comes about wo n't receive the agreement of both disputing parties , but there must of course be a solution with which one can live , and that must be the assumption .
of all the bad solutions , that is at least a possible one .
there 's only the possibility of either reaching a virtual rapprochement or to decide in one way or another in conflict , with all the consequences that involves .
many observers have indicated that a compromise is n't at all possible .
what perspective do you see for the current 120-day attempt at dialogue ?
the perspective is rather clear .
if there is some area where the parties at least come close , where the distance diminishes , then there is a possibility .
it will hardly be a solution , where one can speak of great agreements .
the other " solution " is of course that it could cause a unilateral process of recognition .
that , however , brings up its own problems .
that starts already within the european union .
the mandates of the united nations mission in kosovo -lrb- unmik -rrb- and nato 's kosovo force -lrb- kfor -rrb- stem from un resolution 1244 .
these institutions can hardly go beyond their means .
unilateral recognition would in any case occur without the un .
everyone has to be clear on that .
many are of course scared of by that - and with good reason .
there 's also the problem that the eu plays a significant role in the development of institutions in kosovo - but on the basis of what mandate should it then do that ?
that 's where the resulting problems begin .
what would happen to kfor if the un was no longer involved ?
you have to ask those in favor of unilateral recognition .
do you think that unilateral recognition is n't doable , or is n't desirable ?
not desirable .
everything is doable , for , politics is , as you know , the art of the possible .
the six-nation contract group , composed of the us , britain , france , germany , italy and russia , has so far rejected division as one of its basic principles .
can the troika , which was named by the contact group , move away from the principles ?
here , too , politics is the art of the possible .
the principles have been mentioned repeatedly due to the " parallel cases . "
i think you have to very clearly establish that the kosovo question in itself does n't produce any solutions for parallel cases , but rather poses a unique problem .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo 's premier ceku , second left , with the troika members it is after all the only case of a nato intervention .
that has never happened before in such a manner .
to that extent , drawing parallels is exceedingly problematic .
here the question is more on the side of the security council .
there were definitely also serbian views that could imagine a sort of division under certain conditions .
in this respect , the troika surely had a reason for the proposal to resurface again .
many observers have cited republika srpska as a precedent .
you do n't see it that way ?

in tito 's yugoslavia , bosnia and herzegovina was also a constituent republic .
that had a different , deeply rooted tradition .

a clear geographical division of kosovo is n't even possible .
that 's right , that 's a majority solution .
serbs in other parts of kosovo would stay behind .
one should n't underestimate that then , albanians in the presevo valley would also express wishes when it comes to serbia and demand adjustments to the border .
in any case , it means opening a pandora 's box .

his religious-conservative party colleagues will dominate politics for years , but they should n't become complacent , says dw 's baha güngör . there 's no doubt that abdullah gül - backed by an absolute majority of parliamentarians and after three rounds of voting on aug .
28 - will become his country 's 11th president and occupy the highest office .
turkish premier erdogan 's governing religious-conservative party for justice and development -lrb- akp -rrb- has a clear majority in the national assembly with 341 of 550 seats .
since the nationalists have said that they 'll attend the first two rounds of voting on aug .
20 and aug .
24 , the two-thirds quorum mandated by the constitutional court will be present .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baha güngör the akp 's victory in the july 22 parliamentary elections was too obvious : 46 percent of votes is a clear message .
the army 's indirect coup threats and the desperate attempts of secular elites failed to prevent gül - and with him the first first lady with a headscarf in the presidential palace .
gül 's candidacy has sound democratic legitimacy and the akp will lift him into the highest office on aug .
28 - two days before the traditional " day of defense forces . "
last week , erdogan reached out to the secular opposition , during the election of the parliament 's president , by nominating köksal toptan , a compromise candidate , who was elected with an overwhelming 450 votes .
this sparked hope that erdogan would forego gül , the polarizing presidential candidate , or that the latter would simply take himself out of the race .
but gül had no intention of doing so .
why should he ?
the army , the secular elite , the constitutional court and incumbent president ahmet necedet all tried to prevent gül 's presidency by employing tactics that were hardly tolerable from a democratic point of view .
as a result , the electorate punished them severely .
gül will therefore become turkey 's highest-ranking civilian representative until 2014 .
it 's safe to bet that erdogan will do everything to replace him as the first president elected by popular vote .
on oct .
21 , turks will decide in a referendum whether the next president will be chosen by the people rather than by parliament .
if the july 22 election victory will be repeated , there 's no doubt that this change will take place - just as there 's no doubt that in seven years ' time , erdogan will be elected president of a country that has gone through an adjustment to a presidential political system by then .
it 's perfectly superfluous to restart the outdated debate about what the army will have to say about this development .
the generals ' reputation as guardians of secularism and democracy was damaged long before the indirect coup threat on april 27 in reaction to gül 's first candidacy .
since 1960 , four interventions by the military have all thrown back the country while established secular parties , led by incompetent , power-hungry politicians have surpassed each other in terms of democratic amateurism .
it remains to be seen whether erdogan and his akp will be able to handle the success and refrain from shooting themselves in the foot by rejecting a needed democratic culture of compromise and thinking that they 're infallible .
in 1983 , the religious-conservative motherland party won 45 percent of the vote after three years of military rule despite contrary " advice " for voters by the generals .
today , this party has been relegated to the sidelines outside parliament .
it 's hard to gauge turkish voters : just one year before the motherland party 's grandiose election victory , a constitution dictated by the military had been accepted in a referendum with 92 percent of votes .

turkish premier erdogan 's governing religious-conservative party for justice and development -lrb- akp -rrb- has a clear majority in the national assembly with 341 of 550 seats .
since the nationalists have said that they 'll attend the first two rounds of voting on aug .
20 and aug .
24 , the two-thirds quorum mandated by the constitutional court will be present .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baha güngör the akp 's victory in the july 22 parliamentary elections was too obvious : 46 percent of votes is a clear message .
the army 's indirect coup threats and the desperate attempts of secular elites failed to prevent gül - and with him the first first lady with a headscarf in the presidential palace .
gül 's candidacy has sound democratic legitimacy and the akp will lift him into the highest office on aug .
28 - two days before the traditional " day of defense forces . "
last week , erdogan reached out to the secular opposition , during the election of the parliament 's president , by nominating köksal toptan , a compromise candidate , who was elected with an overwhelming 450 votes .
this sparked hope that erdogan would forego gül , the polarizing presidential candidate , or that the latter would simply take himself out of the race .
but gül had no intention of doing so .
why should he ?
the army , the secular elite , the constitutional court and incumbent president ahmet necedet all tried to prevent gül 's presidency by employing tactics that were hardly tolerable from a democratic point of view .
as a result , the electorate punished them severely .
gül will therefore become turkey 's highest-ranking civilian representative until 2014 .
it 's safe to bet that erdogan will do everything to replace him as the first president elected by popular vote .
on oct .
21 , turks will decide in a referendum whether the next president will be chosen by the people rather than by parliament .
if the july 22 election victory will be repeated , there 's no doubt that this change will take place - just as there 's no doubt that in seven years ' time , erdogan will be elected president of a country that has gone through an adjustment to a presidential political system by then .
it 's perfectly superfluous to restart the outdated debate about what the army will have to say about this development .
the generals ' reputation as guardians of secularism and democracy was damaged long before the indirect coup threat on april 27 in reaction to gül 's first candidacy .
since 1960 , four interventions by the military have all thrown back the country while established secular parties , led by incompetent , power-hungry politicians have surpassed each other in terms of democratic amateurism .
it remains to be seen whether erdogan and his akp will be able to handle the success and refrain from shooting themselves in the foot by rejecting a needed democratic culture of compromise and thinking that they 're infallible .
in 1983 , the religious-conservative motherland party won 45 percent of the vote after three years of military rule despite contrary " advice " for voters by the generals .
today , this party has been relegated to the sidelines outside parliament .
it 's hard to gauge turkish voters : just one year before the motherland party 's grandiose election victory , a constitution dictated by the military had been accepted in a referendum with 92 percent of votes .

after only three days of talks , the troika said it could no longer rule out a division of kosovo into albanian and serbian sectors .
on dec .
10 , the troika is due to present a report to the un on the way forward .
erhard busek of austria has been the eu coordinator of the stability pact for south-eastern europe since 2002 .
dw-radio : in view of the resistance from kosovo albanians , how realistic is the concept of a division of kosovo ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erhard busek erhard busek : at the moment there are only proposals to which someone has expressed opposition .
if you act on that assumption , then there 's no proposal whatsoever , but that 's not a solution .
any compromise that comes about wo n't receive the agreement of both disputing parties , but there must of course be a solution with which one can live , and that must be the assumption .
of all the bad solutions , that is at least a possible one .
there 's only the possibility of either reaching a virtual rapprochement or to decide in one way or another in conflict , with all the consequences that involves .
many observers have indicated that a compromise is n't at all possible .
what perspective do you see for the current 120-day attempt at dialogue ?
the perspective is rather clear .
if there is some area where the parties at least come close , where the distance diminishes , then there is a possibility .
it will hardly be a solution , where one can speak of great agreements .
the other " solution " is of course that it could cause a unilateral process of recognition .
that , however , brings up its own problems .
that starts already within the european union .
the mandates of the united nations mission in kosovo -lrb- unmik -rrb- and nato 's kosovo force -lrb- kfor -rrb- stem from un resolution 1244 .
these institutions can hardly go beyond their means .
unilateral recognition would in any case occur without the un .
everyone has to be clear on that .
many are of course scared of by that - and with good reason .
there 's also the problem that the eu plays a significant role in the development of institutions in kosovo - but on the basis of what mandate should it then do that ?
that 's where the resulting problems begin .
what would happen to kfor if the un was no longer involved ?
you have to ask those in favor of unilateral recognition .
do you think that unilateral recognition is n't doable , or is n't desirable ?
not desirable .
everything is doable , for , politics is , as you know , the art of the possible .
the six-nation contract group , composed of the us , britain , france , germany , italy and russia , has so far rejected division as one of its basic principles .
can the troika , which was named by the contact group , move away from the principles ?
here , too , politics is the art of the possible .
the principles have been mentioned repeatedly due to the " parallel cases . "
i think you have to very clearly establish that the kosovo question in itself does n't produce any solutions for parallel cases , but rather poses a unique problem .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo 's premier ceku , second left , with the troika members it is after all the only case of a nato intervention .
that has never happened before in such a manner .
to that extent , drawing parallels is exceedingly problematic .
here the question is more on the side of the security council .
there were definitely also serbian views that could imagine a sort of division under certain conditions .
in this respect , the troika surely had a reason for the proposal to resurface again .
many observers have cited republika srpska as a precedent .
you do n't see it that way ?
i do n't see a precedent there at all , since it was a different situation .
in tito 's yugoslavia , bosnia and herzegovina was also a constituent republic .
that had a different , deeply rooted tradition .
on the other hand , i did n't always have the impression that people in belgrade would be so enthusiastic if that problem were also to arise .
a clear geographical division of kosovo is n't even possible .
that 's right , that 's a majority solution .
serbs in other parts of kosovo would stay behind .
one should n't underestimate that then , albanians in the presevo valley would also express wishes when it comes to serbia and demand adjustments to the border .
in any case , it means opening a pandora 's box .

dw-radio : in view of the resistance from kosovo albanians , how realistic is the concept of a division of kosovo ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erhard busek erhard busek : at the moment there are only proposals to which someone has expressed opposition .
if you act on that assumption , then there 's no proposal whatsoever , but that 's not a solution .
any compromise that comes about wo n't receive the agreement of both disputing parties , but there must of course be a solution with which one can live , and that must be the assumption .
of all the bad solutions , that is at least a possible one .
there 's only the possibility of either reaching a virtual rapprochement or to decide in one way or another in conflict , with all the consequences that involves .
many observers have indicated that a compromise is n't at all possible .
what perspective do you see for the current 120-day attempt at dialogue ?
the perspective is rather clear .
if there is some area where the parties at least come close , where the distance diminishes , then there is a possibility .
it will hardly be a solution , where one can speak of great agreements .
the other " solution " is of course that it could cause a unilateral process of recognition .
that , however , brings up its own problems .
that starts already within the european union .
the mandates of the united nations mission in kosovo -lrb- unmik -rrb- and nato 's kosovo force -lrb- kfor -rrb- stem from un resolution 1244 .
these institutions can hardly go beyond their means .
unilateral recognition would in any case occur without the un .
everyone has to be clear on that .
many are of course scared of by that - and with good reason .
there 's also the problem that the eu plays a significant role in the development of institutions in kosovo - but on the basis of what mandate should it then do that ?
that 's where the resulting problems begin .
what would happen to kfor if the un was no longer involved ?
you have to ask those in favor of unilateral recognition .
do you think that unilateral recognition is n't doable , or is n't desirable ?
not desirable .
everything is doable , for , politics is , as you know , the art of the possible .
the six-nation contract group , composed of the us , britain , france , germany , italy and russia , has so far rejected division as one of its basic principles .
can the troika , which was named by the contact group , move away from the principles ?
here , too , politics is the art of the possible .
the principles have been mentioned repeatedly due to the " parallel cases . "
i think you have to very clearly establish that the kosovo question in itself does n't produce any solutions for parallel cases , but rather poses a unique problem .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo 's premier ceku , second left , with the troika members it is after all the only case of a nato intervention .
that has never happened before in such a manner .
to that extent , drawing parallels is exceedingly problematic .
here the question is more on the side of the security council .
there were definitely also serbian views that could imagine a sort of division under certain conditions .
in this respect , the troika surely had a reason for the proposal to resurface again .
many observers have cited republika srpska as a precedent .
you do n't see it that way ?
i do n't see a precedent there at all , since it was a different situation .
in tito 's yugoslavia , bosnia and herzegovina was also a constituent republic .
that had a different , deeply rooted tradition .
on the other hand , i did n't always have the impression that people in belgrade would be so enthusiastic if that problem were also to arise .
a clear geographical division of kosovo is n't even possible .
that 's right , that 's a majority solution .
serbs in other parts of kosovo would stay behind .
one should n't underestimate that then , albanians in the presevo valley would also express wishes when it comes to serbia and demand adjustments to the border .
in any case , it means opening a pandora 's box .

" the idea for the mutatoes came one day when i was shopping , " westphal told dw-world.de.

a proposal by a german government spokesman to include moderate taliban representatives in the afghan peace process has been criticized by a conservative foreign policy expert in parliament . it remained unclear how an explosion wednesday that reportedly claimed the lives of three germans would influence the current dialog debate . according to news reports , deputy government spokesman thomas steg on monday suggested that " moderate , reasonable " taliban representatives should be included in the reconstruction and reconciliation process in afghanistan . the suggestion has been criticized by karl-theodor zu guttenberg , a parliamentarian and foreign policy expert for bavaria 's conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , the sister party of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- .

a proposal by a german government spokesman to include moderate taliban representatives in the afghan peace process has been criticized by a conservative foreign policy expert in parliament . it remained unclear how an explosion wednesday that reportedly claimed the lives of three germans would influence the current dialog debate . according to news reports , deputy government spokesman thomas steg on monday suggested that " moderate , reasonable " taliban representatives should be included in the reconstruction and reconciliation process in afghanistan . the suggestion has been criticized by karl-theodor zu guttenberg , a parliamentarian and foreign policy expert for bavaria 's conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , the sister party of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de children and families -pipe- 15.08.2007 more german fathers opting to take parental leave großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stay-at-home dads can now spend more quality time with their children in germany , recent reports show a new , more remunerative plan to encourage recent fathers to take paid parenting leave is starting to have an effect . since the beginning of the year , germany has seen a leap in the number of fathers who take time off to stay home with their young children .
the reason : a sweeping change in how parents are paid for what germans refer to as the “ babypause , ” or parental leave .
in january , germany changed its parental-leave laws to give new parents 67 percent of their salary for up to 12 months or up to 14 months if at least two months of the “ pause ” is taken by the father .
the percentage has an upper cap of 1,800 euros -lrb- $ 2,425 -rrb- a month .
previously , stay-at-home parents were given a lump sum of up to 300 euros per month , if they were eligible at all .
playing catch-up “ the fact that parental-leave payments are now based on earnings rather than a lump sum is an immense improvement over the earlier plan , ” said eberhard schaefer , a consultant and founder of the papa institute , which advises politicians , businesses and individuals on issues surrounding fathers and fatherhood .
“ germany is finally catching up with other european countries - especially in scandinavia , but others as well , " he said .
as a result of these changes , the german state approved some 200,000 applications for paid parental leave in 2007 , german family minister ursula von der leyen said in berlin on wednesday .
and the number of applications more than doubled from the first to the second quarters , from 60,000 to 140,000 per quarter .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the plan steers mothers back to the workplace “ clearly , this parental-leave policy is a hit , ” said von der leyen , whose mission to ease the road for working parents in germany has made her a controversial figure here since she took office in 2005 .
“ i am especially thrilled with the growing number of fathers who take paid parental leave , ” added von der leyen , herself a career woman with seven children .
financial effect last year , just 3.5 percent of fathers across germany took paid leave after their children were born .
today , that number is up to 8.5 percent .
the states with the highest quotas of applicants for “ papa leave ” include berlin , brandenburg , bavaria and hamburg , all of which were above the average .
at 8.5 births per 1,000 inhabitants , germany has the lowest birth rate in europe .
many observers believe this will only change when attitudes and policies become friendlier toward working parents .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von der leyen - happy with her plan 's results “ over the years i have heard from families and fathers that they couldn ’ t afford to stop working for those few months , " said papa institute 's schaefer .
" now , they are only losing 33 percent of their income , so many fathers and mothers say , ‘ ok , we can afford to do this for ourselves . ”
“ they do it gladly because they don ’ t want to lose the opportunity , ” he adds .
susanne seyda , an analyst in family economics at the institute for business -lrb- iw -rrb- in cologne , said the new regulation may simply have given more men the ability to ask for something they may have wanted all along .
previously , men may have worried about what staying home with their child would do to their career , seyda argues .
“ now they are in a stronger bargaining position when they go to ask for the time off .
the employer knows there is financial incentive , and they find it easier to understand . "
back to the work force , quicker the pro-business think tank stands behind the new plan , seyda said , because they think it could both boost german birth rates , and help get women back into the work force more quickly .
“ the opportunity costs are lower because parents don ’ t lose as much income , ” seyda noted .
“ highly qualified couples are more likely to have more children . ”
beyond that , under the new regulation , the government assistance runs out after 12 months - or 14 if the father takes two months .
then , for the mother , its back to the work force - or the assistance runs out .
under the old plan , assistance continued for three years .
“ that means women ’ s working responsibilities will grow and there will not be such a great loss of human capital , ” seyda said .
but birth rates and economic improvement is not as important as the effect such a change could have on german society , papa institute 's schaefer says .
he points out that studies have shown that fathers who spend time with their infants continue to spend more time with them as they grow up “ which could only be seen as a positive . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more fun than a day at the office ?
furthermore , experience with his own clients show that fathers don ’ t want their role to be solely that of breadwinner , or extra helper for the mother , who does the real job of raising the children .
“ they want to be seen as independent , responsible parents , ” which is often hard to negotiate when the mother has the sole , day-to-day responsibility with the children , he added .
" ca n't call for mommy " clearly , schaefer is on to something : the average length of paid leave taken by fathers so far is 4.3 months , well beyond the two months required to get the extra pay .
dieter fichter , a senior consultant at siemens in frankfurt , is beyond the “ babypause ” years .
his two children are 9 and 14 years old , and when they were infants he often put in long hours at work .
but , he said , colleagues of his now are taking the paid-leave offer , albeit just the minimum two months required to get the extra pay .
it isn ’ t seen as something that would damage their careers , he said .
“ missing two months of work is not too long , its nothing , ” fichter said .
moreover , he said , if such an offer had been available to him to him at the time , he would have taken it .
“ i think it would give you a closer relationship with your child , ” he said .
" you have a better understanding of what it means to be the person who has to take care of a child all day long , and know what its needs are , " fichter said .
" you ’ re not just with the child for a few hours on weekends .

the reason : a sweeping change in how parents are paid for what germans refer to as the “ babypause , ” or parental leave .
in january , germany changed its parental-leave laws to give new parents 67 percent of their salary for up to 12 months or up to 14 months if at least two months of the “ pause ” is taken by the father .
the percentage has an upper cap of 1,800 euros -lrb- $ 2,425 -rrb- a month .
previously , stay-at-home parents were given a lump sum of up to 300 euros per month , if they were eligible at all .
playing catch-up “ the fact that parental-leave payments are now based on earnings rather than a lump sum is an immense improvement over the earlier plan , ” said eberhard schaefer , a consultant and founder of the papa institute , which advises politicians , businesses and individuals on issues surrounding fathers and fatherhood .
“ germany is finally catching up with other european countries - especially in scandinavia , but others as well , " he said .
as a result of these changes , the german state approved some 200,000 applications for paid parental leave in 2007 , german family minister ursula von der leyen said in berlin on wednesday .
and the number of applications more than doubled from the first to the second quarters , from 60,000 to 140,000 per quarter .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the plan steers mothers back to the workplace “ clearly , this parental-leave policy is a hit , ” said von der leyen , whose mission to ease the road for working parents in germany has made her a controversial figure here since she took office in 2005 .
“ i am especially thrilled with the growing number of fathers who take paid parental leave , ” added von der leyen , herself a career woman with seven children .
financial effect last year , just 3.5 percent of fathers across germany took paid leave after their children were born .
today , that number is up to 8.5 percent .
the states with the highest quotas of applicants for “ papa leave ” include berlin , brandenburg , bavaria and hamburg , all of which were above the average .
at 8.5 births per 1,000 inhabitants , germany has the lowest birth rate in europe .
many observers believe this will only change when attitudes and policies become friendlier toward working parents .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von der leyen - happy with her plan 's results “ over the years i have heard from families and fathers that they couldn ’ t afford to stop working for those few months , " said papa institute 's schaefer .
" now , they are only losing 33 percent of their income , so many fathers and mothers say , ‘ ok , we can afford to do this for ourselves . ”
“ they do it gladly because they don ’ t want to lose the opportunity , ” he adds .
susanne seyda , an analyst in family economics at the institute for business -lrb- iw -rrb- in cologne , said the new regulation may simply have given more men the ability to ask for something they may have wanted all along .
previously , men may have worried about what staying home with their child would do to their career , seyda argues .
“ now they are in a stronger bargaining position when they go to ask for the time off .
the employer knows there is financial incentive , and they find it easier to understand . "
back to the work force , quicker the pro-business think tank stands behind the new plan , seyda said , because they think it could both boost german birth rates , and help get women back into the work force more quickly .
“ the opportunity costs are lower because parents don ’ t lose as much income , ” seyda noted .
“ highly qualified couples are more likely to have more children . ”
beyond that , under the new regulation , the government assistance runs out after 12 months - or 14 if the father takes two months .
then , for the mother , its back to the work force - or the assistance runs out .
under the old plan , assistance continued for three years .
“ that means women ’ s working responsibilities will grow and there will not be such a great loss of human capital , ” seyda said .
but birth rates and economic improvement is not as important as the effect such a change could have on german society , papa institute 's schaefer says .
he points out that studies have shown that fathers who spend time with their infants continue to spend more time with them as they grow up “ which could only be seen as a positive . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more fun than a day at the office ?
furthermore , experience with his own clients show that fathers don ’ t want their role to be solely that of breadwinner , or extra helper for the mother , who does the real job of raising the children .
“ they want to be seen as independent , responsible parents , ” which is often hard to negotiate when the mother has the sole , day-to-day responsibility with the children , he added .
" ca n't call for mommy " clearly , schaefer is on to something : the average length of paid leave taken by fathers so far is 4.3 months , well beyond the two months required to get the extra pay .
dieter fichter , a senior consultant at siemens in frankfurt , is beyond the “ babypause ” years .
his two children are 9 and 14 years old , and when they were infants he often put in long hours at work .
but , he said , colleagues of his now are taking the paid-leave offer , albeit just the minimum two months required to get the extra pay .
it isn ’ t seen as something that would damage their careers , he said .
“ missing two months of work is not too long , its nothing , ” fichter said .
moreover , he said , if such an offer had been available to him to him at the time , he would have taken it .
“ i think it would give you a closer relationship with your child , ” he said .
" you have a better understanding of what it means to be the person who has to take care of a child all day long , and know what its needs are , " fichter said .
" you ’ re not just with the child for a few hours on weekends .
and you can ’ t call for help from mommy if the baby is crying . ” jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

there , amidst the usual farmers catering to lifestyle-conscious yuppies , shoppers were shocked to find 27-year-old uli westphal with a display of peppers and potatoes , cucumbers and carrots that looked like they had just landed from outer space . " the idea for the mutatoes came one day when i was shopping , " westphal told dw-world.de.
" a little more than a year ago , i found a five-headed eggplant at a farmers ' market and then , a few stalls further on , some bell peppers that resembled props from a science-fiction film .

" bildunterschrift : mutatoes come in various shapes , sizes and colors the idea behind the 500-plus collection of organic curiosities , which westphal photographs and archives on his web site , is to point out the artificial standardization of the products we buy in mass supermarkets .
the mutations are all natural - not the result of radiation or genetic manipulation . and they 're surprisingly aesthetic , as visitors to the berlin market found out .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de children and families -pipe- 15.08.2007 more german fathers opting to take parental leave großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stay-at-home dads can now spend more quality time with their children in germany , recent reports show a new , more remunerative plan to encourage recent fathers to take paid parenting leave is starting to have an effect . since the beginning of the year , germany has seen a leap in the number of fathers who take time off to stay home with their young children .
the reason : a sweeping change in how parents are paid for what germans refer to as the “ babypause , ” or parental leave .
in january , germany changed its parental-leave laws to give new parents 67 percent of their salary for up to 12 months or up to 14 months if at least two months of the “ pause ” is taken by the father .
the percentage has an upper cap of 1,800 euros -lrb- $ 2,425 -rrb- a month .
previously , stay-at-home parents were given a lump sum of up to 300 euros per month , if they were eligible at all .
playing catch-up “ the fact that parental-leave payments are now based on earnings rather than a lump sum is an immense improvement over the earlier plan , ” said eberhard schaefer , a consultant and founder of the papa institute , which advises politicians , businesses and individuals on issues surrounding fathers and fatherhood .
“ germany is finally catching up with other european countries - especially in scandinavia , but others as well , " he said .
as a result of these changes , the german state approved some 200,000 applications for paid parental leave in 2007 , german family minister ursula von der leyen said in berlin on wednesday .
and the number of applications more than doubled from the first to the second quarters , from 60,000 to 140,000 per quarter .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the plan steers mothers back to the workplace “ clearly , this parental-leave policy is a hit , ” said von der leyen , whose mission to ease the road for working parents in germany has made her a controversial figure here since she took office in 2005 .
“ i am especially thrilled with the growing number of fathers who take paid parental leave , ” added von der leyen , herself a career woman with seven children .
financial effect last year , just 3.5 percent of fathers across germany took paid leave after their children were born .
today , that number is up to 8.5 percent .
the states with the highest quotas of applicants for “ papa leave ” include berlin , brandenburg , bavaria and hamburg , all of which were above the average .
at 8.5 births per 1,000 inhabitants , germany has the lowest birth rate in europe .
many observers believe this will only change when attitudes and policies become friendlier toward working parents .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von der leyen - happy with her plan 's results “ over the years i have heard from families and fathers that they couldn ’ t afford to stop working for those few months , " said papa institute 's schaefer .
" now , they are only losing 33 percent of their income , so many fathers and mothers say , ‘ ok , we can afford to do this for ourselves . ”
“ they do it gladly because they don ’ t want to lose the opportunity , ” he adds .
susanne seyda , an analyst in family economics at the institute for business -lrb- iw -rrb- in cologne , said the new regulation may simply have given more men the ability to ask for something they may have wanted all along .
previously , men may have worried about what staying home with their child would do to their career , seyda argues .
“ now they are in a stronger bargaining position when they go to ask for the time off .
the employer knows there is financial incentive , and they find it easier to understand . "
back to the work force , quicker the pro-business think tank stands behind the new plan , seyda said , because they think it could both boost german birth rates , and help get women back into the work force more quickly .
“ the opportunity costs are lower because parents don ’ t lose as much income , ” seyda noted .
“ highly qualified couples are more likely to have more children . ”
beyond that , under the new regulation , the government assistance runs out after 12 months - or 14 if the father takes two months .
then , for the mother , its back to the work force - or the assistance runs out .
under the old plan , assistance continued for three years .
“ that means women ’ s working responsibilities will grow and there will not be such a great loss of human capital , ” seyda said .
but birth rates and economic improvement is not as important as the effect such a change could have on german society , papa institute 's schaefer says .
he points out that studies have shown that fathers who spend time with their infants continue to spend more time with them as they grow up “ which could only be seen as a positive . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more fun than a day at the office ?
furthermore , experience with his own clients show that fathers don ’ t want their role to be solely that of breadwinner , or extra helper for the mother , who does the real job of raising the children .
“ they want to be seen as independent , responsible parents , ” which is often hard to negotiate when the mother has the sole , day-to-day responsibility with the children , he added .
" ca n't call for mommy " clearly , schaefer is on to something : the average length of paid leave taken by fathers so far is 4.3 months , well beyond the two months required to get the extra pay .
dieter fichter , a senior consultant at siemens in frankfurt , is beyond the “ babypause ” years .
his two children are 9 and 14 years old , and when they were infants he often put in long hours at work .
but , he said , colleagues of his now are taking the paid-leave offer , albeit just the minimum two months required to get the extra pay .
it isn ’ t seen as something that would damage their careers , he said .
“ missing two months of work is not too long , its nothing , ” fichter said .
moreover , he said , if such an offer had been available to him to him at the time , he would have taken it .
“ i think it would give you a closer relationship with your child , ” he said .
" you have a better understanding of what it means to be the person who has to take care of a child all day long , and know what its needs are , " fichter said .
" you ’ re not just with the child for a few hours on weekends .
and you can ’ t call for help from mommy if the baby is crying . ” jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de turkey -pipe- 15.08.2007 opinion : turkey 's unpredictable electorate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's foreign minister is set to become his country 's next president .
his religious-conservative party colleagues will dominate politics for years , but they should n't become complacent , says dw 's baha güngör . there 's no doubt that abdullah gül - backed by an absolute majority of parliamentarians and after three rounds of voting on aug .
28 - will become his country 's 11th president and occupy the highest office .
turkish premier erdogan 's governing religious-conservative party for justice and development -lrb- akp -rrb- has a clear majority in the national assembly with 341 of 550 seats .
since the nationalists have said that they 'll attend the first two rounds of voting on aug .
20 and aug .
24 , the two-thirds quorum mandated by the constitutional court will be present .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baha güngör the akp 's victory in the july 22 parliamentary elections was too obvious : 46 percent of votes is a clear message .
the army 's indirect coup threats and the desperate attempts of secular elites failed to prevent gül - and with him the first first lady with a headscarf in the presidential palace .
gül 's candidacy has sound democratic legitimacy and the akp will lift him into the highest office on aug .
28 - two days before the traditional " day of defense forces . "
last week , erdogan reached out to the secular opposition , during the election of the parliament 's president , by nominating köksal toptan , a compromise candidate , who was elected with an overwhelming 450 votes .
this sparked hope that erdogan would forego gül , the polarizing presidential candidate , or that the latter would simply take himself out of the race .
but gül had no intention of doing so .
why should he ?
the army , the secular elite , the constitutional court and incumbent president ahmet necedet all tried to prevent gül 's presidency by employing tactics that were hardly tolerable from a democratic point of view .
as a result , the electorate punished them severely .
gül will therefore become turkey 's highest-ranking civilian representative until 2014 .
it 's safe to bet that erdogan will do everything to replace him as the first president elected by popular vote .
on oct .
21 , turks will decide in a referendum whether the next president will be chosen by the people rather than by parliament .
if the july 22 election victory will be repeated , there 's no doubt that this change will take place - just as there 's no doubt that in seven years ' time , erdogan will be elected president of a country that has gone through an adjustment to a presidential political system by then .
it 's perfectly superfluous to restart the outdated debate about what the army will have to say about this development .
the generals ' reputation as guardians of secularism and democracy was damaged long before the indirect coup threat on april 27 in reaction to gül 's first candidacy .
since 1960 , four interventions by the military have all thrown back the country while established secular parties , led by incompetent , power-hungry politicians have surpassed each other in terms of democratic amateurism .
it remains to be seen whether erdogan and his akp will be able to handle the success and refrain from shooting themselves in the foot by rejecting a needed democratic culture of compromise and thinking that they 're infallible .
in 1983 , the religious-conservative motherland party won 45 percent of the vote after three years of military rule despite contrary " advice " for voters by the generals .
today , this party has been relegated to the sidelines outside parliament .
it 's hard to gauge turkish voters : just one year before the motherland party 's grandiose election victory , a constitution dictated by the military had been accepted in a referendum with 92 percent of votes .

after only three days of talks , the troika said it could no longer rule out a division of kosovo into albanian and serbian sectors .
on dec .
10 , the troika is due to present a report to the un on the way forward .
erhard busek of austria has been the eu coordinator of the stability pact for south-eastern europe since 2002 .
dw-radio : in view of the resistance from kosovo albanians , how realistic is the concept of a division of kosovo ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erhard busek erhard busek : at the moment there are only proposals to which someone has expressed opposition .
if you act on that assumption , then there 's no proposal whatsoever , but that 's not a solution .
any compromise that comes about wo n't receive the agreement of both disputing parties , but there must of course be a solution with which one can live , and that must be the assumption .
of all the bad solutions , that is at least a possible one .
there 's only the possibility of either reaching a virtual rapprochement or to decide in one way or another in conflict , with all the consequences that involves .
many observers have indicated that a compromise is n't at all possible .
what perspective do you see for the current 120-day attempt at dialogue ?
the perspective is rather clear .
if there is some area where the parties at least come close , where the distance diminishes , then there is a possibility .
it will hardly be a solution , where one can speak of great agreements .
the other " solution " is of course that it could cause a unilateral process of recognition .
that , however , brings up its own problems .
that starts already within the european union .
the mandates of the united nations mission in kosovo -lrb- unmik -rrb- and nato 's kosovo force -lrb- kfor -rrb- stem from un resolution 1244 .
these institutions can hardly go beyond their means .
unilateral recognition would in any case occur without the un .
everyone has to be clear on that .
many are of course scared of by that - and with good reason .
there 's also the problem that the eu plays a significant role in the development of institutions in kosovo - but on the basis of what mandate should it then do that ?
that 's where the resulting problems begin .
what would happen to kfor if the un was no longer involved ?
you have to ask those in favor of unilateral recognition .
do you think that unilateral recognition is n't doable , or is n't desirable ?
not desirable .
everything is doable , for , politics is , as you know , the art of the possible .
the six-nation contract group , composed of the us , britain , france , germany , italy and russia , has so far rejected division as one of its basic principles .
can the troika , which was named by the contact group , move away from the principles ?
here , too , politics is the art of the possible .
the principles have been mentioned repeatedly due to the " parallel cases . "
i think you have to very clearly establish that the kosovo question in itself does n't produce any solutions for parallel cases , but rather poses a unique problem .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo 's premier ceku , second left , with the troika members it is after all the only case of a nato intervention .
that has never happened before in such a manner .
to that extent , drawing parallels is exceedingly problematic .
here the question is more on the side of the security council .
there were definitely also serbian views that could imagine a sort of division under certain conditions .
in this respect , the troika surely had a reason for the proposal to resurface again .
many observers have cited republika srpska as a precedent .
you do n't see it that way ?
i do n't see a precedent there at all , since it was a different situation .
in tito 's yugoslavia , bosnia and herzegovina was also a constituent republic .
that had a different , deeply rooted tradition .
on the other hand , i did n't always have the impression that people in belgrade would be so enthusiastic if that problem were also to arise .
a clear geographical division of kosovo is n't even possible .
that 's right , that 's a majority solution .
serbs in other parts of kosovo would stay behind .
one should n't underestimate that then , albanians in the presevo valley would also express wishes when it comes to serbia and demand adjustments to the border .
in any case , it means opening a pandora 's box .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de turkey -pipe- 15.08.2007 opinion : turkey 's unpredictable electorate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's foreign minister is set to become his country 's next president .
his religious-conservative party colleagues will dominate politics for years , but they should n't become complacent , says dw 's baha güngör . there 's no doubt that abdullah gül - backed by an absolute majority of parliamentarians and after three rounds of voting on aug .
28 - will become his country 's 11th president and occupy the highest office .
turkish premier erdogan 's governing religious-conservative party for justice and development -lrb- akp -rrb- has a clear majority in the national assembly with 341 of 550 seats .
since the nationalists have said that they 'll attend the first two rounds of voting on aug .
20 and aug .
24 , the two-thirds quorum mandated by the constitutional court will be present .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baha güngör the akp 's victory in the july 22 parliamentary elections was too obvious : 46 percent of votes is a clear message .
the army 's indirect coup threats and the desperate attempts of secular elites failed to prevent gül - and with him the first first lady with a headscarf in the presidential palace .
gül 's candidacy has sound democratic legitimacy and the akp will lift him into the highest office on aug .
28 - two days before the traditional " day of defense forces . "
last week , erdogan reached out to the secular opposition , during the election of the parliament 's president , by nominating köksal toptan , a compromise candidate , who was elected with an overwhelming 450 votes .
this sparked hope that erdogan would forego gül , the polarizing presidential candidate , or that the latter would simply take himself out of the race .
but gül had no intention of doing so .
why should he ?
the army , the secular elite , the constitutional court and incumbent president ahmet necedet all tried to prevent gül 's presidency by employing tactics that were hardly tolerable from a democratic point of view .
as a result , the electorate punished them severely .
gül will therefore become turkey 's highest-ranking civilian representative until 2014 .
it 's safe to bet that erdogan will do everything to replace him as the first president elected by popular vote .
on oct .
21 , turks will decide in a referendum whether the next president will be chosen by the people rather than by parliament .
if the july 22 election victory will be repeated , there 's no doubt that this change will take place - just as there 's no doubt that in seven years ' time , erdogan will be elected president of a country that has gone through an adjustment to a presidential political system by then .
it 's perfectly superfluous to restart the outdated debate about what the army will have to say about this development .
the generals ' reputation as guardians of secularism and democracy was damaged long before the indirect coup threat on april 27 in reaction to gül 's first candidacy .
since 1960 , four interventions by the military have all thrown back the country while established secular parties , led by incompetent , power-hungry politicians have surpassed each other in terms of democratic amateurism .
it remains to be seen whether erdogan and his akp will be able to handle the success and refrain from shooting themselves in the foot by rejecting a needed democratic culture of compromise and thinking that they 're infallible .
in 1983 , the religious-conservative motherland party won 45 percent of the vote after three years of military rule despite contrary " advice " for voters by the generals .
today , this party has been relegated to the sidelines outside parliament .
it 's hard to gauge turkish voters : just one year before the motherland party 's grandiose election victory , a constitution dictated by the military had been accepted in a referendum with 92 percent of votes .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de children and families -pipe- 15.08.2007 more german fathers opting to take parental leave großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stay-at-home dads can now spend more quality time with their children in germany , recent reports show a new , more remunerative plan to encourage recent fathers to take paid parenting leave is starting to have an effect . since the beginning of the year , germany has seen a leap in the number of fathers who take time off to stay home with their young children .
the reason : a sweeping change in how parents are paid for what germans refer to as the “ babypause , ” or parental leave .
in january , germany changed its parental-leave laws to give new parents 67 percent of their salary for up to 12 months or up to 14 months if at least two months of the “ pause ” is taken by the father .
the percentage has an upper cap of 1,800 euros -lrb- $ 2,425 -rrb- a month .
previously , stay-at-home parents were given a lump sum of up to 300 euros per month , if they were eligible at all .
playing catch-up “ the fact that parental-leave payments are now based on earnings rather than a lump sum is an immense improvement over the earlier plan , ” said eberhard schaefer , a consultant and founder of the papa institute , which advises politicians , businesses and individuals on issues surrounding fathers and fatherhood .
“ germany is finally catching up with other european countries - especially in scandinavia , but others as well , " he said .
as a result of these changes , the german state approved some 200,000 applications for paid parental leave in 2007 , german family minister ursula von der leyen said in berlin on wednesday .
and the number of applications more than doubled from the first to the second quarters , from 60,000 to 140,000 per quarter .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the plan steers mothers back to the workplace “ clearly , this parental-leave policy is a hit , ” said von der leyen , whose mission to ease the road for working parents in germany has made her a controversial figure here since she took office in 2005 .
“ i am especially thrilled with the growing number of fathers who take paid parental leave , ” added von der leyen , herself a career woman with seven children .
financial effect last year , just 3.5 percent of fathers across germany took paid leave after their children were born .
today , that number is up to 8.5 percent .
the states with the highest quotas of applicants for “ papa leave ” include berlin , brandenburg , bavaria and hamburg , all of which were above the average .
at 8.5 births per 1,000 inhabitants , germany has the lowest birth rate in europe .
many observers believe this will only change when attitudes and policies become friendlier toward working parents .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von der leyen - happy with her plan 's results “ over the years i have heard from families and fathers that they couldn ’ t afford to stop working for those few months , " said papa institute 's schaefer .
" now , they are only losing 33 percent of their income , so many fathers and mothers say , ‘ ok , we can afford to do this for ourselves . ”
“ they do it gladly because they don ’ t want to lose the opportunity , ” he adds .
susanne seyda , an analyst in family economics at the institute for business -lrb- iw -rrb- in cologne , said the new regulation may simply have given more men the ability to ask for something they may have wanted all along .
previously , men may have worried about what staying home with their child would do to their career , seyda argues .
“ now they are in a stronger bargaining position when they go to ask for the time off .
the employer knows there is financial incentive , and they find it easier to understand . "
back to the work force , quicker the pro-business think tank stands behind the new plan , seyda said , because they think it could both boost german birth rates , and help get women back into the work force more quickly .
“ the opportunity costs are lower because parents don ’ t lose as much income , ” seyda noted .
“ highly qualified couples are more likely to have more children . ”
beyond that , under the new regulation , the government assistance runs out after 12 months - or 14 if the father takes two months .
then , for the mother , its back to the work force - or the assistance runs out .
under the old plan , assistance continued for three years .
“ that means women ’ s working responsibilities will grow and there will not be such a great loss of human capital , ” seyda said .
but birth rates and economic improvement is not as important as the effect such a change could have on german society , papa institute 's schaefer says .
he points out that studies have shown that fathers who spend time with their infants continue to spend more time with them as they grow up “ which could only be seen as a positive . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more fun than a day at the office ?
furthermore , experience with his own clients show that fathers don ’ t want their role to be solely that of breadwinner , or extra helper for the mother , who does the real job of raising the children .
“ they want to be seen as independent , responsible parents , ” which is often hard to negotiate when the mother has the sole , day-to-day responsibility with the children , he added .
" ca n't call for mommy " clearly , schaefer is on to something : the average length of paid leave taken by fathers so far is 4.3 months , well beyond the two months required to get the extra pay .
dieter fichter , a senior consultant at siemens in frankfurt , is beyond the “ babypause ” years .
his two children are 9 and 14 years old , and when they were infants he often put in long hours at work .
but , he said , colleagues of his now are taking the paid-leave offer , albeit just the minimum two months required to get the extra pay .
it isn ’ t seen as something that would damage their careers , he said .
“ missing two months of work is not too long , its nothing , ” fichter said .
moreover , he said , if such an offer had been available to him to him at the time , he would have taken it .
“ i think it would give you a closer relationship with your child , ” he said .
" you have a better understanding of what it means to be the person who has to take care of a child all day long , and know what its needs are , " fichter said .

as a result of these changes , the german state approved some 200,000 applications for paid parental leave in 2007 , german family minister ursula von der leyen said in berlin on wednesday .
and the number of applications more than doubled from the first to the second quarters , from 60,000 to 140,000 per quarter .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the plan steers mothers back to the workplace “ clearly , this parental-leave policy is a hit , ” said von der leyen , whose mission to ease the road for working parents in germany has made her a controversial figure here since she took office in 2005 .
“ i am especially thrilled with the growing number of fathers who take paid parental leave , ” added von der leyen , herself a career woman with seven children .
financial effect last year , just 3.5 percent of fathers across germany took paid leave after their children were born .
today , that number is up to 8.5 percent .
the states with the highest quotas of applicants for “ papa leave ” include berlin , brandenburg , bavaria and hamburg , all of which were above the average .
at 8.5 births per 1,000 inhabitants , germany has the lowest birth rate in europe .
many observers believe this will only change when attitudes and policies become friendlier toward working parents .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von der leyen - happy with her plan 's results “ over the years i have heard from families and fathers that they couldn ’ t afford to stop working for those few months , " said papa institute 's schaefer .
" now , they are only losing 33 percent of their income , so many fathers and mothers say , ‘ ok , we can afford to do this for ourselves . ”
“ they do it gladly because they don ’ t want to lose the opportunity , ” he adds .
susanne seyda , an analyst in family economics at the institute for business -lrb- iw -rrb- in cologne , said the new regulation may simply have given more men the ability to ask for something they may have wanted all along .
previously , men may have worried about what staying home with their child would do to their career , seyda argues .
“ now they are in a stronger bargaining position when they go to ask for the time off .
the employer knows there is financial incentive , and they find it easier to understand . "
back to the work force , quicker the pro-business think tank stands behind the new plan , seyda said , because they think it could both boost german birth rates , and help get women back into the work force more quickly .
“ the opportunity costs are lower because parents don ’ t lose as much income , ” seyda noted .
“ highly qualified couples are more likely to have more children . ”
beyond that , under the new regulation , the government assistance runs out after 12 months - or 14 if the father takes two months .
then , for the mother , its back to the work force - or the assistance runs out .
under the old plan , assistance continued for three years .
“ that means women ’ s working responsibilities will grow and there will not be such a great loss of human capital , ” seyda said .
but birth rates and economic improvement is not as important as the effect such a change could have on german society , papa institute 's schaefer says .
he points out that studies have shown that fathers who spend time with their infants continue to spend more time with them as they grow up “ which could only be seen as a positive . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more fun than a day at the office ?
furthermore , experience with his own clients show that fathers don ’ t want their role to be solely that of breadwinner , or extra helper for the mother , who does the real job of raising the children .
“ they want to be seen as independent , responsible parents , ” which is often hard to negotiate when the mother has the sole , day-to-day responsibility with the children , he added .
" ca n't call for mommy " clearly , schaefer is on to something : the average length of paid leave taken by fathers so far is 4.3 months , well beyond the two months required to get the extra pay .
dieter fichter , a senior consultant at siemens in frankfurt , is beyond the “ babypause ” years .
his two children are 9 and 14 years old , and when they were infants he often put in long hours at work .
but , he said , colleagues of his now are taking the paid-leave offer , albeit just the minimum two months required to get the extra pay .
it isn ’ t seen as something that would damage their careers , he said .
“ missing two months of work is not too long , its nothing , ” fichter said .
moreover , he said , if such an offer had been available to him to him at the time , he would have taken it .
“ i think it would give you a closer relationship with your child , ” he said .
" you have a better understanding of what it means to be the person who has to take care of a child all day long , and know what its needs are , " fichter said .
" you ’ re not just with the child for a few hours on weekends .
and you can ’ t call for help from mommy if the baby is crying . ” jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the idea for the mutatoes came one day when i was shopping , " westphal told dw-world.de.

" but i 've been pleased that there have also been serious discussions .
i do n't think humorous perspectives are necessarily negative , as long as people do n't stop thinking . "
indeed , while they may be fun to look at , westphal 's photos offer a subtle criticism of today 's culture of cosmetic surgery , the insistence on trying to make the food we consume - to say nothing of the way we look physically - conform to artificial standards of normality and beauty .
the mutatoes remind viewers that deviating from the norm is healthy .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erhard busek erhard busek : at the moment there are only proposals to which someone has expressed opposition .
if you act on that assumption , then there 's no proposal whatsoever , but that 's not a solution .
any compromise that comes about wo n't receive the agreement of both disputing parties , but there must of course be a solution with which one can live , and that must be the assumption .
of all the bad solutions , that is at least a possible one .
there 's only the possibility of either reaching a virtual rapprochement or to decide in one way or another in conflict , with all the consequences that involves .
many observers have indicated that a compromise is n't at all possible .
what perspective do you see for the current 120-day attempt at dialogue ?
the perspective is rather clear .
if there is some area where the parties at least come close , where the distance diminishes , then there is a possibility .
it will hardly be a solution , where one can speak of great agreements .
the other " solution " is of course that it could cause a unilateral process of recognition .
that , however , brings up its own problems .
that starts already within the european union .
the mandates of the united nations mission in kosovo -lrb- unmik -rrb- and nato 's kosovo force -lrb- kfor -rrb- stem from un resolution 1244 .
these institutions can hardly go beyond their means .
unilateral recognition would in any case occur without the un .
everyone has to be clear on that .
many are of course scared of by that - and with good reason .
there 's also the problem that the eu plays a significant role in the development of institutions in kosovo - but on the basis of what mandate should it then do that ?
that 's where the resulting problems begin .
what would happen to kfor if the un was no longer involved ?
you have to ask those in favor of unilateral recognition .
do you think that unilateral recognition is n't doable , or is n't desirable ?
not desirable .
everything is doable , for , politics is , as you know , the art of the possible .
the six-nation contract group , composed of the us , britain , france , germany , italy and russia , has so far rejected division as one of its basic principles .
can the troika , which was named by the contact group , move away from the principles ?
here , too , politics is the art of the possible .
the principles have been mentioned repeatedly due to the " parallel cases . "
i think you have to very clearly establish that the kosovo question in itself does n't produce any solutions for parallel cases , but rather poses a unique problem .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo 's premier ceku , second left , with the troika members it is after all the only case of a nato intervention .
that has never happened before in such a manner .
to that extent , drawing parallels is exceedingly problematic .
here the question is more on the side of the security council .
there were definitely also serbian views that could imagine a sort of division under certain conditions .
in this respect , the troika surely had a reason for the proposal to resurface again .
many observers have cited republika srpska as a precedent .
you do n't see it that way ?
i do n't see a precedent there at all , since it was a different situation .
in tito 's yugoslavia , bosnia and herzegovina was also a constituent republic .
that had a different , deeply rooted tradition .
on the other hand , i did n't always have the impression that people in belgrade would be so enthusiastic if that problem were also to arise .
a clear geographical division of kosovo is n't even possible .
that 's right , that 's a majority solution .
serbs in other parts of kosovo would stay behind .
one should n't underestimate that then , albanians in the presevo valley would also express wishes when it comes to serbia and demand adjustments to the border .
in any case , it means opening a pandora 's box .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de turkey -pipe- 15.08.2007 opinion : turkey 's unpredictable electorate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's foreign minister is set to become his country 's next president .
his religious-conservative party colleagues will dominate politics for years , but they should n't become complacent , says dw 's baha güngör . there 's no doubt that abdullah gül - backed by an absolute majority of parliamentarians and after three rounds of voting on aug .
28 - will become his country 's 11th president and occupy the highest office .
turkish premier erdogan 's governing religious-conservative party for justice and development -lrb- akp -rrb- has a clear majority in the national assembly with 341 of 550 seats .
since the nationalists have said that they 'll attend the first two rounds of voting on aug .
20 and aug .
24 , the two-thirds quorum mandated by the constitutional court will be present .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baha güngör the akp 's victory in the july 22 parliamentary elections was too obvious : 46 percent of votes is a clear message .
the army 's indirect coup threats and the desperate attempts of secular elites failed to prevent gül - and with him the first first lady with a headscarf in the presidential palace .
gül 's candidacy has sound democratic legitimacy and the akp will lift him into the highest office on aug .
28 - two days before the traditional " day of defense forces . "
last week , erdogan reached out to the secular opposition , during the election of the parliament 's president , by nominating köksal toptan , a compromise candidate , who was elected with an overwhelming 450 votes .
this sparked hope that erdogan would forego gül , the polarizing presidential candidate , or that the latter would simply take himself out of the race .
but gül had no intention of doing so .
why should he ?
the army , the secular elite , the constitutional court and incumbent president ahmet necedet all tried to prevent gül 's presidency by employing tactics that were hardly tolerable from a democratic point of view .
as a result , the electorate punished them severely .
gül will therefore become turkey 's highest-ranking civilian representative until 2014 .
it 's safe to bet that erdogan will do everything to replace him as the first president elected by popular vote .
on oct .
21 , turks will decide in a referendum whether the next president will be chosen by the people rather than by parliament .
if the july 22 election victory will be repeated , there 's no doubt that this change will take place - just as there 's no doubt that in seven years ' time , erdogan will be elected president of a country that has gone through an adjustment to a presidential political system by then .
it 's perfectly superfluous to restart the outdated debate about what the army will have to say about this development .
the generals ' reputation as guardians of secularism and democracy was damaged long before the indirect coup threat on april 27 in reaction to gül 's first candidacy .
since 1960 , four interventions by the military have all thrown back the country while established secular parties , led by incompetent , power-hungry politicians have surpassed each other in terms of democratic amateurism .
it remains to be seen whether erdogan and his akp will be able to handle the success and refrain from shooting themselves in the foot by rejecting a needed democratic culture of compromise and thinking that they 're infallible .
in 1983 , the religious-conservative motherland party won 45 percent of the vote after three years of military rule despite contrary " advice " for voters by the generals .
today , this party has been relegated to the sidelines outside parliament .
it 's hard to gauge turkish voters : just one year before the motherland party 's grandiose election victory , a constitution dictated by the military had been accepted in a referendum with 92 percent of votes .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de children and families -pipe- 15.08.2007 more german fathers opting to take parental leave großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stay-at-home dads can now spend more quality time with their children in germany , recent reports show a new , more remunerative plan to encourage recent fathers to take paid parenting leave is starting to have an effect . since the beginning of the year , germany has seen a leap in the number of fathers who take time off to stay home with their young children .
the reason : a sweeping change in how parents are paid for what germans refer to as the “ babypause , ” or parental leave .
in january , germany changed its parental-leave laws to give new parents 67 percent of their salary for up to 12 months or up to 14 months if at least two months of the “ pause ” is taken by the father .
the percentage has an upper cap of 1,800 euros -lrb- $ 2,425 -rrb- a month .
previously , stay-at-home parents were given a lump sum of up to 300 euros per month , if they were eligible at all .
playing catch-up “ the fact that parental-leave payments are now based on earnings rather than a lump sum is an immense improvement over the earlier plan , ” said eberhard schaefer , a consultant and founder of the papa institute , which advises politicians , businesses and individuals on issues surrounding fathers and fatherhood .
“ germany is finally catching up with other european countries - especially in scandinavia , but others as well , " he said .
as a result of these changes , the german state approved some 200,000 applications for paid parental leave in 2007 , german family minister ursula von der leyen said in berlin on wednesday .
and the number of applications more than doubled from the first to the second quarters , from 60,000 to 140,000 per quarter .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the plan steers mothers back to the workplace “ clearly , this parental-leave policy is a hit , ” said von der leyen , whose mission to ease the road for working parents in germany has made her a controversial figure here since she took office in 2005 .
“ i am especially thrilled with the growing number of fathers who take paid parental leave , ” added von der leyen , herself a career woman with seven children .
financial effect last year , just 3.5 percent of fathers across germany took paid leave after their children were born .
today , that number is up to 8.5 percent .
the states with the highest quotas of applicants for “ papa leave ” include berlin , brandenburg , bavaria and hamburg , all of which were above the average .
at 8.5 births per 1,000 inhabitants , germany has the lowest birth rate in europe .
many observers believe this will only change when attitudes and policies become friendlier toward working parents .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von der leyen - happy with her plan 's results “ over the years i have heard from families and fathers that they couldn ’ t afford to stop working for those few months , " said papa institute 's schaefer .
" now , they are only losing 33 percent of their income , so many fathers and mothers say , ‘ ok , we can afford to do this for ourselves . ”
“ they do it gladly because they don ’ t want to lose the opportunity , ” he adds .
susanne seyda , an analyst in family economics at the institute for business -lrb- iw -rrb- in cologne , said the new regulation may simply have given more men the ability to ask for something they may have wanted all along .
previously , men may have worried about what staying home with their child would do to their career , seyda argues .
“ now they are in a stronger bargaining position when they go to ask for the time off .
the employer knows there is financial incentive , and they find it easier to understand . "
back to the work force , quicker the pro-business think tank stands behind the new plan , seyda said , because they think it could both boost german birth rates , and help get women back into the work force more quickly .
“ the opportunity costs are lower because parents don ’ t lose as much income , ” seyda noted .
“ highly qualified couples are more likely to have more children . ”
beyond that , under the new regulation , the government assistance runs out after 12 months - or 14 if the father takes two months .
then , for the mother , its back to the work force - or the assistance runs out .
under the old plan , assistance continued for three years .
“ that means women ’ s working responsibilities will grow and there will not be such a great loss of human capital , ” seyda said .
but birth rates and economic improvement is not as important as the effect such a change could have on german society , papa institute 's schaefer says .
he points out that studies have shown that fathers who spend time with their infants continue to spend more time with them as they grow up “ which could only be seen as a positive . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more fun than a day at the office ?
furthermore , experience with his own clients show that fathers don ’ t want their role to be solely that of breadwinner , or extra helper for the mother , who does the real job of raising the children .
“ they want to be seen as independent , responsible parents , ” which is often hard to negotiate when the mother has the sole , day-to-day responsibility with the children , he added .
" ca n't call for mommy " clearly , schaefer is on to something : the average length of paid leave taken by fathers so far is 4.3 months , well beyond the two months required to get the extra pay .
dieter fichter , a senior consultant at siemens in frankfurt , is beyond the “ babypause ” years .
his two children are 9 and 14 years old , and when they were infants he often put in long hours at work .
but , he said , colleagues of his now are taking the paid-leave offer , albeit just the minimum two months required to get the extra pay .
it isn ’ t seen as something that would damage their careers , he said .
“ missing two months of work is not too long , its nothing , ” fichter said .
moreover , he said , if such an offer had been available to him to him at the time , he would have taken it .
“ i think it would give you a closer relationship with your child , ” he said .
" you have a better understanding of what it means to be the person who has to take care of a child all day long , and know what its needs are , " fichter said .
" you ’ re not just with the child for a few hours on weekends .
and you can ’ t call for help from mommy if the baby is crying . ” jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we are now trying to prevent a similar tragedy -lrb- in calabria -rrb- , " amato told a news conference . italy 's deputy director of police , luigi de sena , and anti-mafia prosecutor pietro grasso meanwhile said such killings in another country were unprecedented . " the calabria mafia has a significant presence in germany , but until now they have always tried to keep a low profile , " de sena told italian news service ansa . grasso said the six men had probably been sent to duisburg in a bid to escape the consequences of the vendetta . in germany , local police spokesman hermann-josef helmich said the men were aged between 16 and 39 . police were quizzing family members of the victims and an autopsy was being conducted to determine the exact cause of death .
execution-style murders bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medics look on as one of the victims is brought to a hearse the execution-style killings took place in front of an italian restaurant .
police said the shots appeared to have been fired through the windscreens of the vehicles .
one car had duisburg license planes and the other was registered in the town of pforzheim . police spokesman reinhard pape said cctv footage from a nearby public building was being studied , and police were looking into reports that two men had been seen in the area at the time of the shooting . police said they were alerted at around 2:30 a.m. by a woman who had heard gunshots . the victims were found in the neudorf part of the city on a main thoroughfare some 100 meters -lrb- 100 yards -rrb- from the central station .
police immediately cordoned off the entire area .
similar killings in february the killings drew comparisons with the murder of seven asians in an armed robbery at a chinese restaurant in the northern german town of sittensen in february . five staff members from malaysia , thailand , vietnam and hong kong were tied up and shot dead along with popular local restaurant owner danny wing hong fan , 36 , and his 28-year-old wife , both british citizens .
only their baby survived . the case comes to trial in the nearby town of stade next week .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de children and families -pipe- 15.08.2007 more german fathers opting to take parental leave großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stay-at-home dads can now spend more quality time with their children in germany , recent reports show a new , more remunerative plan to encourage recent fathers to take paid parenting leave is starting to have an effect . since the beginning of the year , germany has seen a leap in the number of fathers who take time off to stay home with their young children .
the reason : a sweeping change in how parents are paid for what germans refer to as the “ babypause , ” or parental leave .
in january , germany changed its parental-leave laws to give new parents 67 percent of their salary for up to 12 months or up to 14 months if at least two months of the “ pause ” is taken by the father .
the percentage has an upper cap of 1,800 euros -lrb- $ 2,425 -rrb- a month .
previously , stay-at-home parents were given a lump sum of up to 300 euros per month , if they were eligible at all .
playing catch-up “ the fact that parental-leave payments are now based on earnings rather than a lump sum is an immense improvement over the earlier plan , ” said eberhard schaefer , a consultant and founder of the papa institute , which advises politicians , businesses and individuals on issues surrounding fathers and fatherhood .
“ germany is finally catching up with other european countries - especially in scandinavia , but others as well , " he said .
as a result of these changes , the german state approved some 200,000 applications for paid parental leave in 2007 , german family minister ursula von der leyen said in berlin on wednesday .
and the number of applications more than doubled from the first to the second quarters , from 60,000 to 140,000 per quarter .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the plan steers mothers back to the workplace “ clearly , this parental-leave policy is a hit , ” said von der leyen , whose mission to ease the road for working parents in germany has made her a controversial figure here since she took office in 2005 .
“ i am especially thrilled with the growing number of fathers who take paid parental leave , ” added von der leyen , herself a career woman with seven children .
financial effect last year , just 3.5 percent of fathers across germany took paid leave after their children were born .
today , that number is up to 8.5 percent .
the states with the highest quotas of applicants for “ papa leave ” include berlin , brandenburg , bavaria and hamburg , all of which were above the average .
at 8.5 births per 1,000 inhabitants , germany has the lowest birth rate in europe .
many observers believe this will only change when attitudes and policies become friendlier toward working parents .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von der leyen - happy with her plan 's results “ over the years i have heard from families and fathers that they couldn ’ t afford to stop working for those few months , " said papa institute 's schaefer .
" now , they are only losing 33 percent of their income , so many fathers and mothers say , ‘ ok , we can afford to do this for ourselves . ”
“ they do it gladly because they don ’ t want to lose the opportunity , ” he adds .
susanne seyda , an analyst in family economics at the institute for business -lrb- iw -rrb- in cologne , said the new regulation may simply have given more men the ability to ask for something they may have wanted all along .
previously , men may have worried about what staying home with their child would do to their career , seyda argues .
“ now they are in a stronger bargaining position when they go to ask for the time off .
the employer knows there is financial incentive , and they find it easier to understand . "
back to the work force , quicker the pro-business think tank stands behind the new plan , seyda said , because they think it could both boost german birth rates , and help get women back into the work force more quickly .
“ the opportunity costs are lower because parents don ’ t lose as much income , ” seyda noted .
“ highly qualified couples are more likely to have more children . ”
beyond that , under the new regulation , the government assistance runs out after 12 months - or 14 if the father takes two months .
then , for the mother , its back to the work force - or the assistance runs out .
under the old plan , assistance continued for three years .
“ that means women ’ s working responsibilities will grow and there will not be such a great loss of human capital , ” seyda said .
but birth rates and economic improvement is not as important as the effect such a change could have on german society , papa institute 's schaefer says .
he points out that studies have shown that fathers who spend time with their infants continue to spend more time with them as they grow up “ which could only be seen as a positive . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more fun than a day at the office ?
furthermore , experience with his own clients show that fathers don ’ t want their role to be solely that of breadwinner , or extra helper for the mother , who does the real job of raising the children .
“ they want to be seen as independent , responsible parents , ” which is often hard to negotiate when the mother has the sole , day-to-day responsibility with the children , he added .
" ca n't call for mommy " clearly , schaefer is on to something : the average length of paid leave taken by fathers so far is 4.3 months , well beyond the two months required to get the extra pay .
dieter fichter , a senior consultant at siemens in frankfurt , is beyond the “ babypause ” years .
his two children are 9 and 14 years old , and when they were infants he often put in long hours at work .
but , he said , colleagues of his now are taking the paid-leave offer , albeit just the minimum two months required to get the extra pay .
it isn ’ t seen as something that would damage their careers , he said .
“ missing two months of work is not too long , its nothing , ” fichter said .
moreover , he said , if such an offer had been available to him to him at the time , he would have taken it .
“ i think it would give you a closer relationship with your child , ” he said .
" you have a better understanding of what it means to be the person who has to take care of a child all day long , and know what its needs are , " fichter said .
" you ’ re not just with the child for a few hours on weekends .
and you can ’ t call for help from mommy if the baby is crying . ” jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

shotts prison is " unrecognisable " from the institution where less than two decades ago clashes between staff and inmates were common , a report has said .
scotland 's chief inspector of prisons highlighted safety improvements as a key factor in the improved stability at the prison .
the absence of overcrowding was also said to have been a critical factor .
an inspection published in 1994 quoted a scottish prison service prisoner survey in which 40 % of prisoners said they feared for their safety .
this year the figure was 14 % .
chief prisons inspector dr andrew mclellan 's report , based on an inspection in february this year , praised the efforts by prison staff to cut violence in the institution .
it is difficult to exaggerate the benefit when a prison holds the number of prisoners for which it was built .
dr andrew mclellan chief inspector of prisons his report said : " less than 20 years ago an hmcip report stated that ' incidents of mass indiscipline and confrontation with staff became the norm ' .
" that prison is unrecognisable today . "
he added that the " safe atmosphere " throughout shotts was " remarkable in a prison that was once notorious for violence " .
the absence of cell-sharing at the prison was highlighted in the report .
" it is difficult to exaggerate the benefit when a prison holds the number of prisoners for which it was built , " dr mclellan said .
however , the report contained concerns over the " poor practice " in suicide risk management .
an average of 26 prisoners a year have been subject to the scottish prison service anti-suicide procedures , but there has not been a meeting of the suicide risk management group since february 2006 .

so far , the majority of mobile phone owners have shown themselves resistant to the idea of turning their devices into miniature tvs to watch sporting action .
rather , they have preferred to access websites from their phones to catch up on the latest information , or signed-up for score alerts by text .
a hoped-for-breakthrough at the 2006 fifa world cup did not take place .
but this season , bskyb , which owns the mobile premiership rights , is providing action from top-flight matches for the next three years , and most importantly , at an " all-you-can eat " price of £ 5 a month .
post-game highlights are being made available along with goals and key moments from some matches , depending on what time they are being played .
the mobile networks are trying to take customers away from competitors by offering football highlights as part of their mobile tv offering rachael church-sanders , editor sport and technology and eager to claw back some of the cash they splashed out to secure 3g licences , the major mobile networks have got on board with sky and are hoping that this is the season football on mobiles makes a significant breakthrough .
vodafone , orange , t-mobile , 3 , and o2 are all offering some form of content from sky sports ' mobile tv offering - be it full access to sky sports , the 24-7 football video clips and highlights deal , or goals on a clip-by-clip basis .
and in another new move , football league highlights will be available on virgin mobiles .
' new media markets ' rachael church-sanders , editor of sport and technology e-newsletter , observes : " sky will be looking to get back the money it has forked out to secure the mobile rights .
" meanwhile , the mobile networks are trying to take customers away from competitors by offering football highlights as part of their mobile tv offering , while at the same time reducing their own churn rate .
networks are looking to make sport on mobile tv more accessible " at the same time they are also hoping to justify their spending on 3g networks , and are looking for a return on the money they have spent . "
reflecting the importance of mobile rights , the premiership has just concluded deals for countries such as china , thailand , india , pakistan , bangladesh , sri lanka , and , saudi arabia , as well as more traditional markets .
premier league chief executive richard scudamore says : " new media markets are an increasingly important part of our international broadcast strategy and landscape . "
however , alongside these packages of goals and highlights , perhaps the most intriguing offering this summer comes from orange , in the form of frank tv .
this is nothing less than an entire mobile channel dedicated to giving us " fly-on-the-wall " experiences from england and chelsea player frank lampard .
frank tv makes for great bite-size viewing and provides our mobile tv viewers unique insight to the life behind the footballer jake redford , orange the channel is being made available to the 1.3 million orange 3g customers on its mobile phone tv service , orange tv .
it will be broadcast alongside other orange mobile tv channels , including the bbc , channel 4 , sky and fhm .
it includes lampard 's own video diaries filmed in the last two seasons at stamford bridge , chelsea 's training ground and frank 's house .
sprouts and puppies orange was an official partner of chelsea , providing content and behind-the-scenes news , but the deal has ended .
however , lampard has a separate deal with orange , which includes personal appearances and the frank tv video diaries .
orange claims he is the first footballer to launch his own dedicated mobile television channel .
orange says frank tv is the first footballer 's mobile tv channel jake redford , head of mobile , orange uk , said : " frank tv makes for great bite-size viewing and provides our mobile tv viewers unique insight to the life behind the footballer . "
footage shown at the launch mixed football-related material with " frank at home " material , swinging from the player meeting brazilian star ronaldinho to a clip of him explaining how to peel sprouts .
material featuring the lampard puppies is perhaps for the diehard fan only .
but for those more interested in what goes on at chelsea , there is footage from behind the scenes at stamford bridge , much of it featuring masseur billy blood .
" i 've enjoyed it a lot more than i thought i would , " says lampard .
" i 'm pleased with the end product and that people can see the real you . "
exclusive content however , whether the temptation of watching frank tv would be enough to convince football fans to sign up for sport on mobile tv is another matter .
as rachael church-sanders says : " i think people want to have some sort of access to sport on the move - what the score is , who has scored - and so on .
" what frank lampard did previously for orange was successful and liked by fans .
" and there will always be users who will want to see content that is not available elsewhere .
if the channel is to be successful , then they will be hoping to attract a number of new customers . "
but she warns : " at the end of the day , many people are still just using their mobiles for texting and phoning . "
but for now , the mobile networks will be hoping that the lure of premiership action - and for orange , footage of frank lampard wrapping his christmas presents - will be enticing enough to make a growing number of football fans sign up for sport on mobile tv .
if so , this season could be the one that really sees the formation of the " dream team " of sport and mobile networks .

reflecting the importance of mobile rights , the premiership has just concluded deals for countries such as china , thailand , india , pakistan , bangladesh , sri lanka , and , saudi arabia , as well as more traditional markets .
premier league chief executive richard scudamore says : " new media markets are an increasingly important part of our international broadcast strategy and landscape . "
however , alongside these packages of goals and highlights , perhaps the most intriguing offering this summer comes from orange , in the form of frank tv .
this is nothing less than an entire mobile channel dedicated to giving us " fly-on-the-wall " experiences from england and chelsea player frank lampard .
frank tv makes for great bite-size viewing and provides our mobile tv viewers unique insight to the life behind the footballer jake redford , orange the channel is being made available to the 1.3 million orange 3g customers on its mobile phone tv service , orange tv .
it will be broadcast alongside other orange mobile tv channels , including the bbc , channel 4 , sky and fhm .
it includes lampard 's own video diaries filmed in the last two seasons at stamford bridge , chelsea 's training ground and frank 's house .
sprouts and puppies orange was an official partner of chelsea , providing content and behind-the-scenes news , but the deal has ended .
however , lampard has a separate deal with orange , which includes personal appearances and the frank tv video diaries .
orange claims he is the first footballer to launch his own dedicated mobile television channel .
orange says frank tv is the first footballer 's mobile tv channel jake redford , head of mobile , orange uk , said : " frank tv makes for great bite-size viewing and provides our mobile tv viewers unique insight to the life behind the footballer . "
footage shown at the launch mixed football-related material with " frank at home " material , swinging from the player meeting brazilian star ronaldinho to a clip of him explaining how to peel sprouts .
material featuring the lampard puppies is perhaps for the diehard fan only .
but for those more interested in what goes on at chelsea , there is footage from behind the scenes at stamford bridge , much of it featuring masseur billy blood .
" i 've enjoyed it a lot more than i thought i would , " says lampard .
" i 'm pleased with the end product and that people can see the real you . "
exclusive content however , whether the temptation of watching frank tv would be enough to convince football fans to sign up for sport on mobile tv is another matter .
as rachael church-sanders says : " i think people want to have some sort of access to sport on the move - what the score is , who has scored - and so on .
" what frank lampard did previously for orange was successful and liked by fans .
" and there will always be users who will want to see content that is not available elsewhere .
if the channel is to be successful , then they will be hoping to attract a number of new customers . "
but she warns : " at the end of the day , many people are still just using their mobiles for texting and phoning . "
but for now , the mobile networks will be hoping that the lure of premiership action - and for orange , footage of frank lampard wrapping his christmas presents - will be enticing enough to make a growing number of football fans sign up for sport on mobile tv .
if so , this season could be the one that really sees the formation of the " dream team " of sport and mobile networks .

mr abe attended a commemoration ceremony in the capital , tokyo , but did not visit the yasukuni shrine .
his predecessor , junichiro koizumi , made several visits , sparking strong criticism from regional neighbours .
the shrine honours japan 's war dead , including 14 people convicted as class a war criminals after world war ii .
mr abe is known to have visited the shrine before he took office in september last year , but since then he has stayed away .
he told journalists he would not discuss plans for a visit " as long as the issue remains a diplomatic problem " .
fifteen members of his 16-strong cabinet also stayed away .
healing rifts mr abe , a known conservative , wants to reform japan 's pacifist constitution and has advocated a more prominent role for japan on the world stage .
but he has also worked to heal ties with china and south korea .
these ties were harmed under mr koizumi 's leadership , mainly because of his repeated yasukuni visits .
a group of 46 mps did visit the shrine this year , but the number was noticeably smaller than the 62 who visited last year .
mr koizumi , who handed power to mr abe last september , also paid an early morning visit .

gordon brown has pledged three million homes will be built by 2020 , mainly on previously developed brownfield sites .
but a social market foundation study claims two million homes would have to be built on undeveloped countryside or green belt around cities and towns .
the government reiterated that it plans " robust protection " of the green belt .
realistic density mr brown has put housing at the top of his agenda since he became prime minister and announced plans to increase the rate of new development .
he told mps last month : " putting affordable housing within the reach not just of the few but the many is vital both to meeting individual aspirations and to securing a better future for the country . "
but mr brown also pledged the government would " continue to protect robustly the land designated as green belt " . "
we have to face the fact that if we want our kids and our friends ' kids to have somewhere to live ... those homes are going to have to go somewhere " ann rossiter smf director some 60 % of the proposed new homes would be built on brownfield sites under government plans .
but the smf study suggests even if the new homes were built on a density equivalent to london only 2.1 million would be on brownfield land and this would mean some parks and gardens being paved over .
the report found that on a more realistic housing density , " almost two million homes would need to be built on non-previously developed land " .
the smf concluded : " it will not be possible , even if those living in towns and cities accept the loss of their gardens and parks , to meet the uk 's housing needs through previously-developed land alone . "
' scrubland ' it also suggested that the target of three million homes was " likely to be the minimum needed " as supply was failing to meet demand in a " fundamentally unbalanced " uk housing market .
the smf also added that the green belt , which was planned to prevent urban sprawl , contains ex-industrial sites and scrubland and " was not as green as people believe " . "
simply letting the market rip in areas where it would like to go ... wo n't necessarily put development in the places that will do the most good for everybody " richard bate green balance the think tank suggests there may be a case for reconsidering the future of the green belt which often protects " neither wildlife nor areas of outstanding beauty " .
the smf 's director ann rossiter said the uk faced " tough choices " in meeting its housing need and had to tackle the " not in my backyard " mentality .
she told bbc radio five live : " we have to face the fact that if we want our kids and our friends ' kids to have somewhere to live that 's of a decent standard , those homes are going to have to go somewhere .
" and maybe they have to go in the field next to our house , and maybe they have to go near the view that we 've always loved - but that 's the reality of the situation . "
market forces but richard bate , from planning consultancy green balance , said the green belt served a number of crucial purposes .
these included serving as a distinction between town and country , preventing parts of towns and cities becoming derelict and stopping nearby towns and cities merging into each other .
" simply letting the market rip in areas where it would like to go - very often in green belt areas - wo n't necessarily put development in the places that will do the most good for everybody in town and country alike , " he told radio 4 's today programme .
housing and planning minister baroness andrews said the government believed it was possible to build the homes needed by future generations while protecting the environment and green spaces .
" our clear priority for development will remain brownfield land - already 74 % of new housing is being built on brownfield land , up from 57 % in 1997 , " she said .

gupta and prasad were not alone in their disappointment .
' very excited ' hundreds of people who had tried to reach the venue of the celebrations were turned away by gun-toting soldiers and policemen .
some went to the sheeshganj gurudwara , a neighbourhood sikh shrine , some just walked around in the nearby lanes and bylanes .
meanwhile , a colourful ceremony was held on the grounds of the 17-century fort , witnessed by a small group of invited guests , comprising government officials , a few thousand schoolchildren , thousands of security officials and the media .
nine-year-old vipashayana tanwar is among the lucky few invited to watch the celebrations .
the british took away our gold and minerals and everything else vipashayana tanwar her cheeks painted in the colours of the indian flag , she says she is " very excited " that she will be able to see and hear the prime minister .
a student of fourth standard , she is yet to learn about the independence movement , but she does have some ideas of her own .
" i know we are celebrating 60 years of our independence .
we are free from the british now .
the british came here and told the indians - you can not manage your country , " she says .
" then , they took away all our gold and minerals and everything else , " she adds .
as huge speakers blare patriotic songs , the guard of honour gets ready to greet the prime minister , while some 3,500 school children - dressed in orange , white , and green colours of the indian flag - wait patiently for the vip guest to arrive .
' maximum peace ' this is the first time anam parveen , 13 , is witnessing the independence day celebrations and an early start has not dulled her enthusiasm .
" -lsb- india 's first prime minister jawaharlal -rsb- nehru and -lsb- mahatma -rsb- gandhi fought for our independence .
so independence means a lot to me , " she says .
" i want to be a teacher when i grow up .
now i can be whatever i want to .
if we were n't free , then i do n't think i would have been able to become a teacher .
i would have had to do whatever the british rulers would have told me to do , " she adds .
as the prime minister 's convoy arrives , a cheer goes up through the schoolchildren 's enclosure .
hundreds of orange , white and green caps are hurled in the air .
mr singh gave a speech from the historic red fort the prime minister inspects the guard of honour , unfurls the flag , showering rose petals on the dais .
disturbed by the sound of the celebratory canon fire , thousands of pigeons take to the skies .
in his 40-minute-long speech , the prime minister lists the achievements of his government , announces new schemes for the uplift of the poor and the neglected , and promises inclusive growth for all .
the children , prompted by their teachers , clap at regular intervals .
some 900 boy cadets proudly show off gifts from the authorities - raincoats and watches .
once the prime minister 's convoy leaves the red fort , the security relaxes , and those who had been turned away come running to the fort , hoping to catch a glimpse of the departing guests .
some express their annoyance and disappointment at not being allowed to watch the show , others are more understanding .
" because of the threat of terrorism , the security forces did not allow us to go in , " says ram sumer singh , a railway ticket checker .
but , he is not complaining .
" we have the maximum peace in the world .
that is why foreigners come here with a two-month visa , but then they stay on for two years .
that is what india has become in the last 60 years .
and i 'm proud of india , " he says .

the apologetic gesture came as a replica norse warrior ship arrived in dublin after a voyage across the north sea .
danish culture minister brian mikkelson said his country was proud of the ship , havhingsten -lrb- the sea stallion -rrb- .
" but we are not proud of the damages to the people of ireland that followed in the footsteps of the vikings , " he said .
" but the warmth and friendliness with which you greet us today and the viking ship show us that , luckily , it has all been forgiven . "
" it was fairly emotional all right , it was very hard to keep the tears back " diarmuid murphy county cork the replica long boat - the largest in the world - is a reconstruction of the skuldelev 2 built in dublin in 1042 and believed to have sunk in the roskilde fjord 30 years later .
archaeologists traced the wood used in the original to trees felled in glendalough in county wicklow , south of dublin .
the crew of 65 sailed the replica vessel as part of an archaeological experiment .
' go on display ' diarmuid murphy from bantry in county cork - one of only two irish sailors on board - said he almost gave up at the outset .
" about 18 hours into it , i was just so cold and wet and i said there 's no way i 'll do this , " he said .
despite a diet of dried food and sleeping in the cold , cramped and wet conditions of an open boat he was glad to see the port of the irish capital .
" it was fairly emotional all right , it was very hard to keep the tears back , " he said .
researchers will analyse the data that was gathered during the voyage from an onboard computer and film .
the vessel will go on display this month at dublin 's national museum until next year when a crew , captained by carsten hvid , will make the return voyage home .
a project to reconstruct her was launched in denmark in 2004 with her majesty queen margrethe christening her " havhingsten fra glendalough " -lrb- the sea stallion from glendalough -rrb- in recognition of the original 's irish beginnings .

"
social networking sites such as facebook and myspace have become part of the daily routine for millions of internet users .
the popularity of these networks , however , has resulted in an unfortunate by-product - the mushrooming number of requests that come from dozens of these sites .
while not quite spam , the steady stream of requests for facebook friends , linkedin connections , dopplr travellers , or plaxo contact updates , highlights the lack of interoperability between social network sites and significantly undermines their usefulness .
the interoperability issue is likely to become more prominent in the months ahead as hundreds of specialty social networking sites , covering virtually every area of interest from dogs to cooking , jostle for new users .
in fact , services such as ning now enable anyone to create their own social network site .
the result is that internet users are repeatedly required to re-enter their personal information for each new network they join and find that each network is effectively a " walled garden " , where the benefits of the network are artificially limited by the inability to link a friend in facebook with one in myspace .
these limitations are particularly striking when viewed from a global perspective .
while facebook is a leader in the uk -lrb- as well as in canada , south africa , and norway -rrb- , nearly a dozen other sites hold leadership positions in other countries .
these include myspace -lrb- united states , australia , mexico , and italy -rrb- , bebo -lrb- ireland and new zealand -rrb- , cyworld -lrb- south korea -rrb- , friendster -lrb- indonesia , philippines , and singapore -rrb- , fotolog -lrb- argentina , chile , and uruguay -rrb- , hi5 -lrb- colombia , ecuador , and thailand -rrb- , mixi -lrb- japan -rrb- , orkut -lrb- brazil , india , and paraguay -rrb- , skyblog -lrb- france , belgium , senegal -rrb- , studiverzeichnis -lrb- germany , austria -rrb- and vkontakte -lrb- russia -rrb- .
the result is that social networking sites are far more " local " that is often appreciated . "
the better approach - for users and the sites themselves - would be to work toward a world of interoperable social networking " firms withdraw bnp facebook ads social sites reveal class divide unlike the global internet , which enables virtually the entire world to connect , social networks have created very large , localised communities with far more limited international interaction .
the obvious solution is to facilitate greater interoperability between social networking sites , thereby enabling users to better control their personal information and reduce the need for duplication , while simultaneously enhancing the value of all social networks by removing the current barriers .
this suggestion is not new - experts began commenting on the desirability of open social networks years ago - yet there are reasons to believe that the opportunity for greater interoperability may have finally arrived .
first , the focus on the benefits of interoperability cut across a wide range of technological issues including recent calls for interoperable wireless networks and the music industry 's recognition of the need to offer downloads that operate with all music players .
moreover , the frustrations associated with the initial lack of instant messaging interoperability serves as an important reminder of how the issue resonates with consumers .
second , there are signs that the social networking industry recognises the value of openness .
facebook moved toward an open platform for software developers this spring , enabling third party developers to bring thousands of new facebook applications to market .
similarly , plaxo recently launched a service called pulse , a social networking aggregator that works with many popular sites .
third , there is mounting interest in developing open standards for social networks that would facilitate greater interoperability .
for example , the liberty alliance and project higgins are two privacy-focused identity management initiatives that claim to provide users with the ability to manage their personal information across social networks in a secure and trusted manner .
the irony of the current generation of online social networks is that although their premise is leveraging the internet to connect people , their own lack of interconnectedness is stifling their potential .
some services may believe that it is in their economic interest to stick to a walled garden approach ; however , given the global divisions within the social networking world , the mix of language , user preferences , and network effects , it is unlikely that one or two services will capture the global marketplace .
the better approach - for users and the sites themselves - would be to work towards a world of interoperable social networking . "

the obvious solution is to facilitate greater interoperability between social networking sites , thereby enabling users to better control their personal information and reduce the need for duplication , while simultaneously enhancing the value of all social networks by removing the current barriers .
this suggestion is not new - experts began commenting on the desirability of open social networks years ago - yet there are reasons to believe that the opportunity for greater interoperability may have finally arrived .
first , the focus on the benefits of interoperability cut across a wide range of technological issues including recent calls for interoperable wireless networks and the music industry 's recognition of the need to offer downloads that operate with all music players .
moreover , the frustrations associated with the initial lack of instant messaging interoperability serves as an important reminder of how the issue resonates with consumers .
second , there are signs that the social networking industry recognises the value of openness .
facebook moved toward an open platform for software developers this spring , enabling third party developers to bring thousands of new facebook applications to market .
similarly , plaxo recently launched a service called pulse , a social networking aggregator that works with many popular sites .
different social networks need different log ins and passwords third , there is mounting interest in developing open standards for social networks that would facilitate greater interoperability .
for example , the liberty alliance and project higgins are two privacy-focused identity management initiatives that claim to provide users with the ability to manage their personal information across social networks in a secure and trusted manner .
the irony of the current generation of online social networks is that although their premise is leveraging the internet to connect people , their own lack of interconnectedness is stifling their potential .
some services may believe that it is in their economic interest to stick to a walled garden approach ; however , given the global divisions within the social networking world , the mix of language , user preferences , and network effects , it is unlikely that one or two services will capture the global marketplace .
the better approach - for users and the sites themselves - would be to work towards a world of interoperable social networking .

mindful that the public may consider fleeing overseas for their summer and weekend breaks , the government has announced a £ 1m cash boost to support rural tourism in england , half of which will fund a marketing campaign for the english regions and rural businesses such as attractions , bed-and-breakfasts and caravan parks .
elliott frisby , of visitbritain , says that day trips in particular have suffered this year .
" when the weather 's bad , people are more likely to stay at home and do diy or watch television .
but there are things to do in this country , whatever the weather . "
he does , however , admit to hoping for an indian summer .
" if we have beautiful weather in september , then those trips not taken in the first three-quarters of the year could be made up by the end of the year . "
the alton towers theme park in staffordshire is among the attractions to have seen visitors numbers fall as the rain came down .
queues are shorter when the weather is bad " numbers were definitely down in june and july , but not as bad as they could have been because we had a lot of pre-booked tickets , " says spokeswoman liz greenwood .
but some visitors are happy when it rains .
" the ride enthusiasts tend to come when the weather 's bad , because they know it wo n't be busy and they 'll have the rides to themselves . "
robin barker , the deputy chief executive of south west tourism , believes that the amount spent by tourists will show a dip in his region .

you ca n't get good accommodation in england unless you spend £ 150 a night disgruntled holidaymaker jenny titmuss jenny titmuss , 64 , from harlow in essex , has just returned from cornwall with her family , and says she is " disappointed " by the lack of service and general provision for tourists .

we went to a restaurant and it closed its doors at 8pm , and brought us the bill at 9pm .

chris gabbott runs the coppice , a nine-bedroom bed-and-breakfast in the lake district that was severely affected by 2001 's foot-and-mouth epidemic .
his turnover has taken another - smaller - knock this year as a result of the heavy rain .
another factor that has hit the lake district is a change in the uk airports used by american tourists .
" a couple of years ago , they would hire a car at the airport and tour england , stopping off in the lakes .
now they drive down from edinburgh , through the lake district , and stay overnight in places such as stratford - so the hotels in this area lose out , " says mr gabbott , who is president of the lakes hospitality association .

although it is in the south of the county , well clear of the areas worst hit by july 's floods , many visitors expected the park to be under water .
others have stayed away because of the rain , and some assume the park will be closed as a result of the recent foot-and-mouth outbreak .
" our animals were slaughtered in 2001 , but we have not been affected this year .
we had a letter from defra saying we should carry on as normal .
" but one person did ring up asking if we had foot-and-mouth . "
