it 's a move environmental groups say is pointless unless the bloc also gives its backing to effective control mechanisms . the european commission last week banned bluefish tuna fishing in the eastern atlantic and the mediterranean for the rest of the year because of over-fishing and dwindling stocks .
the decision was taken after information emerged that member states had exhausted the 2007 fishing quota of 16,779.5 tons set by the eu .
the ban concerns cyprus , malta , greece , portugal and spain .
the other two member states involved , italy and france , closed their own fisheries in july and august , respectively .
" clearly there are problems both of over-fishing a stock already threatened with collapse and of equity between the member states concerned , " european commissioner for fisheries and maritime affairs joe borg said .
" as its duty , the commission will do all it can to address these issues urgently . "
popularity of tuna cause of decline the decision comes less than a year after a report by wwf , a global conservation organization , found that bluefin tuna stocks in mediterranean fishing waters decreased by 85 percent in the last decade .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over-fishing has put tuna stocks at peril environmental groups warn that tuna could face eventual extinction if fishing continues at current rates , boosted by a worldwide trend for japanese food such as sushi .
depending on its size , the fish commands a price of several thousand dollars on the world market .
" that naturally makes it enormously attractive to countries not to stick to their fishing quotas , " karoline schacht of the wwf told dw-world.de. with stocks steadily declining , the international commission for the conservation of atlantic tunas -lrb- iccat -rrb- last year recommended cutting fishing quotas in half .
" instead the quota has remained nearly as high as last year - the fishing lobby has once again triumphed , " said stefanie werner of greenpeace , adding that mediterranean countries , in particular , have exceeded their fishing quotas .
greenpeace is now demanding suspending fishing until the iccat formulates a " responsible " management plan .
eel and cod threatened too it 's not just tuna that 's threatened .
stocks of eel and cod are also in precarious shape , according to the eu commission .
the eu said a rise in illegal fishing is the main reason for the dwindling stocks .
according to the wwf , around 50 percent of all cod fishing in the baltic sea is illegal .
that amounts to around 22,000 tons each year , according to germany 's federal ministry for agriculture .
the ministry estimated that in the past years over 100,000 tons of cod have been illegally fished each year in the barents sea .
the eu commission has already taken action against poland and banned it from fishing cod after it emerged that polish fishermen caught 18,000 tons of cod in the first half of the year , but only registered 6,000 tons .
better checks needed to enable depleted fish stocks to recover , the eu plans to cut fishing quotas for cod in the baltic sea by a third .
the plan has n't found favor among german fishermen who say the eu needs to introduce more effective controls and inspections to counter illegal fishing rather than cut quotas for legal catches .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say eu member states are not doing enough to rein in illegal fishing " if illegal fishing was reduced by half , there would be no problems with cod stocks , " said lothar fischer , board member of the german coastal fishing association .
the proposed cuts make it apparent that the " eu does n't trust its own control mechanisms , " fischer said .
environmental experts say that part of the problem is the division of checks and balances between the eu and the member states on fishing .
eu member states carry out their own inspections of fishing stocks by checking fish hauls at harbors or reviewing fishing fleets while at sea .
the eu , on the other hand , checks if member states fulfill their responsibilities .
while some say that many member states do n't do a thorough job of inspections , others lay the blame at the eu 's door .
" the penalties for illegal fishing differ from state to state , " said wwf 's schacht , adding that fines in germany are about 400 percent higher than in latvia .

" this is , of course , true for immediate neighbors such as china , " solana said . china is myanmar 's largest trading partner and has long had diplomatic ties to the regime .
beijing is also eyeing the country 's untapped gas fields and strategic location . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solana says china must use its sway over myanmar 's rulers to end bloodshed the eu 's top diplomat urged the myanmar generals " to immediately cease all violence against the peaceful demonstrations of the burmese population . "
solana also stressed that all political prisoners have to be freed in myanmar , while indirectly threatening with sanctions .
" we are pressing for a national reconciliation process .
we are also looking at appropriate measures , in case the military continues to use violence .
we are reviewing all options . " solana 's comments come as un special envoy ibrahim gambari is in the new burmese capital , naypyidaw , for talks with the country 's military rulers .
it remains unclear which members of the government , gambari will be allowed to speak to . china issues call for peace caving in to international pressure , china over the weekend made its strongest call yet for the military dictatorship or junta to find a peaceful solution to the protests as several hundred people took to the streets of rangoon , braving violence and tear gas by security forces . after telephone talks with british prime minister gordon brown , chinese premier wen jiabao said beijing hoped peace would return to myanmar quickly . " china hopes all parties concerned show restraint , resume stability through peaceful means as soon as possible , promote domestic reconciliation and achieve democracy and development . " eu warns of tighter sanctions on friday , sept 28 , the european union summoned myanmar 's senior diplomat in brussels to warn him of tougher sanctions against the military government unless it ends a bloody clampdown on protestors which has killed several people so far .

it 's a move environmental groups say is pointless unless the bloc also gives its backing to effective control mechanisms . the european commission last week banned bluefish tuna fishing in the eastern atlantic and the mediterranean for the rest of the year because of over-fishing and dwindling stocks .
the decision was taken after information emerged that member states had exhausted the 2007 fishing quota of 16,779.5 tons set by the eu .
the ban concerns cyprus , malta , greece , portugal and spain .
the other two member states involved , italy and france , closed their own fisheries in july and august , respectively .
" clearly there are problems both of over-fishing a stock already threatened with collapse and of equity between the member states concerned , " european commissioner for fisheries and maritime affairs joe borg said .
" as its duty , the commission will do all it can to address these issues urgently . "
popularity of tuna cause of decline the decision comes less than a year after a report by wwf , a global conservation organization , found that bluefin tuna stocks in mediterranean fishing waters decreased by 85 percent in the last decade .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over-fishing has put tuna stocks at peril environmental groups warn that tuna could face eventual extinction if fishing continues at current rates , boosted by a worldwide trend for japanese food such as sushi .
depending on its size , the fish commands a price of several thousand dollars on the world market .
" that naturally makes it enormously attractive to countries not to stick to their fishing quotas , " karoline schacht of the wwf told dw-world.de. with stocks steadily declining , the international commission for the conservation of atlantic tunas -lrb- iccat -rrb- last year recommended cutting fishing quotas in half .
" instead the quota has remained nearly as high as last year - the fishing lobby has once again triumphed , " said stefanie werner of greenpeace , adding that mediterranean countries , in particular , have exceeded their fishing quotas .
greenpeace is now demanding suspending fishing until the iccat formulates a " responsible " management plan .
eel and cod threatened too it 's not just tuna that 's threatened .
stocks of eel and cod are also in precarious shape , according to the eu commission .
the eu said a rise in illegal fishing is the main reason for the dwindling stocks .
according to the wwf , around 50 percent of all cod fishing in the baltic sea is illegal .
that amounts to around 22,000 tons each year , according to germany 's federal ministry for agriculture .
the ministry estimated that in the past years over 100,000 tons of cod have been illegally fished each year in the barents sea .
the eu commission has already taken action against poland and banned it from fishing cod after it emerged that polish fishermen caught 18,000 tons of cod in the first half of the year , but only registered 6,000 tons .
better checks needed to enable depleted fish stocks to recover , the eu plans to cut fishing quotas for cod in the baltic sea by a third .
the plan has n't found favor among german fishermen who say the eu needs to introduce more effective controls and inspections to counter illegal fishing rather than cut quotas for legal catches .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say eu member states are not doing enough to rein in illegal fishing " if illegal fishing was reduced by half , there would be no problems with cod stocks , " said lothar fischer , board member of the german coastal fishing association .
the proposed cuts make it apparent that the " eu does n't trust its own control mechanisms , " fischer said .
environmental experts say that part of the problem is the division of checks and balances between the eu and the member states on fishing .
eu member states carry out their own inspections of fishing stocks by checking fish hauls at harbors or reviewing fishing fleets while at sea .
the eu , on the other hand , checks if member states fulfill their responsibilities .
while some say that many member states do n't do a thorough job of inspections , others lay the blame at the eu 's door .
" the penalties for illegal fishing differ from state to state , " said wwf 's schacht , adding that fines in germany are about 400 percent higher than in latvia .

it 's a move environmental groups say is pointless unless the bloc also gives its backing to effective control mechanisms . the european commission last week banned bluefish tuna fishing in the eastern atlantic and the mediterranean for the rest of the year because of over-fishing and dwindling stocks .
the decision was taken after information emerged that member states had exhausted the 2007 fishing quota of 16,779.5 tons set by the eu .
the ban concerns cyprus , malta , greece , portugal and spain .
the other two member states involved , italy and france , closed their own fisheries in july and august , respectively .
" clearly there are problems both of over-fishing a stock already threatened with collapse and of equity between the member states concerned , " european commissioner for fisheries and maritime affairs joe borg said .
" as its duty , the commission will do all it can to address these issues urgently . "
popularity of tuna cause of decline the decision comes less than a year after a report by wwf , a global conservation organization , found that bluefin tuna stocks in mediterranean fishing waters decreased by 85 percent in the last decade .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over-fishing has put tuna stocks at peril environmental groups warn that tuna could face eventual extinction if fishing continues at current rates , boosted by a worldwide trend for japanese food such as sushi .
depending on its size , the fish commands a price of several thousand dollars on the world market .
" that naturally makes it enormously attractive to countries not to stick to their fishing quotas , " karoline schacht of the wwf told dw-world.de. with stocks steadily declining , the international commission for the conservation of atlantic tunas -lrb- iccat -rrb- last year recommended cutting fishing quotas in half .
" instead the quota has remained nearly as high as last year - the fishing lobby has once again triumphed , " said stefanie werner of greenpeace , adding that mediterranean countries , in particular , have exceeded their fishing quotas .
greenpeace is now demanding suspending fishing until the iccat formulates a " responsible " management plan .
eel and cod threatened too it 's not just tuna that 's threatened .
stocks of eel and cod are also in precarious shape , according to the eu commission .
the eu said a rise in illegal fishing is the main reason for the dwindling stocks .
according to the wwf , around 50 percent of all cod fishing in the baltic sea is illegal .
that amounts to around 22,000 tons each year , according to germany 's federal ministry for agriculture .
the ministry estimated that in the past years over 100,000 tons of cod have been illegally fished each year in the barents sea .
the eu commission has already taken action against poland and banned it from fishing cod after it emerged that polish fishermen caught 18,000 tons of cod in the first half of the year , but only registered 6,000 tons .
better checks needed to enable depleted fish stocks to recover , the eu plans to cut fishing quotas for cod in the baltic sea by a third .
the plan has n't found favor among german fishermen who say the eu needs to introduce more effective controls and inspections to counter illegal fishing rather than cut quotas for legal catches .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say eu member states are not doing enough to rein in illegal fishing " if illegal fishing was reduced by half , there would be no problems with cod stocks , " said lothar fischer , board member of the german coastal fishing association .
the proposed cuts make it apparent that the " eu does n't trust its own control mechanisms , " fischer said .
environmental experts say that part of the problem is the division of checks and balances between the eu and the member states on fishing .
eu member states carry out their own inspections of fishing stocks by checking fish hauls at harbors or reviewing fishing fleets while at sea .
the eu , on the other hand , checks if member states fulfill their responsibilities .
while some say that many member states do n't do a thorough job of inspections , others lay the blame at the eu 's door .
" the penalties for illegal fishing differ from state to state , " said wwf 's schacht , adding that fines in germany are about 400 percent higher than in latvia .

it 's a move environmental groups say is pointless unless the bloc also gives its backing to effective control mechanisms . the european commission last week banned bluefish tuna fishing in the eastern atlantic and the mediterranean for the rest of the year because of over-fishing and dwindling stocks .
the decision was taken after information emerged that member states had exhausted the 2007 fishing quota of 16,779.5 tons set by the eu .
the ban concerns cyprus , malta , greece , portugal and spain .
the other two member states involved , italy and france , closed their own fisheries in july and august , respectively .
" clearly there are problems both of over-fishing a stock already threatened with collapse and of equity between the member states concerned , " european commissioner for fisheries and maritime affairs joe borg said .
" as its duty , the commission will do all it can to address these issues urgently . "
popularity of tuna cause of decline the decision comes less than a year after a report by wwf , a global conservation organization , found that bluefin tuna stocks in mediterranean fishing waters decreased by 85 percent in the last decade .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over-fishing has put tuna stocks at peril environmental groups warn that tuna could face eventual extinction if fishing continues at current rates , boosted by a worldwide trend for japanese food such as sushi .
depending on its size , the fish commands a price of several thousand dollars on the world market .
" that naturally makes it enormously attractive to countries not to stick to their fishing quotas , " karoline schacht of the wwf told dw-world.de. with stocks steadily declining , the international commission for the conservation of atlantic tunas -lrb- iccat -rrb- last year recommended cutting fishing quotas in half .
" instead the quota has remained nearly as high as last year - the fishing lobby has once again triumphed , " said stefanie werner of greenpeace , adding that mediterranean countries , in particular , have exceeded their fishing quotas .
greenpeace is now demanding suspending fishing until the iccat formulates a " responsible " management plan .
eel and cod threatened too it 's not just tuna that 's threatened .
stocks of eel and cod are also in precarious shape , according to the eu commission .
the eu said a rise in illegal fishing is the main reason for the dwindling stocks .
according to the wwf , around 50 percent of all cod fishing in the baltic sea is illegal .
that amounts to around 22,000 tons each year , according to germany 's federal ministry for agriculture .
the ministry estimated that in the past years over 100,000 tons of cod have been illegally fished each year in the barents sea .
the eu commission has already taken action against poland and banned it from fishing cod after it emerged that polish fishermen caught 18,000 tons of cod in the first half of the year , but only registered 6,000 tons .
better checks needed to enable depleted fish stocks to recover , the eu plans to cut fishing quotas for cod in the baltic sea by a third .
the plan has n't found favor among german fishermen who say the eu needs to introduce more effective controls and inspections to counter illegal fishing rather than cut quotas for legal catches .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say eu member states are not doing enough to rein in illegal fishing " if illegal fishing was reduced by half , there would be no problems with cod stocks , " said lothar fischer , board member of the german coastal fishing association .
the proposed cuts make it apparent that the " eu does n't trust its own control mechanisms , " fischer said .
environmental experts say that part of the problem is the division of checks and balances between the eu and the member states on fishing .
eu member states carry out their own inspections of fishing stocks by checking fish hauls at harbors or reviewing fishing fleets while at sea .
the eu , on the other hand , checks if member states fulfill their responsibilities .
while some say that many member states do n't do a thorough job of inspections , others lay the blame at the eu 's door .
" the penalties for illegal fishing differ from state to state , " said wwf 's schacht , adding that fines in germany are about 400 percent higher than in latvia .

eel and cod threatened too it 's not just tuna that 's threatened .
stocks of eel and cod are also in precarious shape , according to the eu commission .
the eu said a rise in illegal fishing is the main reason for the dwindling stocks .
according to the wwf , around 50 percent of all cod fishing in the baltic sea is illegal .
that amounts to around 22,000 tons each year , according to germany 's federal ministry for agriculture .
the ministry estimated that in the past years over 100,000 tons of cod have been illegally fished each year in the barents sea .
the eu commission has already taken action against poland and banned it from fishing cod after it emerged that polish fishermen caught 18,000 tons of cod in the first half of the year , but only registered 6,000 tons .
better checks needed to enable depleted fish stocks to recover , the eu plans to cut fishing quotas for cod in the baltic sea by a third .
the plan has n't found favor among german fishermen who say the eu needs to introduce more effective controls and inspections to counter illegal fishing rather than cut quotas for legal catches .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say eu member states are not doing enough to rein in illegal fishing " if illegal fishing was reduced by half , there would be no problems with cod stocks , " said lothar fischer , board member of the german coastal fishing association .
the proposed cuts make it apparent that the " eu does n't trust its own control mechanisms , " fischer said .
environmental experts say that part of the problem is the division of checks and balances between the eu and the member states on fishing .
eu member states carry out their own inspections of fishing stocks by checking fish hauls at harbors or reviewing fishing fleets while at sea .
the eu , on the other hand , checks if member states fulfill their responsibilities .
while some say that many member states do n't do a thorough job of inspections , others lay the blame at the eu 's door .
" the penalties for illegal fishing differ from state to state , " said wwf 's schacht , adding that fines in germany are about 400 percent higher than in latvia .

it 's a move environmental groups say is pointless unless the bloc also gives its backing to effective control mechanisms . the european commission last week banned bluefish tuna fishing in the eastern atlantic and the mediterranean for the rest of the year because of over-fishing and dwindling stocks .
the decision was taken after information emerged that member states had exhausted the 2007 fishing quota of 16,779.5 tons set by the eu .
the ban concerns cyprus , malta , greece , portugal and spain .
the other two member states involved , italy and france , closed their own fisheries in july and august , respectively .
" clearly there are problems both of over-fishing a stock already threatened with collapse and of equity between the member states concerned , " european commissioner for fisheries and maritime affairs joe borg said .
" as its duty , the commission will do all it can to address these issues urgently . "
popularity of tuna cause of decline the decision comes less than a year after a report by wwf , a global conservation organization , found that bluefin tuna stocks in mediterranean fishing waters decreased by 85 percent in the last decade .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over-fishing has put tuna stocks at peril environmental groups warn that tuna could face eventual extinction if fishing continues at current rates , boosted by a worldwide trend for japanese food such as sushi .
depending on its size , the fish commands a price of several thousand dollars on the world market .
" that naturally makes it enormously attractive to countries not to stick to their fishing quotas , " karoline schacht of the wwf told dw-world.de. with stocks steadily declining , the international commission for the conservation of atlantic tunas -lrb- iccat -rrb- last year recommended cutting fishing quotas in half .
" instead the quota has remained nearly as high as last year - the fishing lobby has once again triumphed , " said stefanie werner of greenpeace , adding that mediterranean countries , in particular , have exceeded their fishing quotas .
greenpeace is now demanding suspending fishing until the iccat formulates a " responsible " management plan .
eel and cod threatened too it 's not just tuna that 's threatened .
stocks of eel and cod are also in precarious shape , according to the eu commission .
the eu said a rise in illegal fishing is the main reason for the dwindling stocks .
according to the wwf , around 50 percent of all cod fishing in the baltic sea is illegal .
that amounts to around 22,000 tons each year , according to germany 's federal ministry for agriculture .
the ministry estimated that in the past years over 100,000 tons of cod have been illegally fished each year in the barents sea .
the eu commission has already taken action against poland and banned it from fishing cod after it emerged that polish fishermen caught 18,000 tons of cod in the first half of the year , but only registered 6,000 tons .

it 's a move environmental groups say is pointless unless the bloc also gives its backing to effective control mechanisms . the european commission last week banned bluefish tuna fishing in the eastern atlantic and the mediterranean for the rest of the year because of over-fishing and dwindling stocks .
the decision was taken after information emerged that member states had exhausted the 2007 fishing quota of 16,779.5 tons set by the eu .
the ban concerns cyprus , malta , greece , portugal and spain .
the other two member states involved , italy and france , closed their own fisheries in july and august , respectively .
" clearly there are problems both of over-fishing a stock already threatened with collapse and of equity between the member states concerned , " european commissioner for fisheries and maritime affairs joe borg said .
" as its duty , the commission will do all it can to address these issues urgently . "
popularity of tuna cause of decline the decision comes less than a year after a report by wwf , a global conservation organization , found that bluefin tuna stocks in mediterranean fishing waters decreased by 85 percent in the last decade .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over-fishing has put tuna stocks at peril environmental groups warn that tuna could face eventual extinction if fishing continues at current rates , boosted by a worldwide trend for japanese food such as sushi .
depending on its size , the fish commands a price of several thousand dollars on the world market .
" that naturally makes it enormously attractive to countries not to stick to their fishing quotas , " karoline schacht of the wwf told dw-world.de. with stocks steadily declining , the international commission for the conservation of atlantic tunas -lrb- iccat -rrb- last year recommended cutting fishing quotas in half .
" instead the quota has remained nearly as high as last year - the fishing lobby has once again triumphed , " said stefanie werner of greenpeace , adding that mediterranean countries , in particular , have exceeded their fishing quotas .
greenpeace is now demanding suspending fishing until the iccat formulates a " responsible " management plan .
eel and cod threatened too it 's not just tuna that 's threatened .
stocks of eel and cod are also in precarious shape , according to the eu commission .
the eu said a rise in illegal fishing is the main reason for the dwindling stocks .
according to the wwf , around 50 percent of all cod fishing in the baltic sea is illegal .
that amounts to around 22,000 tons each year , according to germany 's federal ministry for agriculture .
the ministry estimated that in the past years over 100,000 tons of cod have been illegally fished each year in the barents sea .
the eu commission has already taken action against poland and banned it from fishing cod after it emerged that polish fishermen caught 18,000 tons of cod in the first half of the year , but only registered 6,000 tons .
better checks needed to enable depleted fish stocks to recover , the eu plans to cut fishing quotas for cod in the baltic sea by a third .
the plan has n't found favor among german fishermen who say the eu needs to introduce more effective controls and inspections to counter illegal fishing rather than cut quotas for legal catches .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say eu member states are not doing enough to rein in illegal fishing " if illegal fishing was reduced by half , there would be no problems with cod stocks , " said lothar fischer , board member of the german coastal fishing association .
the proposed cuts make it apparent that the " eu does n't trust its own control mechanisms , " fischer said .
environmental experts say that part of the problem is the division of checks and balances between the eu and the member states on fishing .
eu member states carry out their own inspections of fishing stocks by checking fish hauls at harbors or reviewing fishing fleets while at sea .
the eu , on the other hand , checks if member states fulfill their responsibilities .
while some say that many member states do n't do a thorough job of inspections , others lay the blame at the eu 's door .
" the penalties for illegal fishing differ from state to state , " said wwf 's schacht , adding that fines in germany are about 400 percent higher than in latvia .

dw-world.de european union nets deal to save baltic cod and other fish european union fisheries ministers at a luxembourg meeting agreed to cut the cod fishing quotas in the baltic by nine percent where stocks are most depleted and also agreed on measures to protect tuna and eel .

the decision was taken after information emerged that member states had exhausted the 2007 fishing quota of 16,779.5 tons set by the eu .
the ban concerns cyprus , malta , greece , portugal and spain .
the other two member states involved , italy and france , closed their own fisheries in july and august , respectively .

" as its duty , the commission will do all it can to address these issues urgently . "
popularity of tuna cause of decline the decision comes less than a year after a report by wwf , a global conservation organization , found that bluefin tuna stocks in mediterranean fishing waters decreased by 85 percent in the last decade .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over-fishing has put tuna stocks at peril environmental groups warn that tuna could face eventual extinction if fishing continues at current rates , boosted by a worldwide trend for japanese food such as sushi .
depending on its size , the fish commands a price of several thousand dollars on the world market .
" that naturally makes it enormously attractive to countries not to stick to their fishing quotas , " karoline schacht of the wwf told dw-world.de. with stocks steadily declining , the international commission for the conservation of atlantic tunas -lrb- iccat -rrb- last year recommended cutting fishing quotas in half .
" instead the quota has remained nearly as high as last year - the fishing lobby has once again triumphed , " said stefanie werner of greenpeace , adding that mediterranean countries , in particular , have exceeded their fishing quotas .
greenpeace is now demanding suspending fishing until the iccat formulates a " responsible " management plan .
eel and cod threatened too it 's not just tuna that 's threatened .
stocks of eel and cod are also in precarious shape , according to the eu commission .
the eu said a rise in illegal fishing is the main reason for the dwindling stocks .
according to the wwf , around 50 percent of all cod fishing in the baltic sea is illegal .
that amounts to around 22,000 tons each year , according to germany 's federal ministry for agriculture .
the ministry estimated that in the past years over 100,000 tons of cod have been illegally fished each year in the barents sea .
the eu commission has already taken action against poland and banned it from fishing cod after it emerged that polish fishermen caught 18,000 tons of cod in the first half of the year , but only registered 6,000 tons .
better checks needed to enable depleted fish stocks to recover , the eu plans to cut fishing quotas for cod in the baltic sea by a third .
the plan has n't found favor among german fishermen who say the eu needs to introduce more effective controls and inspections to counter illegal fishing rather than cut quotas for legal catches .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say eu member states are not doing enough to rein in illegal fishing " if illegal fishing was reduced by half , there would be no problems with cod stocks , " said lothar fischer , board member of the german coastal fishing association .
the proposed cuts make it apparent that the " eu does n't trust its own control mechanisms , " fischer said .
environmental experts say that part of the problem is the division of checks and balances between the eu and the member states on fishing .
eu member states carry out their own inspections of fishing stocks by checking fish hauls at harbors or reviewing fishing fleets while at sea .
the eu , on the other hand , checks if member states fulfill their responsibilities .
while some say that many member states do n't do a thorough job of inspections , others lay the blame at the eu 's door .
" the penalties for illegal fishing differ from state to state , " said wwf 's schacht , adding that fines in germany are about 400 percent higher than in latvia .

eel and cod threatened too it 's not just tuna that 's threatened .
stocks of eel and cod are also in precarious shape , according to the eu commission .
the eu said a rise in illegal fishing is the main reason for the dwindling stocks .
according to the wwf , around 50 percent of all cod fishing in the baltic sea is illegal .
that amounts to around 22,000 tons each year , according to germany 's federal ministry for agriculture .
the ministry estimated that in the past years over 100,000 tons of cod have been illegally fished each year in the barents sea .
the eu commission has already taken action against poland and banned it from fishing cod after it emerged that polish fishermen caught 18,000 tons of cod in the first half of the year , but only registered 6,000 tons .
better checks needed to enable depleted fish stocks to recover , the eu plans to cut fishing quotas for cod in the baltic sea by a third .
the plan has n't found favor among german fishermen who say the eu needs to introduce more effective controls and inspections to counter illegal fishing rather than cut quotas for legal catches .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say eu member states are not doing enough to rein in illegal fishing " if illegal fishing was reduced by half , there would be no problems with cod stocks , " said lothar fischer , board member of the german coastal fishing association .
the proposed cuts make it apparent that the " eu does n't trust its own control mechanisms , " fischer said .
environmental experts say that part of the problem is the division of checks and balances between the eu and the member states on fishing .
eu member states carry out their own inspections of fishing stocks by checking fish hauls at harbors or reviewing fishing fleets while at sea .
the eu , on the other hand , checks if member states fulfill their responsibilities .
while some say that many member states do n't do a thorough job of inspections , others lay the blame at the eu 's door .

it 's a move environmental groups say is pointless unless the bloc also gives its backing to effective control mechanisms . the european commission last week banned bluefish tuna fishing in the eastern atlantic and the mediterranean for the rest of the year because of over-fishing and dwindling stocks .
the decision was taken after information emerged that member states had exhausted the 2007 fishing quota of 16,779.5 tons set by the eu .
the ban concerns cyprus , malta , greece , portugal and spain .
the other two member states involved , italy and france , closed their own fisheries in july and august , respectively .
" clearly there are problems both of over-fishing a stock already threatened with collapse and of equity between the member states concerned , " european commissioner for fisheries and maritime affairs joe borg said .
" as its duty , the commission will do all it can to address these issues urgently . "
popularity of tuna cause of decline the decision comes less than a year after a report by wwf , a global conservation organization , found that bluefin tuna stocks in mediterranean fishing waters decreased by 85 percent in the last decade .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over-fishing has put tuna stocks at peril environmental groups warn that tuna could face eventual extinction if fishing continues at current rates , boosted by a worldwide trend for japanese food such as sushi .
depending on its size , the fish commands a price of several thousand dollars on the world market .
" that naturally makes it enormously attractive to countries not to stick to their fishing quotas , " karoline schacht of the wwf told dw-world.de. with stocks steadily declining , the international commission for the conservation of atlantic tunas -lrb- iccat -rrb- last year recommended cutting fishing quotas in half .
" instead the quota has remained nearly as high as last year - the fishing lobby has once again triumphed , " said stefanie werner of greenpeace , adding that mediterranean countries , in particular , have exceeded their fishing quotas .
greenpeace is now demanding suspending fishing until the iccat formulates a " responsible " management plan .
eel and cod threatened too it 's not just tuna that 's threatened .
stocks of eel and cod are also in precarious shape , according to the eu commission .
the eu said a rise in illegal fishing is the main reason for the dwindling stocks .
according to the wwf , around 50 percent of all cod fishing in the baltic sea is illegal .
that amounts to around 22,000 tons each year , according to germany 's federal ministry for agriculture .
the ministry estimated that in the past years over 100,000 tons of cod have been illegally fished each year in the barents sea .
the eu commission has already taken action against poland and banned it from fishing cod after it emerged that polish fishermen caught 18,000 tons of cod in the first half of the year , but only registered 6,000 tons .
better checks needed to enable depleted fish stocks to recover , the eu plans to cut fishing quotas for cod in the baltic sea by a third .
the plan has n't found favor among german fishermen who say the eu needs to introduce more effective controls and inspections to counter illegal fishing rather than cut quotas for legal catches .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say eu member states are not doing enough to rein in illegal fishing " if illegal fishing was reduced by half , there would be no problems with cod stocks , " said lothar fischer , board member of the german coastal fishing association .
the proposed cuts make it apparent that the " eu does n't trust its own control mechanisms , " fischer said .
environmental experts say that part of the problem is the division of checks and balances between the eu and the member states on fishing .
eu member states carry out their own inspections of fishing stocks by checking fish hauls at harbors or reviewing fishing fleets while at sea .
the eu , on the other hand , checks if member states fulfill their responsibilities .

" this is , of course , true for immediate neighbors such as china , " solana said . china is myanmar 's largest trading partner and has long had diplomatic ties to the regime .
beijing is also eyeing the country 's untapped gas fields and strategic location . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solana says china must use its sway over myanmar 's rulers to end bloodshed the eu 's top diplomat urged the myanmar generals " to immediately cease all violence against the peaceful demonstrations of the burmese population . "
solana also stressed that all political prisoners have to be freed in myanmar , while indirectly threatening with sanctions .
" we are pressing for a national reconciliation process .
we are also looking at appropriate measures , in case the military continues to use violence .
we are reviewing all options . " solana 's comments come as un special envoy ibrahim gambari is in the new burmese capital , naypyidaw , for talks with the country 's military rulers .
it remains unclear which members of the government , gambari will be allowed to speak to . china issues call for peace caving in to international pressure , china over the weekend made its strongest call yet for the military dictatorship or junta to find a peaceful solution to the protests as several hundred people took to the streets of rangoon , braving violence and tear gas by security forces . after telephone talks with british prime minister gordon brown , chinese premier wen jiabao said beijing hoped peace would return to myanmar quickly . " china hopes all parties concerned show restraint , resume stability through peaceful means as soon as possible , promote domestic reconciliation and achieve democracy and development . " eu warns of tighter sanctions on friday , sept 28 , the european union summoned myanmar 's senior diplomat in brussels to warn him of tougher sanctions against the military government unless it ends a bloody clampdown on protestors which has killed several people so far .
the exact numbers are not known . eu spokeswoman , cristina gallach said a strong message would be conveyed on monday to myanmar 's association of south east asian nations -lrb- asean -rrb- partners to push them to use their influence to end the repression . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : myanmar 's rulers have sent in the military to crack down on demonstrators " we told the charge d 'affairs we are looking at a series of options and the behaviour of the regime would very much have an impact on the type of questions , " gallach said . separately , italian prime minister romano prodi 's office said the eu was discussing backing up a mission to myanmar by un special envoy , gambari . on thursday , a member of the european parliament said eu nations should boycott the beijing olympics next year unless china intervenes to stop the violence in myanmar . eu sanctions " pathetic " the eu has already targeted myanmar 's generals with visa bans , asset freezes and trade restrictions and eu experts are reportedly looking into possible restrictions on exports from myanmar of timber , precious metals and stones . eu exports to myanmar totalled 83 million euros in 2005 , imports from the country amounted to 287 million euros according to eu statistics . however , mark farmaner of the burma campaign uk called eu sanctions " pathetic . " he told news agency reuters that the freeze on assets was less than 7,000 euros in all 27 eu member states and many nations allowed their companies to do business in myanmar . french oil company total is one of the biggest investors in myanmar and currently pumps gas from fields off myanmar 's coast .
the company 's current investments are exempt from an eu investment ban on european firms in myanmar . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : myanmar 's untapped gas reserves have lured foreign companies human rights activists say the firm 's activities earn the military junta millions of dollars each year . business leaders not convinced by call for sanctions earlier this week , french president nicholas sarkozy urged total to refrain from new investment in burma . the french concern said no new investment was planned but added that its pull-out would worsen the situation in the country as its place would be taken by others who treated their staff less well . jürgen hambrecht , chief of german industry 's asia-pacific committee , said in an interview he did not believe restrictions by the eu and us would prod the country 's military rulers to change course .

the commission has established limits on the amount mobile phone companies can charge their customers .
operators can now charge a maximum of around 34 pence a minute for making calls , and 17 pence to receive a call .
the move has been welcomed by consumer groups , but some say charges are still too high when using a mobile phone outside the european union .
the new rules do not apply to text messaging nor internet access on a mobile phone .
the european commission says those prices are high , and it hopes operators will lower them voluntarily .
bbc correspondent sumant bhatia said that in some cases , the new tariffs would be less than half the rate charged by networks earlier this year .
and those costs are expected to fall further over the next two years .
the european telecoms commissioner , viviane reding , also wants to reduce so-called termination charges - the cost of transferring calls from one network to another .
she said : " we hope we 've now seen the last of excessive roaming charges .

spokesman qari yusuf ahmadi said the taleban would never negotiate with the afghan authorities while foreign troops remained in the country .
president karzai repeated on saturday that he would be willing to offer the taleban positions in government if it would bring peace .
he was speaking after a taleban suicide bomber killed 30 people in kabul .
" taliban are not interested in government posts - ministries or anything .
we want the withdrawal of foreign forces and we stand by our position , " qari yusuf ahmadi told news agencies .
" as long as they have not withdrawn , we 'll never talk with the kabul administration . "
offer president karzai said on saturday he wished he could contact taleban leader mullah omar and warlord gulbuddin hekmatyar to ask why they were trying to destroy afghanistan .
he said he would meet both men personally , and even offer them cabinet posts , if it would help to bring about peace .
but he reiterated he would not agree to any troop withdrawal .
