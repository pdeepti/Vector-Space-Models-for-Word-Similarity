located in the former nazi headquarters , the center is intended to be a place of learning . it was in munich that the national socialist movement gained ground following the trauma of world war i. a young adolf hitler staged a failed coup in the conservative bavarian capital in 1923 and after coming to power in 1933 , the nazi leader chose munich as the headquarters of his movement . aware of the central role it played in the rise of nazism , the city of munich has initiated a new documentation center in the brown house on munich 's brienner strasse , which was home to the nazi party starting in the early 1930s . center focuses on teaching for the future " there 's no place on this earth that is as contaminated by ' brown ' ideology as here , " munich city council member marian offman , who also belongs to the jewish community , told deutsche welle .
" this is where the global fire started that claimed 50 million human victims in the end and the actors from this place are responsible for it . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 1938 " night of broken glass " pogrom against jews was ordered from the brown house first proposed in 1989 , the city of munich approved a plan for the center in 2001 and won the support of the state of bavaria .
the federal government is also expected to contribute to the 35 million-euro -lrb- $ 50.4 million -rrb- project . construction is slated to begin by the end of 2008 , coinciding with the 850th anniversary of munich 's founding . project organizers have said that " pro-active commemoration " is a central goal .
this involves " a critical approach to and a frank discussion on the history of national socialism , and includes a look at the teaching of civics and human rights in a way that is relevant to the present and the future , " according to the center 's web site . excavation recovered no nazi artifacts when the second world war came to an end , the temporary american military government commanded the removal of all nazi symbols , including swastikas , flags and nazi architecture .
a cellar covered by withered grass and a bit of rubble was all that was left of the brown house .
even an archaeological dig of the basement proved unfruitful . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : holocaust memorials focus on the victims , while the munich center aims to focus on learning " there was n't anything there except for cellar walls , " said offman .
" i think there were some pamphlets but nothing else .
that 's nothing - considering the monstrous crimes that originated in this place . " city archivist andreas heusler said the decision to tear down the few remaining bits of the brown house after the excavation was too hasty . " it would n't have necessarily been so bad if they had considered the question of conservation and distance a bit more and talked a bit more intensively about how to retain even just a small piece of -lsb- the remains -rsb- for the documentation center and integrate it into the planned exhibition , " said heusler . instead of displaying historical documents or other items , the center intends to spark discussion on topics surrounding the nazi period and its ramifications . those interested in learning more about national socialist history can also visit the documentation center located near nuremberg at hitler 's former convention site .
many of the concentration camp sites also offer information centers , including dachau near munich . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they are not required to accept emission reduction commitments under the kyoto protocol , and say that any such commitments would cramp economic growth and curb poverty reduction efforts . no more junk bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china 's growth has sparked a global race with the west for markets and industrial resources as china was opening one coal-fired plant a week , " it is important to us whether it is equipped with the most modern technology or is an old junk heap , " she said . china in any case paid back the loans , wieczorek-zeul added . the german development ministry focuses on three areas in providing assistance to other countries : environmental protection and sustainable use of natural resources , sustainable economic development and transport , including modernizing the rail network . the justice ministry maintains a dialogue on human rights and the rule of law , although the chinese halted discussions on this front following a private meeting between the dalai lama and chancellor angela merkel in september . the right balance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurt beck would rather avoid direct confrontations with china relations with china have been causing tensions in the ruling german coalition over what should be the driving force in germany 's foreign policy - economics or ethics . in the latest partisan stab on the grand-coalition front , social democratic chief kurt beck criticized angela merkel 's decision to meet the dalai lama . " anybody who knows anything about china understands that politics over there is done much more through protocol than we 're used to , " beck told the frankfurter allgemeinen sonntagszeitung in an interview to be published on sunday , dec .
23 . " those who do politics with china only by means of public warnings will not get far , " beck said , pointing out that china as well as russia were germany 's " strategic partners . " business as usual ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's meeting with the dalai lama did not go down very well in beijing beck 's open criticism of his party 's coalition partner is likely to complicate what is already a sensitive and seemingly interminable debate on the german political scene . the premier of the central german state of hesse and member of chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , roland koch , last month openly criticized german foreign minister and spd member frank-walter steinmeier for " creating the impression in russia and china that we germans are ready to do any kind of business , even when human rights are being trampled on . " " in doing so , the foreign minister is harming our country , " koch said . german chancellor angela merkel , however , in a speech to the german parliament last month , defended her country 's foreign policy as one that was based both on ethics and economic interests . " human rights policy and representation of economic interests are two sides of the same coin , " merkel said .

they are not required to accept emission reduction commitments under the kyoto protocol , and say that any such commitments would cramp economic growth and curb poverty reduction efforts . no more junk bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china 's growth has sparked a global race with the west for markets and industrial resources as china was opening one coal-fired plant a week , " it is important to us whether it is equipped with the most modern technology or is an old junk heap , " she said . china in any case paid back the loans , wieczorek-zeul added . the german development ministry focuses on three areas in providing assistance to other countries : environmental protection and sustainable use of natural resources , sustainable economic development and transport , including modernizing the rail network . the justice ministry maintains a dialogue on human rights and the rule of law , although the chinese halted discussions on this front following a private meeting between the dalai lama and chancellor angela merkel in september . the right balance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurt beck would rather avoid direct confrontations with china relations with china have been causing tensions in the ruling german coalition over what should be the driving force in germany 's foreign policy - economics or ethics . in the latest partisan stab on the grand-coalition front , social democratic chief kurt beck criticized angela merkel 's decision to meet the dalai lama . " anybody who knows anything about china understands that politics over there is done much more through protocol than we 're used to , " beck told the frankfurter allgemeinen sonntagszeitung in an interview to be published on sunday , dec .
23 . " those who do politics with china only by means of public warnings will not get far , " beck said , pointing out that china as well as russia were germany 's " strategic partners . " business as usual ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's meeting with the dalai lama did not go down very well in beijing beck 's open criticism of his party 's coalition partner is likely to complicate what is already a sensitive and seemingly interminable debate on the german political scene . the premier of the central german state of hesse and member of chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , roland koch , last month openly criticized german foreign minister and spd member frank-walter steinmeier for " creating the impression in russia and china that we germans are ready to do any kind of business , even when human rights are being trampled on . " " in doing so , the foreign minister is harming our country , " koch said . german chancellor angela merkel , however , in a speech to the german parliament last month , defended her country 's foreign policy as one that was based both on ethics and economic interests .

located in the former nazi headquarters , the center is intended to be a place of learning . it was in munich that the national socialist movement gained ground following the trauma of world war i. a young adolf hitler staged a failed coup in the conservative bavarian capital in 1923 and after coming to power in 1933 , the nazi leader chose munich as the headquarters of his movement . aware of the central role it played in the rise of nazism , the city of munich has initiated a new documentation center in the brown house on munich 's brienner strasse , which was home to the nazi party starting in the early 1930s . center focuses on teaching for the future " there 's no place on this earth that is as contaminated by ' brown ' ideology as here , " munich city council member marian offman , who also belongs to the jewish community , told deutsche welle .
" this is where the global fire started that claimed 50 million human victims in the end and the actors from this place are responsible for it . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 1938 " night of broken glass " pogrom against jews was ordered from the brown house first proposed in 1989 , the city of munich approved a plan for the center in 2001 and won the support of the state of bavaria .
the federal government is also expected to contribute to the 35 million-euro -lrb- $ 50.4 million -rrb- project . construction is slated to begin by the end of 2008 , coinciding with the 850th anniversary of munich 's founding . project organizers have said that " pro-active commemoration " is a central goal .
this involves " a critical approach to and a frank discussion on the history of national socialism , and includes a look at the teaching of civics and human rights in a way that is relevant to the present and the future , " according to the center 's web site . excavation recovered no nazi artifacts when the second world war came to an end , the temporary american military government commanded the removal of all nazi symbols , including swastikas , flags and nazi architecture .
a cellar covered by withered grass and a bit of rubble was all that was left of the brown house .
even an archaeological dig of the basement proved unfruitful . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : holocaust memorials focus on the victims , while the munich center aims to focus on learning " there was n't anything there except for cellar walls , " said offman .
" i think there were some pamphlets but nothing else .
that 's nothing - considering the monstrous crimes that originated in this place . " city archivist andreas heusler said the decision to tear down the few remaining bits of the brown house after the excavation was too hasty . " it would n't have necessarily been so bad if they had considered the question of conservation and distance a bit more and talked a bit more intensively about how to retain even just a small piece of -lsb- the remains -rsb- for the documentation center and integrate it into the planned exhibition , " said heusler . instead of displaying historical documents or other items , the center intends to spark discussion on topics surrounding the nazi period and its ramifications . those interested in learning more about national socialist history can also visit the documentation center located near nuremberg at hitler 's former convention site .

they are not required to accept emission reduction commitments under the kyoto protocol , and say that any such commitments would cramp economic growth and curb poverty reduction efforts . no more junk bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china 's growth has sparked a global race with the west for markets and industrial resources as china was opening one coal-fired plant a week , " it is important to us whether it is equipped with the most modern technology or is an old junk heap , " she said . china in any case paid back the loans , wieczorek-zeul added . the german development ministry focuses on three areas in providing assistance to other countries : environmental protection and sustainable use of natural resources , sustainable economic development and transport , including modernizing the rail network . the justice ministry maintains a dialogue on human rights and the rule of law , although the chinese halted discussions on this front following a private meeting between the dalai lama and chancellor angela merkel in september . the right balance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurt beck would rather avoid direct confrontations with china relations with china have been causing tensions in the ruling german coalition over what should be the driving force in germany 's foreign policy - economics or ethics . in the latest partisan stab on the grand-coalition front , social democratic chief kurt beck criticized angela merkel 's decision to meet the dalai lama . " anybody who knows anything about china understands that politics over there is done much more through protocol than we 're used to , " beck told the frankfurter allgemeinen sonntagszeitung in an interview to be published on sunday , dec .
23 . " those who do politics with china only by means of public warnings will not get far , " beck said , pointing out that china as well as russia were germany 's " strategic partners . " business as usual ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's meeting with the dalai lama did not go down very well in beijing beck 's open criticism of his party 's coalition partner is likely to complicate what is already a sensitive and seemingly interminable debate on the german political scene . the premier of the central german state of hesse and member of chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , roland koch , last month openly criticized german foreign minister and spd member frank-walter steinmeier for " creating the impression in russia and china that we germans are ready to do any kind of business , even when human rights are being trampled on . " " in doing so , the foreign minister is harming our country , " koch said . german chancellor angela merkel , however , in a speech to the german parliament last month , defended her country 's foreign policy as one that was based both on ethics and economic interests . " human rights policy and representation of economic interests are two sides of the same coin , " merkel said .
" they should never be opposed to each another . " dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

located in the former nazi headquarters , the center is intended to be a place of learning . it was in munich that the national socialist movement gained ground following the trauma of world war i. a young adolf hitler staged a failed coup in the conservative bavarian capital in 1923 and after coming to power in 1933 , the nazi leader chose munich as the headquarters of his movement . aware of the central role it played in the rise of nazism , the city of munich has initiated a new documentation center in the brown house on munich 's brienner strasse , which was home to the nazi party starting in the early 1930s . center focuses on teaching for the future " there 's no place on this earth that is as contaminated by ' brown ' ideology as here , " munich city council member marian offman , who also belongs to the jewish community , told deutsche welle .
" this is where the global fire started that claimed 50 million human victims in the end and the actors from this place are responsible for it . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 1938 " night of broken glass " pogrom against jews was ordered from the brown house first proposed in 1989 , the city of munich approved a plan for the center in 2001 and won the support of the state of bavaria .
the federal government is also expected to contribute to the 35 million-euro -lrb- $ 50.4 million -rrb- project . construction is slated to begin by the end of 2008 , coinciding with the 850th anniversary of munich 's founding . project organizers have said that " pro-active commemoration " is a central goal .
this involves " a critical approach to and a frank discussion on the history of national socialism , and includes a look at the teaching of civics and human rights in a way that is relevant to the present and the future , " according to the center 's web site . excavation recovered no nazi artifacts when the second world war came to an end , the temporary american military government commanded the removal of all nazi symbols , including swastikas , flags and nazi architecture .
a cellar covered by withered grass and a bit of rubble was all that was left of the brown house .
even an archaeological dig of the basement proved unfruitful . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : holocaust memorials focus on the victims , while the munich center aims to focus on learning " there was n't anything there except for cellar walls , " said offman .
" i think there were some pamphlets but nothing else .
that 's nothing - considering the monstrous crimes that originated in this place . " city archivist andreas heusler said the decision to tear down the few remaining bits of the brown house after the excavation was too hasty . " it would n't have necessarily been so bad if they had considered the question of conservation and distance a bit more and talked a bit more intensively about how to retain even just a small piece of -lsb- the remains -rsb- for the documentation center and integrate it into the planned exhibition , " said heusler . instead of displaying historical documents or other items , the center intends to spark discussion on topics surrounding the nazi period and its ramifications . those interested in learning more about national socialist history can also visit the documentation center located near nuremberg at hitler 's former convention site .

located in the former nazi headquarters , the center is intended to be a place of learning . it was in munich that the national socialist movement gained ground following the trauma of world war i. a young adolf hitler staged a failed coup in the conservative bavarian capital in 1923 and after coming to power in 1933 , the nazi leader chose munich as the headquarters of his movement . aware of the central role it played in the rise of nazism , the city of munich has initiated a new documentation center in the brown house on munich 's brienner strasse , which was home to the nazi party starting in the early 1930s . center focuses on teaching for the future " there 's no place on this earth that is as contaminated by ' brown ' ideology as here , " munich city council member marian offman , who also belongs to the jewish community , told deutsche welle .

they are not required to accept emission reduction commitments under the kyoto protocol , and say that any such commitments would cramp economic growth and curb poverty reduction efforts . no more junk bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china 's growth has sparked a global race with the west for markets and industrial resources as china was opening one coal-fired plant a week , " it is important to us whether it is equipped with the most modern technology or is an old junk heap , " she said . china in any case paid back the loans , wieczorek-zeul added . the german development ministry focuses on three areas in providing assistance to other countries : environmental protection and sustainable use of natural resources , sustainable economic development and transport , including modernizing the rail network . the justice ministry maintains a dialogue on human rights and the rule of law , although the chinese halted discussions on this front following a private meeting between the dalai lama and chancellor angela merkel in september . the right balance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurt beck would rather avoid direct confrontations with china relations with china have been causing tensions in the ruling german coalition over what should be the driving force in germany 's foreign policy - economics or ethics . in the latest partisan stab on the grand-coalition front , social democratic chief kurt beck criticized angela merkel 's decision to meet the dalai lama . " anybody who knows anything about china understands that politics over there is done much more through protocol than we 're used to , " beck told the frankfurter allgemeinen sonntagszeitung in an interview to be published on sunday , dec .
23 . " those who do politics with china only by means of public warnings will not get far , " beck said , pointing out that china as well as russia were germany 's " strategic partners . " business as usual ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's meeting with the dalai lama did not go down very well in beijing beck 's open criticism of his party 's coalition partner is likely to complicate what is already a sensitive and seemingly interminable debate on the german political scene . the premier of the central german state of hesse and member of chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , roland koch , last month openly criticized german foreign minister and spd member frank-walter steinmeier for " creating the impression in russia and china that we germans are ready to do any kind of business , even when human rights are being trampled on . " " in doing so , the foreign minister is harming our country , " koch said . german chancellor angela merkel , however , in a speech to the german parliament last month , defended her country 's foreign policy as one that was based both on ethics and economic interests .

they are not required to accept emission reduction commitments under the kyoto protocol , and say that any such commitments would cramp economic growth and curb poverty reduction efforts . no more junk bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china 's growth has sparked a global race with the west for markets and industrial resources as china was opening one coal-fired plant a week , " it is important to us whether it is equipped with the most modern technology or is an old junk heap , " she said . china in any case paid back the loans , wieczorek-zeul added . the german development ministry focuses on three areas in providing assistance to other countries : environmental protection and sustainable use of natural resources , sustainable economic development and transport , including modernizing the rail network . the justice ministry maintains a dialogue on human rights and the rule of law , although the chinese halted discussions on this front following a private meeting between the dalai lama and chancellor angela merkel in september . the right balance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurt beck would rather avoid direct confrontations with china relations with china have been causing tensions in the ruling german coalition over what should be the driving force in germany 's foreign policy - economics or ethics . in the latest partisan stab on the grand-coalition front , social democratic chief kurt beck criticized angela merkel 's decision to meet the dalai lama . " anybody who knows anything about china understands that politics over there is done much more through protocol than we 're used to , " beck told the frankfurter allgemeinen sonntagszeitung in an interview to be published on sunday , dec .
23 . " those who do politics with china only by means of public warnings will not get far , " beck said , pointing out that china as well as russia were germany 's " strategic partners . " business as usual ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's meeting with the dalai lama did not go down very well in beijing beck 's open criticism of his party 's coalition partner is likely to complicate what is already a sensitive and seemingly interminable debate on the german political scene . the premier of the central german state of hesse and member of chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , roland koch , last month openly criticized german foreign minister and spd member frank-walter steinmeier for " creating the impression in russia and china that we germans are ready to do any kind of business , even when human rights are being trampled on . " " in doing so , the foreign minister is harming our country , " koch said . german chancellor angela merkel , however , in a speech to the german parliament last month , defended her country 's foreign policy as one that was based both on ethics and economic interests . " human rights policy and representation of economic interests are two sides of the same coin , " merkel said .

21 , against the recently imposed restrictions on smoking in restaurants .
the court in the southern german city of karlsruhe will hear the case , which claims the smoking bans violate the rights of the hospitality industry .
the court case is seen as a last-ditch effort to halt increasingly stringent anti-smoking regulations which are being put into place in germany , state by state .
until recently , germany was considered one of europe 's last bastions of smoke-filled restaurants .
the tobacco lobby remains strong in germany and as of 2006 , the country is estimated to have some 16.7 million smokers .
different regulations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some feel the bans are unfair to small restaurants the regulations differ depending on the area .
some allow smoking only if a restaurant can provide separate rooms for smokers and non-smokers . " our suit is not meant as a challenge to the rights of non-smokers but as a bid to protect the rights of restaurant owners whose establishments consist of only one room and who will suffer economically as a result of this ban , " the hospitality federation said in a statement .
but germany has been moving towards stricter rules in line with other countries in europe .

located in the former nazi headquarters , the center is intended to be a place of learning . it was in munich that the national socialist movement gained ground following the trauma of world war i. a young adolf hitler staged a failed coup in the conservative bavarian capital in 1923 and after coming to power in 1933 , the nazi leader chose munich as the headquarters of his movement . aware of the central role it played in the rise of nazism , the city of munich has initiated a new documentation center in the brown house on munich 's brienner strasse , which was home to the nazi party starting in the early 1930s . center focuses on teaching for the future " there 's no place on this earth that is as contaminated by ' brown ' ideology as here , " munich city council member marian offman , who also belongs to the jewish community , told deutsche welle .
" this is where the global fire started that claimed 50 million human victims in the end and the actors from this place are responsible for it . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 1938 " night of broken glass " pogrom against jews was ordered from the brown house first proposed in 1989 , the city of munich approved a plan for the center in 2001 and won the support of the state of bavaria .
the federal government is also expected to contribute to the 35 million-euro -lrb- $ 50.4 million -rrb- project . construction is slated to begin by the end of 2008 , coinciding with the 850th anniversary of munich 's founding . project organizers have said that " pro-active commemoration " is a central goal .
this involves " a critical approach to and a frank discussion on the history of national socialism , and includes a look at the teaching of civics and human rights in a way that is relevant to the present and the future , " according to the center 's web site . excavation recovered no nazi artifacts when the second world war came to an end , the temporary american military government commanded the removal of all nazi symbols , including swastikas , flags and nazi architecture .
a cellar covered by withered grass and a bit of rubble was all that was left of the brown house .
even an archaeological dig of the basement proved unfruitful . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : holocaust memorials focus on the victims , while the munich center aims to focus on learning " there was n't anything there except for cellar walls , " said offman .
" i think there were some pamphlets but nothing else .
that 's nothing - considering the monstrous crimes that originated in this place . " city archivist andreas heusler said the decision to tear down the few remaining bits of the brown house after the excavation was too hasty . " it would n't have necessarily been so bad if they had considered the question of conservation and distance a bit more and talked a bit more intensively about how to retain even just a small piece of -lsb- the remains -rsb- for the documentation center and integrate it into the planned exhibition , " said heusler . instead of displaying historical documents or other items , the center intends to spark discussion on topics surrounding the nazi period and its ramifications . those interested in learning more about national socialist history can also visit the documentation center located near nuremberg at hitler 's former convention site .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 22.12.2007 germany 's smoking laws face court challenge großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has been slow to pass anti-smoking legislation with more of germany 's 16 states set to stub out smoking in restaurants in 2008 , opponents have filed a challenge with germany 's constitutional court . a federation of germany 's hotel and restaurant owners filed a challenge with the country 's constitutional court on friday , dec .
21 , against the recently imposed restrictions on smoking in restaurants .
the court in the southern german city of karlsruhe will hear the case , which claims the smoking bans violate the rights of the hospitality industry .
the court case is seen as a last-ditch effort to halt increasingly stringent anti-smoking regulations which are being put into place in germany , state by state .
until recently , germany was considered one of europe 's last bastions of smoke-filled restaurants .
the tobacco lobby remains strong in germany and as of 2006 , the country is estimated to have some 16.7 million smokers .
different regulations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some feel the bans are unfair to small restaurants the regulations differ depending on the area .
some allow smoking only if a restaurant can provide separate rooms for smokers and non-smokers . " our suit is not meant as a challenge to the rights of non-smokers but as a bid to protect the rights of restaurant owners whose establishments consist of only one room and who will suffer economically as a result of this ban , " the hospitality federation said in a statement .
but germany has been moving towards stricter rules in line with other countries in europe .
in 2007 , restaurants without separate smoking sections had to go smoke-free in lower saxony , hesse and baden-württemberg .
other states will follow in 2008 .
oktoberfest 's smoking masses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : where are their smokes ?
especially alarming to smokers is that the wealthy southern state of bavaria plans to implement the tough tobacco restrictions .
starting jan .
1 , 2008 , the bavarian law - the toughest regulation of its kind ever to be enacted in germany - will not only prohibit smoking in public buildings , schools and hospitals , but will also outlaw smoking sections inside bars restaurants . even the world-famous october beer festival in munich will technically have to go smoke-free .

21 , against the recently imposed restrictions on smoking in restaurants .
the court in the southern german city of karlsruhe will hear the case , which claims the smoking bans violate the rights of the hospitality industry .
the court case is seen as a last-ditch effort to halt increasingly stringent anti-smoking regulations which are being put into place in germany , state by state .
until recently , germany was considered one of europe 's last bastions of smoke-filled restaurants .
the tobacco lobby remains strong in germany and as of 2006 , the country is estimated to have some 16.7 million smokers .
different regulations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some feel the bans are unfair to small restaurants the regulations differ depending on the area .
some allow smoking only if a restaurant can provide separate rooms for smokers and non-smokers . " our suit is not meant as a challenge to the rights of non-smokers but as a bid to protect the rights of restaurant owners whose establishments consist of only one room and who will suffer economically as a result of this ban , " the hospitality federation said in a statement .
but germany has been moving towards stricter rules in line with other countries in europe .
in 2007 , restaurants without separate smoking sections had to go smoke-free in lower saxony , hesse and baden-württemberg .
other states will follow in 2008 .

but bavarian premier günther beckstein has promised that the smoking ban will not be enforced during the popular event . the world 's biggest beer festival , which dates back to 1810 , is a money-spinner for munich .
it brings in about a billion euros -lrb- $ 1.4 billion -rrb- a year for the bavarian capital .

21 , against the recently imposed restrictions on smoking in restaurants .
the court in the southern german city of karlsruhe will hear the case , which claims the smoking bans violate the rights of the hospitality industry .
the court case is seen as a last-ditch effort to halt increasingly stringent anti-smoking regulations which are being put into place in germany , state by state .
until recently , germany was considered one of europe 's last bastions of smoke-filled restaurants .
the tobacco lobby remains strong in germany and as of 2006 , the country is estimated to have some 16.7 million smokers .
different regulations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some feel the bans are unfair to small restaurants the regulations differ depending on the area .
some allow smoking only if a restaurant can provide separate rooms for smokers and non-smokers . " our suit is not meant as a challenge to the rights of non-smokers but as a bid to protect the rights of restaurant owners whose establishments consist of only one room and who will suffer economically as a result of this ban , " the hospitality federation said in a statement .

located in the former nazi headquarters , the center is intended to be a place of learning . it was in munich that the national socialist movement gained ground following the trauma of world war i. a young adolf hitler staged a failed coup in the conservative bavarian capital in 1923 and after coming to power in 1933 , the nazi leader chose munich as the headquarters of his movement . aware of the central role it played in the rise of nazism , the city of munich has initiated a new documentation center in the brown house on munich 's brienner strasse , which was home to the nazi party starting in the early 1930s . center focuses on teaching for the future " there 's no place on this earth that is as contaminated by ' brown ' ideology as here , " munich city council member marian offman , who also belongs to the jewish community , told deutsche welle .
" this is where the global fire started that claimed 50 million human victims in the end and the actors from this place are responsible for it . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 1938 " night of broken glass " pogrom against jews was ordered from the brown house first proposed in 1989 , the city of munich approved a plan for the center in 2001 and won the support of the state of bavaria .
the federal government is also expected to contribute to the 35 million-euro -lrb- $ 50.4 million -rrb- project . construction is slated to begin by the end of 2008 , coinciding with the 850th anniversary of munich 's founding . project organizers have said that " pro-active commemoration " is a central goal .
this involves " a critical approach to and a frank discussion on the history of national socialism , and includes a look at the teaching of civics and human rights in a way that is relevant to the present and the future , " according to the center 's web site . excavation recovered no nazi artifacts when the second world war came to an end , the temporary american military government commanded the removal of all nazi symbols , including swastikas , flags and nazi architecture .
a cellar covered by withered grass and a bit of rubble was all that was left of the brown house .
even an archaeological dig of the basement proved unfruitful . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : holocaust memorials focus on the victims , while the munich center aims to focus on learning " there was n't anything there except for cellar walls , " said offman .
" i think there were some pamphlets but nothing else .
that 's nothing - considering the monstrous crimes that originated in this place . " city archivist andreas heusler said the decision to tear down the few remaining bits of the brown house after the excavation was too hasty .

located in the former nazi headquarters , the center is intended to be a place of learning . it was in munich that the national socialist movement gained ground following the trauma of world war i. a young adolf hitler staged a failed coup in the conservative bavarian capital in 1923 and after coming to power in 1933 , the nazi leader chose munich as the headquarters of his movement . aware of the central role it played in the rise of nazism , the city of munich has initiated a new documentation center in the brown house on munich 's brienner strasse , which was home to the nazi party starting in the early 1930s . center focuses on teaching for the future " there 's no place on this earth that is as contaminated by ' brown ' ideology as here , " munich city council member marian offman , who also belongs to the jewish community , told deutsche welle .
" this is where the global fire started that claimed 50 million human victims in the end and the actors from this place are responsible for it . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 1938 " night of broken glass " pogrom against jews was ordered from the brown house first proposed in 1989 , the city of munich approved a plan for the center in 2001 and won the support of the state of bavaria .

this involves " a critical approach to and a frank discussion on the history of national socialism , and includes a look at the teaching of civics and human rights in a way that is relevant to the present and the future , " according to the center 's web site . excavation recovered no nazi artifacts when the second world war came to an end , the temporary american military government commanded the removal of all nazi symbols , including swastikas , flags and nazi architecture .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 22.12.2007 germany 's smoking laws face court challenge großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has been slow to pass anti-smoking legislation with more of germany 's 16 states set to stub out smoking in restaurants in 2008 , opponents have filed a challenge with germany 's constitutional court . a federation of germany 's hotel and restaurant owners filed a challenge with the country 's constitutional court on friday , dec .
21 , against the recently imposed restrictions on smoking in restaurants .
the court in the southern german city of karlsruhe will hear the case , which claims the smoking bans violate the rights of the hospitality industry .
the court case is seen as a last-ditch effort to halt increasingly stringent anti-smoking regulations which are being put into place in germany , state by state .
until recently , germany was considered one of europe 's last bastions of smoke-filled restaurants .
the tobacco lobby remains strong in germany and as of 2006 , the country is estimated to have some 16.7 million smokers .
different regulations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some feel the bans are unfair to small restaurants the regulations differ depending on the area .
some allow smoking only if a restaurant can provide separate rooms for smokers and non-smokers . " our suit is not meant as a challenge to the rights of non-smokers but as a bid to protect the rights of restaurant owners whose establishments consist of only one room and who will suffer economically as a result of this ban , " the hospitality federation said in a statement .
but germany has been moving towards stricter rules in line with other countries in europe .
in 2007 , restaurants without separate smoking sections had to go smoke-free in lower saxony , hesse and baden-württemberg .
other states will follow in 2008 .
oktoberfest 's smoking masses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : where are their smokes ?
especially alarming to smokers is that the wealthy southern state of bavaria plans to implement the tough tobacco restrictions .
starting jan .
1 , 2008 , the bavarian law - the toughest regulation of its kind ever to be enacted in germany - will not only prohibit smoking in public buildings , schools and hospitals , but will also outlaw smoking sections inside bars restaurants . even the world-famous october beer festival in munich will technically have to go smoke-free .

they are not required to accept emission reduction commitments under the kyoto protocol , and say that any such commitments would cramp economic growth and curb poverty reduction efforts . no more junk bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china 's growth has sparked a global race with the west for markets and industrial resources as china was opening one coal-fired plant a week , " it is important to us whether it is equipped with the most modern technology or is an old junk heap , " she said . china in any case paid back the loans , wieczorek-zeul added . the german development ministry focuses on three areas in providing assistance to other countries : environmental protection and sustainable use of natural resources , sustainable economic development and transport , including modernizing the rail network . the justice ministry maintains a dialogue on human rights and the rule of law , although the chinese halted discussions on this front following a private meeting between the dalai lama and chancellor angela merkel in september . the right balance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurt beck would rather avoid direct confrontations with china relations with china have been causing tensions in the ruling german coalition over what should be the driving force in germany 's foreign policy - economics or ethics . in the latest partisan stab on the grand-coalition front , social democratic chief kurt beck criticized angela merkel 's decision to meet the dalai lama . " anybody who knows anything about china understands that politics over there is done much more through protocol than we 're used to , " beck told the frankfurter allgemeinen sonntagszeitung in an interview to be published on sunday , dec .
23 . " those who do politics with china only by means of public warnings will not get far , " beck said , pointing out that china as well as russia were germany 's " strategic partners . " business as usual ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's meeting with the dalai lama did not go down very well in beijing beck 's open criticism of his party 's coalition partner is likely to complicate what is already a sensitive and seemingly interminable debate on the german political scene . the premier of the central german state of hesse and member of chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , roland koch , last month openly criticized german foreign minister and spd member frank-walter steinmeier for " creating the impression in russia and china that we germans are ready to do any kind of business , even when human rights are being trampled on . " " in doing so , the foreign minister is harming our country , " koch said . german chancellor angela merkel , however , in a speech to the german parliament last month , defended her country 's foreign policy as one that was based both on ethics and economic interests . " human rights policy and representation of economic interests are two sides of the same coin , " merkel said .

21 , against the recently imposed restrictions on smoking in restaurants .
the court in the southern german city of karlsruhe will hear the case , which claims the smoking bans violate the rights of the hospitality industry .
the court case is seen as a last-ditch effort to halt increasingly stringent anti-smoking regulations which are being put into place in germany , state by state .
until recently , germany was considered one of europe 's last bastions of smoke-filled restaurants .
the tobacco lobby remains strong in germany and as of 2006 , the country is estimated to have some 16.7 million smokers .
different regulations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some feel the bans are unfair to small restaurants the regulations differ depending on the area .
some allow smoking only if a restaurant can provide separate rooms for smokers and non-smokers . " our suit is not meant as a challenge to the rights of non-smokers but as a bid to protect the rights of restaurant owners whose establishments consist of only one room and who will suffer economically as a result of this ban , " the hospitality federation said in a statement .
but germany has been moving towards stricter rules in line with other countries in europe .
in 2007 , restaurants without separate smoking sections had to go smoke-free in lower saxony , hesse and baden-württemberg .
other states will follow in 2008 .
oktoberfest 's smoking masses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : where are their smokes ?
especially alarming to smokers is that the wealthy southern state of bavaria plans to implement the tough tobacco restrictions .
starting jan .
1 , 2008 , the bavarian law - the toughest regulation of its kind ever to be enacted in germany - will not only prohibit smoking in public buildings , schools and hospitals , but will also outlaw smoking sections inside bars restaurants . even the world-famous october beer festival in munich will technically have to go smoke-free .
but bavarian premier günther beckstein has promised that the smoking ban will not be enforced during the popular event . the world 's biggest beer festival , which dates back to 1810 , is a money-spinner for munich .
it brings in about a billion euros -lrb- $ 1.4 billion -rrb- a year for the bavarian capital .
beer sales at the festival were up 10 percent this year to 6.7 million liters -lrb- 11.8 million pints -rrb- . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

on thursday she became older than her great-great grandmother , queen victoria - who died aged 81 years , seven months and 29 days .
but who has had the memorable reign ?
and which queen lived through the period of most change ?
historian and former director of the victoria and albert museum sir roy strong and modern royal expert and author penny junor give their verdicts : who will be remembered as the more popular queen ?
penny junor " definitely elizabeth .
the respect she has earned both home and abroad has been unparalleled .
do n't forget , queen victoria went into mourning for months after her husband albert died and virtually disappeared from public view .
she went underground and that was n't popular .
in fact , when she did go out , people stoned her carriage .
eventually her ministers had to virtually force her back into public life .
queen elizabeth , on the other hand , has always understood that the sovereign must be vulnerable - then her people will want to protect her .
so first , she was a pretty and glamorous bride , then she was a young mother and then she was a vulnerable queen . "
queen elizabeth 's legacy will be tolerance : a tolerance for differences and multiculturalism " penny junor and although she has n't been the most exciting monarch , she has remained popular because she has been a rock for the nation .
the rest of the world has changed rapidly - but she remains at the centre of it like a solid reference point . "
sir roy strong " the present queen , unlike queen victoria , has never suffered from the loss of the affection of her people .
victoria went into a bad period after the death of prince albert when she virtually became a recluse , so much so that attacks began to be written along the lines of " what does she do with it ? " - " it " being the taxpayers ' money paying for the monarchy .
the present queen 's response to moments when royal popularity was flagging was to respond to the criticisms with a change of policy .
admittedly this always came later than it should : such as over the royal finances or the opening of buckingham palace - but it did always come .
nothing has been allowed to drift to wholesale public alienation .
the nearest she came to it was over the death of diana princess of wales to which , in the end , she responded , travelling south and giving a memorable broadcast . "
who has lived through the period of most change ?
penny junor " the greatest change has been to people 's attitudes .
the reign of queen victoria was an age of deference , when people largely knew their place and people still respected institutions .
now , all of that is gone : we live in a utilitarian age where everything is questioned and every institution needs to justify itself .
importantly , the media has changed .
the press barons used to be royalists and saw their role as protecting the queen .
now everything is a lot more transparent and the media is now more intrusive than it ever was before .
some of the people who control papers - like rupert murdoch - are in fact republicans and see the monarchy as fair game .
alongside that has been the huge technological change during the reign of elizabeth .
in the 1950s people were just beginning to travel by aeroplane .
the queen 's first visits abroad were aboard a ship .
now we have mass air travel and most people own a computer - something most people had n't even heard of 50 years ago . "
" elizabeth ii is the living epitome of the ideals of public life abandoned in what is an era of public and private decadence devoid of moral structure " sir roy strong sir roy strong " both monarchs lived through centuries of astounding change , but without doubt queen victoria 's reign saw far greater ones than those which occurred under her great-great granddaughter .
there has been nothing , for example , to match the mass migration to the cities and towns from the countryside or the industrialisation which characterised the 19th century .
we only have to think also of the arrival of the railways , the telephone or the motor car at the close of her reign .
most of the 20th century was concerned with working through these new technologies .
in a curious way this may be seen in retrospect as parallel to what has happened under elizabeth ii , the it revolution coming at the close of her reign setting the stage for what is to happen in the 21st century . "
who had the most influence on public life ?
penny junor " i would say queen victoria had more actual political power - but that 's not to say that queen elizabeth has been a mere figurehead .
the prime minister consults with her every week .
i remember sir john major told me she was incredibly important to him - she was the one person he could discuss affairs of state with knowing that she was completely objective .
that 's very important when you are surrounded on all side with people who have agendas of their own .
bear in mind , tony blair was n't even born when queen elizabeth took the throne - she has this incredible wealth of experience to draw upon .

her majesty the queen has become britain 's oldest monarch .
on thursday she became older than her great-great grandmother , queen victoria - who died aged 81 years , seven months and 29 days .
but who has had the memorable reign ?
and which queen lived through the period of most change ?
historian and former director of the victoria and albert museum sir roy strong and modern royal expert and author penny junor give their verdicts : who will be remembered as the more popular queen ?
penny junor definitely elizabeth .
the respect she has earned both home and abroad has been unparalleled .
do n't forget , queen victoria went into mourning for months after her husband albert died and virtually disappeared from public view .
she went underground and that was n't popular .
in fact , when she did go out , people stoned her carriage .
eventually her ministers had to virtually force her back into public life .
queen elizabeth , on the other hand , has always understood that the sovereign must be vulnerable - then her people will want to protect her .
so first , she was a pretty and glamorous bride , then she was a young mother and then she was a vulnerable queen .
queen elizabeth 's legacy will be tolerance : a tolerance for differences and multiculturalism penny junor and although she has n't been the most exciting monarch , she has remained popular because she has been a rock for the nation .
the rest of the world has changed rapidly - but she remains at the centre of it like a solid reference point .
sir roy strong the present queen , unlike queen victoria , has never suffered from the loss of the affection of her people .
victoria went into a bad period after the death of prince albert when she virtually became a recluse , so much so that attacks began to be written along the lines of " what does she do with it ? " - " it " being the taxpayers ' money paying for the monarchy .
the present queen 's response to moments when royal popularity was flagging was to respond to the criticisms with a change of policy .
admittedly this always came later than it should : such as over the royal finances or the opening of buckingham palace - but it did always come .
nothing has been allowed to drift to wholesale public alienation .
the nearest she came to it was over the death of diana princess of wales to which , in the end , she responded , travelling south and giving a memorable broadcast .
who has lived through the period of most change ?
penny junor the greatest change has been to people 's attitudes .
the reign of queen victoria was an age of deference , when people largely knew their place and people still respected institutions .
now , all of that is gone : we live in a utilitarian age where everything is questioned and every institution needs to justify itself .
importantly , the media has changed .
the press barons used to be royalists and saw their role as protecting the queen .
now everything is a lot more transparent and the media is now more intrusive than it ever was before .
some of the people who control papers - like rupert murdoch - are in fact republicans and see the monarchy as fair game .
alongside that has been the huge technological change during the reign of elizabeth .
in the 1950s people were just beginning to travel by aeroplane .
the queen 's first visits abroad were aboard a ship .
now we have mass air travel and most people own a computer - something most people had n't even heard of 50 years ago .
elizabeth ii is the living epitome of the ideals of public life abandoned in what is an era of public and private decadence devoid of moral structure sir roy strong sir roy strong both monarchs lived through centuries of astounding change , but without doubt queen victoria 's reign saw far greater ones than those which occurred under her great-great granddaughter .
there has been nothing , for example , to match the mass migration to the cities and towns from the countryside or the industrialisation which characterised the 19th century .
we only have to think also of the arrival of the railways , the telephone or the motor car at the close of her reign .
most of the 20th century was concerned with working through these new technologies .
in a curious way this may be seen in retrospect as parallel to what has happened under elizabeth ii , the it revolution coming at the close of her reign setting the stage for what is to happen in the 21st century .
who had the most influence on public life ?
penny junor i would say queen victoria had more actual political power - but that 's not to say that queen elizabeth has been a mere figurehead .
the prime minister consults with her every week .
i remember sir john major told me she was incredibly important to him - she was the one person he could discuss affairs of state with knowing that she was completely objective .
that 's very important when you are surrounded on all side with people who have agendas of their own .
bear in mind , tony blair was n't even born when queen elizabeth took the throne - she has this incredible wealth of experience to draw upon .
in terms of royal fashions - that has largely gone away .

admittedly this always came later than it should : such as over the royal finances or the opening of buckingham palace - but it did always come .
nothing has been allowed to drift to wholesale public alienation .
the nearest she came to it was over the death of diana princess of wales to which , in the end , she responded , travelling south and giving a memorable broadcast .
who has lived through the period of most change ?
penny junor the greatest change has been to people 's attitudes .
the reign of queen victoria was an age of deference , when people largely knew their place and people still respected institutions .
now , all of that is gone : we live in a utilitarian age where everything is questioned and every institution needs to justify itself .
importantly , the media has changed .
the press barons used to be royalists and saw their role as protecting the queen .
now everything is a lot more transparent and the media is now more intrusive than it ever was before .
some of the people who control papers - like rupert murdoch - are in fact republicans and see the monarchy as fair game .
alongside that has been the huge technological change during the reign of elizabeth .
in the 1950s people were just beginning to travel by aeroplane .
the queen 's first visits abroad were aboard a ship .
now we have mass air travel and most people own a computer - something most people had n't even heard of 50 years ago .
elizabeth ii is the living epitome of the ideals of public life abandoned in what is an era of public and private decadence devoid of moral structure sir roy strong sir roy strong both monarchs lived through centuries of astounding change , but without doubt queen victoria 's reign saw far greater ones than those which occurred under her great-great granddaughter .
there has been nothing , for example , to match the mass migration to the cities and towns from the countryside or the industrialisation which characterised the 19th century .
we only have to think also of the arrival of the railways , the telephone or the motor car at the close of her reign .
most of the 20th century was concerned with working through these new technologies .
in a curious way this may be seen in retrospect as parallel to what has happened under elizabeth ii , the it revolution coming at the close of her reign setting the stage for what is to happen in the 21st century .
who had the most influence on public life ?
penny junor i would say queen victoria had more actual political power - but that 's not to say that queen elizabeth has been a mere figurehead .
the prime minister consults with her every week .
i remember sir john major told me she was incredibly important to him - she was the one person he could discuss affairs of state with knowing that she was completely objective .
that 's very important when you are surrounded on all side with people who have agendas of their own .
bear in mind , tony blair was n't even born when queen elizabeth took the throne - she has this incredible wealth of experience to draw upon .
in terms of royal fashions - that has largely gone away .
people do n't look to royalty as they did 100 years ago on matters of taste or fashion .
sir roy strong queen victoria was a far greater influence on public life , setting an example of private probity for the monarchy and the royal family which became a model for the burgeoning middle classes of her age .
it was a tradition largely adhered to by her successors including elizabeth ii , only to be eroded by her children .
elizabeth ii , far from being the exemplar of the aspirations of her age , in fact embodies all the attributes which have been gradually discarded or eroded during her reign , ones which include duty , patriotism , faith and respect .
within her period elizabeth ii is the living epitome of the ideals of public life abandoned in what is an era of public and private decadence devoid of moral structure .
who will leave the most lasting legacy ?
penny junor queen elizabeth 's age will be seen as the liberal age , when all old rules were thrown out .
in victoria 's time homosexuality and suicide were crimes , divorce was very much frowned on .
all this was changing when elizabeth became queen .
there have been huge social changes during her reign , and we now live in a much freer society .
you ca n't say she herself has n't been affected by the changes - all her children , apart from edward - have been divorced .
and even edward lived with sophie in the palace before they got married - that would have been absolutely unheard of not long ago .
she also presided over one of the most significant changes to britain - the loss of our empire , and the transition to the commonwealth which has attempted to create peace and understanding across the world .
through all this she has been non-judgemental and a standard-bearer for integration .
i would say her legacy will be that of tolerance : a tolerance for differences and multiculturalism .
sir roy strong queen elizabeth 's legacy - it will surely be that of continuity .
both queens lived through turbulent times , but in the last 50 years we have seen huge social changes in britain - yet the queen has kept the monarchy going , despite everything .
it is quite extraordinary to me that she has kept the same round of events going , year after year - the state opening of parliament and social events like ascot and henley .
essentially she has been following the pattern laid down by her father and grandfather , almost without change .
in doing so she has endowed the nation with a sense of stability through a period of tempestuous change .
we have taken it all for granted - and i think we will not realise how extraordinary she has been until she is gone .

historian and former director of the victoria and albert museum sir roy strong and modern royal expert and author penny junor give their verdicts : who will be remembered as the more popular queen ?
penny junor definitely elizabeth .
the respect she has earned both home and abroad has been unparalleled .

her majesty the queen has become britain 's oldest monarch .
on thursday she became older than her great-great grandmother , queen victoria - who died aged 81 years , seven months and 29 days .
but who has had the memorable reign ?
and which queen lived through the period of most change ?
historian and former director of the victoria and albert museum sir roy strong and modern royal expert and author penny junor give their verdicts : who will be remembered as the more popular queen ?
penny junor definitely elizabeth .
the respect she has earned both home and abroad has been unparalleled .
do n't forget , queen victoria went into mourning for months after her husband albert died and virtually disappeared from public view .
she went underground and that was n't popular .
in fact , when she did go out , people stoned her carriage .
eventually her ministers had to virtually force her back into public life .
queen elizabeth , on the other hand , has always understood that the sovereign must be vulnerable - then her people will want to protect her .
so first , she was a pretty and glamorous bride , then she was a young mother and then she was a vulnerable queen .
queen elizabeth 's legacy will be tolerance : a tolerance for differences and multiculturalism penny junor and although she has n't been the most exciting monarch , she has remained popular because she has been a rock for the nation .
the rest of the world has changed rapidly - but she remains at the centre of it like a solid reference point .
sir roy strong the present queen , unlike queen victoria , has never suffered from the loss of the affection of her people .
victoria went into a bad period after the death of prince albert when she virtually became a recluse , so much so that attacks began to be written along the lines of " what does she do with it ? " - " it " being the taxpayers ' money paying for the monarchy .
the present queen 's response to moments when royal popularity was flagging was to respond to the criticisms with a change of policy .
admittedly this always came later than it should : such as over the royal finances or the opening of buckingham palace - but it did always come .
nothing has been allowed to drift to wholesale public alienation .
the nearest she came to it was over the death of diana princess of wales to which , in the end , she responded , travelling south and giving a memorable broadcast .
who has lived through the period of most change ?
penny junor the greatest change has been to people 's attitudes .
the reign of queen victoria was an age of deference , when people largely knew their place and people still respected institutions .
now , all of that is gone : we live in a utilitarian age where everything is questioned and every institution needs to justify itself .
importantly , the media has changed .
the press barons used to be royalists and saw their role as protecting the queen .
now everything is a lot more transparent and the media is now more intrusive than it ever was before .
some of the people who control papers - like rupert murdoch - are in fact republicans and see the monarchy as fair game .
alongside that has been the huge technological change during the reign of elizabeth .
in the 1950s people were just beginning to travel by aeroplane .
the queen 's first visits abroad were aboard a ship .
now we have mass air travel and most people own a computer - something most people had n't even heard of 50 years ago .
elizabeth ii is the living epitome of the ideals of public life abandoned in what is an era of public and private decadence devoid of moral structure sir roy strong sir roy strong both monarchs lived through centuries of astounding change , but without doubt queen victoria 's reign saw far greater ones than those which occurred under her great-great granddaughter .
there has been nothing , for example , to match the mass migration to the cities and towns from the countryside or the industrialisation which characterised the 19th century .
we only have to think also of the arrival of the railways , the telephone or the motor car at the close of her reign .
most of the 20th century was concerned with working through these new technologies .
in a curious way this may be seen in retrospect as parallel to what has happened under elizabeth ii , the it revolution coming at the close of her reign setting the stage for what is to happen in the 21st century .
who had the most influence on public life ?
penny junor i would say queen victoria had more actual political power - but that 's not to say that queen elizabeth has been a mere figurehead .
the prime minister consults with her every week .
i remember sir john major told me she was incredibly important to him - she was the one person he could discuss affairs of state with knowing that she was completely objective .
that 's very important when you are surrounded on all side with people who have agendas of their own .
bear in mind , tony blair was n't even born when queen elizabeth took the throne - she has this incredible wealth of experience to draw upon .
in terms of royal fashions - that has largely gone away .
people do n't look to royalty as they did 100 years ago on matters of taste or fashion .
sir roy strong queen victoria was a far greater influence on public life , setting an example of private probity for the monarchy and the royal family which became a model for the burgeoning middle classes of her age .
it was a tradition largely adhered to by her successors including elizabeth ii , only to be eroded by her children .
elizabeth ii , far from being the exemplar of the aspirations of her age , in fact embodies all the attributes which have been gradually discarded or eroded during her reign , ones which include duty , patriotism , faith and respect .
within her period elizabeth ii is the living epitome of the ideals of public life abandoned in what is an era of public and private decadence devoid of moral structure .
who will leave the most lasting legacy ?
penny junor queen elizabeth 's age will be seen as the liberal age , when all old rules were thrown out .
in victoria 's time homosexuality and suicide were crimes , divorce was very much frowned on .
all this was changing when elizabeth became queen .
there have been huge social changes during her reign , and we now live in a much freer society .
you ca n't say she herself has n't been affected by the changes - all her children , apart from edward - have been divorced .
and even edward lived with sophie in the palace before they got married - that would have been absolutely unheard of not long ago .
she also presided over one of the most significant changes to britain - the loss of our empire , and the transition to the commonwealth which has attempted to create peace and understanding across the world .
through all this she has been non-judgemental and a standard-bearer for integration .
i would say her legacy will be that of tolerance : a tolerance for differences and multiculturalism .
sir roy strong queen elizabeth 's legacy - it will surely be that of continuity .
both queens lived through turbulent times , but in the last 50 years we have seen huge social changes in britain - yet the queen has kept the monarchy going , despite everything .
it is quite extraordinary to me that she has kept the same round of events going , year after year - the state opening of parliament and social events like ascot and henley .
essentially she has been following the pattern laid down by her father and grandfather , almost without change .
in doing so she has endowed the nation with a sense of stability through a period of tempestuous change .
we have taken it all for granted - and i think we will not realise how extraordinary she has been until she is gone .

her majesty the queen has become britain 's oldest monarch .
on thursday she became older than her great-great grandmother , queen victoria - who died aged 81 years , seven months and 29 days .
but who has had the memorable reign ?
and which queen lived through the period of most change ?
historian and former director of the victoria and albert museum sir roy strong and modern royal expert and author penny junor give their verdicts : who will be remembered as the more popular queen ?
penny junor definitely elizabeth .
the respect she has earned both home and abroad has been unparalleled .
do n't forget , queen victoria went into mourning for months after her husband albert died and virtually disappeared from public view .
she went underground and that was n't popular .
in fact , when she did go out , people stoned her carriage .
eventually her ministers had to virtually force her back into public life .
queen elizabeth , on the other hand , has always understood that the sovereign must be vulnerable - then her people will want to protect her .
so first , she was a pretty and glamorous bride , then she was a young mother and then she was a vulnerable queen .
queen elizabeth 's legacy will be tolerance : a tolerance for differences and multiculturalism penny junor and although she has n't been the most exciting monarch , she has remained popular because she has been a rock for the nation .
the rest of the world has changed rapidly - but she remains at the centre of it like a solid reference point .
sir roy strong the present queen , unlike queen victoria , has never suffered from the loss of the affection of her people .
victoria went into a bad period after the death of prince albert when she virtually became a recluse , so much so that attacks began to be written along the lines of " what does she do with it ? " - " it " being the taxpayers ' money paying for the monarchy .
the present queen 's response to moments when royal popularity was flagging was to respond to the criticisms with a change of policy .
admittedly this always came later than it should : such as over the royal finances or the opening of buckingham palace - but it did always come .
nothing has been allowed to drift to wholesale public alienation .
the nearest she came to it was over the death of diana princess of wales to which , in the end , she responded , travelling south and giving a memorable broadcast .
who has lived through the period of most change ?
penny junor the greatest change has been to people 's attitudes .
the reign of queen victoria was an age of deference , when people largely knew their place and people still respected institutions .
now , all of that is gone : we live in a utilitarian age where everything is questioned and every institution needs to justify itself .
importantly , the media has changed .
the press barons used to be royalists and saw their role as protecting the queen .
now everything is a lot more transparent and the media is now more intrusive than it ever was before .
some of the people who control papers - like rupert murdoch - are in fact republicans and see the monarchy as fair game .
alongside that has been the huge technological change during the reign of elizabeth .
in the 1950s people were just beginning to travel by aeroplane .
the queen 's first visits abroad were aboard a ship .
now we have mass air travel and most people own a computer - something most people had n't even heard of 50 years ago .
elizabeth ii is the living epitome of the ideals of public life abandoned in what is an era of public and private decadence devoid of moral structure sir roy strong sir roy strong both monarchs lived through centuries of astounding change , but without doubt queen victoria 's reign saw far greater ones than those which occurred under her great-great granddaughter .
there has been nothing , for example , to match the mass migration to the cities and towns from the countryside or the industrialisation which characterised the 19th century .
we only have to think also of the arrival of the railways , the telephone or the motor car at the close of her reign .
most of the 20th century was concerned with working through these new technologies .
in a curious way this may be seen in retrospect as parallel to what has happened under elizabeth ii , the it revolution coming at the close of her reign setting the stage for what is to happen in the 21st century .
who had the most influence on public life ?
penny junor i would say queen victoria had more actual political power - but that 's not to say that queen elizabeth has been a mere figurehead .
the prime minister consults with her every week .
i remember sir john major told me she was incredibly important to him - she was the one person he could discuss affairs of state with knowing that she was completely objective .
that 's very important when you are surrounded on all side with people who have agendas of their own .
bear in mind , tony blair was n't even born when queen elizabeth took the throne - she has this incredible wealth of experience to draw upon .
in terms of royal fashions - that has largely gone away .
