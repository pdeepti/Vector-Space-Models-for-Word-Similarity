" strikes do not help anybody " telekom chief rene obermann called on the union thursday to lay aside the strike plans and to return to the negotiating table . " strikes do not help anybody , ' said obermann , who took over the chief executive job last november . but ver.di officials said the strike action could start friday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obermann has a major crisis on his hands " we hope that the telekom management comes to its senses quickly , " said lothar schröder , a member of the ver.di board , announcing the strike . while ver.di strike leader ado wilhelm told dpa-afx there would not be a total collapse of services , he said telekom customers would feel the effects of the strike . the union 's move follows five weeks of so-called warning strikes by telekom employees over the cost-cutting plans . warnings about fierce competition the decision to step up industrial action followed warnings from obermann about the fierce competition facing the bonn-based company and the need for it to reform . indeed , strong growth in the group 's overseas operations and high-speed internet business failed to offset a further slump in its fixed-line customers in germany , with net earnings tumbling 58 percent to 459 million euros -lrb- $ 621 million -rrb- " a cut-throat price war is raging in germany , " obermann told a press conference in bonn thursday .
analysts had expected first-quarter earnings would come in at about 770 million euros . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : telekom employees are in no mood to bargain " we see no alternative to the reforms that have been instituted , and which have been discussed in detail for weeks and months now " said obermann .
" only these measures can ensure the long-term independence of deutsche telekom and secure as many jobs as possible in the company here in germany . " telekom has already undergone a major transformation over the decade since it was listed on the stock exchange in november 1996 , with the group eliminating more than 100,000 jobs . but as part of obermann 's drive to reduce costs , he wants to cut the group 's current german workforce by 32,000 by the end of 2008 . underscoring the intense competition facing telekom in germany , obermann said thursday the group had lost 588,000 fixed-line customers to its rivals during the first three months of the year . in particular , this is a further sign of the competition that has taken shape in germany 's domestic telecoms market since liberalization of europe 's telecommunications industry in 1998 . a rollercoaster ride telekom 's struggle to turn around its domestic german market was in stark contrast to a solid performance of its international operations , which now represents almost 50 percent of its total revenue . telekom 's shareholders have been on a rollercoaster ride since the former state monopoly 's shares were first listed on the share market in november 1996 at a price of 14.32 euros for private investors . after steadily climbing in the wake of their stock exchange debut , the telekom shares rocketed up to 104.90 euros in june 2000 at the height of the so-called new economy boom before skidding down to a record low of 8.14 euros in june 2002 . as thursday 's trading drew to a close , the group 's shares edged up 0.3 percent to 12.69 euros following the release of the first-quarter results and the announcement of the strike . dw staff / dpa -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de powerful unions launch warning strikes with more to come thousands of workers downed tools monday after the ig metall trade union called strikes to step up pressure for wage talks in the electrical , engineering and metalworking sectors .

people are waiting for integrated answers to global crises , he told dw . jakob von uexküll is also the founder of the right livelihood awards , also known as the " alternative nobel prize " and the other economic summit .
the world future council , his latest project , is holding its first meeting in hamburg from may 10 to 13 .
dw-radio : the aim of the world future council is to secure a healthy planet for the benefit of future generations .
how does the council want to achieve this ?
jakob von uexküll : by working very closely with decision-makers to highlight solutions which already exist , to identify and research those which may not be known yet and then make sure they 're implemented .
we have already begun to do this by holding a hearing with parliamentarians and heads of energy committees in nairobi after the un climate conference a few months ago .
as a result , the energy legislation in three african countries is already being improved .
these are very concrete steps based on the fact that we know what needs to be done in many areas but the political will still seems to be lacking .
i felt that , by creating a political organization that specifically speaks up as a strong voice for future generations , we could create this extra will .
during their war of independence , the americans had a slogan that read " no taxation without representation , " and today we are taxing the very lives of future generations , but we are not giving them a say in the matter .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : organizations write up good declarations , but most think too short-term , von uexküll said there have been organizations in the past , for example councils of seers into the future in colonial india , but today - when our influence on the future is longer-term and bigger than ever - we 've lacked such an institution .
how is the world future council different from other international organizations that deal with important global issues ?
a spokes-organization for future generation - this focus has not existed before .
we are not interested in what is supposedly realistic today .
we are interested in what is necessary and we 're working to make that politically realistic .
we are long-term , while existing institutions and commissions are often quite short-term .
they have a short mandate , produce a very good declaration and then expect someone else to implement it - usually the us - and that really has n't worked .
we are also looking at various different issues together .
all the major crises in the world today are integrated , but most of the institutions that exist at the moment are highly specialized , and i think that 's another reason why we 're still not moving ahead as fast as we must .
you 'll be involving democratically elected parliamentarians , as well as over 6,000 ngos , the media and the public .
how will this work in practice ?
with the parliamentarians it 's very concrete .
there is a new electronic network being developed that links all the world 's democratically elected national members of parliament , called the e-parliament initiative .
the hearings in nairobi will be a joint project with e-parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " if we do n't use the sun and wind of today , they 'll be lost forever " as far as civil society goes , we wrote to the 6,000 organizations to get nominations of who they thought would make a credible member of the world future council .
and , of course , the media is crucial to getting the message out .
if we look at climate chaos , for example , this has been a huge market failure , but it 's also been a failure for politics and the media .
people have thought it 's a problem for future generations and suddenly it 's hitting us now .
in australia they 're talking about evacuating whole cities because there 's a lack of water .
i think there 's awareness there , and openness in many of these organizations to work with us .
people are waiting for integrated answers to the crises we are facing .
fighting climate change is one of your top priorities .
what are the first steps your organization is going to take ?
the renewable energy promotion is no doubt the most important thing now .
we can not afford anymore to waste the sun and the wind of today , because we ca n't use them tomorrow .
they 'll be lost forever .
it 's nonsense to say they 're still too expensive .
that 's basically immaterial .
if we have the resources and the workers to install this equipment and the materials to build them , then we have to do it .
we 're focusing on promoting the best legislation to spread renewable energy .
it 's a german law , which has spread to over 40 countries and regions world-wide .
it 's very democratic because you encourage people to do something themselves .
you do n't sit and wait for huge companies that have been part of the problem to suddenly decide to become part of the solution .
would you say that climate change is threatening to overshadow other pressing global problems like fighting aids or reducing poverty ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : climate change worsens other issues like poverty , said von uexküll the problem is not that climate change overshadows them but that it makes them more serious .
you can not solve poverty with ongoing climate chaos .
natural laws override all economic laws and all cultures because they determine the preconditions for our existence .
it is quite clear that all our gains in fighting poverty and hunger are going to disappear very quickly if we ca n't reduce climate chaos and we 're going to find lots of illnesses spreading to parts of the world where they have been defeated or where they 've never been before .
in early june , the g8 countries are going to meet for their annual summit in heiligendamm .
what message do you have for the g8 leaders ?
the lack of political will has , of course , been the problem , so they need an additional push .
again , renewable energy , but also the whole spectrum of legislation to combat climate change is going to be high on the agenda .
we want to remind them that they must integrate the interests of future generations in their decision-making .
" short-termism " has characterized eu and g8 decision-making and eu regulations have been preventing what needs to be done instead of promoting it because economic growth and free trade have been the motto .
i 'm not saying we do n't need growth - we need growth of solar energy , for example - but everything has to be subordinated to these new demands to secure a healthy planet for us and for future generations . barbara gruber interviewed jakob von uexküll -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turning globalization on its head globalization is not just about outsourcing jobs in the west to asia : indian companies are now creating jobs in europe .

we are also looking at various different issues together .
all the major crises in the world today are integrated , but most of the institutions that exist at the moment are highly specialized , and i think that 's another reason why we 're still not moving ahead as fast as we must .
you 'll be involving democratically elected parliamentarians , as well as over 6,000 ngos , the media and the public .
how will this work in practice ?
with the parliamentarians it 's very concrete .
there is a new electronic network being developed that links all the world 's democratically elected national members of parliament , called the e-parliament initiative .
the hearings in nairobi will be a joint project with e-parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " if we do n't use the sun and wind of today , they 'll be lost forever " as far as civil society goes , we wrote to the 6,000 organizations to get nominations of who they thought would make a credible member of the world future council .
and , of course , the media is crucial to getting the message out .
if we look at climate chaos , for example , this has been a huge market failure , but it 's also been a failure for politics and the media .
people have thought it 's a problem for future generations and suddenly it 's hitting us now .
in australia they 're talking about evacuating whole cities because there 's a lack of water .
i think there 's awareness there , and openness in many of these organizations to work with us .
people are waiting for integrated answers to the crises we are facing .
fighting climate change is one of your top priorities .
what are the first steps your organization is going to take ?
the renewable energy promotion is no doubt the most important thing now .
we can not afford anymore to waste the sun and the wind of today , because we ca n't use them tomorrow .
they 'll be lost forever .
it 's nonsense to say they 're still too expensive .
that 's basically immaterial .
if we have the resources and the workers to install this equipment and the materials to build them , then we have to do it .
we 're focusing on promoting the best legislation to spread renewable energy .
it 's a german law , which has spread to over 40 countries and regions world-wide .
it 's very democratic because you encourage people to do something themselves .
you do n't sit and wait for huge companies that have been part of the problem to suddenly decide to become part of the solution .
would you say that climate change is threatening to overshadow other pressing global problems like fighting aids or reducing poverty ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : climate change worsens other issues like poverty , said von uexküll the problem is not that climate change overshadows them but that it makes them more serious .
you can not solve poverty with ongoing climate chaos .
natural laws override all economic laws and all cultures because they determine the preconditions for our existence .
it is quite clear that all our gains in fighting poverty and hunger are going to disappear very quickly if we ca n't reduce climate chaos and we 're going to find lots of illnesses spreading to parts of the world where they have been defeated or where they 've never been before .
in early june , the g8 countries are going to meet for their annual summit in heiligendamm .
what message do you have for the g8 leaders ?
the lack of political will has , of course , been the problem , so they need an additional push .
again , renewable energy , but also the whole spectrum of legislation to combat climate change is going to be high on the agenda .
we want to remind them that they must integrate the interests of future generations in their decision-making .
" short-termism " has characterized eu and g8 decision-making and eu regulations have been preventing what needs to be done instead of promoting it because economic growth and free trade have been the motto .
i 'm not saying we do n't need growth - we need growth of solar energy , for example - but everything has to be subordinated to these new demands to secure a healthy planet for us and for future generations . barbara gruber interviewed jakob von uexküll -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turning globalization on its head globalization is not just about outsourcing jobs in the west to asia : indian companies are now creating jobs in europe .

people are waiting for integrated answers to global crises , he told dw . jakob von uexküll is also the founder of the right livelihood awards , also known as the " alternative nobel prize " and the other economic summit .
the world future council , his latest project , is holding its first meeting in hamburg from may 10 to 13 .
dw-radio : the aim of the world future council is to secure a healthy planet for the benefit of future generations .
how does the council want to achieve this ?
jakob von uexküll : by working very closely with decision-makers to highlight solutions which already exist , to identify and research those which may not be known yet and then make sure they 're implemented .
we have already begun to do this by holding a hearing with parliamentarians and heads of energy committees in nairobi after the un climate conference a few months ago .
as a result , the energy legislation in three african countries is already being improved .
these are very concrete steps based on the fact that we know what needs to be done in many areas but the political will still seems to be lacking .
i felt that , by creating a political organization that specifically speaks up as a strong voice for future generations , we could create this extra will .
during their war of independence , the americans had a slogan that read " no taxation without representation , " and today we are taxing the very lives of future generations , but we are not giving them a say in the matter .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : organizations write up good declarations , but most think too short-term , von uexküll said there have been organizations in the past , for example councils of seers into the future in colonial india , but today - when our influence on the future is longer-term and bigger than ever - we 've lacked such an institution .
how is the world future council different from other international organizations that deal with important global issues ?
a spokes-organization for future generation - this focus has not existed before .
we are not interested in what is supposedly realistic today .
we are interested in what is necessary and we 're working to make that politically realistic .
we are long-term , while existing institutions and commissions are often quite short-term .
they have a short mandate , produce a very good declaration and then expect someone else to implement it - usually the us - and that really has n't worked .

brüstle and others urged lawmakers to give them increased access to the stem cells - cells at an early stage of development , which have the potential to turn into different types of tissue .
but stem-cell research is controversial because the cells are culled from human embryos .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neurobiologist brüstle was one of the first to use stem cells in 2001 , the bundestag passed a law that banned the production of stem cells from human embryos .
they also ruled that research on human stem cells was only allowed if the cells were imported to germany before jan .
1 , 2002 .
restrictive law the law is considered to be one of the most restrictive in the world .
brüstle and 23 of his fellow scientists were in berlin wednesday to appear before the bundestag committee debating the topic .
they urged lawmakers to relax the 2002 cutoff date for imports .
“ what we need is to get rid of the current cutoff date we have in germany .
so we need to have access to all existing cell lines which are available at an international level , " brüstle said .
the newer cell lines are of a better quality and they have no contamination in contrast to the old cell lines , brüstle argued .
and , he noted , " we need access to these cell lines to be competitive at an international level . "
danger of prosecution the solution , according to brüstle , is to use " supernumerary " embryos from fertility clinics - which otherwise would be discarded - for the creation of cell lines and the development of medical therapies .
moreover , if they would n't allow this kind of research in germany , brüstle said legislators should at least limit the law 's geographic reach to germany alone .
currently , german scientists abroad run the risk of being criminally charged at home if they take part in international projects that use recent embryos .
this should not be the case , the scientists argued .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lab mice are easy to come by , but stem cells are not many researchers accuse the german government of inhibiting scientific success .
some believe that stem-cell research holds the key to cures for genetic diseases such as parkinson 's or alzheimer 's , and patents to cures for these diseases could be very lucrative .
jörg hinrich hacker , the vice president of the german research association , noted that there were currently hardly any pre-2002 embryos available to do research on , and that those that were available were culled with outdated methods .
theologist , lawmakers stand steady but frankfurt theology professor hille haker spoke out against changing the law .
nothing had changed in terms of ethics since 2002 , he argued , and added that the state was justified in limiting scientific advancement in favor of moral protection of human embryos .
and german minister for research annette schavan argued that principles - such as the sanctity of human life - come before scientific milestones .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at the heart of the controversy is the sanctity of human life " it has been our firm conviction that human embryos should not be destroyed to get stem cells , " she said .
" and then it is totally clear that we need this cutoff date .
just because other countries have other perceptions , we can not abandon our own german conviction . "
in parliament , only the liberal fdp and the left parties have stood behind the notion of changing the current law on stem-cell research .
useful debate the green party refuses to alter the 2002 date , and the ruling spd and cdu fractions have sent mixed signals .
while research minister schavan has said the government would make no move to abandon the regulation altogether , a postponement of the current cutoff date nonetheless seems probable .
the debate over the cutoff date will show " whether or not we can find new ways to combine the protection of human life with the expectations of scientists , " schavan told zdf television . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu lawmakers move to boost advanced medical therapies eu lawmakers backed planned rules on new types of " advanced " treatment for diseases such as cancer or alzheimer 's , and shot down calls for a blanket ban on medicines developed through stem-cell research .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de science -pipe- 10.05.2007 german scientists plead for more access to stem cells großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german scientists worry they will miss the boat on stem-cell research a group of top german scientists called for lawmakers to relax restrictions on stem-cell research , warning that germany risks losing its status as a leader in research - not to mention lucrative contracts . the group of esteemed german researchers appeared before a parliamentary committee in berlin on wednesday including neurolobiologist oliver brüstle , the first german researcher to apply to import embryonic stem cells , in 2000 .
brüstle and others urged lawmakers to give them increased access to the stem cells - cells at an early stage of development , which have the potential to turn into different types of tissue .
but stem-cell research is controversial because the cells are culled from human embryos .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neurobiologist brüstle was one of the first to use stem cells in 2001 , the bundestag passed a law that banned the production of stem cells from human embryos .
they also ruled that research on human stem cells was only allowed if the cells were imported to germany before jan .
1 , 2002 .
restrictive law the law is considered to be one of the most restrictive in the world .
brüstle and 23 of his fellow scientists were in berlin wednesday to appear before the bundestag committee debating the topic .
they urged lawmakers to relax the 2002 cutoff date for imports .
“ what we need is to get rid of the current cutoff date we have in germany .
so we need to have access to all existing cell lines which are available at an international level , " brüstle said .
the newer cell lines are of a better quality and they have no contamination in contrast to the old cell lines , brüstle argued .
and , he noted , " we need access to these cell lines to be competitive at an international level . "
danger of prosecution the solution , according to brüstle , is to use " supernumerary " embryos from fertility clinics - which otherwise would be discarded - for the creation of cell lines and the development of medical therapies .
moreover , if they would n't allow this kind of research in germany , brüstle said legislators should at least limit the law 's geographic reach to germany alone .
currently , german scientists abroad run the risk of being criminally charged at home if they take part in international projects that use recent embryos .
this should not be the case , the scientists argued .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lab mice are easy to come by , but stem cells are not many researchers accuse the german government of inhibiting scientific success .
some believe that stem-cell research holds the key to cures for genetic diseases such as parkinson 's or alzheimer 's , and patents to cures for these diseases could be very lucrative .
jörg hinrich hacker , the vice president of the german research association , noted that there were currently hardly any pre-2002 embryos available to do research on , and that those that were available were culled with outdated methods .
theologist , lawmakers stand steady but frankfurt theology professor hille haker spoke out against changing the law .
nothing had changed in terms of ethics since 2002 , he argued , and added that the state was justified in limiting scientific advancement in favor of moral protection of human embryos .
and german minister for research annette schavan argued that principles - such as the sanctity of human life - come before scientific milestones .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at the heart of the controversy is the sanctity of human life " it has been our firm conviction that human embryos should not be destroyed to get stem cells , " she said .
" and then it is totally clear that we need this cutoff date .
just because other countries have other perceptions , we can not abandon our own german conviction . "
in parliament , only the liberal fdp and the left parties have stood behind the notion of changing the current law on stem-cell research .
useful debate the green party refuses to alter the 2002 date , and the ruling spd and cdu fractions have sent mixed signals .
while research minister schavan has said the government would make no move to abandon the regulation altogether , a postponement of the current cutoff date nonetheless seems probable .
the debate over the cutoff date will show " whether or not we can find new ways to combine the protection of human life with the expectations of scientists , " schavan told zdf television . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu lawmakers move to boost advanced medical therapies eu lawmakers backed planned rules on new types of " advanced " treatment for diseases such as cancer or alzheimer 's , and shot down calls for a blanket ban on medicines developed through stem-cell research .
-lrb- 29.04.2007 -rrb- controversial decision allows women to donate eggs to science the decision by british fertility regulators to pay women to donate eggs to medical research raises tricky questions about the ethics of compromising women 's health in the pursuit of scientific stardom .
-lrb- 02.03.2007 -rrb- keeping stem cells cold , very cold doing research using stem cells is controversial .
but even before any research can be carried out , the cells have to be stored at extremely cold temperatures .
that 's exactly what one german institute specializes in .
-lrb- 05.11.2005 -rrb- feedback should the cutoff date be dropped and more recent stem cells be allowed into german labs ?

germany had six coal-burning plants among the top-ten most polluting sites in the european union , the wwf survey showed .
and it was tied with britain for having the largest number of dirty electricity plants overall . each country contributed ten plants to the total .
overall , the wwf said , the dirty thirty in seven countries pumped out nearly 400 million tons of carbon dioxide in 2006 .

the top 12 power plants in the overall eu rankings are fuelled by lignite , a low grade " brown coal , " and were mainly first commissioned in the 1960s and 1970s .
however , the number one offending plant , greece 's agios dimitrios , first went into service in the mid-1980s , according to wwf .
the rest were largely coal-fired , although the british power stations at kingsnorth -lrb- 24th -rrb- and eggborough -lrb- 29th -rrb- also use heavy fuel oil or gas , respectively .
more than half of the dirty thirty are run by just four power generation companies : germany 's rwe , swedish firm vattenfall , french group edf and germany 's eon .

germany had six coal-burning plants among the top-ten most polluting sites in the european union , the wwf survey showed .
and it was tied with britain for having the largest number of dirty electricity plants overall . each country contributed ten plants to the total .
overall , the wwf said , the dirty thirty in seven countries pumped out nearly 400 million tons of carbon dioxide in 2006 .
that 's 10 per cent of all eu co2 emissions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only the greeks have dirtier power plants than germany " the facts are clear : the power sector needs to phase out dirty coal as soon as possible , " said stephan singer , head of wwf 's climate and energy unit .
blaming lignite within germany , the dirtiest power station was the rwe-run niederaußem brown-coal plant -lrb- number three on the overall ranking . -rrb-
it , and several others on the german list , is in the industrial state of north-rhinewestphalia .
the top 12 power plants in the overall eu rankings are fuelled by lignite , a low grade " brown coal , " and were mainly first commissioned in the 1960s and 1970s .
however , the number one offending plant , greece 's agios dimitrios , first went into service in the mid-1980s , according to wwf .
the rest were largely coal-fired , although the british power stations at kingsnorth -lrb- 24th -rrb- and eggborough -lrb- 29th -rrb- also use heavy fuel oil or gas , respectively .
more than half of the dirty thirty are run by just four power generation companies : germany 's rwe , swedish firm vattenfall , french group edf and germany 's eon .
calls for eu help " we can not tolerate a power sector where the dirtier get richer , " singer said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an rwe plant in north rhine wesphalia he called on the european union to improve its emissions trading schemes to ensure that only those who clean up their power stations reap a financial benefit .
the wwf report for 2006 ranked plants across the then 25-nation eu according to their efficiency - a calculation based on the number of grams of carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- emitted per kilowatt hour of electricity generated .

" on 27th june , i will tender my resignation from the office of prime minister , " he told labour party supporters in his constituency of sedgefield in northeast england . " i have been prime minister of this country for just over 10 years .
in this job , in the world today , i think that is long enough for me , but more especially for the country .

" speaking at trimdon labour club , where he launched his bid for the labour party leadership in 1994 , he said : " i come back here to sedgefield where my political journey began and where it will end .

consequently , labour 's position in the british political landscape took a battering as voters registered their displeasure . while never publicly admitting as much , labour insiders have been urging blair to step down sooner rather than later in an attempt to salvage what was left of public support . his long-awaited announcement triggered a seven-week process for the election of a successor , most likely to be gordon brown , the chancellor of the exchequer .
blair , who together with brown founded new labour , allegedly promised brown back in 1994 that he would enable him to " share " the premiership at some point in the future .
but such a pledge has never been officially confirmed , and , as blair took the party to three election victories in succession , the impatience of brown supporters grew .

" strikes do not help anybody " telekom chief rene obermann called on the union thursday to lay aside the strike plans and to return to the negotiating table . " strikes do not help anybody , ' said obermann , who took over the chief executive job last november . but ver.di officials said the strike action could start friday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obermann has a major crisis on his hands " we hope that the telekom management comes to its senses quickly , " said lothar schröder , a member of the ver.di board , announcing the strike . while ver.di strike leader ado wilhelm told dpa-afx there would not be a total collapse of services , he said telekom customers would feel the effects of the strike . the union 's move follows five weeks of so-called warning strikes by telekom employees over the cost-cutting plans . warnings about fierce competition the decision to step up industrial action followed warnings from obermann about the fierce competition facing the bonn-based company and the need for it to reform . indeed , strong growth in the group 's overseas operations and high-speed internet business failed to offset a further slump in its fixed-line customers in germany , with net earnings tumbling 58 percent to 459 million euros -lrb- $ 621 million -rrb- " a cut-throat price war is raging in germany , " obermann told a press conference in bonn thursday .
analysts had expected first-quarter earnings would come in at about 770 million euros . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : telekom employees are in no mood to bargain " we see no alternative to the reforms that have been instituted , and which have been discussed in detail for weeks and months now " said obermann .
" only these measures can ensure the long-term independence of deutsche telekom and secure as many jobs as possible in the company here in germany . " telekom has already undergone a major transformation over the decade since it was listed on the stock exchange in november 1996 , with the group eliminating more than 100,000 jobs . but as part of obermann 's drive to reduce costs , he wants to cut the group 's current german workforce by 32,000 by the end of 2008 . underscoring the intense competition facing telekom in germany , obermann said thursday the group had lost 588,000 fixed-line customers to its rivals during the first three months of the year . in particular , this is a further sign of the competition that has taken shape in germany 's domestic telecoms market since liberalization of europe 's telecommunications industry in 1998 . a rollercoaster ride telekom 's struggle to turn around its domestic german market was in stark contrast to a solid performance of its international operations , which now represents almost 50 percent of its total revenue . telekom 's shareholders have been on a rollercoaster ride since the former state monopoly 's shares were first listed on the share market in november 1996 at a price of 14.32 euros for private investors . after steadily climbing in the wake of their stock exchange debut , the telekom shares rocketed up to 104.90 euros in june 2000 at the height of the so-called new economy boom before skidding down to a record low of 8.14 euros in june 2002 . as thursday 's trading drew to a close , the group 's shares edged up 0.3 percent to 12.69 euros following the release of the first-quarter results and the announcement of the strike . dw staff / dpa -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de powerful unions launch warning strikes with more to come thousands of workers downed tools monday after the ig metall trade union called strikes to step up pressure for wage talks in the electrical , engineering and metalworking sectors .

rushed through parliament in four days , they envisage a two-round popular vote to elect the president and call for a once-renewable five-year presidential mandate instead of the current single , seven-year term .
the bill , which has to be approved by outgoing president ahmet necdet sezer to come into force , also calls for parliamentary elections to be held every four years instead of the current five .
president sezer has 15 days to decide if he wants to return the bill to parliament for reconsideration .
if it is voted without any change for a second time , sezer has to either sign it in to law or put it on a referendum .
many expect the staunchly secular sezer - who has often clashed with the ruling justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- - to send the amendments back to parliament .
a total of 376 lawmakers in the 550-seat assembly voted thursday in favour of the amendments in a secret ballot , while one voted against , house speaker bulent arinc said .
akp secure vote but opposition remains the akp has 351 seats and , thanks to the backing of a minor opposition party , garnered more than the required two-thirds majority - or 367 votes - needed for the package to be adopted .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the republican people 's party oppose the amendements the main opposition republican people 's party had opposed the changes on the grounds that parliament should not be making radical changes to the system with a little more than two months to go to legislative elections .
legal experts have warned that the akp 's push for such a major overhaul of the constitution is hasty and could create problems in the functioning of the state .
the akp counters that the amendments are the solution to a damaging political crisis sparked by the presidential election .
the prospect of gul , a former islamist , becoming head of state sparked mass secular protests on the grounds that his election would increase the influence of islam in all fields of life .
opponents say the akp , the moderate offshoot of a now-banned islamist movement , is not truly committed to turkey 's secular system and harbours ambitions to erode the separation of state and religion .
gul at center of secularism storm gul , the sole candidate , formally withdrew wednesday , ending the presidential election process in parliament , which the opposition boycotted .

within hours , the army , which has toppled four governments since 1960 , issued a stiff statement , warning of action to defend the secular system if need be .
the constitutional court later annulled the forum on the grounds that parliament voted without the required quorum of 367 .
lawmakers on sunday held a re-run of the vote , which the opposition again boycotted , once again preventing the akp from establishing the necessary quorum .
the turmoil forced prime minister recep tayyip erdogan to bring legislative elections forward to july 22 from november .
according to two opinion polls published thurday , the akp is still the most popular party , with a wide margin ahead of its rivals .
one survey , published in the weekly magazine tempo , found that 41.3 percent of respondents would vote for the akp if elections were held instantly , while the second , carried by the vatan newspaper , put support for the akp at 29.04 percent .

germany had six coal-burning plants among the top-ten most polluting sites in the european union , the wwf survey showed .
and it was tied with britain for having the largest number of dirty electricity plants overall . each country contributed ten plants to the total .
overall , the wwf said , the dirty thirty in seven countries pumped out nearly 400 million tons of carbon dioxide in 2006 .
that 's 10 per cent of all eu co2 emissions .

rushed through parliament in four days , they envisage a two-round popular vote to elect the president and call for a once-renewable five-year presidential mandate instead of the current single , seven-year term .
the bill , which has to be approved by outgoing president ahmet necdet sezer to come into force , also calls for parliamentary elections to be held every four years instead of the current five .
president sezer has 15 days to decide if he wants to return the bill to parliament for reconsideration .
if it is voted without any change for a second time , sezer has to either sign it in to law or put it on a referendum .
many expect the staunchly secular sezer - who has often clashed with the ruling justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- - to send the amendments back to parliament .
a total of 376 lawmakers in the 550-seat assembly voted thursday in favour of the amendments in a secret ballot , while one voted against , house speaker bulent arinc said .
akp secure vote but opposition remains the akp has 351 seats and , thanks to the backing of a minor opposition party , garnered more than the required two-thirds majority - or 367 votes - needed for the package to be adopted .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the republican people 's party oppose the amendements the main opposition republican people 's party had opposed the changes on the grounds that parliament should not be making radical changes to the system with a little more than two months to go to legislative elections .
legal experts have warned that the akp 's push for such a major overhaul of the constitution is hasty and could create problems in the functioning of the state .
the akp counters that the amendments are the solution to a damaging political crisis sparked by the presidential election .
the prospect of gul , a former islamist , becoming head of state sparked mass secular protests on the grounds that his election would increase the influence of islam in all fields of life .
opponents say the akp , the moderate offshoot of a now-banned islamist movement , is not truly committed to turkey 's secular system and harbours ambitions to erode the separation of state and religion .
gul at center of secularism storm gul , the sole candidate , formally withdrew wednesday , ending the presidential election process in parliament , which the opposition boycotted .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gul and prime minister erdogan try to find an answer in a first round of balloting in parliament on april 27 , gul narrowly missed being elected .
within hours , the army , which has toppled four governments since 1960 , issued a stiff statement , warning of action to defend the secular system if need be .
the constitutional court later annulled the forum on the grounds that parliament voted without the required quorum of 367 .
lawmakers on sunday held a re-run of the vote , which the opposition again boycotted , once again preventing the akp from establishing the necessary quorum .
the turmoil forced prime minister recep tayyip erdogan to bring legislative elections forward to july 22 from november .
according to two opinion polls published thurday , the akp is still the most popular party , with a wide margin ahead of its rivals .
one survey , published in the weekly magazine tempo , found that 41.3 percent of respondents would vote for the akp if elections were held instantly , while the second , carried by the vatan newspaper , put support for the akp at 29.04 percent .
earlier thursday , parliament also adopted a constitutional measure widely seen as aimed at preventing militant kurdish politicians from entering parliament . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkish parliament sets new presidential vote a turkish parliamentary committee set july 22 as the date for snap general elections after prime minister recep tayyip erdogan called for polls to end a simmering crisis over a disputed presidential vote .

brüstle and others urged lawmakers to give them increased access to the stem cells - cells at an early stage of development , which have the potential to turn into different types of tissue .
but stem-cell research is controversial because the cells are culled from human embryos .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neurobiologist brüstle was one of the first to use stem cells in 2001 , the bundestag passed a law that banned the production of stem cells from human embryos .
they also ruled that research on human stem cells was only allowed if the cells were imported to germany before jan .
1 , 2002 .
restrictive law the law is considered to be one of the most restrictive in the world .
brüstle and 23 of his fellow scientists were in berlin wednesday to appear before the bundestag committee debating the topic .
they urged lawmakers to relax the 2002 cutoff date for imports .
“ what we need is to get rid of the current cutoff date we have in germany .
so we need to have access to all existing cell lines which are available at an international level , " brüstle said .
the newer cell lines are of a better quality and they have no contamination in contrast to the old cell lines , brüstle argued .
and , he noted , " we need access to these cell lines to be competitive at an international level . "
danger of prosecution the solution , according to brüstle , is to use " supernumerary " embryos from fertility clinics - which otherwise would be discarded - for the creation of cell lines and the development of medical therapies .
moreover , if they would n't allow this kind of research in germany , brüstle said legislators should at least limit the law 's geographic reach to germany alone .
currently , german scientists abroad run the risk of being criminally charged at home if they take part in international projects that use recent embryos .
this should not be the case , the scientists argued .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lab mice are easy to come by , but stem cells are not many researchers accuse the german government of inhibiting scientific success .
some believe that stem-cell research holds the key to cures for genetic diseases such as parkinson 's or alzheimer 's , and patents to cures for these diseases could be very lucrative .
jörg hinrich hacker , the vice president of the german research association , noted that there were currently hardly any pre-2002 embryos available to do research on , and that those that were available were culled with outdated methods .
theologist , lawmakers stand steady but frankfurt theology professor hille haker spoke out against changing the law .
nothing had changed in terms of ethics since 2002 , he argued , and added that the state was justified in limiting scientific advancement in favor of moral protection of human embryos .
and german minister for research annette schavan argued that principles - such as the sanctity of human life - come before scientific milestones .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at the heart of the controversy is the sanctity of human life " it has been our firm conviction that human embryos should not be destroyed to get stem cells , " she said .
" and then it is totally clear that we need this cutoff date .
just because other countries have other perceptions , we can not abandon our own german conviction . "
in parliament , only the liberal fdp and the left parties have stood behind the notion of changing the current law on stem-cell research .
useful debate the green party refuses to alter the 2002 date , and the ruling spd and cdu fractions have sent mixed signals .
while research minister schavan has said the government would make no move to abandon the regulation altogether , a postponement of the current cutoff date nonetheless seems probable .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de turkey -pipe- 10.05.2007 turkish parliament approves electoral reforms großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the vote for the president will be put in the hands of the people if the reforms become law turkey 's ruling party rushed a package of major constitutional reforms through parliament on thursday as it sought to end weeks of political stalemate over the election of a new president . the amendments were initiated by the islamist-rooted justice and development party after it failed twice to get its presidential candidate , foreign minister abdullah gul , elected in parliamentary votes as the current law requires .
rushed through parliament in four days , they envisage a two-round popular vote to elect the president and call for a once-renewable five-year presidential mandate instead of the current single , seven-year term .
the bill , which has to be approved by outgoing president ahmet necdet sezer to come into force , also calls for parliamentary elections to be held every four years instead of the current five .
president sezer has 15 days to decide if he wants to return the bill to parliament for reconsideration .
if it is voted without any change for a second time , sezer has to either sign it in to law or put it on a referendum .
many expect the staunchly secular sezer - who has often clashed with the ruling justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- - to send the amendments back to parliament .
a total of 376 lawmakers in the 550-seat assembly voted thursday in favour of the amendments in a secret ballot , while one voted against , house speaker bulent arinc said .
akp secure vote but opposition remains the akp has 351 seats and , thanks to the backing of a minor opposition party , garnered more than the required two-thirds majority - or 367 votes - needed for the package to be adopted .

legal experts have warned that the akp 's push for such a major overhaul of the constitution is hasty and could create problems in the functioning of the state .
the akp counters that the amendments are the solution to a damaging political crisis sparked by the presidential election .
the prospect of gul , a former islamist , becoming head of state sparked mass secular protests on the grounds that his election would increase the influence of islam in all fields of life .
opponents say the akp , the moderate offshoot of a now-banned islamist movement , is not truly committed to turkey 's secular system and harbours ambitions to erode the separation of state and religion .

the constitutional court later annulled the forum on the grounds that parliament voted without the required quorum of 367 .
lawmakers on sunday held a re-run of the vote , which the opposition again boycotted , once again preventing the akp from establishing the necessary quorum .
the turmoil forced prime minister recep tayyip erdogan to bring legislative elections forward to july 22 from november .
according to two opinion polls published thurday , the akp is still the most popular party , with a wide margin ahead of its rivals .
one survey , published in the weekly magazine tempo , found that 41.3 percent of respondents would vote for the akp if elections were held instantly , while the second , carried by the vatan newspaper , put support for the akp at 29.04 percent .

rushed through parliament in four days , they envisage a two-round popular vote to elect the president and call for a once-renewable five-year presidential mandate instead of the current single , seven-year term .
the bill , which has to be approved by outgoing president ahmet necdet sezer to come into force , also calls for parliamentary elections to be held every four years instead of the current five .
president sezer has 15 days to decide if he wants to return the bill to parliament for reconsideration .
if it is voted without any change for a second time , sezer has to either sign it in to law or put it on a referendum .
many expect the staunchly secular sezer - who has often clashed with the ruling justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- - to send the amendments back to parliament .
a total of 376 lawmakers in the 550-seat assembly voted thursday in favour of the amendments in a secret ballot , while one voted against , house speaker bulent arinc said .

" strikes do not help anybody " telekom chief rene obermann called on the union thursday to lay aside the strike plans and to return to the negotiating table . " strikes do not help anybody , ' said obermann , who took over the chief executive job last november . but ver.di officials said the strike action could start friday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obermann has a major crisis on his hands " we hope that the telekom management comes to its senses quickly , " said lothar schröder , a member of the ver.di board , announcing the strike . while ver.di strike leader ado wilhelm told dpa-afx there would not be a total collapse of services , he said telekom customers would feel the effects of the strike . the union 's move follows five weeks of so-called warning strikes by telekom employees over the cost-cutting plans . warnings about fierce competition the decision to step up industrial action followed warnings from obermann about the fierce competition facing the bonn-based company and the need for it to reform . indeed , strong growth in the group 's overseas operations and high-speed internet business failed to offset a further slump in its fixed-line customers in germany , with net earnings tumbling 58 percent to 459 million euros -lrb- $ 621 million -rrb- " a cut-throat price war is raging in germany , " obermann told a press conference in bonn thursday .
analysts had expected first-quarter earnings would come in at about 770 million euros . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : telekom employees are in no mood to bargain " we see no alternative to the reforms that have been instituted , and which have been discussed in detail for weeks and months now " said obermann .
" only these measures can ensure the long-term independence of deutsche telekom and secure as many jobs as possible in the company here in germany . " telekom has already undergone a major transformation over the decade since it was listed on the stock exchange in november 1996 , with the group eliminating more than 100,000 jobs . but as part of obermann 's drive to reduce costs , he wants to cut the group 's current german workforce by 32,000 by the end of 2008 . underscoring the intense competition facing telekom in germany , obermann said thursday the group had lost 588,000 fixed-line customers to its rivals during the first three months of the year . in particular , this is a further sign of the competition that has taken shape in germany 's domestic telecoms market since liberalization of europe 's telecommunications industry in 1998 . a rollercoaster ride telekom 's struggle to turn around its domestic german market was in stark contrast to a solid performance of its international operations , which now represents almost 50 percent of its total revenue . telekom 's shareholders have been on a rollercoaster ride since the former state monopoly 's shares were first listed on the share market in november 1996 at a price of 14.32 euros for private investors . after steadily climbing in the wake of their stock exchange debut , the telekom shares rocketed up to 104.90 euros in june 2000 at the height of the so-called new economy boom before skidding down to a record low of 8.14 euros in june 2002 . as thursday 's trading drew to a close , the group 's shares edged up 0.3 percent to 12.69 euros following the release of the first-quarter results and the announcement of the strike . dw staff / dpa -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de powerful unions launch warning strikes with more to come thousands of workers downed tools monday after the ig metall trade union called strikes to step up pressure for wage talks in the electrical , engineering and metalworking sectors .

" telekom has already undergone a major transformation over the decade since it was listed on the stock exchange in november 1996 , with the group eliminating more than 100,000 jobs . but as part of obermann 's drive to reduce costs , he wants to cut the group 's current german workforce by 32,000 by the end of 2008 . underscoring the intense competition facing telekom in germany , obermann said thursday the group had lost 588,000 fixed-line customers to its rivals during the first three months of the year . in particular , this is a further sign of the competition that has taken shape in germany 's domestic telecoms market since liberalization of europe 's telecommunications industry in 1998 . a rollercoaster ride telekom 's struggle to turn around its domestic german market was in stark contrast to a solid performance of its international operations , which now represents almost 50 percent of its total revenue . telekom 's shareholders have been on a rollercoaster ride since the former state monopoly 's shares were first listed on the share market in november 1996 at a price of 14.32 euros for private investors . after steadily climbing in the wake of their stock exchange debut , the telekom shares rocketed up to 104.90 euros in june 2000 at the height of the so-called new economy boom before skidding down to a record low of 8.14 euros in june 2002 . as thursday 's trading drew to a close , the group 's shares edged up 0.3 percent to 12.69 euros following the release of the first-quarter results and the announcement of the strike . dw staff / dpa -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de powerful unions launch warning strikes with more to come thousands of workers downed tools monday after the ig metall trade union called strikes to step up pressure for wage talks in the electrical , engineering and metalworking sectors .

brüstle and others urged lawmakers to give them increased access to the stem cells - cells at an early stage of development , which have the potential to turn into different types of tissue .
but stem-cell research is controversial because the cells are culled from human embryos .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neurobiologist brüstle was one of the first to use stem cells in 2001 , the bundestag passed a law that banned the production of stem cells from human embryos .
they also ruled that research on human stem cells was only allowed if the cells were imported to germany before jan .
1 , 2002 .
restrictive law the law is considered to be one of the most restrictive in the world .
brüstle and 23 of his fellow scientists were in berlin wednesday to appear before the bundestag committee debating the topic .
they urged lawmakers to relax the 2002 cutoff date for imports .
“ what we need is to get rid of the current cutoff date we have in germany .
so we need to have access to all existing cell lines which are available at an international level , " brüstle said .
the newer cell lines are of a better quality and they have no contamination in contrast to the old cell lines , brüstle argued .
and , he noted , " we need access to these cell lines to be competitive at an international level . "
danger of prosecution the solution , according to brüstle , is to use " supernumerary " embryos from fertility clinics - which otherwise would be discarded - for the creation of cell lines and the development of medical therapies .
moreover , if they would n't allow this kind of research in germany , brüstle said legislators should at least limit the law 's geographic reach to germany alone .
currently , german scientists abroad run the risk of being criminally charged at home if they take part in international projects that use recent embryos .
this should not be the case , the scientists argued .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lab mice are easy to come by , but stem cells are not many researchers accuse the german government of inhibiting scientific success .
some believe that stem-cell research holds the key to cures for genetic diseases such as parkinson 's or alzheimer 's , and patents to cures for these diseases could be very lucrative .
jörg hinrich hacker , the vice president of the german research association , noted that there were currently hardly any pre-2002 embryos available to do research on , and that those that were available were culled with outdated methods .
theologist , lawmakers stand steady but frankfurt theology professor hille haker spoke out against changing the law .
nothing had changed in terms of ethics since 2002 , he argued , and added that the state was justified in limiting scientific advancement in favor of moral protection of human embryos .
and german minister for research annette schavan argued that principles - such as the sanctity of human life - come before scientific milestones .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at the heart of the controversy is the sanctity of human life " it has been our firm conviction that human embryos should not be destroyed to get stem cells , " she said .
" and then it is totally clear that we need this cutoff date .
just because other countries have other perceptions , we can not abandon our own german conviction . "
in parliament , only the liberal fdp and the left parties have stood behind the notion of changing the current law on stem-cell research .
useful debate the green party refuses to alter the 2002 date , and the ruling spd and cdu fractions have sent mixed signals .
while research minister schavan has said the government would make no move to abandon the regulation altogether , a postponement of the current cutoff date nonetheless seems probable .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de globalization -pipe- 10.05.2007 " we are taxing the lives of future generations " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : think long-term , von uexküll says jakob von uexküll founded the world future council to provide a voice for future generations on topics like climate change , poverty and fair trade .
people are waiting for integrated answers to global crises , he told dw . jakob von uexküll is also the founder of the right livelihood awards , also known as the " alternative nobel prize " and the other economic summit .
the world future council , his latest project , is holding its first meeting in hamburg from may 10 to 13 .
dw-radio : the aim of the world future council is to secure a healthy planet for the benefit of future generations .
how does the council want to achieve this ?
jakob von uexküll : by working very closely with decision-makers to highlight solutions which already exist , to identify and research those which may not be known yet and then make sure they 're implemented .
we have already begun to do this by holding a hearing with parliamentarians and heads of energy committees in nairobi after the un climate conference a few months ago .
as a result , the energy legislation in three african countries is already being improved .
these are very concrete steps based on the fact that we know what needs to be done in many areas but the political will still seems to be lacking .
i felt that , by creating a political organization that specifically speaks up as a strong voice for future generations , we could create this extra will .
during their war of independence , the americans had a slogan that read " no taxation without representation , " and today we are taxing the very lives of future generations , but we are not giving them a say in the matter .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : organizations write up good declarations , but most think too short-term , von uexküll said there have been organizations in the past , for example councils of seers into the future in colonial india , but today - when our influence on the future is longer-term and bigger than ever - we 've lacked such an institution .
how is the world future council different from other international organizations that deal with important global issues ?
a spokes-organization for future generation - this focus has not existed before .
we are not interested in what is supposedly realistic today .
we are interested in what is necessary and we 're working to make that politically realistic .
we are long-term , while existing institutions and commissions are often quite short-term .
they have a short mandate , produce a very good declaration and then expect someone else to implement it - usually the us - and that really has n't worked .
we are also looking at various different issues together .
all the major crises in the world today are integrated , but most of the institutions that exist at the moment are highly specialized , and i think that 's another reason why we 're still not moving ahead as fast as we must .
you 'll be involving democratically elected parliamentarians , as well as over 6,000 ngos , the media and the public .
how will this work in practice ?
with the parliamentarians it 's very concrete .
there is a new electronic network being developed that links all the world 's democratically elected national members of parliament , called the e-parliament initiative .
the hearings in nairobi will be a joint project with e-parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " if we do n't use the sun and wind of today , they 'll be lost forever " as far as civil society goes , we wrote to the 6,000 organizations to get nominations of who they thought would make a credible member of the world future council .
and , of course , the media is crucial to getting the message out .
if we look at climate chaos , for example , this has been a huge market failure , but it 's also been a failure for politics and the media .
people have thought it 's a problem for future generations and suddenly it 's hitting us now .
in australia they 're talking about evacuating whole cities because there 's a lack of water .
i think there 's awareness there , and openness in many of these organizations to work with us .
people are waiting for integrated answers to the crises we are facing .
fighting climate change is one of your top priorities .
what are the first steps your organization is going to take ?
the renewable energy promotion is no doubt the most important thing now .
we can not afford anymore to waste the sun and the wind of today , because we ca n't use them tomorrow .
they 'll be lost forever .
it 's nonsense to say they 're still too expensive .
that 's basically immaterial .
if we have the resources and the workers to install this equipment and the materials to build them , then we have to do it .
we 're focusing on promoting the best legislation to spread renewable energy .
it 's a german law , which has spread to over 40 countries and regions world-wide .
it 's very democratic because you encourage people to do something themselves .
you do n't sit and wait for huge companies that have been part of the problem to suddenly decide to become part of the solution .
would you say that climate change is threatening to overshadow other pressing global problems like fighting aids or reducing poverty ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : climate change worsens other issues like poverty , said von uexküll the problem is not that climate change overshadows them but that it makes them more serious .
you can not solve poverty with ongoing climate chaos .
natural laws override all economic laws and all cultures because they determine the preconditions for our existence .
it is quite clear that all our gains in fighting poverty and hunger are going to disappear very quickly if we ca n't reduce climate chaos and we 're going to find lots of illnesses spreading to parts of the world where they have been defeated or where they 've never been before .
in early june , the g8 countries are going to meet for their annual summit in heiligendamm .
what message do you have for the g8 leaders ?
the lack of political will has , of course , been the problem , so they need an additional push .
again , renewable energy , but also the whole spectrum of legislation to combat climate change is going to be high on the agenda .
we want to remind them that they must integrate the interests of future generations in their decision-making .
" short-termism " has characterized eu and g8 decision-making and eu regulations have been preventing what needs to be done instead of promoting it because economic growth and free trade have been the motto .
i 'm not saying we do n't need growth - we need growth of solar energy , for example - but everything has to be subordinated to these new demands to secure a healthy planet for us and for future generations . barbara gruber interviewed jakob von uexküll -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turning globalization on its head globalization is not just about outsourcing jobs in the west to asia : indian companies are now creating jobs in europe .

people are waiting for integrated answers to global crises , he told dw . jakob von uexküll is also the founder of the right livelihood awards , also known as the " alternative nobel prize " and the other economic summit .
the world future council , his latest project , is holding its first meeting in hamburg from may 10 to 13 .
dw-radio : the aim of the world future council is to secure a healthy planet for the benefit of future generations .
how does the council want to achieve this ?
jakob von uexküll : by working very closely with decision-makers to highlight solutions which already exist , to identify and research those which may not be known yet and then make sure they 're implemented .
we have already begun to do this by holding a hearing with parliamentarians and heads of energy committees in nairobi after the un climate conference a few months ago .
as a result , the energy legislation in three african countries is already being improved .
these are very concrete steps based on the fact that we know what needs to be done in many areas but the political will still seems to be lacking .
i felt that , by creating a political organization that specifically speaks up as a strong voice for future generations , we could create this extra will .
during their war of independence , the americans had a slogan that read " no taxation without representation , " and today we are taxing the very lives of future generations , but we are not giving them a say in the matter .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : organizations write up good declarations , but most think too short-term , von uexküll said there have been organizations in the past , for example councils of seers into the future in colonial india , but today - when our influence on the future is longer-term and bigger than ever - we 've lacked such an institution .
how is the world future council different from other international organizations that deal with important global issues ?
a spokes-organization for future generation - this focus has not existed before .
we are not interested in what is supposedly realistic today .
we are interested in what is necessary and we 're working to make that politically realistic .
we are long-term , while existing institutions and commissions are often quite short-term .
they have a short mandate , produce a very good declaration and then expect someone else to implement it - usually the us - and that really has n't worked .
we are also looking at various different issues together .
all the major crises in the world today are integrated , but most of the institutions that exist at the moment are highly specialized , and i think that 's another reason why we 're still not moving ahead as fast as we must .
you 'll be involving democratically elected parliamentarians , as well as over 6,000 ngos , the media and the public .
how will this work in practice ?
with the parliamentarians it 's very concrete .
there is a new electronic network being developed that links all the world 's democratically elected national members of parliament , called the e-parliament initiative .
the hearings in nairobi will be a joint project with e-parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " if we do n't use the sun and wind of today , they 'll be lost forever " as far as civil society goes , we wrote to the 6,000 organizations to get nominations of who they thought would make a credible member of the world future council .
and , of course , the media is crucial to getting the message out .
if we look at climate chaos , for example , this has been a huge market failure , but it 's also been a failure for politics and the media .
people have thought it 's a problem for future generations and suddenly it 's hitting us now .
in australia they 're talking about evacuating whole cities because there 's a lack of water .
i think there 's awareness there , and openness in many of these organizations to work with us .
people are waiting for integrated answers to the crises we are facing .
fighting climate change is one of your top priorities .
what are the first steps your organization is going to take ?
the renewable energy promotion is no doubt the most important thing now .
we can not afford anymore to waste the sun and the wind of today , because we ca n't use them tomorrow .
they 'll be lost forever .
it 's nonsense to say they 're still too expensive .
that 's basically immaterial .
if we have the resources and the workers to install this equipment and the materials to build them , then we have to do it .
we 're focusing on promoting the best legislation to spread renewable energy .
it 's a german law , which has spread to over 40 countries and regions world-wide .
it 's very democratic because you encourage people to do something themselves .
you do n't sit and wait for huge companies that have been part of the problem to suddenly decide to become part of the solution .
would you say that climate change is threatening to overshadow other pressing global problems like fighting aids or reducing poverty ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : climate change worsens other issues like poverty , said von uexküll the problem is not that climate change overshadows them but that it makes them more serious .
you can not solve poverty with ongoing climate chaos .
natural laws override all economic laws and all cultures because they determine the preconditions for our existence .
it is quite clear that all our gains in fighting poverty and hunger are going to disappear very quickly if we ca n't reduce climate chaos and we 're going to find lots of illnesses spreading to parts of the world where they have been defeated or where they 've never been before .
in early june , the g8 countries are going to meet for their annual summit in heiligendamm .
what message do you have for the g8 leaders ?
the lack of political will has , of course , been the problem , so they need an additional push .
again , renewable energy , but also the whole spectrum of legislation to combat climate change is going to be high on the agenda .
we want to remind them that they must integrate the interests of future generations in their decision-making .
" short-termism " has characterized eu and g8 decision-making and eu regulations have been preventing what needs to be done instead of promoting it because economic growth and free trade have been the motto .
i 'm not saying we do n't need growth - we need growth of solar energy , for example - but everything has to be subordinated to these new demands to secure a healthy planet for us and for future generations . barbara gruber interviewed jakob von uexküll -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turning globalization on its head globalization is not just about outsourcing jobs in the west to asia : indian companies are now creating jobs in europe .

you 'll be involving democratically elected parliamentarians , as well as over 6,000 ngos , the media and the public .
how will this work in practice ?
with the parliamentarians it 's very concrete .
there is a new electronic network being developed that links all the world 's democratically elected national members of parliament , called the e-parliament initiative .
the hearings in nairobi will be a joint project with e-parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " if we do n't use the sun and wind of today , they 'll be lost forever " as far as civil society goes , we wrote to the 6,000 organizations to get nominations of who they thought would make a credible member of the world future council .
and , of course , the media is crucial to getting the message out .
if we look at climate chaos , for example , this has been a huge market failure , but it 's also been a failure for politics and the media .
people have thought it 's a problem for future generations and suddenly it 's hitting us now .
in australia they 're talking about evacuating whole cities because there 's a lack of water .
i think there 's awareness there , and openness in many of these organizations to work with us .
people are waiting for integrated answers to the crises we are facing .
fighting climate change is one of your top priorities .
what are the first steps your organization is going to take ?
the renewable energy promotion is no doubt the most important thing now .
we can not afford anymore to waste the sun and the wind of today , because we ca n't use them tomorrow .
they 'll be lost forever .
it 's nonsense to say they 're still too expensive .
that 's basically immaterial .
if we have the resources and the workers to install this equipment and the materials to build them , then we have to do it .
we 're focusing on promoting the best legislation to spread renewable energy .
it 's a german law , which has spread to over 40 countries and regions world-wide .
it 's very democratic because you encourage people to do something themselves .
you do n't sit and wait for huge companies that have been part of the problem to suddenly decide to become part of the solution .
would you say that climate change is threatening to overshadow other pressing global problems like fighting aids or reducing poverty ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : climate change worsens other issues like poverty , said von uexküll the problem is not that climate change overshadows them but that it makes them more serious .
you can not solve poverty with ongoing climate chaos .
natural laws override all economic laws and all cultures because they determine the preconditions for our existence .
it is quite clear that all our gains in fighting poverty and hunger are going to disappear very quickly if we ca n't reduce climate chaos and we 're going to find lots of illnesses spreading to parts of the world where they have been defeated or where they 've never been before .
in early june , the g8 countries are going to meet for their annual summit in heiligendamm .
what message do you have for the g8 leaders ?
the lack of political will has , of course , been the problem , so they need an additional push .
again , renewable energy , but also the whole spectrum of legislation to combat climate change is going to be high on the agenda .
we want to remind them that they must integrate the interests of future generations in their decision-making .
" short-termism " has characterized eu and g8 decision-making and eu regulations have been preventing what needs to be done instead of promoting it because economic growth and free trade have been the motto .
i 'm not saying we do n't need growth - we need growth of solar energy , for example - but everything has to be subordinated to these new demands to secure a healthy planet for us and for future generations . barbara gruber interviewed jakob von uexküll -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turning globalization on its head globalization is not just about outsourcing jobs in the west to asia : indian companies are now creating jobs in europe .
-lrb- 25.03.2007 -rrb- climate conference searches for kyoto protocol replacement a un conference on climate change opened in the german city of bonn monday in a bid to tie countries such as the united states and china into a new accord on greenhouse emissions that will replace the kyoto protocol .

" on 27th june , i will tender my resignation from the office of prime minister , " he told labour party supporters in his constituency of sedgefield in northeast england . " i have been prime minister of this country for just over 10 years .
in this job , in the world today , i think that is long enough for me , but more especially for the country .
sometimes the only way you conquer the pull of power is to set it down , " he said . he trumpeted the changes britain has undergone since 1997 , when he took office . that year " was a moment for a new beginning , the sweeping away of all the detritus of the past .

" speaking at trimdon labour club , where he launched his bid for the labour party leadership in 1994 , he said : " i come back here to sedgefield where my political journey began and where it will end .

consequently , labour 's position in the british political landscape took a battering as voters registered their displeasure . while never publicly admitting as much , labour insiders have been urging blair to step down sooner rather than later in an attempt to salvage what was left of public support . his long-awaited announcement triggered a seven-week process for the election of a successor , most likely to be gordon brown , the chancellor of the exchequer .
blair , who together with brown founded new labour , allegedly promised brown back in 1994 that he would enable him to " share " the premiership at some point in the future .
but such a pledge has never been officially confirmed , and , as blair took the party to three election victories in succession , the impatience of brown supporters grew .
under intense pressure from the labour party , blair declared last september that he would step down " within a year . "
earlier thursday , blair informed the cabinet in london of his plans .
at the meeting , brown was said to have praised blair 's " unique leadership . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de turkey -pipe- 10.05.2007 turkish parliament approves electoral reforms großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the vote for the president will be put in the hands of the people if the reforms become law turkey 's ruling party rushed a package of major constitutional reforms through parliament on thursday as it sought to end weeks of political stalemate over the election of a new president . the amendments were initiated by the islamist-rooted justice and development party after it failed twice to get its presidential candidate , foreign minister abdullah gul , elected in parliamentary votes as the current law requires .
rushed through parliament in four days , they envisage a two-round popular vote to elect the president and call for a once-renewable five-year presidential mandate instead of the current single , seven-year term .
the bill , which has to be approved by outgoing president ahmet necdet sezer to come into force , also calls for parliamentary elections to be held every four years instead of the current five .
president sezer has 15 days to decide if he wants to return the bill to parliament for reconsideration .
if it is voted without any change for a second time , sezer has to either sign it in to law or put it on a referendum .
many expect the staunchly secular sezer - who has often clashed with the ruling justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- - to send the amendments back to parliament .
a total of 376 lawmakers in the 550-seat assembly voted thursday in favour of the amendments in a secret ballot , while one voted against , house speaker bulent arinc said .
akp secure vote but opposition remains the akp has 351 seats and , thanks to the backing of a minor opposition party , garnered more than the required two-thirds majority - or 367 votes - needed for the package to be adopted .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the republican people 's party oppose the amendements the main opposition republican people 's party had opposed the changes on the grounds that parliament should not be making radical changes to the system with a little more than two months to go to legislative elections .
legal experts have warned that the akp 's push for such a major overhaul of the constitution is hasty and could create problems in the functioning of the state .
the akp counters that the amendments are the solution to a damaging political crisis sparked by the presidential election .
the prospect of gul , a former islamist , becoming head of state sparked mass secular protests on the grounds that his election would increase the influence of islam in all fields of life .
opponents say the akp , the moderate offshoot of a now-banned islamist movement , is not truly committed to turkey 's secular system and harbours ambitions to erode the separation of state and religion .
gul at center of secularism storm gul , the sole candidate , formally withdrew wednesday , ending the presidential election process in parliament , which the opposition boycotted .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gul and prime minister erdogan try to find an answer in a first round of balloting in parliament on april 27 , gul narrowly missed being elected .
within hours , the army , which has toppled four governments since 1960 , issued a stiff statement , warning of action to defend the secular system if need be .
the constitutional court later annulled the forum on the grounds that parliament voted without the required quorum of 367 .
lawmakers on sunday held a re-run of the vote , which the opposition again boycotted , once again preventing the akp from establishing the necessary quorum .
the turmoil forced prime minister recep tayyip erdogan to bring legislative elections forward to july 22 from november .
according to two opinion polls published thurday , the akp is still the most popular party , with a wide margin ahead of its rivals .
one survey , published in the weekly magazine tempo , found that 41.3 percent of respondents would vote for the akp if elections were held instantly , while the second , carried by the vatan newspaper , put support for the akp at 29.04 percent .
earlier thursday , parliament also adopted a constitutional measure widely seen as aimed at preventing militant kurdish politicians from entering parliament . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkish parliament sets new presidential vote a turkish parliamentary committee set july 22 as the date for snap general elections after prime minister recep tayyip erdogan called for polls to end a simmering crisis over a disputed presidential vote .

with tourism from across the atlantic at a record low , the stakes are high , both economically and for the us image abroad . many european tourists see traveling to the us as more of a hassle than it 's worth these days .
they worry about visa and paperwork issues , fingerprinting , long lines at airport and unfriendly immigration officials , experts say . " there 's a perception out there that it 's tough to get into the united states at the moment .
so people tend to look at what are the other options .
there are plenty of attractive destinations around the world , " said geoffrey lipman , assistant secretary general of the united nation 's world tourism organization , based in madrid , spain . in recent years , europeans have begun to take more trips regionally or satisfy their wanderlust with vacations to africa and asia , figures from the un organization show . passing on a bargain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for some , the security hassles are n't worth it there were 1.5 million fewer european tourists who visited the us in 2006 compared with 2000 .
european tourism continued to slide in recent years with numbers down two percent in 2006 compared with 2005 .
the forecasts for this year look flat as well , according to recent figures from the us department of commerce . all this is not to imply that european tourists are turning their backs on the us altogether .
europe remains an important source of tourism for the us , with one of every two overseas visitors traditionally coming from european countries , amounting to a total of nearly 10 million in 2006 .
the uk , japan , germany and france are the four biggest sources of overseas tourism to the us . the drop in european tourism is surprising considering the us is currently a bargain for europeans , with the euro at $ 1.35 and the british pound at $ 1.99 .
under normal circumstances , the cheap dollar would mean a 10-30 percent increase in european tourism to the us , said rolf freitag , chairman of ipk international , a munich-based consulting firm that specializes in tourism research . " there should have been an explosion , " he said .
" when the dollar is cheap for europeans there is always a boom . " image problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the strong euro does n't seem to be bringing europeans to the us but recent years have been far from normal for tourism .
the 2001 terrorist attacks in new york and washington strained us-european relations , with france and germany voicing strong opposition to the us-led war in iraq .
a majority of europeans view the us unfavorably , angry about foreign policy decisions made by president george bush , studies show . " i think the image of the us , especially because the president has a bad reputation , prevents people from going there , " said rene schwietzke , 34 , who lives in the eastern german city of jena . schwietzke travels regularly to the us since his quality assurance company does business there .
he finds the us to be a great tourism destination and he describes it as laidback , cheap , beautiful and full of friendly people . yet get him talking about security measures , and he describes them as " a big pain " and " really inconvenient . " perception is reality bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us has n't seemed welcoming in recent years tourism experts feel it 's the immigration hassles and not a dislike of president george w. bush that keep europeans from visiting the us . in september , the us tourism industry launched the discover america partnership , a group focused on using tourism to improve the us image abroad .
lobbying political leaders has been the first priority . the us can welcome international tourists without compromising security , said geoff freeman , who heads up the partnership .
freeman has lobbied political leaders to strengthen the visa waiver program , hire more customs officials , and make the country 's busiest airports more welcoming to international travelers . " we do n't believe a long line at an airport means we 're more secure , it means we 're inefficient , " freeman said .
" we do n't think inadequate use of technology makes us more secure , it just makes us less competitive . " more than just money bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : security checks should be made more efficient the us has lost $ 90 billion in potential revenue from international tourism since 2000 simply from not keeping up with the tourism growth rates of the rest of the world , according to figures from the travel industry association of america -lrb- tia . -rrb-
but it 's not just money that is worrisome . " the diplomatic factor of travel is as important as economics , " said roger dow , chief executive officer of the tia .
" in this battle for world opinion and getting to know one another and sharing ideas , there 's nothing better than people traveling . " europeans who visit the us have a more positive view of the country and talk it up to their friends , studies show . freeman agreed : " if we want to win hearts and minds around the world , then travel is the greatest tool we have and unfortunately to date we 're not using it .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de science -pipe- 10.05.2007 german scientists plead for more access to stem cells großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german scientists worry they will miss the boat on stem-cell research a group of top german scientists called for lawmakers to relax restrictions on stem-cell research , warning that germany risks losing its status as a leader in research - not to mention lucrative contracts . the group of esteemed german researchers appeared before a parliamentary committee in berlin on wednesday including neurolobiologist oliver brüstle , the first german researcher to apply to import embryonic stem cells , in 2000 .
brüstle and others urged lawmakers to give them increased access to the stem cells - cells at an early stage of development , which have the potential to turn into different types of tissue .
but stem-cell research is controversial because the cells are culled from human embryos .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neurobiologist brüstle was one of the first to use stem cells in 2001 , the bundestag passed a law that banned the production of stem cells from human embryos .
they also ruled that research on human stem cells was only allowed if the cells were imported to germany before jan .
1 , 2002 .
restrictive law the law is considered to be one of the most restrictive in the world .
brüstle and 23 of his fellow scientists were in berlin wednesday to appear before the bundestag committee debating the topic .
they urged lawmakers to relax the 2002 cutoff date for imports .
“ what we need is to get rid of the current cutoff date we have in germany .
so we need to have access to all existing cell lines which are available at an international level , " brüstle said .
the newer cell lines are of a better quality and they have no contamination in contrast to the old cell lines , brüstle argued .
and , he noted , " we need access to these cell lines to be competitive at an international level . "
danger of prosecution the solution , according to brüstle , is to use " supernumerary " embryos from fertility clinics - which otherwise would be discarded - for the creation of cell lines and the development of medical therapies .
moreover , if they would n't allow this kind of research in germany , brüstle said legislators should at least limit the law 's geographic reach to germany alone .
currently , german scientists abroad run the risk of being criminally charged at home if they take part in international projects that use recent embryos .
this should not be the case , the scientists argued .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lab mice are easy to come by , but stem cells are not many researchers accuse the german government of inhibiting scientific success .
some believe that stem-cell research holds the key to cures for genetic diseases such as parkinson 's or alzheimer 's , and patents to cures for these diseases could be very lucrative .
jörg hinrich hacker , the vice president of the german research association , noted that there were currently hardly any pre-2002 embryos available to do research on , and that those that were available were culled with outdated methods .
theologist , lawmakers stand steady but frankfurt theology professor hille haker spoke out against changing the law .
nothing had changed in terms of ethics since 2002 , he argued , and added that the state was justified in limiting scientific advancement in favor of moral protection of human embryos .
and german minister for research annette schavan argued that principles - such as the sanctity of human life - come before scientific milestones .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at the heart of the controversy is the sanctity of human life " it has been our firm conviction that human embryos should not be destroyed to get stem cells , " she said .
" and then it is totally clear that we need this cutoff date .
just because other countries have other perceptions , we can not abandon our own german conviction . "
in parliament , only the liberal fdp and the left parties have stood behind the notion of changing the current law on stem-cell research .
useful debate the green party refuses to alter the 2002 date , and the ruling spd and cdu fractions have sent mixed signals .
while research minister schavan has said the government would make no move to abandon the regulation altogether , a postponement of the current cutoff date nonetheless seems probable .
the debate over the cutoff date will show " whether or not we can find new ways to combine the protection of human life with the expectations of scientists , " schavan told zdf television . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu lawmakers move to boost advanced medical therapies eu lawmakers backed planned rules on new types of " advanced " treatment for diseases such as cancer or alzheimer 's , and shot down calls for a blanket ban on medicines developed through stem-cell research .

brüstle and others urged lawmakers to give them increased access to the stem cells - cells at an early stage of development , which have the potential to turn into different types of tissue .
but stem-cell research is controversial because the cells are culled from human embryos .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neurobiologist brüstle was one of the first to use stem cells in 2001 , the bundestag passed a law that banned the production of stem cells from human embryos .
they also ruled that research on human stem cells was only allowed if the cells were imported to germany before jan .

restrictive law the law is considered to be one of the most restrictive in the world .
brüstle and 23 of his fellow scientists were in berlin wednesday to appear before the bundestag committee debating the topic .
they urged lawmakers to relax the 2002 cutoff date for imports .
“ what we need is to get rid of the current cutoff date we have in germany .
so we need to have access to all existing cell lines which are available at an international level , " brüstle said .
the newer cell lines are of a better quality and they have no contamination in contrast to the old cell lines , brüstle argued .
and , he noted , " we need access to these cell lines to be competitive at an international level . "
danger of prosecution the solution , according to brüstle , is to use " supernumerary " embryos from fertility clinics - which otherwise would be discarded - for the creation of cell lines and the development of medical therapies .
moreover , if they would n't allow this kind of research in germany , brüstle said legislators should at least limit the law 's geographic reach to germany alone .
currently , german scientists abroad run the risk of being criminally charged at home if they take part in international projects that use recent embryos .
this should not be the case , the scientists argued .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lab mice are easy to come by , but stem cells are not many researchers accuse the german government of inhibiting scientific success .
some believe that stem-cell research holds the key to cures for genetic diseases such as parkinson 's or alzheimer 's , and patents to cures for these diseases could be very lucrative .
jörg hinrich hacker , the vice president of the german research association , noted that there were currently hardly any pre-2002 embryos available to do research on , and that those that were available were culled with outdated methods .

" strikes do not help anybody " telekom chief rene obermann called on the union thursday to lay aside the strike plans and to return to the negotiating table . " strikes do not help anybody , ' said obermann , who took over the chief executive job last november . but ver.di officials said the strike action could start friday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obermann has a major crisis on his hands " we hope that the telekom management comes to its senses quickly , " said lothar schröder , a member of the ver.di board , announcing the strike . while ver.di strike leader ado wilhelm told dpa-afx there would not be a total collapse of services , he said telekom customers would feel the effects of the strike . the union 's move follows five weeks of so-called warning strikes by telekom employees over the cost-cutting plans . warnings about fierce competition the decision to step up industrial action followed warnings from obermann about the fierce competition facing the bonn-based company and the need for it to reform . indeed , strong growth in the group 's overseas operations and high-speed internet business failed to offset a further slump in its fixed-line customers in germany , with net earnings tumbling 58 percent to 459 million euros -lrb- $ 621 million -rrb- " a cut-throat price war is raging in germany , " obermann told a press conference in bonn thursday .
analysts had expected first-quarter earnings would come in at about 770 million euros . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : telekom employees are in no mood to bargain " we see no alternative to the reforms that have been instituted , and which have been discussed in detail for weeks and months now " said obermann .
" only these measures can ensure the long-term independence of deutsche telekom and secure as many jobs as possible in the company here in germany . " telekom has already undergone a major transformation over the decade since it was listed on the stock exchange in november 1996 , with the group eliminating more than 100,000 jobs . but as part of obermann 's drive to reduce costs , he wants to cut the group 's current german workforce by 32,000 by the end of 2008 . underscoring the intense competition facing telekom in germany , obermann said thursday the group had lost 588,000 fixed-line customers to its rivals during the first three months of the year . in particular , this is a further sign of the competition that has taken shape in germany 's domestic telecoms market since liberalization of europe 's telecommunications industry in 1998 . a rollercoaster ride telekom 's struggle to turn around its domestic german market was in stark contrast to a solid performance of its international operations , which now represents almost 50 percent of its total revenue . telekom 's shareholders have been on a rollercoaster ride since the former state monopoly 's shares were first listed on the share market in november 1996 at a price of 14.32 euros for private investors . after steadily climbing in the wake of their stock exchange debut , the telekom shares rocketed up to 104.90 euros in june 2000 at the height of the so-called new economy boom before skidding down to a record low of 8.14 euros in june 2002 . as thursday 's trading drew to a close , the group 's shares edged up 0.3 percent to 12.69 euros following the release of the first-quarter results and the announcement of the strike . dw staff / dpa -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de powerful unions launch warning strikes with more to come thousands of workers downed tools monday after the ig metall trade union called strikes to step up pressure for wage talks in the electrical , engineering and metalworking sectors .

rushed through parliament in four days , they envisage a two-round popular vote to elect the president and call for a once-renewable five-year presidential mandate instead of the current single , seven-year term .
the bill , which has to be approved by outgoing president ahmet necdet sezer to come into force , also calls for parliamentary elections to be held every four years instead of the current five .
president sezer has 15 days to decide if he wants to return the bill to parliament for reconsideration .
if it is voted without any change for a second time , sezer has to either sign it in to law or put it on a referendum .
many expect the staunchly secular sezer - who has often clashed with the ruling justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- - to send the amendments back to parliament .

the akp counters that the amendments are the solution to a damaging political crisis sparked by the presidential election .
the prospect of gul , a former islamist , becoming head of state sparked mass secular protests on the grounds that his election would increase the influence of islam in all fields of life .

one survey , published in the weekly magazine tempo , found that 41.3 percent of respondents would vote for the akp if elections were held instantly , while the second , carried by the vatan newspaper , put support for the akp at 29.04 percent .

when it comes to the name of his unavoidable foray into the literary arena , the best odds are on " in my own words " at 4/1 , making it the favorite title , followed by " hard labour " -lrb- 6/1 -rrb- and " my legacy " -lrb- 8/1 -rrb- .
more outside bets are on the less likely " the blair rich project " , " no cash , no honors ! " and " yo , blair ! “ the last a reference to us president george w. bush remarks at last year 's g8 summit in saint petersburg .
even more risky wagers could be put on other potential titles such as " poodle of power " , " oil 's well that ends well " and " being pm means you never have to say you ’ re sorry " .
a-listers dominate bets on praise-giving bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " what 's your name again ? "
the list of those rushing to praise blair is headed by his old pal george .
w , followed by prime minister john howard of australia , stephen harper of canada and chancellor angela merkel of germany .
longer odds are on iran 's ayatollah ali khamenei and osama bin laden both at a distinctly ungenerous 33/1 .
bookmakers are even offering odds on the color of blair 's tie when he makes the announcement .
unsurprisingly for the red rose party , red is odds on favorite at 2/1 , while there have been a few enquiries into odds for a stars and stripes cravat .
as for what he might do next , a speaking tour of the united states is at 2/1 , followed by publishing his memoirs and journalism .
but there are also odds on him going on tour with ugly rumours , the band he fronted as a long-haired student at oxford university in his undergraduate days .
brits bet that blair will rock on bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " do you know ' i wanna be your dog ' by iggy pop ? "
gamblers might also want to take a few outside bets on blair 's rock band releasing a single by the end of the year .
potential cover versions worth a flutter could be : " golden brown " by the stranglers -lrb- in homage to blair 's most likely successor -rrb- , " maggie may " by rod stewart -lrb- a nod to former pm and blair 's idol margaret thatcher -rrb- or a guitar-driven take on frank sinatra 's " my way . "
for those who really like to speculate , a few pounds may be spread over a few less likely songs such as the clash 's " i 'm so bored with the usa " , " get your filthy hands off my desert " by pink floyd and " jilted john " by jilted john -lrb- with the famous refrain " gordon is a moron " -rrb- .
given the sporty blair 's love of mixing with the general public , the bookies are also taking bets on whether the soon-to-be ex-prime minister will run the london marathon at some point in his retiring years .
however , after showing no interest at all to previous mass gatherings on the streets of the capital , this may also be an outside wager .
tony looking for a new team ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " there could be a position free at bayern if you 're game " there are even odds on him becoming the next coach of his favorite english premiership soccer team , newcastle united , who are currently without a manager after the last incumbent , glenn roeder , resigned earlier this week .
however , rumors circulating in london suggest a safer bet would be on blair taking over from jose mourinho at chelsea , given the pm 's fondness for exiled russian oligarchs and dissidents .
disclaimer : while some of these bets are the original ones announced by bookmaker paddy power , some are those made up by the author and do not reflect real bets or the opinion of deutsche welle as a whole . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de blair announces resignation ; successor to take power in june british prime minister tony blair thursday announced that he will step down after a decade in office , handing over power to a successor on june 27 .

rushed through parliament in four days , they envisage a two-round popular vote to elect the president and call for a once-renewable five-year presidential mandate instead of the current single , seven-year term .
the bill , which has to be approved by outgoing president ahmet necdet sezer to come into force , also calls for parliamentary elections to be held every four years instead of the current five .
president sezer has 15 days to decide if he wants to return the bill to parliament for reconsideration .
if it is voted without any change for a second time , sezer has to either sign it in to law or put it on a referendum .
many expect the staunchly secular sezer - who has often clashed with the ruling justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- - to send the amendments back to parliament .
a total of 376 lawmakers in the 550-seat assembly voted thursday in favour of the amendments in a secret ballot , while one voted against , house speaker bulent arinc said .
akp secure vote but opposition remains the akp has 351 seats and , thanks to the backing of a minor opposition party , garnered more than the required two-thirds majority - or 367 votes - needed for the package to be adopted .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the republican people 's party oppose the amendements the main opposition republican people 's party had opposed the changes on the grounds that parliament should not be making radical changes to the system with a little more than two months to go to legislative elections .
legal experts have warned that the akp 's push for such a major overhaul of the constitution is hasty and could create problems in the functioning of the state .
the akp counters that the amendments are the solution to a damaging political crisis sparked by the presidential election .
the prospect of gul , a former islamist , becoming head of state sparked mass secular protests on the grounds that his election would increase the influence of islam in all fields of life .
opponents say the akp , the moderate offshoot of a now-banned islamist movement , is not truly committed to turkey 's secular system and harbours ambitions to erode the separation of state and religion .
gul at center of secularism storm gul , the sole candidate , formally withdrew wednesday , ending the presidential election process in parliament , which the opposition boycotted .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gul and prime minister erdogan try to find an answer in a first round of balloting in parliament on april 27 , gul narrowly missed being elected .
within hours , the army , which has toppled four governments since 1960 , issued a stiff statement , warning of action to defend the secular system if need be .
the constitutional court later annulled the forum on the grounds that parliament voted without the required quorum of 367 .
lawmakers on sunday held a re-run of the vote , which the opposition again boycotted , once again preventing the akp from establishing the necessary quorum .
the turmoil forced prime minister recep tayyip erdogan to bring legislative elections forward to july 22 from november .
according to two opinion polls published thurday , the akp is still the most popular party , with a wide margin ahead of its rivals .
one survey , published in the weekly magazine tempo , found that 41.3 percent of respondents would vote for the akp if elections were held instantly , while the second , carried by the vatan newspaper , put support for the akp at 29.04 percent .
earlier thursday , parliament also adopted a constitutional measure widely seen as aimed at preventing militant kurdish politicians from entering parliament . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkish parliament sets new presidential vote a turkish parliamentary committee set july 22 as the date for snap general elections after prime minister recep tayyip erdogan called for polls to end a simmering crisis over a disputed presidential vote .

people are waiting for integrated answers to global crises , he told dw . jakob von uexküll is also the founder of the right livelihood awards , also known as the " alternative nobel prize " and the other economic summit .
the world future council , his latest project , is holding its first meeting in hamburg from may 10 to 13 .
dw-radio : the aim of the world future council is to secure a healthy planet for the benefit of future generations .
how does the council want to achieve this ?
jakob von uexküll : by working very closely with decision-makers to highlight solutions which already exist , to identify and research those which may not be known yet and then make sure they 're implemented .
we have already begun to do this by holding a hearing with parliamentarians and heads of energy committees in nairobi after the un climate conference a few months ago .
as a result , the energy legislation in three african countries is already being improved .
these are very concrete steps based on the fact that we know what needs to be done in many areas but the political will still seems to be lacking .
i felt that , by creating a political organization that specifically speaks up as a strong voice for future generations , we could create this extra will .
during their war of independence , the americans had a slogan that read " no taxation without representation , " and today we are taxing the very lives of future generations , but we are not giving them a say in the matter .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : organizations write up good declarations , but most think too short-term , von uexküll said there have been organizations in the past , for example councils of seers into the future in colonial india , but today - when our influence on the future is longer-term and bigger than ever - we 've lacked such an institution .
how is the world future council different from other international organizations that deal with important global issues ?
a spokes-organization for future generation - this focus has not existed before .
we are not interested in what is supposedly realistic today .
we are interested in what is necessary and we 're working to make that politically realistic .
we are long-term , while existing institutions and commissions are often quite short-term .
they have a short mandate , produce a very good declaration and then expect someone else to implement it - usually the us - and that really has n't worked .
we are also looking at various different issues together .
all the major crises in the world today are integrated , but most of the institutions that exist at the moment are highly specialized , and i think that 's another reason why we 're still not moving ahead as fast as we must .
you 'll be involving democratically elected parliamentarians , as well as over 6,000 ngos , the media and the public .
how will this work in practice ?
with the parliamentarians it 's very concrete .
there is a new electronic network being developed that links all the world 's democratically elected national members of parliament , called the e-parliament initiative .
the hearings in nairobi will be a joint project with e-parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " if we do n't use the sun and wind of today , they 'll be lost forever " as far as civil society goes , we wrote to the 6,000 organizations to get nominations of who they thought would make a credible member of the world future council .
and , of course , the media is crucial to getting the message out .
if we look at climate chaos , for example , this has been a huge market failure , but it 's also been a failure for politics and the media .
people have thought it 's a problem for future generations and suddenly it 's hitting us now .
in australia they 're talking about evacuating whole cities because there 's a lack of water .
i think there 's awareness there , and openness in many of these organizations to work with us .
people are waiting for integrated answers to the crises we are facing .
fighting climate change is one of your top priorities .
what are the first steps your organization is going to take ?
the renewable energy promotion is no doubt the most important thing now .
we can not afford anymore to waste the sun and the wind of today , because we ca n't use them tomorrow .
they 'll be lost forever .
it 's nonsense to say they 're still too expensive .
that 's basically immaterial .
if we have the resources and the workers to install this equipment and the materials to build them , then we have to do it .
we 're focusing on promoting the best legislation to spread renewable energy .
it 's a german law , which has spread to over 40 countries and regions world-wide .
it 's very democratic because you encourage people to do something themselves .
you do n't sit and wait for huge companies that have been part of the problem to suddenly decide to become part of the solution .
would you say that climate change is threatening to overshadow other pressing global problems like fighting aids or reducing poverty ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : climate change worsens other issues like poverty , said von uexküll the problem is not that climate change overshadows them but that it makes them more serious .
you can not solve poverty with ongoing climate chaos .
natural laws override all economic laws and all cultures because they determine the preconditions for our existence .
it is quite clear that all our gains in fighting poverty and hunger are going to disappear very quickly if we ca n't reduce climate chaos and we 're going to find lots of illnesses spreading to parts of the world where they have been defeated or where they 've never been before .
in early june , the g8 countries are going to meet for their annual summit in heiligendamm .
what message do you have for the g8 leaders ?
the lack of political will has , of course , been the problem , so they need an additional push .
again , renewable energy , but also the whole spectrum of legislation to combat climate change is going to be high on the agenda .
we want to remind them that they must integrate the interests of future generations in their decision-making .
" short-termism " has characterized eu and g8 decision-making and eu regulations have been preventing what needs to be done instead of promoting it because economic growth and free trade have been the motto .
i 'm not saying we do n't need growth - we need growth of solar energy , for example - but everything has to be subordinated to these new demands to secure a healthy planet for us and for future generations . barbara gruber interviewed jakob von uexküll -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turning globalization on its head globalization is not just about outsourcing jobs in the west to asia : indian companies are now creating jobs in europe .

people are waiting for integrated answers to global crises , he told dw . jakob von uexküll is also the founder of the right livelihood awards , also known as the " alternative nobel prize " and the other economic summit .
the world future council , his latest project , is holding its first meeting in hamburg from may 10 to 13 .
dw-radio : the aim of the world future council is to secure a healthy planet for the benefit of future generations .
how does the council want to achieve this ?
jakob von uexküll : by working very closely with decision-makers to highlight solutions which already exist , to identify and research those which may not be known yet and then make sure they 're implemented .
we have already begun to do this by holding a hearing with parliamentarians and heads of energy committees in nairobi after the un climate conference a few months ago .
as a result , the energy legislation in three african countries is already being improved .
these are very concrete steps based on the fact that we know what needs to be done in many areas but the political will still seems to be lacking .
i felt that , by creating a political organization that specifically speaks up as a strong voice for future generations , we could create this extra will .
during their war of independence , the americans had a slogan that read " no taxation without representation , " and today we are taxing the very lives of future generations , but we are not giving them a say in the matter .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : organizations write up good declarations , but most think too short-term , von uexküll said there have been organizations in the past , for example councils of seers into the future in colonial india , but today - when our influence on the future is longer-term and bigger than ever - we 've lacked such an institution .
how is the world future council different from other international organizations that deal with important global issues ?
a spokes-organization for future generation - this focus has not existed before .
we are not interested in what is supposedly realistic today .
we are interested in what is necessary and we 're working to make that politically realistic .
we are long-term , while existing institutions and commissions are often quite short-term .
they have a short mandate , produce a very good declaration and then expect someone else to implement it - usually the us - and that really has n't worked .
we are also looking at various different issues together .
all the major crises in the world today are integrated , but most of the institutions that exist at the moment are highly specialized , and i think that 's another reason why we 're still not moving ahead as fast as we must .
you 'll be involving democratically elected parliamentarians , as well as over 6,000 ngos , the media and the public .
how will this work in practice ?
with the parliamentarians it 's very concrete .
there is a new electronic network being developed that links all the world 's democratically elected national members of parliament , called the e-parliament initiative .
the hearings in nairobi will be a joint project with e-parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " if we do n't use the sun and wind of today , they 'll be lost forever " as far as civil society goes , we wrote to the 6,000 organizations to get nominations of who they thought would make a credible member of the world future council .
and , of course , the media is crucial to getting the message out .
if we look at climate chaos , for example , this has been a huge market failure , but it 's also been a failure for politics and the media .
people have thought it 's a problem for future generations and suddenly it 's hitting us now .
in australia they 're talking about evacuating whole cities because there 's a lack of water .
i think there 's awareness there , and openness in many of these organizations to work with us .
people are waiting for integrated answers to the crises we are facing .
fighting climate change is one of your top priorities .
what are the first steps your organization is going to take ?
the renewable energy promotion is no doubt the most important thing now .
we can not afford anymore to waste the sun and the wind of today , because we ca n't use them tomorrow .
they 'll be lost forever .
it 's nonsense to say they 're still too expensive .
that 's basically immaterial .
if we have the resources and the workers to install this equipment and the materials to build them , then we have to do it .
we 're focusing on promoting the best legislation to spread renewable energy .
it 's a german law , which has spread to over 40 countries and regions world-wide .
it 's very democratic because you encourage people to do something themselves .
you do n't sit and wait for huge companies that have been part of the problem to suddenly decide to become part of the solution .
would you say that climate change is threatening to overshadow other pressing global problems like fighting aids or reducing poverty ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : climate change worsens other issues like poverty , said von uexküll the problem is not that climate change overshadows them but that it makes them more serious .
you can not solve poverty with ongoing climate chaos .
natural laws override all economic laws and all cultures because they determine the preconditions for our existence .
it is quite clear that all our gains in fighting poverty and hunger are going to disappear very quickly if we ca n't reduce climate chaos and we 're going to find lots of illnesses spreading to parts of the world where they have been defeated or where they 've never been before .

" on 27th june , i will tender my resignation from the office of prime minister , " he told labour party supporters in his constituency of sedgefield in northeast england . " i have been prime minister of this country for just over 10 years .
in this job , in the world today , i think that is long enough for me , but more especially for the country .
sometimes the only way you conquer the pull of power is to set it down , " he said . he trumpeted the changes britain has undergone since 1997 , when he took office . that year " was a moment for a new beginning , the sweeping away of all the detritus of the past .
expectations were so high , too high probably , too high probably for either of us , " he said . " now in 2007 you can easily point to challenges and grievances that fester , but go back to 1997 , think back , no , really think back about your own living standards , then in may 1997 and now . " speaking at trimdon labour club , where he launched his bid for the labour party leadership in 1994 , he said : " i come back here to sedgefield where my political journey began and where it will end . " blair also defended his record in office , saying " i did what i thought was right " during his decade in power .
in particular he defended his decision to stand shoulder to shoulder with the united states in the aftermath of sept .
11 , 2001 , including going to war against iraq in 2003 . announcement signals chance for renewal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair 's legacy will be the future state of iraq despite his best efforts to leave a legacy of social reforms and international climate accords , blair 's time in office will be forever remembered for his decision to involve britain in the deeply unpopular iraq war . many believe his relationship with the british people was irrevocably damaged by the iraq decision and his continued support for us-led adventures .
consequently , labour 's position in the british political landscape took a battering as voters registered their displeasure . while never publicly admitting as much , labour insiders have been urging blair to step down sooner rather than later in an attempt to salvage what was left of public support . his long-awaited announcement triggered a seven-week process for the election of a successor , most likely to be gordon brown , the chancellor of the exchequer .
blair , who together with brown founded new labour , allegedly promised brown back in 1994 that he would enable him to " share " the premiership at some point in the future .
but such a pledge has never been officially confirmed , and , as blair took the party to three election victories in succession , the impatience of brown supporters grew .
under intense pressure from the labour party , blair declared last september that he would step down " within a year . "
earlier thursday , blair informed the cabinet in london of his plans .
at the meeting , brown was said to have praised blair 's " unique leadership . "
campaign for leadership election bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few of blair 's cabinet team are likely to challenge brown the preparations for the internal leadership election to determine his successor are expected to begin almost immediately . in britain , the prime minister is the head of the largest party in parliament and a general election does not have to be called if he or she resigns . under labour party rules , the election process begins when its ruling national executive committee -lrb- nec -rrb- first meets about 72 hours after the leader 's announcement of a resignation and sets a timetable for a campaign . prospective candidates each have to secure the signatures of at least 44 -lrb- 12.5 percent -rrb- of the 353 labour party members of parliament in the lower house of commons to have their name on the ballot paper . after nominations closes , hustings - election meetings in which candidates stake their claim for the post - take place across the country .
all " validly nominated candidates " - even if unchallenged - are expected to attend . brown stands relatively unchallenged bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair could annoint brown as he chosen successor friday at the moment , finance minister gordon brown is the most likely winner , after other potentially strong candidates like environment secretary david miliband and home secretary john reid ruled themselves out in recent weeks . other minor candidates could stand .
former environment minister michael meacher and backbencher john mcdonnell have said they want to challenge brown , although it is unclear if they will be able to garner enough signatures to do so . voting begins after campaigning ends . any fully-paid up member of the labour party or members of its affiliated organizations - such as trades unions and socialist societies - who pay a political subscription to labour can vote . labour had 198,026 individual members as of dec .
31 , 2005 , according to the 2006 nec annual report . the ballot is expected to take about two weeks .
a procedures committee , made up of the labour party general secretary and senior party representatives , including the nec , oversees the election process . the winner must have secured more than 50 percent of the votes of the electoral college , which is split three ways between labour party members , british and european parliament lawmakers and affiliated associations . the process is the same for the deputy leadership post left vacant by deputy prime minister john prescott , who is expected to announce his resignation at the same time as blair . dw staff / afp / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de gordon brown , the next man in number 10 as chancellor of the exchequer , gordon brown has been the second most powerful man in british politics for more than a decade .
he 's now likely to move into number 10 - considerably later than most people expected .
-lrb- 10.05.2007 -rrb- tony blair to resign within the next year tony blair should resign sooner rather than later according to british polls and european public opinion , paving the way for his deputy , gordon brown to succeed as prime minister .

germany had six coal-burning plants among the top-ten most polluting sites in the european union , the wwf survey showed .
and it was tied with britain for having the largest number of dirty electricity plants overall . each country contributed ten plants to the total .
overall , the wwf said , the dirty thirty in seven countries pumped out nearly 400 million tons of carbon dioxide in 2006 .
that 's 10 per cent of all eu co2 emissions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only the greeks have dirtier power plants than germany " the facts are clear : the power sector needs to phase out dirty coal as soon as possible , " said stephan singer , head of wwf 's climate and energy unit .

it , and several others on the german list , is in the industrial state of north-rhinewestphalia .
the top 12 power plants in the overall eu rankings are fuelled by lignite , a low grade " brown coal , " and were mainly first commissioned in the 1960s and 1970s .
however , the number one offending plant , greece 's agios dimitrios , first went into service in the mid-1980s , according to wwf .
the rest were largely coal-fired , although the british power stations at kingsnorth -lrb- 24th -rrb- and eggborough -lrb- 29th -rrb- also use heavy fuel oil or gas , respectively .
more than half of the dirty thirty are run by just four power generation companies : germany 's rwe , swedish firm vattenfall , french group edf and germany 's eon .

rushed through parliament in four days , they envisage a two-round popular vote to elect the president and call for a once-renewable five-year presidential mandate instead of the current single , seven-year term .
the bill , which has to be approved by outgoing president ahmet necdet sezer to come into force , also calls for parliamentary elections to be held every four years instead of the current five .
president sezer has 15 days to decide if he wants to return the bill to parliament for reconsideration .
if it is voted without any change for a second time , sezer has to either sign it in to law or put it on a referendum .
many expect the staunchly secular sezer - who has often clashed with the ruling justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- - to send the amendments back to parliament .
a total of 376 lawmakers in the 550-seat assembly voted thursday in favour of the amendments in a secret ballot , while one voted against , house speaker bulent arinc said .
akp secure vote but opposition remains the akp has 351 seats and , thanks to the backing of a minor opposition party , garnered more than the required two-thirds majority - or 367 votes - needed for the package to be adopted .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the republican people 's party oppose the amendements the main opposition republican people 's party had opposed the changes on the grounds that parliament should not be making radical changes to the system with a little more than two months to go to legislative elections .
legal experts have warned that the akp 's push for such a major overhaul of the constitution is hasty and could create problems in the functioning of the state .
the akp counters that the amendments are the solution to a damaging political crisis sparked by the presidential election .
the prospect of gul , a former islamist , becoming head of state sparked mass secular protests on the grounds that his election would increase the influence of islam in all fields of life .
opponents say the akp , the moderate offshoot of a now-banned islamist movement , is not truly committed to turkey 's secular system and harbours ambitions to erode the separation of state and religion .
gul at center of secularism storm gul , the sole candidate , formally withdrew wednesday , ending the presidential election process in parliament , which the opposition boycotted .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gul and prime minister erdogan try to find an answer in a first round of balloting in parliament on april 27 , gul narrowly missed being elected .
within hours , the army , which has toppled four governments since 1960 , issued a stiff statement , warning of action to defend the secular system if need be .
the constitutional court later annulled the forum on the grounds that parliament voted without the required quorum of 367 .
lawmakers on sunday held a re-run of the vote , which the opposition again boycotted , once again preventing the akp from establishing the necessary quorum .
the turmoil forced prime minister recep tayyip erdogan to bring legislative elections forward to july 22 from november .
according to two opinion polls published thurday , the akp is still the most popular party , with a wide margin ahead of its rivals .
one survey , published in the weekly magazine tempo , found that 41.3 percent of respondents would vote for the akp if elections were held instantly , while the second , carried by the vatan newspaper , put support for the akp at 29.04 percent .

rushed through parliament in four days , they envisage a two-round popular vote to elect the president and call for a once-renewable five-year presidential mandate instead of the current single , seven-year term .
the bill , which has to be approved by outgoing president ahmet necdet sezer to come into force , also calls for parliamentary elections to be held every four years instead of the current five .
president sezer has 15 days to decide if he wants to return the bill to parliament for reconsideration .
if it is voted without any change for a second time , sezer has to either sign it in to law or put it on a referendum .
many expect the staunchly secular sezer - who has often clashed with the ruling justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- - to send the amendments back to parliament .
a total of 376 lawmakers in the 550-seat assembly voted thursday in favour of the amendments in a secret ballot , while one voted against , house speaker bulent arinc said .
akp secure vote but opposition remains the akp has 351 seats and , thanks to the backing of a minor opposition party , garnered more than the required two-thirds majority - or 367 votes - needed for the package to be adopted .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the republican people 's party oppose the amendements the main opposition republican people 's party had opposed the changes on the grounds that parliament should not be making radical changes to the system with a little more than two months to go to legislative elections .
legal experts have warned that the akp 's push for such a major overhaul of the constitution is hasty and could create problems in the functioning of the state .
the akp counters that the amendments are the solution to a damaging political crisis sparked by the presidential election .
the prospect of gul , a former islamist , becoming head of state sparked mass secular protests on the grounds that his election would increase the influence of islam in all fields of life .
opponents say the akp , the moderate offshoot of a now-banned islamist movement , is not truly committed to turkey 's secular system and harbours ambitions to erode the separation of state and religion .
gul at center of secularism storm gul , the sole candidate , formally withdrew wednesday , ending the presidential election process in parliament , which the opposition boycotted .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gul and prime minister erdogan try to find an answer in a first round of balloting in parliament on april 27 , gul narrowly missed being elected .
within hours , the army , which has toppled four governments since 1960 , issued a stiff statement , warning of action to defend the secular system if need be .
the constitutional court later annulled the forum on the grounds that parliament voted without the required quorum of 367 .
lawmakers on sunday held a re-run of the vote , which the opposition again boycotted , once again preventing the akp from establishing the necessary quorum .
the turmoil forced prime minister recep tayyip erdogan to bring legislative elections forward to july 22 from november .
according to two opinion polls published thurday , the akp is still the most popular party , with a wide margin ahead of its rivals .

brüstle and others urged lawmakers to give them increased access to the stem cells - cells at an early stage of development , which have the potential to turn into different types of tissue .
but stem-cell research is controversial because the cells are culled from human embryos .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neurobiologist brüstle was one of the first to use stem cells in 2001 , the bundestag passed a law that banned the production of stem cells from human embryos .
they also ruled that research on human stem cells was only allowed if the cells were imported to germany before jan .
1 , 2002 .
restrictive law the law is considered to be one of the most restrictive in the world .
brüstle and 23 of his fellow scientists were in berlin wednesday to appear before the bundestag committee debating the topic .
they urged lawmakers to relax the 2002 cutoff date for imports .
“ what we need is to get rid of the current cutoff date we have in germany .
so we need to have access to all existing cell lines which are available at an international level , " brüstle said .
the newer cell lines are of a better quality and they have no contamination in contrast to the old cell lines , brüstle argued .
and , he noted , " we need access to these cell lines to be competitive at an international level . "
danger of prosecution the solution , according to brüstle , is to use " supernumerary " embryos from fertility clinics - which otherwise would be discarded - for the creation of cell lines and the development of medical therapies .
moreover , if they would n't allow this kind of research in germany , brüstle said legislators should at least limit the law 's geographic reach to germany alone .
currently , german scientists abroad run the risk of being criminally charged at home if they take part in international projects that use recent embryos .
this should not be the case , the scientists argued .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lab mice are easy to come by , but stem cells are not many researchers accuse the german government of inhibiting scientific success .
some believe that stem-cell research holds the key to cures for genetic diseases such as parkinson 's or alzheimer 's , and patents to cures for these diseases could be very lucrative .
jörg hinrich hacker , the vice president of the german research association , noted that there were currently hardly any pre-2002 embryos available to do research on , and that those that were available were culled with outdated methods .
theologist , lawmakers stand steady but frankfurt theology professor hille haker spoke out against changing the law .
nothing had changed in terms of ethics since 2002 , he argued , and added that the state was justified in limiting scientific advancement in favor of moral protection of human embryos .
and german minister for research annette schavan argued that principles - such as the sanctity of human life - come before scientific milestones .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at the heart of the controversy is the sanctity of human life " it has been our firm conviction that human embryos should not be destroyed to get stem cells , " she said .
" and then it is totally clear that we need this cutoff date .
just because other countries have other perceptions , we can not abandon our own german conviction . "
in parliament , only the liberal fdp and the left parties have stood behind the notion of changing the current law on stem-cell research .
useful debate the green party refuses to alter the 2002 date , and the ruling spd and cdu fractions have sent mixed signals .
while research minister schavan has said the government would make no move to abandon the regulation altogether , a postponement of the current cutoff date nonetheless seems probable .
the debate over the cutoff date will show " whether or not we can find new ways to combine the protection of human life with the expectations of scientists , " schavan told zdf television . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu lawmakers move to boost advanced medical therapies eu lawmakers backed planned rules on new types of " advanced " treatment for diseases such as cancer or alzheimer 's , and shot down calls for a blanket ban on medicines developed through stem-cell research .

brüstle and others urged lawmakers to give them increased access to the stem cells - cells at an early stage of development , which have the potential to turn into different types of tissue .
but stem-cell research is controversial because the cells are culled from human embryos .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neurobiologist brüstle was one of the first to use stem cells in 2001 , the bundestag passed a law that banned the production of stem cells from human embryos .
they also ruled that research on human stem cells was only allowed if the cells were imported to germany before jan .
1 , 2002 .
restrictive law the law is considered to be one of the most restrictive in the world .
brüstle and 23 of his fellow scientists were in berlin wednesday to appear before the bundestag committee debating the topic .
they urged lawmakers to relax the 2002 cutoff date for imports .
“ what we need is to get rid of the current cutoff date we have in germany .
so we need to have access to all existing cell lines which are available at an international level , " brüstle said .
the newer cell lines are of a better quality and they have no contamination in contrast to the old cell lines , brüstle argued .
and , he noted , " we need access to these cell lines to be competitive at an international level . "
danger of prosecution the solution , according to brüstle , is to use " supernumerary " embryos from fertility clinics - which otherwise would be discarded - for the creation of cell lines and the development of medical therapies .
moreover , if they would n't allow this kind of research in germany , brüstle said legislators should at least limit the law 's geographic reach to germany alone .
currently , german scientists abroad run the risk of being criminally charged at home if they take part in international projects that use recent embryos .
this should not be the case , the scientists argued .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lab mice are easy to come by , but stem cells are not many researchers accuse the german government of inhibiting scientific success .
some believe that stem-cell research holds the key to cures for genetic diseases such as parkinson 's or alzheimer 's , and patents to cures for these diseases could be very lucrative .
jörg hinrich hacker , the vice president of the german research association , noted that there were currently hardly any pre-2002 embryos available to do research on , and that those that were available were culled with outdated methods .
theologist , lawmakers stand steady but frankfurt theology professor hille haker spoke out against changing the law .
nothing had changed in terms of ethics since 2002 , he argued , and added that the state was justified in limiting scientific advancement in favor of moral protection of human embryos .
and german minister for research annette schavan argued that principles - such as the sanctity of human life - come before scientific milestones .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at the heart of the controversy is the sanctity of human life " it has been our firm conviction that human embryos should not be destroyed to get stem cells , " she said .
" and then it is totally clear that we need this cutoff date .
just because other countries have other perceptions , we can not abandon our own german conviction . "
in parliament , only the liberal fdp and the left parties have stood behind the notion of changing the current law on stem-cell research .
useful debate the green party refuses to alter the 2002 date , and the ruling spd and cdu fractions have sent mixed signals .
while research minister schavan has said the government would make no move to abandon the regulation altogether , a postponement of the current cutoff date nonetheless seems probable .
the debate over the cutoff date will show " whether or not we can find new ways to combine the protection of human life with the expectations of scientists , " schavan told zdf television . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu lawmakers move to boost advanced medical therapies eu lawmakers backed planned rules on new types of " advanced " treatment for diseases such as cancer or alzheimer 's , and shot down calls for a blanket ban on medicines developed through stem-cell research .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : security and protests at the g8 summit us demonstrators join the g8 protests police prevent protests as g8 summit gets going in germany the demonized face of g8 protests locals live with g8 protests in own backyard globalization -pipe- 10.05.2007 thousands of g8 opponents protest in german cities großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trouble flared up in hamburg over 6,000 protestors across germany took to the streets wednesday night to demonstrate against a series of raids on anti-globalization organizations ahead of the upcoming g8 summit on the baltic coast . over 40 demonstrators were arrested across the country , although protests in most cities , including berlin , cologne , hannover and göttingen , remained largely peaceful .
the one exception was the northern city of hamburg , where police resorted to water canons and truncheons in clashes with some 2,000 activists demonstrating in the district of st. pauli .
the police were retaliating against demonstrators outside a local culture center who were throwing bottles and stones .
the trouble had died down by midnight , with hamburg police reporting that a total of 26 protestors had been arrested , and four people injured .
" three police officers and one passerby were hurt , " said a police spokesperson early on thursday morning .
complaints from the left bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angry words from claudia roth the raids also triggered outrage among politicians , with one complaint coming from claudia roth , co-head of the opposition green party .
" -lrb- these raids -rrb- are inappropriate , arbitrary and undifferentiated , " she said in berlin wednesday .
she also described the swoop as a blatant attempt to intimidate and criminalize opponents of the summit .
the social democrats ' youth wing , jusos , was similarly adamant that the raids were an overreaction , while the left party accused the government of encouraging " a climate of escalation . "
anti-g8 group " gipfelsoli , " meanwhile , referred to a " wave of repression " designed to undermine the movement 's communication structures .

people are waiting for integrated answers to global crises , he told dw . jakob von uexküll is also the founder of the right livelihood awards , also known as the " alternative nobel prize " and the other economic summit .
the world future council , his latest project , is holding its first meeting in hamburg from may 10 to 13 .
dw-radio : the aim of the world future council is to secure a healthy planet for the benefit of future generations .
how does the council want to achieve this ?
jakob von uexküll : by working very closely with decision-makers to highlight solutions which already exist , to identify and research those which may not be known yet and then make sure they 're implemented .
we have already begun to do this by holding a hearing with parliamentarians and heads of energy committees in nairobi after the un climate conference a few months ago .
as a result , the energy legislation in three african countries is already being improved .
these are very concrete steps based on the fact that we know what needs to be done in many areas but the political will still seems to be lacking .
i felt that , by creating a political organization that specifically speaks up as a strong voice for future generations , we could create this extra will .
during their war of independence , the americans had a slogan that read " no taxation without representation , " and today we are taxing the very lives of future generations , but we are not giving them a say in the matter .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : organizations write up good declarations , but most think too short-term , von uexküll said there have been organizations in the past , for example councils of seers into the future in colonial india , but today - when our influence on the future is longer-term and bigger than ever - we 've lacked such an institution .
how is the world future council different from other international organizations that deal with important global issues ?
a spokes-organization for future generation - this focus has not existed before .
we are not interested in what is supposedly realistic today .
we are interested in what is necessary and we 're working to make that politically realistic .
we are long-term , while existing institutions and commissions are often quite short-term .
they have a short mandate , produce a very good declaration and then expect someone else to implement it - usually the us - and that really has n't worked .
we are also looking at various different issues together .
all the major crises in the world today are integrated , but most of the institutions that exist at the moment are highly specialized , and i think that 's another reason why we 're still not moving ahead as fast as we must .
you 'll be involving democratically elected parliamentarians , as well as over 6,000 ngos , the media and the public .
how will this work in practice ?
with the parliamentarians it 's very concrete .
there is a new electronic network being developed that links all the world 's democratically elected national members of parliament , called the e-parliament initiative .
the hearings in nairobi will be a joint project with e-parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " if we do n't use the sun and wind of today , they 'll be lost forever " as far as civil society goes , we wrote to the 6,000 organizations to get nominations of who they thought would make a credible member of the world future council .
and , of course , the media is crucial to getting the message out .
if we look at climate chaos , for example , this has been a huge market failure , but it 's also been a failure for politics and the media .
people have thought it 's a problem for future generations and suddenly it 's hitting us now .
in australia they 're talking about evacuating whole cities because there 's a lack of water .
i think there 's awareness there , and openness in many of these organizations to work with us .
people are waiting for integrated answers to the crises we are facing .
fighting climate change is one of your top priorities .
what are the first steps your organization is going to take ?
the renewable energy promotion is no doubt the most important thing now .
we can not afford anymore to waste the sun and the wind of today , because we ca n't use them tomorrow .
they 'll be lost forever .
it 's nonsense to say they 're still too expensive .
that 's basically immaterial .
if we have the resources and the workers to install this equipment and the materials to build them , then we have to do it .
we 're focusing on promoting the best legislation to spread renewable energy .
it 's a german law , which has spread to over 40 countries and regions world-wide .
it 's very democratic because you encourage people to do something themselves .
you do n't sit and wait for huge companies that have been part of the problem to suddenly decide to become part of the solution .
would you say that climate change is threatening to overshadow other pressing global problems like fighting aids or reducing poverty ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : climate change worsens other issues like poverty , said von uexküll the problem is not that climate change overshadows them but that it makes them more serious .
you can not solve poverty with ongoing climate chaos .
natural laws override all economic laws and all cultures because they determine the preconditions for our existence .
it is quite clear that all our gains in fighting poverty and hunger are going to disappear very quickly if we ca n't reduce climate chaos and we 're going to find lots of illnesses spreading to parts of the world where they have been defeated or where they 've never been before .
in early june , the g8 countries are going to meet for their annual summit in heiligendamm .
what message do you have for the g8 leaders ?
the lack of political will has , of course , been the problem , so they need an additional push .
again , renewable energy , but also the whole spectrum of legislation to combat climate change is going to be high on the agenda .
we want to remind them that they must integrate the interests of future generations in their decision-making .
" short-termism " has characterized eu and g8 decision-making and eu regulations have been preventing what needs to be done instead of promoting it because economic growth and free trade have been the motto .
i 'm not saying we do n't need growth - we need growth of solar energy , for example - but everything has to be subordinated to these new demands to secure a healthy planet for us and for future generations . barbara gruber interviewed jakob von uexküll -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turning globalization on its head globalization is not just about outsourcing jobs in the west to asia : indian companies are now creating jobs in europe .

people are waiting for integrated answers to global crises , he told dw . jakob von uexküll is also the founder of the right livelihood awards , also known as the " alternative nobel prize " and the other economic summit .
the world future council , his latest project , is holding its first meeting in hamburg from may 10 to 13 .
dw-radio : the aim of the world future council is to secure a healthy planet for the benefit of future generations .
how does the council want to achieve this ?
jakob von uexküll : by working very closely with decision-makers to highlight solutions which already exist , to identify and research those which may not be known yet and then make sure they 're implemented .
we have already begun to do this by holding a hearing with parliamentarians and heads of energy committees in nairobi after the un climate conference a few months ago .
as a result , the energy legislation in three african countries is already being improved .
these are very concrete steps based on the fact that we know what needs to be done in many areas but the political will still seems to be lacking .
i felt that , by creating a political organization that specifically speaks up as a strong voice for future generations , we could create this extra will .
during their war of independence , the americans had a slogan that read " no taxation without representation , " and today we are taxing the very lives of future generations , but we are not giving them a say in the matter .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : organizations write up good declarations , but most think too short-term , von uexküll said there have been organizations in the past , for example councils of seers into the future in colonial india , but today - when our influence on the future is longer-term and bigger than ever - we 've lacked such an institution .
how is the world future council different from other international organizations that deal with important global issues ?
a spokes-organization for future generation - this focus has not existed before .
we are not interested in what is supposedly realistic today .
we are interested in what is necessary and we 're working to make that politically realistic .
we are long-term , while existing institutions and commissions are often quite short-term .
they have a short mandate , produce a very good declaration and then expect someone else to implement it - usually the us - and that really has n't worked .
we are also looking at various different issues together .
all the major crises in the world today are integrated , but most of the institutions that exist at the moment are highly specialized , and i think that 's another reason why we 're still not moving ahead as fast as we must .
you 'll be involving democratically elected parliamentarians , as well as over 6,000 ngos , the media and the public .
how will this work in practice ?
with the parliamentarians it 's very concrete .
there is a new electronic network being developed that links all the world 's democratically elected national members of parliament , called the e-parliament initiative .
the hearings in nairobi will be a joint project with e-parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " if we do n't use the sun and wind of today , they 'll be lost forever " as far as civil society goes , we wrote to the 6,000 organizations to get nominations of who they thought would make a credible member of the world future council .
and , of course , the media is crucial to getting the message out .
if we look at climate chaos , for example , this has been a huge market failure , but it 's also been a failure for politics and the media .
people have thought it 's a problem for future generations and suddenly it 's hitting us now .
in australia they 're talking about evacuating whole cities because there 's a lack of water .
i think there 's awareness there , and openness in many of these organizations to work with us .
people are waiting for integrated answers to the crises we are facing .
fighting climate change is one of your top priorities .
what are the first steps your organization is going to take ?
the renewable energy promotion is no doubt the most important thing now .
we can not afford anymore to waste the sun and the wind of today , because we ca n't use them tomorrow .
they 'll be lost forever .
it 's nonsense to say they 're still too expensive .
that 's basically immaterial .
if we have the resources and the workers to install this equipment and the materials to build them , then we have to do it .
we 're focusing on promoting the best legislation to spread renewable energy .
it 's a german law , which has spread to over 40 countries and regions world-wide .
it 's very democratic because you encourage people to do something themselves .
you do n't sit and wait for huge companies that have been part of the problem to suddenly decide to become part of the solution .
would you say that climate change is threatening to overshadow other pressing global problems like fighting aids or reducing poverty ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : climate change worsens other issues like poverty , said von uexküll the problem is not that climate change overshadows them but that it makes them more serious .
you can not solve poverty with ongoing climate chaos .
natural laws override all economic laws and all cultures because they determine the preconditions for our existence .
it is quite clear that all our gains in fighting poverty and hunger are going to disappear very quickly if we ca n't reduce climate chaos and we 're going to find lots of illnesses spreading to parts of the world where they have been defeated or where they 've never been before .
in early june , the g8 countries are going to meet for their annual summit in heiligendamm .
what message do you have for the g8 leaders ?
the lack of political will has , of course , been the problem , so they need an additional push .
again , renewable energy , but also the whole spectrum of legislation to combat climate change is going to be high on the agenda .
we want to remind them that they must integrate the interests of future generations in their decision-making .
" short-termism " has characterized eu and g8 decision-making and eu regulations have been preventing what needs to be done instead of promoting it because economic growth and free trade have been the motto .

how does the council want to achieve this ?
jakob von uexküll : by working very closely with decision-makers to highlight solutions which already exist , to identify and research those which may not be known yet and then make sure they 're implemented .
we have already begun to do this by holding a hearing with parliamentarians and heads of energy committees in nairobi after the un climate conference a few months ago .
as a result , the energy legislation in three african countries is already being improved .
these are very concrete steps based on the fact that we know what needs to be done in many areas but the political will still seems to be lacking .
i felt that , by creating a political organization that specifically speaks up as a strong voice for future generations , we could create this extra will .
during their war of independence , the americans had a slogan that read " no taxation without representation , " and today we are taxing the very lives of future generations , but we are not giving them a say in the matter .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : organizations write up good declarations , but most think too short-term , von uexküll said there have been organizations in the past , for example councils of seers into the future in colonial india , but today - when our influence on the future is longer-term and bigger than ever - we 've lacked such an institution .
how is the world future council different from other international organizations that deal with important global issues ?
a spokes-organization for future generation - this focus has not existed before .
we are not interested in what is supposedly realistic today .
we are interested in what is necessary and we 're working to make that politically realistic .
we are long-term , while existing institutions and commissions are often quite short-term .
they have a short mandate , produce a very good declaration and then expect someone else to implement it - usually the us - and that really has n't worked .
we are also looking at various different issues together .
all the major crises in the world today are integrated , but most of the institutions that exist at the moment are highly specialized , and i think that 's another reason why we 're still not moving ahead as fast as we must .
you 'll be involving democratically elected parliamentarians , as well as over 6,000 ngos , the media and the public .
how will this work in practice ?
with the parliamentarians it 's very concrete .
there is a new electronic network being developed that links all the world 's democratically elected national members of parliament , called the e-parliament initiative .
the hearings in nairobi will be a joint project with e-parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " if we do n't use the sun and wind of today , they 'll be lost forever " as far as civil society goes , we wrote to the 6,000 organizations to get nominations of who they thought would make a credible member of the world future council .
and , of course , the media is crucial to getting the message out .
if we look at climate chaos , for example , this has been a huge market failure , but it 's also been a failure for politics and the media .
people have thought it 's a problem for future generations and suddenly it 's hitting us now .
in australia they 're talking about evacuating whole cities because there 's a lack of water .
i think there 's awareness there , and openness in many of these organizations to work with us .
people are waiting for integrated answers to the crises we are facing .
fighting climate change is one of your top priorities .
what are the first steps your organization is going to take ?
the renewable energy promotion is no doubt the most important thing now .
we can not afford anymore to waste the sun and the wind of today , because we ca n't use them tomorrow .
they 'll be lost forever .
it 's nonsense to say they 're still too expensive .
that 's basically immaterial .
if we have the resources and the workers to install this equipment and the materials to build them , then we have to do it .
we 're focusing on promoting the best legislation to spread renewable energy .
it 's a german law , which has spread to over 40 countries and regions world-wide .
it 's very democratic because you encourage people to do something themselves .
you do n't sit and wait for huge companies that have been part of the problem to suddenly decide to become part of the solution .
would you say that climate change is threatening to overshadow other pressing global problems like fighting aids or reducing poverty ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : climate change worsens other issues like poverty , said von uexküll the problem is not that climate change overshadows them but that it makes them more serious .
you can not solve poverty with ongoing climate chaos .
natural laws override all economic laws and all cultures because they determine the preconditions for our existence .
it is quite clear that all our gains in fighting poverty and hunger are going to disappear very quickly if we ca n't reduce climate chaos and we 're going to find lots of illnesses spreading to parts of the world where they have been defeated or where they 've never been before .
in early june , the g8 countries are going to meet for their annual summit in heiligendamm .
what message do you have for the g8 leaders ?
the lack of political will has , of course , been the problem , so they need an additional push .
again , renewable energy , but also the whole spectrum of legislation to combat climate change is going to be high on the agenda .
we want to remind them that they must integrate the interests of future generations in their decision-making .
" short-termism " has characterized eu and g8 decision-making and eu regulations have been preventing what needs to be done instead of promoting it because economic growth and free trade have been the motto .
i 'm not saying we do n't need growth - we need growth of solar energy , for example - but everything has to be subordinated to these new demands to secure a healthy planet for us and for future generations . barbara gruber interviewed jakob von uexküll -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turning globalization on its head globalization is not just about outsourcing jobs in the west to asia : indian companies are now creating jobs in europe .

the one exception was the northern city of hamburg , where police resorted to water canons and truncheons in clashes with some 2,000 activists demonstrating in the district of st. pauli .
the police were retaliating against demonstrators outside a local culture center who were throwing bottles and stones .
the trouble had died down by midnight , with hamburg police reporting that a total of 26 protestors had been arrested , and four people injured .
" three police officers and one passerby were hurt , " said a police spokesperson early on thursday morning .
complaints from the left bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angry words from claudia roth the raids also triggered outrage among politicians , with one complaint coming from claudia roth , co-head of the opposition green party .
" -lrb- these raids -rrb- are inappropriate , arbitrary and undifferentiated , " she said in berlin wednesday .
she also described the swoop as a blatant attempt to intimidate and criminalize opponents of the summit .
the social democrats ' youth wing , jusos , was similarly adamant that the raids were an overreaction , while the left party accused the government of encouraging " a climate of escalation . "
anti-g8 group " gipfelsoli , " meanwhile , referred to a " wave of repression " designed to undermine the movement 's communication structures .
agreement came from christoph kliesing , a lawyer who represents left-wing groups .
" in my opinion the goal of the searches is to gain information about potential g8 summit actions and perhaps to scare those people who want to take part in the protests , " he told a news conference in berlin wednesday .

the same day , interior minister wolfgang schäuble said he would be tightening border controls in measures similar to those taken during last summer 's world cup tournament to prevent an influx of soccer hooligans .

bookmakers are even offering odds on the color of blair 's tie when he makes the announcement .
unsurprisingly for the red rose party , red is odds on favorite at 2/1 , while there have been a few enquiries into odds for a stars and stripes cravat .

given the sporty blair 's love of mixing with the general public , the bookies are also taking bets on whether the soon-to-be ex-prime minister will run the london marathon at some point in his retiring years .

when it comes to the name of his unavoidable foray into the literary arena , the best odds are on " in my own words " at 4/1 , making it the favorite title , followed by " hard labour " -lrb- 6/1 -rrb- and " my legacy " -lrb- 8/1 -rrb- .
more outside bets are on the less likely " the blair rich project " , " no cash , no honors ! " and " yo , blair ! “ the last a reference to us president george w. bush remarks at last year 's g8 summit in saint petersburg .
even more risky wagers could be put on other potential titles such as " poodle of power " , " oil 's well that ends well " and " being pm means you never have to say you ’ re sorry " .
a-listers dominate bets on praise-giving bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " what 's your name again ? "
the list of those rushing to praise blair is headed by his old pal george .
w , followed by prime minister john howard of australia , stephen harper of canada and chancellor angela merkel of germany .
longer odds are on iran 's ayatollah ali khamenei and osama bin laden both at a distinctly ungenerous 33/1 .
bookmakers are even offering odds on the color of blair 's tie when he makes the announcement .
unsurprisingly for the red rose party , red is odds on favorite at 2/1 , while there have been a few enquiries into odds for a stars and stripes cravat .
as for what he might do next , a speaking tour of the united states is at 2/1 , followed by publishing his memoirs and journalism .
but there are also odds on him going on tour with ugly rumours , the band he fronted as a long-haired student at oxford university in his undergraduate days .

germany had six coal-burning plants among the top-ten most polluting sites in the european union , the wwf survey showed .
and it was tied with britain for having the largest number of dirty electricity plants overall . each country contributed ten plants to the total .
overall , the wwf said , the dirty thirty in seven countries pumped out nearly 400 million tons of carbon dioxide in 2006 .
that 's 10 per cent of all eu co2 emissions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only the greeks have dirtier power plants than germany " the facts are clear : the power sector needs to phase out dirty coal as soon as possible , " said stephan singer , head of wwf 's climate and energy unit .
blaming lignite within germany , the dirtiest power station was the rwe-run niederaußem brown-coal plant -lrb- number three on the overall ranking . -rrb-
it , and several others on the german list , is in the industrial state of north-rhinewestphalia .
the top 12 power plants in the overall eu rankings are fuelled by lignite , a low grade " brown coal , " and were mainly first commissioned in the 1960s and 1970s .
however , the number one offending plant , greece 's agios dimitrios , first went into service in the mid-1980s , according to wwf .
the rest were largely coal-fired , although the british power stations at kingsnorth -lrb- 24th -rrb- and eggborough -lrb- 29th -rrb- also use heavy fuel oil or gas , respectively .

germany had six coal-burning plants among the top-ten most polluting sites in the european union , the wwf survey showed .
and it was tied with britain for having the largest number of dirty electricity plants overall . each country contributed ten plants to the total .
overall , the wwf said , the dirty thirty in seven countries pumped out nearly 400 million tons of carbon dioxide in 2006 .
that 's 10 per cent of all eu co2 emissions .

" on 27th june , i will tender my resignation from the office of prime minister , " he told labour party supporters in his constituency of sedgefield in northeast england . " i have been prime minister of this country for just over 10 years .
in this job , in the world today , i think that is long enough for me , but more especially for the country .
sometimes the only way you conquer the pull of power is to set it down , " he said . he trumpeted the changes britain has undergone since 1997 , when he took office . that year " was a moment for a new beginning , the sweeping away of all the detritus of the past .
expectations were so high , too high probably , too high probably for either of us , " he said . " now in 2007 you can easily point to challenges and grievances that fester , but go back to 1997 , think back , no , really think back about your own living standards , then in may 1997 and now . " speaking at trimdon labour club , where he launched his bid for the labour party leadership in 1994 , he said : " i come back here to sedgefield where my political journey began and where it will end . " blair also defended his record in office , saying " i did what i thought was right " during his decade in power .
in particular he defended his decision to stand shoulder to shoulder with the united states in the aftermath of sept .
11 , 2001 , including going to war against iraq in 2003 . announcement signals chance for renewal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair 's legacy will be the future state of iraq despite his best efforts to leave a legacy of social reforms and international climate accords , blair 's time in office will be forever remembered for his decision to involve britain in the deeply unpopular iraq war . many believe his relationship with the british people was irrevocably damaged by the iraq decision and his continued support for us-led adventures .
consequently , labour 's position in the british political landscape took a battering as voters registered their displeasure . while never publicly admitting as much , labour insiders have been urging blair to step down sooner rather than later in an attempt to salvage what was left of public support . his long-awaited announcement triggered a seven-week process for the election of a successor , most likely to be gordon brown , the chancellor of the exchequer .
blair , who together with brown founded new labour , allegedly promised brown back in 1994 that he would enable him to " share " the premiership at some point in the future .
but such a pledge has never been officially confirmed , and , as blair took the party to three election victories in succession , the impatience of brown supporters grew .
under intense pressure from the labour party , blair declared last september that he would step down " within a year . "
earlier thursday , blair informed the cabinet in london of his plans .
at the meeting , brown was said to have praised blair 's " unique leadership . "
campaign for leadership election bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few of blair 's cabinet team are likely to challenge brown the preparations for the internal leadership election to determine his successor are expected to begin almost immediately . in britain , the prime minister is the head of the largest party in parliament and a general election does not have to be called if he or she resigns . under labour party rules , the election process begins when its ruling national executive committee -lrb- nec -rrb- first meets about 72 hours after the leader 's announcement of a resignation and sets a timetable for a campaign . prospective candidates each have to secure the signatures of at least 44 -lrb- 12.5 percent -rrb- of the 353 labour party members of parliament in the lower house of commons to have their name on the ballot paper . after nominations closes , hustings - election meetings in which candidates stake their claim for the post - take place across the country .
all " validly nominated candidates " - even if unchallenged - are expected to attend . brown stands relatively unchallenged bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair could annoint brown as he chosen successor friday at the moment , finance minister gordon brown is the most likely winner , after other potentially strong candidates like environment secretary david miliband and home secretary john reid ruled themselves out in recent weeks . other minor candidates could stand .
former environment minister michael meacher and backbencher john mcdonnell have said they want to challenge brown , although it is unclear if they will be able to garner enough signatures to do so . voting begins after campaigning ends . any fully-paid up member of the labour party or members of its affiliated organizations - such as trades unions and socialist societies - who pay a political subscription to labour can vote . labour had 198,026 individual members as of dec .
31 , 2005 , according to the 2006 nec annual report . the ballot is expected to take about two weeks .
a procedures committee , made up of the labour party general secretary and senior party representatives , including the nec , oversees the election process . the winner must have secured more than 50 percent of the votes of the electoral college , which is split three ways between labour party members , british and european parliament lawmakers and affiliated associations . the process is the same for the deputy leadership post left vacant by deputy prime minister john prescott , who is expected to announce his resignation at the same time as blair . dw staff / afp / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de gordon brown , the next man in number 10 as chancellor of the exchequer , gordon brown has been the second most powerful man in british politics for more than a decade .

brüstle and others urged lawmakers to give them increased access to the stem cells - cells at an early stage of development , which have the potential to turn into different types of tissue .
but stem-cell research is controversial because the cells are culled from human embryos .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neurobiologist brüstle was one of the first to use stem cells in 2001 , the bundestag passed a law that banned the production of stem cells from human embryos .
they also ruled that research on human stem cells was only allowed if the cells were imported to germany before jan .
1 , 2002 .
restrictive law the law is considered to be one of the most restrictive in the world .
brüstle and 23 of his fellow scientists were in berlin wednesday to appear before the bundestag committee debating the topic .
they urged lawmakers to relax the 2002 cutoff date for imports .
“ what we need is to get rid of the current cutoff date we have in germany .
so we need to have access to all existing cell lines which are available at an international level , " brüstle said .
the newer cell lines are of a better quality and they have no contamination in contrast to the old cell lines , brüstle argued .
and , he noted , " we need access to these cell lines to be competitive at an international level . "
danger of prosecution the solution , according to brüstle , is to use " supernumerary " embryos from fertility clinics - which otherwise would be discarded - for the creation of cell lines and the development of medical therapies .
moreover , if they would n't allow this kind of research in germany , brüstle said legislators should at least limit the law 's geographic reach to germany alone .
currently , german scientists abroad run the risk of being criminally charged at home if they take part in international projects that use recent embryos .
this should not be the case , the scientists argued .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lab mice are easy to come by , but stem cells are not many researchers accuse the german government of inhibiting scientific success .
some believe that stem-cell research holds the key to cures for genetic diseases such as parkinson 's or alzheimer 's , and patents to cures for these diseases could be very lucrative .
jörg hinrich hacker , the vice president of the german research association , noted that there were currently hardly any pre-2002 embryos available to do research on , and that those that were available were culled with outdated methods .
theologist , lawmakers stand steady but frankfurt theology professor hille haker spoke out against changing the law .
nothing had changed in terms of ethics since 2002 , he argued , and added that the state was justified in limiting scientific advancement in favor of moral protection of human embryos .
and german minister for research annette schavan argued that principles - such as the sanctity of human life - come before scientific milestones .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at the heart of the controversy is the sanctity of human life " it has been our firm conviction that human embryos should not be destroyed to get stem cells , " she said .
" and then it is totally clear that we need this cutoff date .
just because other countries have other perceptions , we can not abandon our own german conviction . "
in parliament , only the liberal fdp and the left parties have stood behind the notion of changing the current law on stem-cell research .
useful debate the green party refuses to alter the 2002 date , and the ruling spd and cdu fractions have sent mixed signals .
while research minister schavan has said the government would make no move to abandon the regulation altogether , a postponement of the current cutoff date nonetheless seems probable .
the debate over the cutoff date will show " whether or not we can find new ways to combine the protection of human life with the expectations of scientists , " schavan told zdf television . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu lawmakers move to boost advanced medical therapies eu lawmakers backed planned rules on new types of " advanced " treatment for diseases such as cancer or alzheimer 's , and shot down calls for a blanket ban on medicines developed through stem-cell research .

" strikes do not help anybody " telekom chief rene obermann called on the union thursday to lay aside the strike plans and to return to the negotiating table . " strikes do not help anybody , ' said obermann , who took over the chief executive job last november . but ver.di officials said the strike action could start friday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obermann has a major crisis on his hands " we hope that the telekom management comes to its senses quickly , " said lothar schröder , a member of the ver.di board , announcing the strike . while ver.di strike leader ado wilhelm told dpa-afx there would not be a total collapse of services , he said telekom customers would feel the effects of the strike . the union 's move follows five weeks of so-called warning strikes by telekom employees over the cost-cutting plans . warnings about fierce competition the decision to step up industrial action followed warnings from obermann about the fierce competition facing the bonn-based company and the need for it to reform . indeed , strong growth in the group 's overseas operations and high-speed internet business failed to offset a further slump in its fixed-line customers in germany , with net earnings tumbling 58 percent to 459 million euros -lrb- $ 621 million -rrb- " a cut-throat price war is raging in germany , " obermann told a press conference in bonn thursday .
analysts had expected first-quarter earnings would come in at about 770 million euros . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : telekom employees are in no mood to bargain " we see no alternative to the reforms that have been instituted , and which have been discussed in detail for weeks and months now " said obermann .
" only these measures can ensure the long-term independence of deutsche telekom and secure as many jobs as possible in the company here in germany . " telekom has already undergone a major transformation over the decade since it was listed on the stock exchange in november 1996 , with the group eliminating more than 100,000 jobs . but as part of obermann 's drive to reduce costs , he wants to cut the group 's current german workforce by 32,000 by the end of 2008 . underscoring the intense competition facing telekom in germany , obermann said thursday the group had lost 588,000 fixed-line customers to its rivals during the first three months of the year . in particular , this is a further sign of the competition that has taken shape in germany 's domestic telecoms market since liberalization of europe 's telecommunications industry in 1998 . a rollercoaster ride telekom 's struggle to turn around its domestic german market was in stark contrast to a solid performance of its international operations , which now represents almost 50 percent of its total revenue . telekom 's shareholders have been on a rollercoaster ride since the former state monopoly 's shares were first listed on the share market in november 1996 at a price of 14.32 euros for private investors . after steadily climbing in the wake of their stock exchange debut , the telekom shares rocketed up to 104.90 euros in june 2000 at the height of the so-called new economy boom before skidding down to a record low of 8.14 euros in june 2002 . as thursday 's trading drew to a close , the group 's shares edged up 0.3 percent to 12.69 euros following the release of the first-quarter results and the announcement of the strike . dw staff / dpa -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de powerful unions launch warning strikes with more to come thousands of workers downed tools monday after the ig metall trade union called strikes to step up pressure for wage talks in the electrical , engineering and metalworking sectors .

" strikes do not help anybody " telekom chief rene obermann called on the union thursday to lay aside the strike plans and to return to the negotiating table .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de science -pipe- 10.05.2007 german scientists plead for more access to stem cells großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german scientists worry they will miss the boat on stem-cell research a group of top german scientists called for lawmakers to relax restrictions on stem-cell research , warning that germany risks losing its status as a leader in research - not to mention lucrative contracts . the group of esteemed german researchers appeared before a parliamentary committee in berlin on wednesday including neurolobiologist oliver brüstle , the first german researcher to apply to import embryonic stem cells , in 2000 .
brüstle and others urged lawmakers to give them increased access to the stem cells - cells at an early stage of development , which have the potential to turn into different types of tissue .
but stem-cell research is controversial because the cells are culled from human embryos .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neurobiologist brüstle was one of the first to use stem cells in 2001 , the bundestag passed a law that banned the production of stem cells from human embryos .
they also ruled that research on human stem cells was only allowed if the cells were imported to germany before jan .
1 , 2002 .
restrictive law the law is considered to be one of the most restrictive in the world .
brüstle and 23 of his fellow scientists were in berlin wednesday to appear before the bundestag committee debating the topic .
they urged lawmakers to relax the 2002 cutoff date for imports .
“ what we need is to get rid of the current cutoff date we have in germany .
so we need to have access to all existing cell lines which are available at an international level , " brüstle said .
the newer cell lines are of a better quality and they have no contamination in contrast to the old cell lines , brüstle argued .
and , he noted , " we need access to these cell lines to be competitive at an international level . "
danger of prosecution the solution , according to brüstle , is to use " supernumerary " embryos from fertility clinics - which otherwise would be discarded - for the creation of cell lines and the development of medical therapies .
moreover , if they would n't allow this kind of research in germany , brüstle said legislators should at least limit the law 's geographic reach to germany alone .
currently , german scientists abroad run the risk of being criminally charged at home if they take part in international projects that use recent embryos .
this should not be the case , the scientists argued .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lab mice are easy to come by , but stem cells are not many researchers accuse the german government of inhibiting scientific success .
some believe that stem-cell research holds the key to cures for genetic diseases such as parkinson 's or alzheimer 's , and patents to cures for these diseases could be very lucrative .
jörg hinrich hacker , the vice president of the german research association , noted that there were currently hardly any pre-2002 embryos available to do research on , and that those that were available were culled with outdated methods .
theologist , lawmakers stand steady but frankfurt theology professor hille haker spoke out against changing the law .
nothing had changed in terms of ethics since 2002 , he argued , and added that the state was justified in limiting scientific advancement in favor of moral protection of human embryos .
and german minister for research annette schavan argued that principles - such as the sanctity of human life - come before scientific milestones .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at the heart of the controversy is the sanctity of human life " it has been our firm conviction that human embryos should not be destroyed to get stem cells , " she said .
" and then it is totally clear that we need this cutoff date .
just because other countries have other perceptions , we can not abandon our own german conviction . "
in parliament , only the liberal fdp and the left parties have stood behind the notion of changing the current law on stem-cell research .
useful debate the green party refuses to alter the 2002 date , and the ruling spd and cdu fractions have sent mixed signals .
while research minister schavan has said the government would make no move to abandon the regulation altogether , a postponement of the current cutoff date nonetheless seems probable .
the debate over the cutoff date will show " whether or not we can find new ways to combine the protection of human life with the expectations of scientists , " schavan told zdf television . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu lawmakers move to boost advanced medical therapies eu lawmakers backed planned rules on new types of " advanced " treatment for diseases such as cancer or alzheimer 's , and shot down calls for a blanket ban on medicines developed through stem-cell research .

brüstle and others urged lawmakers to give them increased access to the stem cells - cells at an early stage of development , which have the potential to turn into different types of tissue .
but stem-cell research is controversial because the cells are culled from human embryos .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neurobiologist brüstle was one of the first to use stem cells in 2001 , the bundestag passed a law that banned the production of stem cells from human embryos .
they also ruled that research on human stem cells was only allowed if the cells were imported to germany before jan .
1 , 2002 .
restrictive law the law is considered to be one of the most restrictive in the world .
brüstle and 23 of his fellow scientists were in berlin wednesday to appear before the bundestag committee debating the topic .
they urged lawmakers to relax the 2002 cutoff date for imports .
“ what we need is to get rid of the current cutoff date we have in germany .
so we need to have access to all existing cell lines which are available at an international level , " brüstle said .
the newer cell lines are of a better quality and they have no contamination in contrast to the old cell lines , brüstle argued .
and , he noted , " we need access to these cell lines to be competitive at an international level . "
danger of prosecution the solution , according to brüstle , is to use " supernumerary " embryos from fertility clinics - which otherwise would be discarded - for the creation of cell lines and the development of medical therapies .
moreover , if they would n't allow this kind of research in germany , brüstle said legislators should at least limit the law 's geographic reach to germany alone .
currently , german scientists abroad run the risk of being criminally charged at home if they take part in international projects that use recent embryos .
this should not be the case , the scientists argued .

rushed through parliament in four days , they envisage a two-round popular vote to elect the president and call for a once-renewable five-year presidential mandate instead of the current single , seven-year term .
the bill , which has to be approved by outgoing president ahmet necdet sezer to come into force , also calls for parliamentary elections to be held every four years instead of the current five .
president sezer has 15 days to decide if he wants to return the bill to parliament for reconsideration .
if it is voted without any change for a second time , sezer has to either sign it in to law or put it on a referendum .
many expect the staunchly secular sezer - who has often clashed with the ruling justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- - to send the amendments back to parliament .

rushed through parliament in four days , they envisage a two-round popular vote to elect the president and call for a once-renewable five-year presidential mandate instead of the current single , seven-year term .
the bill , which has to be approved by outgoing president ahmet necdet sezer to come into force , also calls for parliamentary elections to be held every four years instead of the current five .
president sezer has 15 days to decide if he wants to return the bill to parliament for reconsideration .
if it is voted without any change for a second time , sezer has to either sign it in to law or put it on a referendum .
many expect the staunchly secular sezer - who has often clashed with the ruling justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- - to send the amendments back to parliament .

when it comes to the name of his unavoidable foray into the literary arena , the best odds are on " in my own words " at 4/1 , making it the favorite title , followed by " hard labour " -lrb- 6/1 -rrb- and " my legacy " -lrb- 8/1 -rrb- .
more outside bets are on the less likely " the blair rich project " , " no cash , no honors ! " and " yo , blair ! “ the last a reference to us president george w. bush remarks at last year 's g8 summit in saint petersburg .
even more risky wagers could be put on other potential titles such as " poodle of power " , " oil 's well that ends well " and " being pm means you never have to say you ’ re sorry " .
a-listers dominate bets on praise-giving bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " what 's your name again ? "
the list of those rushing to praise blair is headed by his old pal george .
w , followed by prime minister john howard of australia , stephen harper of canada and chancellor angela merkel of germany .
longer odds are on iran 's ayatollah ali khamenei and osama bin laden both at a distinctly ungenerous 33/1 .
bookmakers are even offering odds on the color of blair 's tie when he makes the announcement .
unsurprisingly for the red rose party , red is odds on favorite at 2/1 , while there have been a few enquiries into odds for a stars and stripes cravat .
as for what he might do next , a speaking tour of the united states is at 2/1 , followed by publishing his memoirs and journalism .
but there are also odds on him going on tour with ugly rumours , the band he fronted as a long-haired student at oxford university in his undergraduate days .
brits bet that blair will rock on bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " do you know ' i wanna be your dog ' by iggy pop ? "
gamblers might also want to take a few outside bets on blair 's rock band releasing a single by the end of the year .
potential cover versions worth a flutter could be : " golden brown " by the stranglers -lrb- in homage to blair 's most likely successor -rrb- , " maggie may " by rod stewart -lrb- a nod to former pm and blair 's idol margaret thatcher -rrb- or a guitar-driven take on frank sinatra 's " my way . "
for those who really like to speculate , a few pounds may be spread over a few less likely songs such as the clash 's " i 'm so bored with the usa " , " get your filthy hands off my desert " by pink floyd and " jilted john " by jilted john -lrb- with the famous refrain " gordon is a moron " -rrb- .
given the sporty blair 's love of mixing with the general public , the bookies are also taking bets on whether the soon-to-be ex-prime minister will run the london marathon at some point in his retiring years .
however , after showing no interest at all to previous mass gatherings on the streets of the capital , this may also be an outside wager .
tony looking for a new team ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " there could be a position free at bayern if you 're game " there are even odds on him becoming the next coach of his favorite english premiership soccer team , newcastle united , who are currently without a manager after the last incumbent , glenn roeder , resigned earlier this week .
however , rumors circulating in london suggest a safer bet would be on blair taking over from jose mourinho at chelsea , given the pm 's fondness for exiled russian oligarchs and dissidents .
disclaimer : while some of these bets are the original ones announced by bookmaker paddy power , some are those made up by the author and do not reflect real bets or the opinion of deutsche welle as a whole . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de blair announces resignation ; successor to take power in june british prime minister tony blair thursday announced that he will step down after a decade in office , handing over power to a successor on june 27 .
-lrb- 10.05.2007 -rrb- gordon brown , the next man in number 10 as chancellor of the exchequer , gordon brown has been the second most powerful man in british politics for more than a decade .
he 's now likely to move into number 10 - considerably later than most people expected .
-lrb- 10.05.2007 -rrb- the best of " from the fringe " germans might have a reputation of being a little grim and glum , but they 're not all sourpusses .
they can laugh or be laughable at times , and you can chuckle right along .

brüstle and others urged lawmakers to give them increased access to the stem cells - cells at an early stage of development , which have the potential to turn into different types of tissue .
but stem-cell research is controversial because the cells are culled from human embryos .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neurobiologist brüstle was one of the first to use stem cells in 2001 , the bundestag passed a law that banned the production of stem cells from human embryos .
they also ruled that research on human stem cells was only allowed if the cells were imported to germany before jan .
1 , 2002 .
restrictive law the law is considered to be one of the most restrictive in the world .
brüstle and 23 of his fellow scientists were in berlin wednesday to appear before the bundestag committee debating the topic .
they urged lawmakers to relax the 2002 cutoff date for imports .
“ what we need is to get rid of the current cutoff date we have in germany .
so we need to have access to all existing cell lines which are available at an international level , " brüstle said .

rushed through parliament in four days , they envisage a two-round popular vote to elect the president and call for a once-renewable five-year presidential mandate instead of the current single , seven-year term .
the bill , which has to be approved by outgoing president ahmet necdet sezer to come into force , also calls for parliamentary elections to be held every four years instead of the current five .
president sezer has 15 days to decide if he wants to return the bill to parliament for reconsideration .
if it is voted without any change for a second time , sezer has to either sign it in to law or put it on a referendum .
many expect the staunchly secular sezer - who has often clashed with the ruling justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- - to send the amendments back to parliament .
a total of 376 lawmakers in the 550-seat assembly voted thursday in favour of the amendments in a secret ballot , while one voted against , house speaker bulent arinc said .
akp secure vote but opposition remains the akp has 351 seats and , thanks to the backing of a minor opposition party , garnered more than the required two-thirds majority - or 367 votes - needed for the package to be adopted .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the republican people 's party oppose the amendements the main opposition republican people 's party had opposed the changes on the grounds that parliament should not be making radical changes to the system with a little more than two months to go to legislative elections .
legal experts have warned that the akp 's push for such a major overhaul of the constitution is hasty and could create problems in the functioning of the state .
the akp counters that the amendments are the solution to a damaging political crisis sparked by the presidential election .
the prospect of gul , a former islamist , becoming head of state sparked mass secular protests on the grounds that his election would increase the influence of islam in all fields of life .
opponents say the akp , the moderate offshoot of a now-banned islamist movement , is not truly committed to turkey 's secular system and harbours ambitions to erode the separation of state and religion .
gul at center of secularism storm gul , the sole candidate , formally withdrew wednesday , ending the presidential election process in parliament , which the opposition boycotted .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gul and prime minister erdogan try to find an answer in a first round of balloting in parliament on april 27 , gul narrowly missed being elected .
within hours , the army , which has toppled four governments since 1960 , issued a stiff statement , warning of action to defend the secular system if need be .
the constitutional court later annulled the forum on the grounds that parliament voted without the required quorum of 367 .
lawmakers on sunday held a re-run of the vote , which the opposition again boycotted , once again preventing the akp from establishing the necessary quorum .
the turmoil forced prime minister recep tayyip erdogan to bring legislative elections forward to july 22 from november .
according to two opinion polls published thurday , the akp is still the most popular party , with a wide margin ahead of its rivals .
one survey , published in the weekly magazine tempo , found that 41.3 percent of respondents would vote for the akp if elections were held instantly , while the second , carried by the vatan newspaper , put support for the akp at 29.04 percent .
earlier thursday , parliament also adopted a constitutional measure widely seen as aimed at preventing militant kurdish politicians from entering parliament . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkish parliament sets new presidential vote a turkish parliamentary committee set july 22 as the date for snap general elections after prime minister recep tayyip erdogan called for polls to end a simmering crisis over a disputed presidential vote .

unsurprisingly for the red rose party , red is odds on favorite at 2/1 , while there have been a few enquiries into odds for a stars and stripes cravat .

given the sporty blair 's love of mixing with the general public , the bookies are also taking bets on whether the soon-to-be ex-prime minister will run the london marathon at some point in his retiring years .

when it comes to the name of his unavoidable foray into the literary arena , the best odds are on " in my own words " at 4/1 , making it the favorite title , followed by " hard labour " -lrb- 6/1 -rrb- and " my legacy " -lrb- 8/1 -rrb- .
more outside bets are on the less likely " the blair rich project " , " no cash , no honors ! " and " yo , blair ! “ the last a reference to us president george w. bush remarks at last year 's g8 summit in saint petersburg .
even more risky wagers could be put on other potential titles such as " poodle of power " , " oil 's well that ends well " and " being pm means you never have to say you ’ re sorry " .

the list of those rushing to praise blair is headed by his old pal george .

longer odds are on iran 's ayatollah ali khamenei and osama bin laden both at a distinctly ungenerous 33/1 .

" on 27th june , i will tender my resignation from the office of prime minister , " he told labour party supporters in his constituency of sedgefield in northeast england . " i have been prime minister of this country for just over 10 years .
in this job , in the world today , i think that is long enough for me , but more especially for the country .
sometimes the only way you conquer the pull of power is to set it down , " he said . he trumpeted the changes britain has undergone since 1997 , when he took office . that year " was a moment for a new beginning , the sweeping away of all the detritus of the past .
expectations were so high , too high probably , too high probably for either of us , " he said . " now in 2007 you can easily point to challenges and grievances that fester , but go back to 1997 , think back , no , really think back about your own living standards , then in may 1997 and now . " speaking at trimdon labour club , where he launched his bid for the labour party leadership in 1994 , he said : " i come back here to sedgefield where my political journey began and where it will end . " blair also defended his record in office , saying " i did what i thought was right " during his decade in power .
in particular he defended his decision to stand shoulder to shoulder with the united states in the aftermath of sept .
11 , 2001 , including going to war against iraq in 2003 . announcement signals chance for renewal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair 's legacy will be the future state of iraq despite his best efforts to leave a legacy of social reforms and international climate accords , blair 's time in office will be forever remembered for his decision to involve britain in the deeply unpopular iraq war . many believe his relationship with the british people was irrevocably damaged by the iraq decision and his continued support for us-led adventures .
consequently , labour 's position in the british political landscape took a battering as voters registered their displeasure . while never publicly admitting as much , labour insiders have been urging blair to step down sooner rather than later in an attempt to salvage what was left of public support . his long-awaited announcement triggered a seven-week process for the election of a successor , most likely to be gordon brown , the chancellor of the exchequer .
blair , who together with brown founded new labour , allegedly promised brown back in 1994 that he would enable him to " share " the premiership at some point in the future .
but such a pledge has never been officially confirmed , and , as blair took the party to three election victories in succession , the impatience of brown supporters grew .
under intense pressure from the labour party , blair declared last september that he would step down " within a year . "
earlier thursday , blair informed the cabinet in london of his plans .
at the meeting , brown was said to have praised blair 's " unique leadership . "
campaign for leadership election bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few of blair 's cabinet team are likely to challenge brown the preparations for the internal leadership election to determine his successor are expected to begin almost immediately . in britain , the prime minister is the head of the largest party in parliament and a general election does not have to be called if he or she resigns . under labour party rules , the election process begins when its ruling national executive committee -lrb- nec -rrb- first meets about 72 hours after the leader 's announcement of a resignation and sets a timetable for a campaign . prospective candidates each have to secure the signatures of at least 44 -lrb- 12.5 percent -rrb- of the 353 labour party members of parliament in the lower house of commons to have their name on the ballot paper . after nominations closes , hustings - election meetings in which candidates stake their claim for the post - take place across the country .
all " validly nominated candidates " - even if unchallenged - are expected to attend . brown stands relatively unchallenged bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair could annoint brown as he chosen successor friday at the moment , finance minister gordon brown is the most likely winner , after other potentially strong candidates like environment secretary david miliband and home secretary john reid ruled themselves out in recent weeks . other minor candidates could stand .
former environment minister michael meacher and backbencher john mcdonnell have said they want to challenge brown , although it is unclear if they will be able to garner enough signatures to do so . voting begins after campaigning ends . any fully-paid up member of the labour party or members of its affiliated organizations - such as trades unions and socialist societies - who pay a political subscription to labour can vote . labour had 198,026 individual members as of dec .
31 , 2005 , according to the 2006 nec annual report . the ballot is expected to take about two weeks .
a procedures committee , made up of the labour party general secretary and senior party representatives , including the nec , oversees the election process . the winner must have secured more than 50 percent of the votes of the electoral college , which is split three ways between labour party members , british and european parliament lawmakers and affiliated associations . the process is the same for the deputy leadership post left vacant by deputy prime minister john prescott , who is expected to announce his resignation at the same time as blair . dw staff / afp / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de gordon brown , the next man in number 10 as chancellor of the exchequer , gordon brown has been the second most powerful man in british politics for more than a decade .

germany had six coal-burning plants among the top-ten most polluting sites in the european union , the wwf survey showed .
and it was tied with britain for having the largest number of dirty electricity plants overall . each country contributed ten plants to the total .
overall , the wwf said , the dirty thirty in seven countries pumped out nearly 400 million tons of carbon dioxide in 2006 .
that 's 10 per cent of all eu co2 emissions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only the greeks have dirtier power plants than germany " the facts are clear : the power sector needs to phase out dirty coal as soon as possible , " said stephan singer , head of wwf 's climate and energy unit .
blaming lignite within germany , the dirtiest power station was the rwe-run niederaußem brown-coal plant -lrb- number three on the overall ranking . -rrb-
it , and several others on the german list , is in the industrial state of north-rhinewestphalia .
the top 12 power plants in the overall eu rankings are fuelled by lignite , a low grade " brown coal , " and were mainly first commissioned in the 1960s and 1970s .
however , the number one offending plant , greece 's agios dimitrios , first went into service in the mid-1980s , according to wwf .
the rest were largely coal-fired , although the british power stations at kingsnorth -lrb- 24th -rrb- and eggborough -lrb- 29th -rrb- also use heavy fuel oil or gas , respectively .
more than half of the dirty thirty are run by just four power generation companies : germany 's rwe , swedish firm vattenfall , french group edf and germany 's eon .
calls for eu help " we can not tolerate a power sector where the dirtier get richer , " singer said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an rwe plant in north rhine wesphalia he called on the european union to improve its emissions trading schemes to ensure that only those who clean up their power stations reap a financial benefit .
the wwf report for 2006 ranked plants across the then 25-nation eu according to their efficiency - a calculation based on the number of grams of carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- emitted per kilowatt hour of electricity generated .
co2 is the main greenhouse gas that traps the sun 's heat , causing global warming . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de carbon-capture test begins at german pilot plant europe ’ s leading energy utility , vattenfall , has begun test runs of a new technology aimed at capturing carbon dioxide at power plants .

rushed through parliament in four days , they envisage a two-round popular vote to elect the president and call for a once-renewable five-year presidential mandate instead of the current single , seven-year term .
the bill , which has to be approved by outgoing president ahmet necdet sezer to come into force , also calls for parliamentary elections to be held every four years instead of the current five .
president sezer has 15 days to decide if he wants to return the bill to parliament for reconsideration .
if it is voted without any change for a second time , sezer has to either sign it in to law or put it on a referendum .
many expect the staunchly secular sezer - who has often clashed with the ruling justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- - to send the amendments back to parliament .
a total of 376 lawmakers in the 550-seat assembly voted thursday in favour of the amendments in a secret ballot , while one voted against , house speaker bulent arinc said .
akp secure vote but opposition remains the akp has 351 seats and , thanks to the backing of a minor opposition party , garnered more than the required two-thirds majority - or 367 votes - needed for the package to be adopted .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the republican people 's party oppose the amendements the main opposition republican people 's party had opposed the changes on the grounds that parliament should not be making radical changes to the system with a little more than two months to go to legislative elections .
legal experts have warned that the akp 's push for such a major overhaul of the constitution is hasty and could create problems in the functioning of the state .
the akp counters that the amendments are the solution to a damaging political crisis sparked by the presidential election .
the prospect of gul , a former islamist , becoming head of state sparked mass secular protests on the grounds that his election would increase the influence of islam in all fields of life .
opponents say the akp , the moderate offshoot of a now-banned islamist movement , is not truly committed to turkey 's secular system and harbours ambitions to erode the separation of state and religion .
gul at center of secularism storm gul , the sole candidate , formally withdrew wednesday , ending the presidential election process in parliament , which the opposition boycotted .

within hours , the army , which has toppled four governments since 1960 , issued a stiff statement , warning of action to defend the secular system if need be .
the constitutional court later annulled the forum on the grounds that parliament voted without the required quorum of 367 .
lawmakers on sunday held a re-run of the vote , which the opposition again boycotted , once again preventing the akp from establishing the necessary quorum .
the turmoil forced prime minister recep tayyip erdogan to bring legislative elections forward to july 22 from november .
according to two opinion polls published thurday , the akp is still the most popular party , with a wide margin ahead of its rivals .
one survey , published in the weekly magazine tempo , found that 41.3 percent of respondents would vote for the akp if elections were held instantly , while the second , carried by the vatan newspaper , put support for the akp at 29.04 percent .

rushed through parliament in four days , they envisage a two-round popular vote to elect the president and call for a once-renewable five-year presidential mandate instead of the current single , seven-year term .
the bill , which has to be approved by outgoing president ahmet necdet sezer to come into force , also calls for parliamentary elections to be held every four years instead of the current five .
president sezer has 15 days to decide if he wants to return the bill to parliament for reconsideration .
if it is voted without any change for a second time , sezer has to either sign it in to law or put it on a referendum .
many expect the staunchly secular sezer - who has often clashed with the ruling justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- - to send the amendments back to parliament .
a total of 376 lawmakers in the 550-seat assembly voted thursday in favour of the amendments in a secret ballot , while one voted against , house speaker bulent arinc said .
akp secure vote but opposition remains the akp has 351 seats and , thanks to the backing of a minor opposition party , garnered more than the required two-thirds majority - or 367 votes - needed for the package to be adopted .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the republican people 's party oppose the amendements the main opposition republican people 's party had opposed the changes on the grounds that parliament should not be making radical changes to the system with a little more than two months to go to legislative elections .
legal experts have warned that the akp 's push for such a major overhaul of the constitution is hasty and could create problems in the functioning of the state .
the akp counters that the amendments are the solution to a damaging political crisis sparked by the presidential election .
the prospect of gul , a former islamist , becoming head of state sparked mass secular protests on the grounds that his election would increase the influence of islam in all fields of life .
opponents say the akp , the moderate offshoot of a now-banned islamist movement , is not truly committed to turkey 's secular system and harbours ambitions to erode the separation of state and religion .
gul at center of secularism storm gul , the sole candidate , formally withdrew wednesday , ending the presidential election process in parliament , which the opposition boycotted .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de travel -pipe- 10.05.2007 wary of security hassles , european tourists steer clear of us großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fewer europeans are heading to top us tourist destinations these days the us tourism industry needs to win back a formerly dependable ally : the european tourist .
with tourism from across the atlantic at a record low , the stakes are high , both economically and for the us image abroad . many european tourists see traveling to the us as more of a hassle than it 's worth these days .
they worry about visa and paperwork issues , fingerprinting , long lines at airport and unfriendly immigration officials , experts say . " there 's a perception out there that it 's tough to get into the united states at the moment .
so people tend to look at what are the other options .
there are plenty of attractive destinations around the world , " said geoffrey lipman , assistant secretary general of the united nation 's world tourism organization , based in madrid , spain . in recent years , europeans have begun to take more trips regionally or satisfy their wanderlust with vacations to africa and asia , figures from the un organization show . passing on a bargain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for some , the security hassles are n't worth it there were 1.5 million fewer european tourists who visited the us in 2006 compared with 2000 .
european tourism continued to slide in recent years with numbers down two percent in 2006 compared with 2005 .
the forecasts for this year look flat as well , according to recent figures from the us department of commerce . all this is not to imply that european tourists are turning their backs on the us altogether .
europe remains an important source of tourism for the us , with one of every two overseas visitors traditionally coming from european countries , amounting to a total of nearly 10 million in 2006 .
the uk , japan , germany and france are the four biggest sources of overseas tourism to the us . the drop in european tourism is surprising considering the us is currently a bargain for europeans , with the euro at $ 1.35 and the british pound at $ 1.99 .
under normal circumstances , the cheap dollar would mean a 10-30 percent increase in european tourism to the us , said rolf freitag , chairman of ipk international , a munich-based consulting firm that specializes in tourism research . " there should have been an explosion , " he said .
" when the dollar is cheap for europeans there is always a boom . " image problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the strong euro does n't seem to be bringing europeans to the us but recent years have been far from normal for tourism .
the 2001 terrorist attacks in new york and washington strained us-european relations , with france and germany voicing strong opposition to the us-led war in iraq .
a majority of europeans view the us unfavorably , angry about foreign policy decisions made by president george bush , studies show . " i think the image of the us , especially because the president has a bad reputation , prevents people from going there , " said rene schwietzke , 34 , who lives in the eastern german city of jena . schwietzke travels regularly to the us since his quality assurance company does business there .
he finds the us to be a great tourism destination and he describes it as laidback , cheap , beautiful and full of friendly people . yet get him talking about security measures , and he describes them as " a big pain " and " really inconvenient . " perception is reality bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us has n't seemed welcoming in recent years tourism experts feel it 's the immigration hassles and not a dislike of president george w. bush that keep europeans from visiting the us . in september , the us tourism industry launched the discover america partnership , a group focused on using tourism to improve the us image abroad .
lobbying political leaders has been the first priority . the us can welcome international tourists without compromising security , said geoff freeman , who heads up the partnership .
freeman has lobbied political leaders to strengthen the visa waiver program , hire more customs officials , and make the country 's busiest airports more welcoming to international travelers . " we do n't believe a long line at an airport means we 're more secure , it means we 're inefficient , " freeman said .
" we do n't think inadequate use of technology makes us more secure , it just makes us less competitive . " more than just money bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : security checks should be made more efficient the us has lost $ 90 billion in potential revenue from international tourism since 2000 simply from not keeping up with the tourism growth rates of the rest of the world , according to figures from the travel industry association of america -lrb- tia . -rrb-
but it 's not just money that is worrisome . " the diplomatic factor of travel is as important as economics , " said roger dow , chief executive officer of the tia .
" in this battle for world opinion and getting to know one another and sharing ideas , there 's nothing better than people traveling . " europeans who visit the us have a more positive view of the country and talk it up to their friends , studies show . freeman agreed : " if we want to win hearts and minds around the world , then travel is the greatest tool we have and unfortunately to date we 're not using it .

people are waiting for integrated answers to global crises , he told dw . jakob von uexküll is also the founder of the right livelihood awards , also known as the " alternative nobel prize " and the other economic summit .
the world future council , his latest project , is holding its first meeting in hamburg from may 10 to 13 .
dw-radio : the aim of the world future council is to secure a healthy planet for the benefit of future generations .
how does the council want to achieve this ?
jakob von uexküll : by working very closely with decision-makers to highlight solutions which already exist , to identify and research those which may not be known yet and then make sure they 're implemented .
we have already begun to do this by holding a hearing with parliamentarians and heads of energy committees in nairobi after the un climate conference a few months ago .
as a result , the energy legislation in three african countries is already being improved .
these are very concrete steps based on the fact that we know what needs to be done in many areas but the political will still seems to be lacking .
i felt that , by creating a political organization that specifically speaks up as a strong voice for future generations , we could create this extra will .
during their war of independence , the americans had a slogan that read " no taxation without representation , " and today we are taxing the very lives of future generations , but we are not giving them a say in the matter .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : organizations write up good declarations , but most think too short-term , von uexküll said there have been organizations in the past , for example councils of seers into the future in colonial india , but today - when our influence on the future is longer-term and bigger than ever - we 've lacked such an institution .
how is the world future council different from other international organizations that deal with important global issues ?
a spokes-organization for future generation - this focus has not existed before .
we are not interested in what is supposedly realistic today .
we are interested in what is necessary and we 're working to make that politically realistic .
we are long-term , while existing institutions and commissions are often quite short-term .
they have a short mandate , produce a very good declaration and then expect someone else to implement it - usually the us - and that really has n't worked .
we are also looking at various different issues together .
all the major crises in the world today are integrated , but most of the institutions that exist at the moment are highly specialized , and i think that 's another reason why we 're still not moving ahead as fast as we must .
you 'll be involving democratically elected parliamentarians , as well as over 6,000 ngos , the media and the public .
how will this work in practice ?
with the parliamentarians it 's very concrete .
there is a new electronic network being developed that links all the world 's democratically elected national members of parliament , called the e-parliament initiative .
the hearings in nairobi will be a joint project with e-parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " if we do n't use the sun and wind of today , they 'll be lost forever " as far as civil society goes , we wrote to the 6,000 organizations to get nominations of who they thought would make a credible member of the world future council .
and , of course , the media is crucial to getting the message out .
if we look at climate chaos , for example , this has been a huge market failure , but it 's also been a failure for politics and the media .
people have thought it 's a problem for future generations and suddenly it 's hitting us now .
in australia they 're talking about evacuating whole cities because there 's a lack of water .
i think there 's awareness there , and openness in many of these organizations to work with us .
people are waiting for integrated answers to the crises we are facing .
fighting climate change is one of your top priorities .
what are the first steps your organization is going to take ?
the renewable energy promotion is no doubt the most important thing now .
we can not afford anymore to waste the sun and the wind of today , because we ca n't use them tomorrow .
they 'll be lost forever .
it 's nonsense to say they 're still too expensive .
that 's basically immaterial .
if we have the resources and the workers to install this equipment and the materials to build them , then we have to do it .
we 're focusing on promoting the best legislation to spread renewable energy .
it 's a german law , which has spread to over 40 countries and regions world-wide .
it 's very democratic because you encourage people to do something themselves .
you do n't sit and wait for huge companies that have been part of the problem to suddenly decide to become part of the solution .
would you say that climate change is threatening to overshadow other pressing global problems like fighting aids or reducing poverty ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : climate change worsens other issues like poverty , said von uexküll the problem is not that climate change overshadows them but that it makes them more serious .
you can not solve poverty with ongoing climate chaos .
natural laws override all economic laws and all cultures because they determine the preconditions for our existence .
it is quite clear that all our gains in fighting poverty and hunger are going to disappear very quickly if we ca n't reduce climate chaos and we 're going to find lots of illnesses spreading to parts of the world where they have been defeated or where they 've never been before .
in early june , the g8 countries are going to meet for their annual summit in heiligendamm .
what message do you have for the g8 leaders ?
the lack of political will has , of course , been the problem , so they need an additional push .
again , renewable energy , but also the whole spectrum of legislation to combat climate change is going to be high on the agenda .
we want to remind them that they must integrate the interests of future generations in their decision-making .
" short-termism " has characterized eu and g8 decision-making and eu regulations have been preventing what needs to be done instead of promoting it because economic growth and free trade have been the motto .
i 'm not saying we do n't need growth - we need growth of solar energy , for example - but everything has to be subordinated to these new demands to secure a healthy planet for us and for future generations . barbara gruber interviewed jakob von uexküll -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turning globalization on its head globalization is not just about outsourcing jobs in the west to asia : indian companies are now creating jobs in europe .

so people tend to look at what are the other options .
there are plenty of attractive destinations around the world , " said geoffrey lipman , assistant secretary general of the united nation 's world tourism organization , based in madrid , spain . in recent years , europeans have begun to take more trips regionally or satisfy their wanderlust with vacations to africa and asia , figures from the un organization show . passing on a bargain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for some , the security hassles are n't worth it there were 1.5 million fewer european tourists who visited the us in 2006 compared with 2000 .
european tourism continued to slide in recent years with numbers down two percent in 2006 compared with 2005 .
the forecasts for this year look flat as well , according to recent figures from the us department of commerce . all this is not to imply that european tourists are turning their backs on the us altogether .
europe remains an important source of tourism for the us , with one of every two overseas visitors traditionally coming from european countries , amounting to a total of nearly 10 million in 2006 .
the uk , japan , germany and france are the four biggest sources of overseas tourism to the us . the drop in european tourism is surprising considering the us is currently a bargain for europeans , with the euro at $ 1.35 and the british pound at $ 1.99 .
under normal circumstances , the cheap dollar would mean a 10-30 percent increase in european tourism to the us , said rolf freitag , chairman of ipk international , a munich-based consulting firm that specializes in tourism research . " there should have been an explosion , " he said .
" when the dollar is cheap for europeans there is always a boom . " image problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the strong euro does n't seem to be bringing europeans to the us but recent years have been far from normal for tourism .

a majority of europeans view the us unfavorably , angry about foreign policy decisions made by president george bush , studies show . " i think the image of the us , especially because the president has a bad reputation , prevents people from going there , " said rene schwietzke , 34 , who lives in the eastern german city of jena . schwietzke travels regularly to the us since his quality assurance company does business there .
he finds the us to be a great tourism destination and he describes it as laidback , cheap , beautiful and full of friendly people . yet get him talking about security measures , and he describes them as " a big pain " and " really inconvenient . " perception is reality bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us has n't seemed welcoming in recent years tourism experts feel it 's the immigration hassles and not a dislike of president george w. bush that keep europeans from visiting the us . in september , the us tourism industry launched the discover america partnership , a group focused on using tourism to improve the us image abroad .
lobbying political leaders has been the first priority . the us can welcome international tourists without compromising security , said geoff freeman , who heads up the partnership .
freeman has lobbied political leaders to strengthen the visa waiver program , hire more customs officials , and make the country 's busiest airports more welcoming to international travelers . " we do n't believe a long line at an airport means we 're more secure , it means we 're inefficient , " freeman said .
" we do n't think inadequate use of technology makes us more secure , it just makes us less competitive . " more than just money bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : security checks should be made more efficient the us has lost $ 90 billion in potential revenue from international tourism since 2000 simply from not keeping up with the tourism growth rates of the rest of the world , according to figures from the travel industry association of america -lrb- tia . -rrb-
but it 's not just money that is worrisome . " the diplomatic factor of travel is as important as economics , " said roger dow , chief executive officer of the tia .
" in this battle for world opinion and getting to know one another and sharing ideas , there 's nothing better than people traveling . " europeans who visit the us have a more positive view of the country and talk it up to their friends , studies show . freeman agreed : " if we want to win hearts and minds around the world , then travel is the greatest tool we have and unfortunately to date we 're not using it .

people are waiting for integrated answers to global crises , he told dw . jakob von uexküll is also the founder of the right livelihood awards , also known as the " alternative nobel prize " and the other economic summit .
the world future council , his latest project , is holding its first meeting in hamburg from may 10 to 13 .
dw-radio : the aim of the world future council is to secure a healthy planet for the benefit of future generations .
how does the council want to achieve this ?
jakob von uexküll : by working very closely with decision-makers to highlight solutions which already exist , to identify and research those which may not be known yet and then make sure they 're implemented .
we have already begun to do this by holding a hearing with parliamentarians and heads of energy committees in nairobi after the un climate conference a few months ago .
as a result , the energy legislation in three african countries is already being improved .
these are very concrete steps based on the fact that we know what needs to be done in many areas but the political will still seems to be lacking .
i felt that , by creating a political organization that specifically speaks up as a strong voice for future generations , we could create this extra will .
during their war of independence , the americans had a slogan that read " no taxation without representation , " and today we are taxing the very lives of future generations , but we are not giving them a say in the matter .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : organizations write up good declarations , but most think too short-term , von uexküll said there have been organizations in the past , for example councils of seers into the future in colonial india , but today - when our influence on the future is longer-term and bigger than ever - we 've lacked such an institution .
how is the world future council different from other international organizations that deal with important global issues ?
a spokes-organization for future generation - this focus has not existed before .

it 's very democratic because you encourage people to do something themselves .

people are waiting for integrated answers to global crises , he told dw . jakob von uexküll is also the founder of the right livelihood awards , also known as the " alternative nobel prize " and the other economic summit .
the world future council , his latest project , is holding its first meeting in hamburg from may 10 to 13 .
dw-radio : the aim of the world future council is to secure a healthy planet for the benefit of future generations .
how does the council want to achieve this ?
jakob von uexküll : by working very closely with decision-makers to highlight solutions which already exist , to identify and research those which may not be known yet and then make sure they 're implemented .
we have already begun to do this by holding a hearing with parliamentarians and heads of energy committees in nairobi after the un climate conference a few months ago .
as a result , the energy legislation in three african countries is already being improved .
these are very concrete steps based on the fact that we know what needs to be done in many areas but the political will still seems to be lacking .
i felt that , by creating a political organization that specifically speaks up as a strong voice for future generations , we could create this extra will .
during their war of independence , the americans had a slogan that read " no taxation without representation , " and today we are taxing the very lives of future generations , but we are not giving them a say in the matter .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : organizations write up good declarations , but most think too short-term , von uexküll said there have been organizations in the past , for example councils of seers into the future in colonial india , but today - when our influence on the future is longer-term and bigger than ever - we 've lacked such an institution .
how is the world future council different from other international organizations that deal with important global issues ?
a spokes-organization for future generation - this focus has not existed before .
we are not interested in what is supposedly realistic today .
we are interested in what is necessary and we 're working to make that politically realistic .
we are long-term , while existing institutions and commissions are often quite short-term .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de globalization -pipe- 10.05.2007 " we are taxing the lives of future generations " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : think long-term , von uexküll says jakob von uexküll founded the world future council to provide a voice for future generations on topics like climate change , poverty and fair trade .
people are waiting for integrated answers to global crises , he told dw . jakob von uexküll is also the founder of the right livelihood awards , also known as the " alternative nobel prize " and the other economic summit .
the world future council , his latest project , is holding its first meeting in hamburg from may 10 to 13 .
dw-radio : the aim of the world future council is to secure a healthy planet for the benefit of future generations .
how does the council want to achieve this ?
jakob von uexküll : by working very closely with decision-makers to highlight solutions which already exist , to identify and research those which may not be known yet and then make sure they 're implemented .
we have already begun to do this by holding a hearing with parliamentarians and heads of energy committees in nairobi after the un climate conference a few months ago .
as a result , the energy legislation in three african countries is already being improved .
these are very concrete steps based on the fact that we know what needs to be done in many areas but the political will still seems to be lacking .
i felt that , by creating a political organization that specifically speaks up as a strong voice for future generations , we could create this extra will .
during their war of independence , the americans had a slogan that read " no taxation without representation , " and today we are taxing the very lives of future generations , but we are not giving them a say in the matter .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : organizations write up good declarations , but most think too short-term , von uexküll said there have been organizations in the past , for example councils of seers into the future in colonial india , but today - when our influence on the future is longer-term and bigger than ever - we 've lacked such an institution .
how is the world future council different from other international organizations that deal with important global issues ?
a spokes-organization for future generation - this focus has not existed before .
we are not interested in what is supposedly realistic today .
we are interested in what is necessary and we 're working to make that politically realistic .
we are long-term , while existing institutions and commissions are often quite short-term .
they have a short mandate , produce a very good declaration and then expect someone else to implement it - usually the us - and that really has n't worked .
we are also looking at various different issues together .
all the major crises in the world today are integrated , but most of the institutions that exist at the moment are highly specialized , and i think that 's another reason why we 're still not moving ahead as fast as we must .
you 'll be involving democratically elected parliamentarians , as well as over 6,000 ngos , the media and the public .
how will this work in practice ?
with the parliamentarians it 's very concrete .
there is a new electronic network being developed that links all the world 's democratically elected national members of parliament , called the e-parliament initiative .
the hearings in nairobi will be a joint project with e-parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " if we do n't use the sun and wind of today , they 'll be lost forever " as far as civil society goes , we wrote to the 6,000 organizations to get nominations of who they thought would make a credible member of the world future council .
and , of course , the media is crucial to getting the message out .
if we look at climate chaos , for example , this has been a huge market failure , but it 's also been a failure for politics and the media .
people have thought it 's a problem for future generations and suddenly it 's hitting us now .
in australia they 're talking about evacuating whole cities because there 's a lack of water .
i think there 's awareness there , and openness in many of these organizations to work with us .
people are waiting for integrated answers to the crises we are facing .
fighting climate change is one of your top priorities .
what are the first steps your organization is going to take ?
the renewable energy promotion is no doubt the most important thing now .
we can not afford anymore to waste the sun and the wind of today , because we ca n't use them tomorrow .
they 'll be lost forever .
it 's nonsense to say they 're still too expensive .
that 's basically immaterial .
if we have the resources and the workers to install this equipment and the materials to build them , then we have to do it .
we 're focusing on promoting the best legislation to spread renewable energy .
it 's a german law , which has spread to over 40 countries and regions world-wide .
it 's very democratic because you encourage people to do something themselves .
you do n't sit and wait for huge companies that have been part of the problem to suddenly decide to become part of the solution .
would you say that climate change is threatening to overshadow other pressing global problems like fighting aids or reducing poverty ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : climate change worsens other issues like poverty , said von uexküll the problem is not that climate change overshadows them but that it makes them more serious .
you can not solve poverty with ongoing climate chaos .
natural laws override all economic laws and all cultures because they determine the preconditions for our existence .
it is quite clear that all our gains in fighting poverty and hunger are going to disappear very quickly if we ca n't reduce climate chaos and we 're going to find lots of illnesses spreading to parts of the world where they have been defeated or where they 've never been before .
in early june , the g8 countries are going to meet for their annual summit in heiligendamm .
what message do you have for the g8 leaders ?
the lack of political will has , of course , been the problem , so they need an additional push .
again , renewable energy , but also the whole spectrum of legislation to combat climate change is going to be high on the agenda .
we want to remind them that they must integrate the interests of future generations in their decision-making .
" short-termism " has characterized eu and g8 decision-making and eu regulations have been preventing what needs to be done instead of promoting it because economic growth and free trade have been the motto .
i 'm not saying we do n't need growth - we need growth of solar energy , for example - but everything has to be subordinated to these new demands to secure a healthy planet for us and for future generations . barbara gruber interviewed jakob von uexküll -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turning globalization on its head globalization is not just about outsourcing jobs in the west to asia : indian companies are now creating jobs in europe .

the archive 's official opening , in berlin , coincided with diverse celebrations marking the anniversary of the end of world war ii . " a great satisfaction " " for me , it is a great satisfaction that on the day of liberation of fascism here in berlin , this video archive is being presented , " said giacomo notari , an italian resistance fighter who attended the conference .

but organizers hope it will spread to include others . " i am delighted that … the first video-archive with eyewitnesses of the european resistance could be developed and is online from today on , " said belen enciso of the european commission .

people are waiting for integrated answers to global crises , he told dw . jakob von uexküll is also the founder of the right livelihood awards , also known as the " alternative nobel prize " and the other economic summit .
the world future council , his latest project , is holding its first meeting in hamburg from may 10 to 13 .
dw-radio : the aim of the world future council is to secure a healthy planet for the benefit of future generations .
how does the council want to achieve this ?
jakob von uexküll : by working very closely with decision-makers to highlight solutions which already exist , to identify and research those which may not be known yet and then make sure they 're implemented .
we have already begun to do this by holding a hearing with parliamentarians and heads of energy committees in nairobi after the un climate conference a few months ago .
as a result , the energy legislation in three african countries is already being improved .
these are very concrete steps based on the fact that we know what needs to be done in many areas but the political will still seems to be lacking .
i felt that , by creating a political organization that specifically speaks up as a strong voice for future generations , we could create this extra will .
during their war of independence , the americans had a slogan that read " no taxation without representation , " and today we are taxing the very lives of future generations , but we are not giving them a say in the matter .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : organizations write up good declarations , but most think too short-term , von uexküll said there have been organizations in the past , for example councils of seers into the future in colonial india , but today - when our influence on the future is longer-term and bigger than ever - we 've lacked such an institution .
how is the world future council different from other international organizations that deal with important global issues ?
a spokes-organization for future generation - this focus has not existed before .
we are not interested in what is supposedly realistic today .
we are interested in what is necessary and we 're working to make that politically realistic .
we are long-term , while existing institutions and commissions are often quite short-term .
they have a short mandate , produce a very good declaration and then expect someone else to implement it - usually the us - and that really has n't worked .
we are also looking at various different issues together .
all the major crises in the world today are integrated , but most of the institutions that exist at the moment are highly specialized , and i think that 's another reason why we 're still not moving ahead as fast as we must .
you 'll be involving democratically elected parliamentarians , as well as over 6,000 ngos , the media and the public .
how will this work in practice ?
with the parliamentarians it 's very concrete .
there is a new electronic network being developed that links all the world 's democratically elected national members of parliament , called the e-parliament initiative .
the hearings in nairobi will be a joint project with e-parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " if we do n't use the sun and wind of today , they 'll be lost forever " as far as civil society goes , we wrote to the 6,000 organizations to get nominations of who they thought would make a credible member of the world future council .
and , of course , the media is crucial to getting the message out .
if we look at climate chaos , for example , this has been a huge market failure , but it 's also been a failure for politics and the media .
people have thought it 's a problem for future generations and suddenly it 's hitting us now .
in australia they 're talking about evacuating whole cities because there 's a lack of water .
i think there 's awareness there , and openness in many of these organizations to work with us .
people are waiting for integrated answers to the crises we are facing .
fighting climate change is one of your top priorities .
what are the first steps your organization is going to take ?
the renewable energy promotion is no doubt the most important thing now .
we can not afford anymore to waste the sun and the wind of today , because we ca n't use them tomorrow .
they 'll be lost forever .
it 's nonsense to say they 're still too expensive .
that 's basically immaterial .
if we have the resources and the workers to install this equipment and the materials to build them , then we have to do it .
we 're focusing on promoting the best legislation to spread renewable energy .
it 's a german law , which has spread to over 40 countries and regions world-wide .
it 's very democratic because you encourage people to do something themselves .
you do n't sit and wait for huge companies that have been part of the problem to suddenly decide to become part of the solution .
would you say that climate change is threatening to overshadow other pressing global problems like fighting aids or reducing poverty ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : climate change worsens other issues like poverty , said von uexküll the problem is not that climate change overshadows them but that it makes them more serious .
you can not solve poverty with ongoing climate chaos .
natural laws override all economic laws and all cultures because they determine the preconditions for our existence .
it is quite clear that all our gains in fighting poverty and hunger are going to disappear very quickly if we ca n't reduce climate chaos and we 're going to find lots of illnesses spreading to parts of the world where they have been defeated or where they 've never been before .
in early june , the g8 countries are going to meet for their annual summit in heiligendamm .
what message do you have for the g8 leaders ?
the lack of political will has , of course , been the problem , so they need an additional push .
again , renewable energy , but also the whole spectrum of legislation to combat climate change is going to be high on the agenda .
we want to remind them that they must integrate the interests of future generations in their decision-making .
" short-termism " has characterized eu and g8 decision-making and eu regulations have been preventing what needs to be done instead of promoting it because economic growth and free trade have been the motto .
i 'm not saying we do n't need growth - we need growth of solar energy , for example - but everything has to be subordinated to these new demands to secure a healthy planet for us and for future generations . barbara gruber interviewed jakob von uexküll -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : turning globalization on its head globalization is not just about outsourcing jobs in the west to asia : indian companies are now creating jobs in europe .

germany had six coal-burning plants among the top-ten most polluting sites in the european union , the wwf survey showed .
and it was tied with britain for having the largest number of dirty electricity plants overall . each country contributed ten plants to the total .
overall , the wwf said , the dirty thirty in seven countries pumped out nearly 400 million tons of carbon dioxide in 2006 .
that 's 10 per cent of all eu co2 emissions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only the greeks have dirtier power plants than germany " the facts are clear : the power sector needs to phase out dirty coal as soon as possible , " said stephan singer , head of wwf 's climate and energy unit .
blaming lignite within germany , the dirtiest power station was the rwe-run niederaußem brown-coal plant -lrb- number three on the overall ranking . -rrb-
it , and several others on the german list , is in the industrial state of north-rhinewestphalia .
the top 12 power plants in the overall eu rankings are fuelled by lignite , a low grade " brown coal , " and were mainly first commissioned in the 1960s and 1970s .
however , the number one offending plant , greece 's agios dimitrios , first went into service in the mid-1980s , according to wwf .
the rest were largely coal-fired , although the british power stations at kingsnorth -lrb- 24th -rrb- and eggborough -lrb- 29th -rrb- also use heavy fuel oil or gas , respectively .
more than half of the dirty thirty are run by just four power generation companies : germany 's rwe , swedish firm vattenfall , french group edf and germany 's eon .
calls for eu help " we can not tolerate a power sector where the dirtier get richer , " singer said .

the wwf report for 2006 ranked plants across the then 25-nation eu according to their efficiency - a calculation based on the number of grams of carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- emitted per kilowatt hour of electricity generated .

eight days before aaron gilbert was killed by his mother 's partner in may 2005 , an anonymous caller complained about the way he was being treated .
instead of an investigation , a letter was sent to aaron 's mother , rebecca lewis , but went to the wrong address .
lewis was later convicted of familial homicide for failing to protect aaron .
last year , she became one of the first people in the uk to be convicted of the offence after a jury found her guilty of failing to prevent partner andrew lloyd from murdering baby aaron .
lloyd admitted the murder and was jailed for 24 years , while lewis was jailed for six years .
a review has been carried out by the local safeguarding children board -lrb- lscb -rrb- into the involvement of all local services leading up to the murder .
it calls for a review of the department which took the anonymous call claiming aaron had bruises and was being cared for by people who possibly had problems with drugs .
five recommendations a " comprehensive review " by swansea social services in how it deals with information and makes critical child protection decisions .
review policy for engaging the community as partners in the child protection process examine information-sharing procedures review procedures for calling domestic violence risk assessment conferences raise failings of the process for placing details on the police national computer with organisations responsible source : lscb report the details of the call were passed on to a social worker , who wrote a letter to lewis inviting her to a meeting .
however , it was sent to the wrong address and lewis did not turn up .
on the same day in an unrelated visit , a health visitor called at their house and left a card .
but later that day , 13-month-old aaron was admitted to hospital suffering from head injuries from which he never recovered .
he had 50 injuries on his body when he died of brain damage in may 2005 , it emerged during the trial at swansea crown court .
the report concludes that sending a letter was an " inadequate response " to the allegations .
it says the social worker was not properly supervised because key staff had left and had not been replaced immediately .
' better safeguarding ' there were also problems about the way information about lloyd was shared and he was not identified as a " significant risk " .
details of his parole licence were not put on police computers , mental health services did not pass on information about his personality disorder and his history of domestic violence was not shared with the probation service .
the report found work of the health service was " largely very positive " but on one occasion his mother took aaron to hospital with an injured arm and left before being seen .
staff decided a home visit was needed , but it never took place because of staff sickness .
the report adds that , while many of the circumstances which led to aaron 's death could not have been predicted , lessons must be learned by everyone involved in the case .
this included swansea social services , the probation service , the nhs and south wales police .
lscb chairman , mark roszkowski , said : " we welcome the review as a means for all the agencies involved to identify lessons that need to be learned to improve interagency working and better safeguarding for children . "
the child and family division of swansea social services said it had carried out its own examination and had already implemented many of the review 's recommendations .
it said it would be working closely with its partners to further improve procedures in the interest of vulnerable children .
swansea health community said it was important that agencies involved in child care worked together to avert tragedies like aaron 's death , and an action plan was in place to further improve procedures .
south wales police said they had already taken steps to act on some of the recommendations and would " continue to work with our partners to identify those who pose a risk to society and protect those who are vulnerable . "
a welsh assembly government spokesperson added : " the welsh assembly government will read the report thoroughly and will consider the lessons that can be learnt in this tragic case . "

instead of an investigation , a letter was sent to aaron 's mother , rebecca lewis , but went to the wrong address .
lewis was later convicted of familial homicide for failing to protect aaron .
last year , she became one of the first people in the uk to be convicted of the offence after a jury found her guilty of failing to prevent partner andrew lloyd from murdering baby aaron .
lloyd admitted the murder and was jailed for 24 years , while lewis was jailed for six years .
a review has been carried out by the local safeguarding children board -lrb- lscb -rrb- into the involvement of all local services leading up to the murder .
it calls for a review of the department which took the anonymous call claiming aaron had bruises and was being cared for by people who possibly had problems with drugs .
five recommendations a " comprehensive review " by swansea social services in how it deals with information and makes critical child protection decisions .
review policy for engaging the community as partners in the child protection process examine information-sharing procedures review procedures for calling domestic violence risk assessment conferences raise failings of the process for placing details on the police national computer with organisations responsible source : lscb report the details of the call were passed on to a social worker , who wrote a letter to lewis inviting her to a meeting .
however , it was sent to the wrong address and lewis did not turn up .
on the same day in an unrelated visit , a health visitor called at their house and left a card .
but later that day , 13-month-old aaron was admitted to hospital suffering from head injuries from which he never recovered .
he had 50 injuries on his body when he died of brain damage in may 2005 , it emerged during the trial at swansea crown court .
the report concludes that sending a letter was an " inadequate response " to the allegations .
it says the social worker was not properly supervised because key staff had left and had not been replaced immediately .
' better safeguarding ' there were also problems about the way information about lloyd was shared and he was not identified as a " significant risk " .
details of his parole licence were not put on police computers , mental health services did not pass on information about his personality disorder and his history of domestic violence was not shared with the probation service .
the report found work of the health service was " largely very positive " but on one occasion his mother took aaron to hospital with an injured arm and left before being seen .
staff decided a home visit was needed , but it never took place because of staff sickness .
the report adds that , while many of the circumstances which led to aaron 's death could not have been predicted , lessons must be learned by everyone involved in the case .
this included swansea social services , the probation service , the nhs and south wales police .
lscb chairman , mark roszkowski , said : " we welcome the review as a means for all the agencies involved to identify lessons that need to be learned to improve interagency working and better safeguarding for children . "
the child and family division of swansea social services said it had carried out its own examination and had already implemented many of the review 's recommendations .
it said it would be working closely with its partners to further improve procedures in the interest of vulnerable children .
swansea health community said it was important that agencies involved in child care worked together to avert tragedies like aaron 's death , and an action plan was in place to further improve procedures .
south wales police said they had already taken steps to act on some of the recommendations and would " continue to work with our partners to identify those who pose a risk to society and protect those who are vulnerable . "
a welsh assembly government spokesperson added : " the welsh assembly government will read the report thoroughly and will consider the lessons that can be learnt in this tragic case . "

it is his first visit to latin america since becoming pope in april 2005 .
he is to perform a series of open air masses before travelling to aparecida for the focus of the visit , a major conference of latin american bishops .
there he is expected to touch on the growing challenge the catholic church faces from evangelical groups .
pope 's itinerary 10 may : meets brazilian president lula in sao paulo , then church leaders and young people 11 may : pope leads prayers around sao paulo 13 may : prayers and address to open latin american bishops ' conference at aparecida pope visit : reporter 's diary talking to journalists on the flight , the pope said his main concern in the region was the loss of millions of disaffected roman catholics to evangelical churches .
according to a recent study , some 64 % of brazilians are catholic , but this number represents a 10 % fall compared to 10 years ago and contrasts with an upsurge in converts to evangelical churches .
the issue of abortion is also expected to feature , amid dismay within the catholic church at mexico city 's move to legalise it .
' peace to all of you ' brazilian president luiz inacio lula da silva greeted pope benedict as his plane touched down at sao paulo 's international airport .
" i extend my greetings to all the peoples of latin america and the caribbean in the words of the apostle : ' peace to all of you who are in christ ' , " the pope said , speaking in portuguese .
have your say " the catholic church is losing congregations because of its orthodox view " alessandro cavalcante , sao paulo send us your comments crowds waited in the rain to catch a glimpse of the pontiff , who later went to a monastery where he will stay during the visit .
at the monastery , the faithful chanted " bento , bento " as he arrived and waved flags as he blessed them .
on thursday , he is to address a youth gathering in the city 's pacaembu stadium and on friday canonize brother antonio galvao , brazil 's first native-born saint , during a public mass .
then on sunday , pope benedict is to open the bishops ' conference , the first such meeting for 15 years .
the two-week forum will bring together almost 200 bishops and cardinals from across latin american and the caribbean to set out the church 's agenda and policies in the region for the coming years .
abortion debate the conference comes only weeks after mexico city 's decision on abortion .
talking to journalists on the plane , pope benedict appeared to back mexico city church officials who said that politicians who supported the law and medical workers who performed abortions would be excommunicated .
a vatican spokesman later clarified the issue , saying the pope did not intend to excommunicate anyone .
however , father federico lombardi said that " legislative action in favour of abortion is incompatible with participation in the eucharist " and therefore " politicians exclude themselves from communion " .
the subject is also up for debate in brazil .
the health minister has recently said he would like to see discussion on abortion - currently permitted only in limited circumstances - a suggestion that has already prompted a vigorous response from senior clergy .
warm welcome president lula has already made it clear that he regards the question more as a matter of public health than a moral choice .
but our vatican correspondent , david willey , who is travelling with the pope , says that the church is reluctant for even a similar public discussion on the issue in brazil .
the pope said it was the issue of catholics choosing to join evangelical churches that was " our biggest worry " .
" we need to find a convincing response , " he said .
pope benedict is sure of a warm welcome from the catholic faithful in brazil , says the bbc 's simon watts .
but his problems is that both he and the local catholic hierarchy are more conservative than most brazilians .
to the converts , the evangelicals offer the chance of redemption now , rather than in the after-life , as well as a social network and help with problems like drink or drugs .
in contrast , catholic rituals can seem stuffy and out-of-touch with day-to-day reality for most brazilians , our correspondent adds .

at the monastery , the faithful chanted " bento , bento " as he arrived and waved flags as he blessed them .
on thursday , he is to address a youth gathering in the city 's pacaembu stadium and on friday canonize brother antonio galvao , brazil 's first native-born saint , during a public mass .
then on sunday , pope benedict is to open the bishops ' conference , the first such meeting for 15 years .
the two-week forum will bring together almost 200 bishops and cardinals from across latin american and the caribbean to set out the church 's agenda and policies in the region for the coming years .
abortion debate the conference comes only weeks after mexico city 's decision on abortion .
this is benedict 's first visit to latin america as pope talking to journalists on the plane , pope benedict appeared to back mexico city church officials who said that politicians who supported the law and medical workers who performed abortions would be excommunicated .
a vatican spokesman later clarified the issue , saying the pope did not intend to excommunicate anyone .
however , father federico lombardi said that " legislative action in favour of abortion is incompatible with participation in the eucharist " and therefore " politicians exclude themselves from communion " .
the subject is also up for debate in brazil .
the health minister has recently said he would like to see discussion on abortion - currently permitted only in limited circumstances - a suggestion that has already prompted a vigorous response from senior clergy .
warm welcome president lula has already made it clear that he regards the question more as a matter of public health than a moral choice .
but our vatican correspondent , david willey , who is travelling with the pope , says that the church is reluctant for even a similar public discussion on the issue in brazil .
the pope said it was the issue of catholics choosing to join evangelical churches that was " our biggest worry " .
" we need to find a convincing response , " he said .
pope benedict is sure of a warm welcome from the catholic faithful in brazil , says the bbc 's simon watts .
but his problems is that both he and the local catholic hierarchy are more conservative than most brazilians .
to the converts , the evangelicals offer the chance of redemption now , rather than in the after-life , as well as a social network and help with problems like drink or drugs .
in contrast , catholic rituals can seem stuffy and out-of-touch with day-to-day reality for most brazilians , our correspondent adds .

pamela northcott , 58 , from dyserth in denbighsire has terminal kidney cancer .
her two daughters interrupted a nhs trust meeting on tuesday to demand she was given the drug nexavar , which can help slow the progress of the tumour .
kate spall and emma northcott have now been told that their mother will be given the drug for two months .
she will then be scanned to see if the drug , which is not yet recognised by the national institute of clinical excellence -lrb- nice -rrb- , is having an effect on her condition and the treatment will be reviewed .
her daughters , who said the drug was available within 70 english trusts , said they were overjoyed .
the family said they hoped the case would set a precedent and provide hope for other sufferers .
the news comes as a report into the use of new cancer treatments suggests that britain lags behind many other western countries .
swedish researchers have said that the united states , france , switzerland and austria are world leaders for using new drugs , but the uk is one of the slowest countries to adopt new treatments .
' determined ' on tuesday , pamela northcott 's daughters interrupted a board meeting of conwy and denbighshire nhs trust , but at the time , the trust said it was unable to authorise use of the drug .
the sisters claimed that authorities in wales were " hiding " behind the fact it has not been nice-approved and were refusing to use it because of its cost .
emma northcott -lrb- top -rrb- joined her sister to interrupt the meeting the drug , which can cost up to £ 40,000 , is not a cure , but can help some patients .
ms spall now spends much of her time working with kidney patients in england , and claims to have helped many win the right to have nexavar after appealing the decision of their trusts .
she said : " i am determined to make sure nobody else has to go through this . "
in a statement after tuesday 's meeting , the trust said the " all wales medicines strategy group -lrb- awmsg -rrb- had decided not to recommend the use of nexavar for patients in wales " .
" the nhs in wales is required to follow the recommendations of the awmsg in all but exceptional circumstances .
" in view of this advice , the trust was unable to authorise the use of the drug , and any decision would therefore need to be made by the denbighshire local health board . "

at school he drove his teachers to distraction , constantly questioning their authority .
at university , he acted out his rock star fantasies as the lead singer of a band .
few at that stage would have predicted a career in the sober world of politics , even though blair 's charisma and ability to charm people were evident from an early age .
the story of his rise to power is certainly not a rags to riches tale - he was born with every advantage in life - but it is no less remarkable for that .
it is the story of how a middle class , privately-educated barrister - the son of a would-be tory mp - went on to become the most successful leader in the history of the labour party , profoundly changing it and the country in the process .
and how a man once seen as a lightweight - preoccupied with his own image and popularity - became one of the most powerful and controversial figures on the world stage .
tory leanings anthony charles lynton blair was born in 1953 in edinburgh , the second son of hazel and leo blair .
he spent the first few years of his life in adelaide , australia , where leo lectured in law at the city 's university .
they returned to the uk in late 1950s and blair spent the remainder of his childhood in durham , where he was a day pupil at the fee-paying choristers school .
leo was chairman of the local conservative association but had to abandon his ambition to become a tory mp when he suffered a stroke .
his political leanings appeared to have rubbed off on the young tony , who stood in a mock school election as the conservative candidate .
' maddening ' blair 's teachers at exclusive edinburgh boarding school fettes recall a cheeky , rebellious figure ; a talented actor who loved being the centre of attention and who cultivated a " cool " image among his peers .
blair 's cv born : 6 may 1953 educated : choristers school , fettes , oxford family : married , four children 1976 : barrister specialising in trade union and employment law 1983 : labour mp for sedgefield , shadow city spokesman 1984 - 87 : shadow trade and industry minister 1987 - 88 : shadow energy secretary 1989 - 92 : shadow employment secretary 1992 - 94 : shadow home secretary 1994 - 97 : opposition leader 1997 - prime minister " tony was full of life .
maddening at times , full of himself and very argumentative , " blair 's housemaster eric anderson told blair 's biographer john rentoul .
" he was an expert at testing the rules to the limit , and i would n't swear that he stuck rigidly to the rules on not drinking , smoking or breaking bounds .
but he was a live wire and fun to have around . "
at the age of 17 he was given " six of the best " for persistently flouting the school rules .
then he was threatened with expulsion .
it was his girlfriend 's father , lord mackenzie stewart , an old fettesian and cross bench peer , who came to the rescue , striking a deal with the school that allowed blair to spend the final few weeks of the summer term living with him .
mackenzie stewart 's daughter , amanda , was the first girl to be admitted to fettes .
typically , it was the super-confident blair who beat the 440 other boys to win her heart .
rock music blair also met charlie falconer while at fettes .
the man who would later become his lord chancellor was a pupil at the rival edinburgh academy .
blair left fettes with three a levels and a place at st john 's college , oxford , to study law .
like many teenage boys in the late 1960s he was besotted by rock music .
he idolised mick jagger but he also dreamed of wielding power behind the scenes , as a manager or promoter .
before taking up his place at oxford , he headed for london , where he spent a carefree year " managing " student rock bands and putting on gigs and discos with his friend alan collenette .
to make ends meet , the pair stacked shelves at barkers food hall , in kensington .
at oxford he briefly fronted a rock band , ugly rumours .
friends recall his charismatic stage presence , but also his professional attitude .
trainee barrister " he even wanted to rehearse , " said band mate mark ellen .
but blair was also developing a more thoughtful side .
he began to talk about left wing politics and , unusually for the times , became increasingly serious about his christian faith , taking confirmation classes .
he lost his mother to cancer while he was at oxford , which also appears to have profoundly affected his outlook .
in his first year at the university , he befriended an australian priest , peter thompson , with whom he would debate social issues and theology late into the night .
blair later credited thompson with awakening in him an interest in christian socialism , and a desire for social change .
blair was also unusual , in the pot-smoking student milieu of the early 1970s , in that he appears to have avoided drugs .
there are also few reports of him being incapacitated by drink .
his only real vice was smoking cigarettes , a habit wife cherie later made him quit .
he smoked his last one 15 minutes before their wedding .
blair left oxford with a second class degree and in 1976 became a trainee barrister in the chambers of derry irvine , who would later become his first lord chancellor .
it was here that he met cherie booth , a fellow pupil in irvine 's chambers .
she had a first class degree and was seen as being more of a high flyer than blair .
activist friends recall a christmas party , during a game which involved passing a balloon between their knees , when it became obvious they would be more than just colleagues .
blair properties 1980 : mapledene road , hackney , bought £ 40,000 , sold 1986 £ 80,000 1983 : myrobella , trimdon village , nr sedgefield , bought £ 30,000 1986 : stavordale road , islington , bought £ 120,000 , sold 1993 £ 200,000 1993 : richmond crescent , islington , bought £ 375,000 , sold 1997 £ 615,000 1997:11 downing street - rent free flat next door to prime minister 's traditional residence 2002 : clifton , bristol , two flats bought for £ 525,000 in total 2004 : connaught square , bayswater , bought £ 3.6m 2007 : bayswater .
two bed house behind connaught square property , bought £ 800,000 .
blairs plan to join buildings together to create extra space " the next day we went out to lunch and hours later we were still there , " blair later recalled .
" i found her immensely physically attractive and i wanted her as a friend as well . "
the couple married in 1980 , setting up home in hackney , east london , in a £ 40,000 end-of-terrace house , and threw themselves into local labour party politics .
blair had joined the party shortly after leaving oxford , but it was only now that he became more involved as an activist , encouraged by neighbour - and future home secretary - charles clarke , who shared his centre-left outlook .
in 1981 , through his father-in-law , the actor and left wing campaigner tony booth , blair contacted labour mp tom pendry to ask for help in becoming an mp .
pendry gave him a tour of the commons and advised him to stand for selection as a candidate in a forthcoming by-election in beaconsfield .
blair never stood a chance in such a safe conservative seat but he managed to attract the attention of labour leader michael foot , who was impressed by his enthusiasm and told him he had a " big future in politics " .
manifesto concerns nevertheless , it looked as if he would miss out on a chance to contest the 1983 general election .
it was only at the very last minute that he found a vacant seat , in the newly-created constituency of sedgefield , near where he grew up in county durham , securing the nomination ahead of several sitting mps and his future chief whip hilary armstrong , the daughter of a local labour mp .
the 1983 labour manifesto was one of the most left wing ever to be put before the british electorate .
it included commitments to nationalisation of industry and unilateral nuclear disarmament .
blair made it clear privately to john burton , his election agent and mentor , that he did not agree with key parts of it , particularly proposals to withdraw britain from the eu .
his victory , in a rock solid labour area , was assured , although labour had a bad night nationally .
the early 1980s was a grim era of factory closures and job losses in the north east of england , with unemployment in the former mining villages that made up most of blair 's constituency soaring above 20 % .
within weeks of entering parliament , blair , who at 30 was the youngest labour mp , led a delegation of pit men and their families to london , where he joined forces with national union of mineworkers -lrb- num -rrb- leader arthur scargill to petition the national coal board over the planned closure of a coke works .
middle class appeal the young " london barrister , " as local newspapers described him , fought for his constituents ' jobs in traditional heavy industries but he also made no effort to hide his belief that the labour party had to modernise - and broaden its appeal to middle class voters - or die .
in an article for the northern echo , he argued " to win power for the low-paid , unemployed and the north , we must also appeal to the 60 % of the population in private housing , to the employed on the average wage and to the south " .

at one party meeting , he was shocked to find himself being denounced as a " traitor to socialism " by labour mp dennis skinner , after he made a speech urging reform .
" it was a very early lesson in politics because i said exactly what i thought .
i said we were living in a new age but we were talking like everybody had just got black and white tvs , " he later recalled in an interview with the northern echo .
cherie had also contested the 1983 general election , but after losing the no-hope seat of thanet in kent , she threw herself into her legal career , going on to become one of the country 's leading human rights lawyers .
by the end of blair 's first year in parliament , she had also given birth to the first of the couple 's four children , euan .
that first year also saw blair gain a crucial ally in his mission to modernise the labour party .
new agenda colleagues recall him being initially somewhat in awe of gordon brown , the young scottish mp he shared an office with in parliament .
blair 's favourite food bananas , beck 's lager and pistachio nuts - maid who served blair at labour conference fresh fettucini garnished with an exotic sauce of olive oil , sun-dried tomatoes and capers - nspcc islington cook book fish and chips - sedgefield labour party election leaflet unlike him , brown had been steeped in labour politics from a very early age and already had a knack for making headlines .
but together with peter mandelson , then a senior aide to party leader neil kinnock , the pair set about laying the foundations for what would become new labour .
blair , brown and mandelson were determined to make labour electable again by ditching unpopular labour policies , such as unilateral disarmament , and forging a new agenda marrying free market economics with social justice .
but they also wanted to improve the way labour communicated with voters .
focus groups , previously distrusted by labour politicians - if they had even heard of such things at all - would became key tools in shaping the party 's message .
advertising executives and pollsters , previously treated with suspicion by left wing politicians , were drafted into the modernisers ' inner circle to advise on presentation .
leadership deal blair and brown were promoted rapidly through the shadow cabinet ranks , but when it came to who would stand as the " modernising " candidate when leader john smith died of a heart attack in 1994 , their supporters were split .
many assumed brown , as the older of the two , would take precedence .
blair 's favourite music the beatles the rolling stones led zeppelin free bruce springsteen u2 coldplay the foo fighters simply red but the shadow chancellor hesitated , eventually agreeing to give blair a clear run at the top job .
the deal was supposedly struck over dinner at granita , an islington restaurant , with blair reportedly pledging to hand over to brown after two terms - and to give him , as chancellor , unprecedented control over the domestic agenda .
but the precise terms of any deal remain hotly contested .
what appears to have been decisive is the decision of mandelson to switch his backing from brown to blair - believing the shadow home secretary to be the better communicator of the two .
it was a decision that caused a " rift " in new labour from the beginning , mandelson recently admitted , with the distrust and feuding between blair and brown , or more often their respective supporters , coming to dominate british politics .
soundbites the new labour leader was initially seen as something of a political lightweight .
he had easily defeated left wingers john prescott and margaret beckett to snatch the leadership - and he had set about reforming the party with single-minded determination - but he was dubbed " bambi " by the press and cartoonists depicted him as a slick , permanently grinning public relations man .
like many in the labour party , blair believed neil kinnock 's chances of becoming prime minister in 1992 had been destroyed by a hostile tabloid press .
he was determined not to let that happen to him and he hired tough talking former tabloid journalist alastair campbell to sharpen up its press operation .
the pair would obsess over every aspect of blair 's image , placing bets on which of their carefully crafted soundbites would make it on to the evening news bulletins .
campbell normally won .
blair also courted showbusiness personalities - attempting to align labour with a new wave of british pop stars and artists emerging in the mid 1990s , dubbed by the style press " cool britannia " .
his speeches at the time bordered on the messianic , tapping into what he saw as a pre-millennial mood of optimism .
sleaze promise his specific policies were modest in scope , but his rhetoric was dizzying : he promised nothing less than a country reborn , sweeping away the " sleaze " and drift of the major years .
and he deployed all of his charm and charisma on tv chat shows , showing himself to be a natural in front of the cameras , in contrast to the more stilted major .
it worked .
blair swept to a landslide victory in 1997 , becoming , at 43 , the youngest prime minister in nearly 200 years .
always nervous on polling day , he was still gloomily contemplating a possible coalition with the liberal democrats , even as the scale of his victory was becoming obvious .
two hours after polls closed - with the early results indicating a landslide - he ordered supporters in the royal festival hall to stop celebrating for fear of appearing complacent or " triumphalist " .
he need not have feared .
blair entered downing street on a wave of optimism and good will , on 2 may 1997 .
he promised to restore trust in politics and breathe new life into britain 's tired institutions .
in the early weeks of his premiership , he held a series of glittering receptions in downing street to celebrate his victory .
but behind the scenes , he was haunted by the splits and in-fighting he believed had destroyed previous labour administrations .
honeymoon period he continued to rule over his party with an iron will , battling to impose his own choice of candidates in the first london mayoral contest and devolved assembly elections and ensuring ministers remained " on message " at all times .
wary of the civil service 's ability to deliver his policy goals , he centralised power in downing street .
he preferred to make decisions with a small band of trusted advisors , rather than through more formal cabinet procedures , prompting accusations of " cronyism " and claims he was running a presidential style of government .
the media manipulation techniques that had served him so well in opposition were also beginning to earn his government a reputation for " spin " .
but blair 's personality - and his ability to connect with people through television - continued to be central to labour 's appeal .
within weeks of being elected , he delivered a halting , emotionally-charged eulogy to princess diana , on the morning of her death .
it was a performance which seemed to capture the public mood .
he would later insist that the phrase " the people 's princess " was his own and not alastair campbell 's invention , as cynics claimed .
euro decision then , when he was engulfed by his first party funding scandal , accused of offering favours in return for a £ 1m donation from formula one boss bernie ecclestone , he again took to the airwaves , pleading with the public to keep their faith in him .
" i think most people who have dealt with me , think i 'm a pretty straight sort of guy and i am , " he told the bbc 's john humphrys .
blair 's honeymoon period with the electorate felt like it would go on forever and his popularity received a further boost in 2000 , when cherie announced that , at the age of 45 , she was to become a mother again .
leo blair became the first legitimate child to be born to a serving prime minister in 150 years .
blair holidays 1997 : tuscany , guest of geoffrey robinson , labour mp and businessman 1998 : tuscany , prince girolamo strozzi , law professor and family friend 1999 : tuscany , vannino chiti , tuscan president 2001 : ariege , southern france , sir martin keene , high court judge and family friend 2003 - 06 : barbados , sir cliff richard , singer 2004 : sardinia , silvio berlusconi , italian premier and media mogul 2006 : barbados , sir anthony bamford , jcb boss and tory donor 2007 : miami , robin gibb , bee gees member blair swept to another landslide election victory in 2001 , pledging to deliver improvements to health and education he had been promising since 1997 .
the timidity and reliance on focus groups that had characterised much of his first term began to be replaced by more sure-footed and decisive leadership .
he had already angered the left by talking about the " scars on his back " from his early , tentative attempts to make the public services more efficient .
now he was determined to be more bold in his approach , reasoning that the unions could hardly complain about market reforms with record amounts of cash pouring into schools and hospitals .
the only cloud on blair 's horizon was his worsening relationship with gordon brown , which , observers said , alternated between table-thumping rows and sullen periods of silence .
fresh mandate emboldened by his fresh mandate , he appointed blairites to key positions across government , from david blunkett at the home office to estelle morris at education , in an attempt to wrest control of the domestic agenda from the treasury .
but it was brown , who was said to be increasingly obsessed with becoming prime minister , that held all the aces when it came to the one thing blair really wanted .
he had long planned to take britain into the euro , believing it would define his legacy and finally place britain at the " heart of europe " after years on the margins under the conservatives .
but brown was less convinced of the case for joining the euro and , crucially , he had seized control of the entry process , devising five " economic tests " that had to be passed before britain ditched the pound .
a referendum was promised for 2003 , but by then the economic argument for the euro had been lost .
the five tests had not been passed , brown decreed , and the single currency was kicked into the long grass , along with blair 's dreams of a european legacy .
iraq but by then blair had found another , larger mission - one that really would write his name into the history books , for better or worse .
blair had always taken a single-minded approach to foreign policy .
he appeared to enjoy the company of the no-nonsense men of action he found in the military .
they made a refreshing change from the naturally cautious civil servants that surrounded him in downing street - or the left-wing mps and union leaders who it seemed to him were forever trying to stand in the way of progress .
early successes in sierra leone and kosovo convinced blair of the value of military action in pursuit of humanitarian aims .
colleagues said his christian faith gave him a clearer sense of moral purpose than many of those around him - but it was not a subject he was ever comfortable talking about in public .
he had forged a close relationship with us president bill clinton during his first term in office , with whom he shared a centre-left political philosophy .
but to the surprise and dismay of many in his own party , including his loyal deputy john prescott , he formed an even closer bond with clinton 's successor , the republican george w bush .
the 11 september attacks moved the relationship on to a different level .
failure blair toured the world , shoring up support for the bush administration , utterly convinced of his own powers of persuasion and advocacy ; instinctively believing britain 's place was at america 's side in her hour of need .
but it was the 2003 decision to invade iraq - without a un mandate and in the teeth of bitter opposition at home and abroad - that would link the two leaders together in the public mind for ever .
blair had drawn on every last ounce of his persuasive skill to make the case for war to mps and the wider public .
but the subsequent failure to find weapons of mass destruction in iraq appeared to confirm many people 's worst suspicions about him - that he relied too much on spin and was not to be trusted .
in the public backlash that followed he briefly considered quitting .
he was persuaded to carry on by cabinet supporters but in october 2004 he surprised everyone by announcing he would not seek a fourth term in office if he won the next election .
the announcement had been designed to end speculation about his health - he had undergone an operation to correct an irregular heart beat .
' lame duck ' but it only succeeded in sparking more damaging speculation about his departure date , leading opponents to brand him a " lame duck " premier .
for the 2005 general election campaign , alastair campbell devised what came to be known as the " masochism strategy " , with blair allowing voters to vent their anger about iraq at him in a series of tv debates .
he became the first labour leader to win three consecutive terms in office but any elation was short-lived .
his share of the popular vote was the lowest on record for any prime minister .
his self-belief and powers of persuasion remained undimmed .
over one remarkable 24 hour period , he flew to singapore to help london land the 2012 olympics - punching the air with glee as he did so - before flying back to gleneagles , in scotland , to unveil a debt relief package for africa .
they were the two of the biggest achievements of his premiership .
but they were instantly overshadowed by the 7 july attack on the london transport system - the first suicide attacks mainland britain had ever witnessed .
his opinion poll ratings improved in the immediate aftermath of 7 july , as he once again proved his ability to capture the nation 's mood in a time of crisis .
but when a bombers ' taped testimony was released blaming the attack on blair 's foreign policy , it threw the spotlight back on to iraq and his refusal to apologise for what his opponents saw as a terrible miscalculation .
blair was convinced britain was engaged , with america , in a global " war on terror " but he was having trouble bringing many in his party with him .
final straw when he failed to condemn israel 's bombing of lebanon , once again standing four square with george bush in the face of mounting criticism around the world , it was the final straw for many normally loyal labour mps .
a series of resignations by junior ministers , who believed his failure to name a departure date was damaging the party , underlined his weakened position and he was forced to announce he would be gone by september 2007 .
it was not , he confessed , the way he had wanted it to end .
in his own mind , and that of his supporters , he was a prime minister at the peak of his powers .
his extraordinary farewell speech at the 2006 party conference in manchester reminded even his harshest labour party critics what they would be losing when he was gone .
the charisma that had served him so well over the years was still intact .
the difference was that he no longer agonised over his own popularity .
it was enough for him to know that he had " done the right thing " .
his final months in office were dogged by a police investigation into allegations he had nominated party donors for peerages .
he became the first serving prime minister to be interviewed as part of a police investigation , although downing street was keen to stress he was being treated as a witness .
the affair had its origins before the 2005 general election when blair - concerned by the size of the tories ' war chest - sought massive loans from a series of wealthy individuals , which he kept secret from all but a few members of his inner circle .
even labour 's treasurer was kept in the dark . "
i am not going to beg for my character in front of anyone .
people can make up their own mind about me " tony blair four of the lenders were subsequently nominated for peerages , but were rejected by the independent appointments ' commission , sparking opposition claims they had been " sold " honours .
blair was accused of flouting his own rules on party funding , introduced as part of his drive to " clean up " politics .
parliamentary standards commissioner sir alastair graham accused him of destroying trust in politics , saying the issue would be associated with his time in office in the way " sleaze " was with john major .
but rather than pleading to be trusted , as he had in 1997 during the bernie ecclestone affair , blair simply refused to talk about the allegations .
" i am not going to beg for my character in front of anyone .
people can make up their own mind about me , " he told the bbc in february .
conviction politician he said he had " a deep respect for the british people and it 's been an honour and privilege to lead them " .
but he said he had " changed " over the past 10 years .
he was a " different sort of person " now , who was less concerned about being " liked " .
blair had been hardened by a decade in office .
he had become a conviction politician - a very different character to the one that had first walked into downing street in 1997 , guitar case in hand .

activist friends recall a christmas party , during a game which involved passing a balloon between their knees , when it became obvious they would be more than just colleagues .

blairs plan to join buildings together to create extra space " the next day we went out to lunch and hours later we were still there , " blair later recalled .
" i found her immensely physically attractive and i wanted her as a friend as well . "
the couple married in 1980 , setting up home in hackney , east london , in a £ 40,000 end-of-terrace house , and threw themselves into local labour party politics .
blair had joined the party shortly after leaving oxford , but it was only now that he became more involved as an activist , encouraged by neighbour - and future home secretary - charles clarke , who shared his centre-left outlook .
in 1981 , through his father-in-law , the actor and left wing campaigner tony booth , blair contacted labour mp tom pendry to ask for help in becoming an mp .
pendry gave him a tour of the commons and advised him to stand for selection as a candidate in a forthcoming by-election in beaconsfield .
blair never stood a chance in such a safe conservative seat but he managed to attract the attention of labour leader michael foot , who was impressed by his enthusiasm and told him he had a " big future in politics " .
manifesto concerns nevertheless , it looked as if he would miss out on a chance to contest the 1983 general election .
it was only at the very last minute that he found a vacant seat , in the newly-created constituency of sedgefield , near where he grew up in county durham , securing the nomination ahead of several sitting mps and his future chief whip hilary armstrong , the daughter of a local labour mp .
the 1983 labour manifesto was one of the most left wing ever to be put before the british electorate .
it included commitments to nationalisation of industry and unilateral nuclear disarmament .
presentation was crucial to the new labour project blair made it clear privately to john burton , his election agent and mentor , that he did not agree with key parts of it , particularly proposals to withdraw britain from the eu .
his victory , in a rock solid labour area , was assured , although labour had a bad night nationally .
the early 1980s was a grim era of factory closures and job losses in the north east of england , with unemployment in the former mining villages that made up most of blair 's constituency soaring above 20 % .
within weeks of entering parliament , blair , who at 30 was the youngest labour mp , led a delegation of pit men and their families to london , where he joined forces with national union of mineworkers -lrb- num -rrb- leader arthur scargill to petition the national coal board over the planned closure of a coke works .
middle class appeal the young " london barrister , " as local newspapers described him , fought for his constituents ' jobs in traditional heavy industries but he also made no effort to hide his belief that the labour party had to modernise - and broaden its appeal to middle class voters - or die .
in an article for the northern echo , he argued " to win power for the low-paid , unemployed and the north , we must also appeal to the 60 % of the population in private housing , to the employed on the average wage and to the south " .

at one party meeting , he was shocked to find himself being denounced as a " traitor to socialism " by labour mp dennis skinner , after he made a speech urging reform .
" it was a very early lesson in politics because i said exactly what i thought .
i said we were living in a new age but we were talking like everybody had just got black and white tvs , " he later recalled in an interview with the northern echo .
cherie had also contested the 1983 general election , but after losing the no-hope seat of thanet in kent , she threw herself into her legal career , going on to become one of the country 's leading human rights lawyers .
by the end of blair 's first year in parliament , she had also given birth to the first of the couple 's four children , euan .
that first year also saw blair gain a crucial ally in his mission to modernise the labour party .
new agenda colleagues recall him being initially somewhat in awe of gordon brown , the young scottish mp he shared an office with in parliament .
blair 's favourite food bananas , beck 's lager and pistachio nuts - maid who served blair at labour conference fresh fettucini garnished with an exotic sauce of olive oil , sun-dried tomatoes and capers - nspcc islington cook book fish and chips - sedgefield labour party election leaflet unlike him , brown had been steeped in labour politics from a very early age and already had a knack for making headlines .
but together with peter mandelson , then a senior aide to party leader neil kinnock , the pair set about laying the foundations for what would become new labour .
blair , brown and mandelson were determined to make labour electable again by ditching unpopular labour policies , such as unilateral disarmament , and forging a new agenda marrying free market economics with social justice .
but they also wanted to improve the way labour communicated with voters .
focus groups , previously distrusted by labour politicians - if they had even heard of such things at all - would became key tools in shaping the party 's message .
advertising executives and pollsters , previously treated with suspicion by left wing politicians , were drafted into the modernisers ' inner circle to advise on presentation .
leadership deal blair and brown were promoted rapidly through the shadow cabinet ranks , but when it came to who would stand as the " modernising " candidate when leader john smith died of a heart attack in 1994 , their supporters were split .
many assumed brown , as the older of the two , would take precedence .
blair 's favourite music the beatles the rolling stones led zeppelin free bruce springsteen u2 coldplay the foo fighters simply red but the shadow chancellor hesitated , eventually agreeing to give blair a clear run at the top job .
the deal was supposedly struck over dinner at granita , an islington restaurant , with blair reportedly pledging to hand over to brown after two terms - and to give him , as chancellor , unprecedented control over the domestic agenda .
but the precise terms of any deal remain hotly contested .
what appears to have been decisive is the decision of mandelson to switch his backing from brown to blair - believing the shadow home secretary to be the better communicator of the two .
it was a decision that caused a " rift " in new labour from the beginning , mandelson recently admitted , with the distrust and feuding between blair and brown , or more often their respective supporters , coming to dominate british politics .
soundbites the new labour leader was initially seen as something of a political lightweight .
he had easily defeated left wingers john prescott and margaret beckett to snatch the leadership - and he had set about reforming the party with single-minded determination - but he was dubbed " bambi " by the press and cartoonists depicted him as a slick , permanently grinning public relations man .
like many in the labour party , blair believed neil kinnock 's chances of becoming prime minister in 1992 had been destroyed by a hostile tabloid press .
british troops saw much action during the blair years he was determined not to let that happen to him and he hired tough talking former tabloid journalist alastair campbell to sharpen up its press operation .
the pair would obsess over every aspect of blair 's image , placing bets on which of their carefully crafted soundbites would make it on to the evening news bulletins .
campbell normally won .
blair also courted showbusiness personalities - attempting to align labour with a new wave of british pop stars and artists emerging in the mid 1990s , dubbed by the style press " cool britannia " .
his speeches at the time bordered on the messianic , tapping into what he saw as a pre-millennial mood of optimism .
sleaze promise his specific policies were modest in scope , but his rhetoric was dizzying : he promised nothing less than a country reborn , sweeping away the " sleaze " and drift of the major years .
and he deployed all of his charm and charisma on tv chat shows , showing himself to be a natural in front of the cameras , in contrast to the more stilted major .
it worked .
blair swept to a landslide victory in 1997 , becoming , at 43 , the youngest prime minister in nearly 200 years .
blair 's family man image was a key part of his appeal always nervous on polling day , he was still gloomily contemplating a possible coalition with the liberal democrats , even as the scale of his victory was becoming obvious .
two hours after polls closed - with the early results indicating a landslide - he ordered supporters in the royal festival hall to stop celebrating for fear of appearing complacent or " triumphalist " .
he need not have feared .
blair entered downing street on a wave of optimism and good will , on 2 may 1997 .
he promised to restore trust in politics and breathe new life into britain 's tired institutions .
in the early weeks of his premiership , he held a series of glittering receptions in downing street to celebrate his victory .
but behind the scenes , he was haunted by the splits and in-fighting he believed had destroyed previous labour administrations .
honeymoon period he continued to rule over his party with an iron will , battling to impose his own choice of candidates in the first london mayoral contest and devolved assembly elections and ensuring ministers remained " on message " at all times .
wary of the civil service 's ability to deliver his policy goals , he centralised power in downing street .
he preferred to make decisions with a small band of trusted advisors , rather than through more formal cabinet procedures , prompting accusations of " cronyism " and claims he was running a presidential style of government .
the public backlash against iraq prompted thoughts of quitting the media manipulation techniques that had served him so well in opposition were also beginning to earn his government a reputation for " spin " .
but blair 's personality - and his ability to connect with people through television - continued to be central to labour 's appeal .
within weeks of being elected , he delivered a halting , emotionally-charged eulogy to princess diana , on the morning of her death .
it was a performance which seemed to capture the public mood .
he would later insist that the phrase " the people 's princess " was his own and not alastair campbell 's invention , as cynics claimed .
euro decision then , when he was engulfed by his first party funding scandal , accused of offering favours in return for a £ 1m donation from formula one boss bernie ecclestone , he again took to the airwaves , pleading with the public to keep their faith in him .
" i think most people who have dealt with me , think i 'm a pretty straight sort of guy and i am , " he told the bbc 's john humphrys .
blair 's honeymoon period with the electorate felt like it would go on forever and his popularity received a further boost in 2000 , when cherie announced that , at the age of 45 , she was to become a mother again .
leo blair became the first legitimate child to be born to a serving prime minister in 150 years .
blair holidays 1997 : tuscany , guest of geoffrey robinson , labour mp and businessman 1998 : tuscany , prince girolamo strozzi , law professor and family friend 1999 : tuscany , vannino chiti , tuscan president 2001 : ariege , southern france , sir martin keene , high court judge and family friend 2003 - 06 : barbados , sir cliff richard , singer 2004 : sardinia , silvio berlusconi , italian premier and media mogul 2006 : barbados , sir anthony bamford , jcb boss and tory donor 2007 : miami , robin gibb , bee gees member blair swept to another landslide election victory in 2001 , pledging to deliver improvements to health and education he had been promising since 1997 .
the timidity and reliance on focus groups that had characterised much of his first term began to be replaced by more sure-footed and decisive leadership .
he had already angered the left by talking about the " scars on his back " from his early , tentative attempts to make the public services more efficient .
now he was determined to be more bold in his approach , reasoning that the unions could hardly complain about market reforms with record amounts of cash pouring into schools and hospitals .
the only cloud on blair 's horizon was his worsening relationship with gordon brown , which , observers said , alternated between table-thumping rows and sullen periods of silence .
fresh mandate emboldened by his fresh mandate , he appointed blairites to key positions across government , from david blunkett at the home office to estelle morris at education , in an attempt to wrest control of the domestic agenda from the treasury .
but it was brown , who was said to be increasingly obsessed with becoming prime minister , that held all the aces when it came to the one thing blair really wanted .
he had long planned to take britain into the euro , believing it would define his legacy and finally place britain at the " heart of europe " after years on the margins under the conservatives .
but brown was less convinced of the case for joining the euro and , crucially , he had seized control of the entry process , devising five " economic tests " that had to be passed before britain ditched the pound .
a referendum was promised for 2003 , but by then the economic argument for the euro had been lost .
the five tests had not been passed , brown decreed , and the single currency was kicked into the long grass , along with blair 's dreams of a european legacy .
iraq but by then blair had found another , larger mission - one that really would write his name into the history books , for better or worse .
blair had always taken a single-minded approach to foreign policy .
he appeared to enjoy the company of the no-nonsense men of action he found in the military .
they made a refreshing change from the naturally cautious civil servants that surrounded him in downing street - or the left-wing mps and union leaders who it seemed to him were forever trying to stand in the way of progress .
early successes in sierra leone and kosovo convinced blair of the value of military action in pursuit of humanitarian aims .
the blairs ' marriage has remained solid throughout colleagues said his christian faith gave him a clearer sense of moral purpose than many of those around him - but it was not a subject he was ever comfortable talking about in public .
he had forged a close relationship with us president bill clinton during his first term in office , with whom he shared a centre-left political philosophy .
but to the surprise and dismay of many in his own party , including his loyal deputy john prescott , he formed an even closer bond with clinton 's successor , the republican george w bush .
the 11 september attacks moved the relationship on to a different level .
failure blair toured the world , shoring up support for the bush administration , utterly convinced of his own powers of persuasion and advocacy ; instinctively believing britain 's place was at america 's side in her hour of need .
but it was the 2003 decision to invade iraq - without a un mandate and in the teeth of bitter opposition at home and abroad - that would link the two leaders together in the public mind for ever .
blair had drawn on every last ounce of his persuasive skill to make the case for war to mps and the wider public .
blair and brown buried the hatchet for the 2005 election campaign but the subsequent failure to find weapons of mass destruction in iraq appeared to confirm many people 's worst suspicions about him - that he relied too much on spin and was not to be trusted .
in the public backlash that followed he briefly considered quitting .
he was persuaded to carry on by cabinet supporters but in october 2004 he surprised everyone by announcing he would not seek a fourth term in office if he won the next election .
the announcement had been designed to end speculation about his health - he had undergone an operation to correct an irregular heart beat .
' lame duck ' but it only succeeded in sparking more damaging speculation about his departure date , leading opponents to brand him a " lame duck " premier .
for the 2005 general election campaign , alastair campbell devised what came to be known as the " masochism strategy " , with blair allowing voters to vent their anger about iraq at him in a series of tv debates .
he became the first labour leader to win three consecutive terms in office but any elation was short-lived .
his share of the popular vote was the lowest on record for any prime minister .
his self-belief and powers of persuasion remained undimmed .
over one remarkable 24 hour period , he flew to singapore to help london land the 2012 olympics - punching the air with glee as he did so - before flying back to gleneagles , in scotland , to unveil a debt relief package for africa .
they were the two of the biggest achievements of his premiership .
blair 's final conference speech was an emotional occasion but they were instantly overshadowed by the 7 july attack on the london transport system - the first suicide attacks mainland britain had ever witnessed .
his opinion poll ratings improved in the immediate aftermath of 7 july , as he once again proved his ability to capture the nation 's mood in a time of crisis .
but when a bombers ' taped testimony was released blaming the attack on blair 's foreign policy , it threw the spotlight back on to iraq and his refusal to apologise for what his opponents saw as a terrible miscalculation .
blair was convinced britain was engaged , with america , in a global " war on terror " but he was having trouble bringing many in his party with him .
final straw when he failed to condemn israel 's bombing of lebanon , once again standing four square with george bush in the face of mounting criticism around the world , it was the final straw for many normally loyal labour mps .
a series of resignations by junior ministers , who believed his failure to name a departure date was damaging the party , underlined his weakened position and he was forced to announce he would be gone by september 2007 .
it was not , he confessed , the way he had wanted it to end .
tony blair has been sedgefield 's mp for nearly 25 years in his own mind , and that of his supporters , he was a prime minister at the peak of his powers .
his extraordinary farewell speech at the 2006 party conference in manchester reminded even his harshest labour party critics what they would be losing when he was gone .
the charisma that had served him so well over the years was still intact .
the difference was that he no longer agonised over his own popularity .
it was enough for him to know that he had " done the right thing " .
his final months in office were dogged by a police investigation into allegations he had nominated party donors for peerages .
he became the first serving prime minister to be interviewed as part of a police investigation , although downing street was keen to stress he was being treated as a witness .
the affair had its origins before the 2005 general election when blair - concerned by the size of the tories ' war chest - sought massive loans from a series of wealthy individuals , which he kept secret from all but a few members of his inner circle .
even labour 's treasurer was kept in the dark .
i am not going to beg for my character in front of anyone .
people can make up their own mind about me tony blair four of the lenders were subsequently nominated for peerages , but were rejected by the independent appointments ' commission , sparking opposition claims they had been " sold " honours .
blair was accused of flouting his own rules on party funding , introduced as part of his drive to " clean up " politics .
parliamentary standards commissioner sir alastair graham accused him of destroying trust in politics , saying the issue would be associated with his time in office in the way " sleaze " was with john major .
but rather than pleading to be trusted , as he had in 1997 during the bernie ecclestone affair , blair simply refused to talk about the allegations .
" i am not going to beg for my character in front of anyone .
people can make up their own mind about me , " he told the bbc in february .
conviction politician he said he had " a deep respect for the british people and it 's been an honour and privilege to lead them " .
but he said he had " changed " over the past 10 years .
he was a " different sort of person " now , who was less concerned about being " liked " .
blair had been hardened by a decade in office .
he had become a conviction politician - a very different character to the one that had first walked into downing street in 1997 , guitar case in hand .

at school he drove his teachers to distraction , constantly questioning their authority .
at university , he acted out his rock star fantasies as the lead singer of a band .
few at that stage would have predicted a career in the sober world of politics , even though blair 's charisma and ability to charm people were evident from an early age .
blair was known as a cheeky , argumentative schoolboy the story of his rise to power is certainly not a rags to riches tale - he was born with every advantage in life - but it is no less remarkable for that .
it is the story of how a middle class , privately-educated barrister - the son of a would-be tory mp - went on to become the most successful leader in the history of the labour party , profoundly changing it and the country in the process .
and how a man once seen as a lightweight - preoccupied with his own image and popularity - became one of the most powerful and controversial figures on the world stage .
tory leanings anthony charles lynton blair was born in 1953 in edinburgh , the second son of hazel and leo blair .
the student tony blair had a rebellious streak he spent the first few years of his life in adelaide , australia , where leo lectured in law at the city 's university .
they returned to the uk in late 1950s and blair spent the remainder of his childhood in durham , where he was a day pupil at the fee-paying choristers school .
leo was chairman of the local conservative association but had to abandon his ambition to become a tory mp when he suffered a stroke .
his political leanings appeared to have rubbed off on the young tony , who stood in a mock school election as the conservative candidate .
' maddening ' blair 's teachers at exclusive edinburgh boarding school fettes recall a cheeky , rebellious figure ; a talented actor who loved being the centre of attention and who cultivated a " cool " image among his peers .
blair 's cv born : 6 may 1953 educated : choristers school , fettes , oxford family : married , four children 1976 : barrister specialising in trade union and employment law 1983 : labour mp for sedgefield , shadow city spokesman 1984 - 87 : shadow trade and industry minister 1987 - 88 : shadow energy secretary 1989 - 92 : shadow employment secretary 1992 - 94 : shadow home secretary 1994 - 97 : opposition leader 1997 - prime minister " tony was full of life .
maddening at times , full of himself and very argumentative , " blair 's housemaster eric anderson told blair 's biographer john rentoul .
" he was an expert at testing the rules to the limit , and i would n't swear that he stuck rigidly to the rules on not drinking , smoking or breaking bounds .
but he was a live wire and fun to have around . "
at the age of 17 he was given " six of the best " for persistently flouting the school rules .
then he was threatened with expulsion .
it was his girlfriend 's father , lord mackenzie stewart , an old fettesian and cross bench peer , who came to the rescue , striking a deal with the school that allowed blair to spend the final few weeks of the summer term living with him .
mackenzie stewart 's daughter , amanda , was the first girl to be admitted to fettes .
typically , it was the super-confident blair who beat the 440 other boys to win her heart .
rock music blair also met charlie falconer while at fettes .
the man who would later become his lord chancellor was a pupil at the rival edinburgh academy .
blair left fettes with three a levels and a place at st john 's college , oxford , to study law .
the young barrister impressed michael foot with his enthusiasm like many teenage boys in the late 1960s he was besotted by rock music .
he idolised mick jagger but he also dreamed of wielding power behind the scenes , as a manager or promoter .
before taking up his place at oxford , he headed for london , where he spent a carefree year " managing " student rock bands and putting on gigs and discos with his friend alan collenette .
to make ends meet , the pair stacked shelves at barkers food hall , in kensington .
at oxford he briefly fronted a rock band , ugly rumours .
friends recall his charismatic stage presence , but also his professional attitude .
trainee barrister " he even wanted to rehearse , " said band mate mark ellen .
but blair was also developing a more thoughtful side .
he began to talk about left wing politics and , unusually for the times , became increasingly serious about his christian faith , taking confirmation classes .
he lost his mother to cancer while he was at oxford , which also appears to have profoundly affected his outlook .
in his first year at the university , he befriended an australian priest , peter thompson , with whom he would debate social issues and theology late into the night .
blair later credited thompson with awakening in him an interest in christian socialism , and a desire for social change .
how tony blair has aged during 10 years in office enlarge image blair was also unusual , in the pot-smoking student milieu of the early 1970s , in that he appears to have avoided drugs .
there are also few reports of him being incapacitated by drink .
his only real vice was smoking cigarettes , a habit wife cherie later made him quit .
he smoked his last one 15 minutes before their wedding .
blair left oxford with a second class degree and in 1976 became a trainee barrister in the chambers of derry irvine , who would later become his first lord chancellor .
it was here that he met cherie booth , a fellow pupil in irvine 's chambers .
she had a first class degree and was seen as being more of a high flyer than blair .
activist friends recall a christmas party , during a game which involved passing a balloon between their knees , when it became obvious they would be more than just colleagues .

blairs plan to join buildings together to create extra space " the next day we went out to lunch and hours later we were still there , " blair later recalled .
" i found her immensely physically attractive and i wanted her as a friend as well . "
the couple married in 1980 , setting up home in hackney , east london , in a £ 40,000 end-of-terrace house , and threw themselves into local labour party politics .
blair had joined the party shortly after leaving oxford , but it was only now that he became more involved as an activist , encouraged by neighbour - and future home secretary - charles clarke , who shared his centre-left outlook .
in 1981 , through his father-in-law , the actor and left wing campaigner tony booth , blair contacted labour mp tom pendry to ask for help in becoming an mp .

but together with peter mandelson , then a senior aide to party leader neil kinnock , the pair set about laying the foundations for what would become new labour .
blair , brown and mandelson were determined to make labour electable again by ditching unpopular labour policies , such as unilateral disarmament , and forging a new agenda marrying free market economics with social justice .
but they also wanted to improve the way labour communicated with voters .
focus groups , previously distrusted by labour politicians - if they had even heard of such things at all - would became key tools in shaping the party 's message .
advertising executives and pollsters , previously treated with suspicion by left wing politicians , were drafted into the modernisers ' inner circle to advise on presentation .
leadership deal blair and brown were promoted rapidly through the shadow cabinet ranks , but when it came to who would stand as the " modernising " candidate when leader john smith died of a heart attack in 1994 , their supporters were split .
many assumed brown , as the older of the two , would take precedence .
blair 's favourite music the beatles the rolling stones led zeppelin free bruce springsteen u2 coldplay the foo fighters simply red but the shadow chancellor hesitated , eventually agreeing to give blair a clear run at the top job .
the deal was supposedly struck over dinner at granita , an islington restaurant , with blair reportedly pledging to hand over to brown after two terms - and to give him , as chancellor , unprecedented control over the domestic agenda .
but the precise terms of any deal remain hotly contested .
what appears to have been decisive is the decision of mandelson to switch his backing from brown to blair - believing the shadow home secretary to be the better communicator of the two .
it was a decision that caused a " rift " in new labour from the beginning , mandelson recently admitted , with the distrust and feuding between blair and brown , or more often their respective supporters , coming to dominate british politics .
soundbites the new labour leader was initially seen as something of a political lightweight .
he had easily defeated left wingers john prescott and margaret beckett to snatch the leadership - and he had set about reforming the party with single-minded determination - but he was dubbed " bambi " by the press and cartoonists depicted him as a slick , permanently grinning public relations man .
like many in the labour party , blair believed neil kinnock 's chances of becoming prime minister in 1992 had been destroyed by a hostile tabloid press .
british troops saw much action during the blair years he was determined not to let that happen to him and he hired tough talking former tabloid journalist alastair campbell to sharpen up its press operation .
the pair would obsess over every aspect of blair 's image , placing bets on which of their carefully crafted soundbites would make it on to the evening news bulletins .
campbell normally won .
blair also courted showbusiness personalities - attempting to align labour with a new wave of british pop stars and artists emerging in the mid 1990s , dubbed by the style press " cool britannia " .
his speeches at the time bordered on the messianic , tapping into what he saw as a pre-millennial mood of optimism .
sleaze promise his specific policies were modest in scope , but his rhetoric was dizzying : he promised nothing less than a country reborn , sweeping away the " sleaze " and drift of the major years .
and he deployed all of his charm and charisma on tv chat shows , showing himself to be a natural in front of the cameras , in contrast to the more stilted major .
it worked .
blair swept to a landslide victory in 1997 , becoming , at 43 , the youngest prime minister in nearly 200 years .
blair 's family man image was a key part of his appeal always nervous on polling day , he was still gloomily contemplating a possible coalition with the liberal democrats , even as the scale of his victory was becoming obvious .
two hours after polls closed - with the early results indicating a landslide - he ordered supporters in the royal festival hall to stop celebrating for fear of appearing complacent or " triumphalist " .
he need not have feared .
blair entered downing street on a wave of optimism and good will , on 2 may 1997 .
he promised to restore trust in politics and breathe new life into britain 's tired institutions .
in the early weeks of his premiership , he held a series of glittering receptions in downing street to celebrate his victory .
but behind the scenes , he was haunted by the splits and in-fighting he believed had destroyed previous labour administrations .
honeymoon period he continued to rule over his party with an iron will , battling to impose his own choice of candidates in the first london mayoral contest and devolved assembly elections and ensuring ministers remained " on message " at all times .
wary of the civil service 's ability to deliver his policy goals , he centralised power in downing street .
he preferred to make decisions with a small band of trusted advisors , rather than through more formal cabinet procedures , prompting accusations of " cronyism " and claims he was running a presidential style of government .
the public backlash against iraq prompted thoughts of quitting the media manipulation techniques that had served him so well in opposition were also beginning to earn his government a reputation for " spin " .
but blair 's personality - and his ability to connect with people through television - continued to be central to labour 's appeal .
within weeks of being elected , he delivered a halting , emotionally-charged eulogy to princess diana , on the morning of her death .
it was a performance which seemed to capture the public mood .
he would later insist that the phrase " the people 's princess " was his own and not alastair campbell 's invention , as cynics claimed .
euro decision then , when he was engulfed by his first party funding scandal , accused of offering favours in return for a £ 1m donation from formula one boss bernie ecclestone , he again took to the airwaves , pleading with the public to keep their faith in him .
" i think most people who have dealt with me , think i 'm a pretty straight sort of guy and i am , " he told the bbc 's john humphrys .
blair 's honeymoon period with the electorate felt like it would go on forever and his popularity received a further boost in 2000 , when cherie announced that , at the age of 45 , she was to become a mother again .
leo blair became the first legitimate child to be born to a serving prime minister in 150 years .
blair holidays 1997 : tuscany , guest of geoffrey robinson , labour mp and businessman 1998 : tuscany , prince girolamo strozzi , law professor and family friend 1999 : tuscany , vannino chiti , tuscan president 2001 : ariege , southern france , sir martin keene , high court judge and family friend 2003 - 06 : barbados , sir cliff richard , singer 2004 : sardinia , silvio berlusconi , italian premier and media mogul 2006 : barbados , sir anthony bamford , jcb boss and tory donor 2007 : miami , robin gibb , bee gees member blair swept to another landslide election victory in 2001 , pledging to deliver improvements to health and education he had been promising since 1997 .
the timidity and reliance on focus groups that had characterised much of his first term began to be replaced by more sure-footed and decisive leadership .
he had already angered the left by talking about the " scars on his back " from his early , tentative attempts to make the public services more efficient .
now he was determined to be more bold in his approach , reasoning that the unions could hardly complain about market reforms with record amounts of cash pouring into schools and hospitals .
the only cloud on blair 's horizon was his worsening relationship with gordon brown , which , observers said , alternated between table-thumping rows and sullen periods of silence .
fresh mandate emboldened by his fresh mandate , he appointed blairites to key positions across government , from david blunkett at the home office to estelle morris at education , in an attempt to wrest control of the domestic agenda from the treasury .
but it was brown , who was said to be increasingly obsessed with becoming prime minister , that held all the aces when it came to the one thing blair really wanted .
he had long planned to take britain into the euro , believing it would define his legacy and finally place britain at the " heart of europe " after years on the margins under the conservatives .
but brown was less convinced of the case for joining the euro and , crucially , he had seized control of the entry process , devising five " economic tests " that had to be passed before britain ditched the pound .
a referendum was promised for 2003 , but by then the economic argument for the euro had been lost .
the five tests had not been passed , brown decreed , and the single currency was kicked into the long grass , along with blair 's dreams of a european legacy .
iraq but by then blair had found another , larger mission - one that really would write his name into the history books , for better or worse .
blair had always taken a single-minded approach to foreign policy .
he appeared to enjoy the company of the no-nonsense men of action he found in the military .
they made a refreshing change from the naturally cautious civil servants that surrounded him in downing street - or the left-wing mps and union leaders who it seemed to him were forever trying to stand in the way of progress .
early successes in sierra leone and kosovo convinced blair of the value of military action in pursuit of humanitarian aims .
the blairs ' marriage has remained solid throughout colleagues said his christian faith gave him a clearer sense of moral purpose than many of those around him - but it was not a subject he was ever comfortable talking about in public .
he had forged a close relationship with us president bill clinton during his first term in office , with whom he shared a centre-left political philosophy .
but to the surprise and dismay of many in his own party , including his loyal deputy john prescott , he formed an even closer bond with clinton 's successor , the republican george w bush .
the 11 september attacks moved the relationship on to a different level .
failure blair toured the world , shoring up support for the bush administration , utterly convinced of his own powers of persuasion and advocacy ; instinctively believing britain 's place was at america 's side in her hour of need .
but it was the 2003 decision to invade iraq - without a un mandate and in the teeth of bitter opposition at home and abroad - that would link the two leaders together in the public mind for ever .
blair had drawn on every last ounce of his persuasive skill to make the case for war to mps and the wider public .
blair and brown buried the hatchet for the 2005 election campaign but the subsequent failure to find weapons of mass destruction in iraq appeared to confirm many people 's worst suspicions about him - that he relied too much on spin and was not to be trusted .
in the public backlash that followed he briefly considered quitting .
he was persuaded to carry on by cabinet supporters but in october 2004 he surprised everyone by announcing he would not seek a fourth term in office if he won the next election .
the announcement had been designed to end speculation about his health - he had undergone an operation to correct an irregular heart beat .
' lame duck ' but it only succeeded in sparking more damaging speculation about his departure date , leading opponents to brand him a " lame duck " premier .
for the 2005 general election campaign , alastair campbell devised what came to be known as the " masochism strategy " , with blair allowing voters to vent their anger about iraq at him in a series of tv debates .
he became the first labour leader to win three consecutive terms in office but any elation was short-lived .
his share of the popular vote was the lowest on record for any prime minister .
his self-belief and powers of persuasion remained undimmed .
over one remarkable 24 hour period , he flew to singapore to help london land the 2012 olympics - punching the air with glee as he did so - before flying back to gleneagles , in scotland , to unveil a debt relief package for africa .
they were the two of the biggest achievements of his premiership .
blair 's final conference speech was an emotional occasion but they were instantly overshadowed by the 7 july attack on the london transport system - the first suicide attacks mainland britain had ever witnessed .
his opinion poll ratings improved in the immediate aftermath of 7 july , as he once again proved his ability to capture the nation 's mood in a time of crisis .
but when a bombers ' taped testimony was released blaming the attack on blair 's foreign policy , it threw the spotlight back on to iraq and his refusal to apologise for what his opponents saw as a terrible miscalculation .
blair was convinced britain was engaged , with america , in a global " war on terror " but he was having trouble bringing many in his party with him .
final straw when he failed to condemn israel 's bombing of lebanon , once again standing four square with george bush in the face of mounting criticism around the world , it was the final straw for many normally loyal labour mps .
a series of resignations by junior ministers , who believed his failure to name a departure date was damaging the party , underlined his weakened position and he was forced to announce he would be gone by september 2007 .
it was not , he confessed , the way he had wanted it to end .
tony blair has been sedgefield 's mp for nearly 25 years in his own mind , and that of his supporters , he was a prime minister at the peak of his powers .
his extraordinary farewell speech at the 2006 party conference in manchester reminded even his harshest labour party critics what they would be losing when he was gone .
the charisma that had served him so well over the years was still intact .
the difference was that he no longer agonised over his own popularity .
it was enough for him to know that he had " done the right thing " .
his final months in office were dogged by a police investigation into allegations he had nominated party donors for peerages .
he became the first serving prime minister to be interviewed as part of a police investigation , although downing street was keen to stress he was being treated as a witness .
the affair had its origins before the 2005 general election when blair - concerned by the size of the tories ' war chest - sought massive loans from a series of wealthy individuals , which he kept secret from all but a few members of his inner circle .
even labour 's treasurer was kept in the dark .
i am not going to beg for my character in front of anyone .
people can make up their own mind about me tony blair four of the lenders were subsequently nominated for peerages , but were rejected by the independent appointments ' commission , sparking opposition claims they had been " sold " honours .
blair was accused of flouting his own rules on party funding , introduced as part of his drive to " clean up " politics .
parliamentary standards commissioner sir alastair graham accused him of destroying trust in politics , saying the issue would be associated with his time in office in the way " sleaze " was with john major .
but rather than pleading to be trusted , as he had in 1997 during the bernie ecclestone affair , blair simply refused to talk about the allegations .
" i am not going to beg for my character in front of anyone .
people can make up their own mind about me , " he told the bbc in february .
conviction politician he said he had " a deep respect for the british people and it 's been an honour and privilege to lead them " .
but he said he had " changed " over the past 10 years .
he was a " different sort of person " now , who was less concerned about being " liked " .
blair had been hardened by a decade in office .
he had become a conviction politician - a very different character to the one that had first walked into downing street in 1997 , guitar case in hand .

at school he drove his teachers to distraction , constantly questioning their authority .
at university , he acted out his rock star fantasies as the lead singer of a band .
few at that stage would have predicted a career in the sober world of politics , even though blair 's charisma and ability to charm people were evident from an early age .
blair was known as a cheeky , argumentative schoolboy the story of his rise to power is certainly not a rags to riches tale - he was born with every advantage in life - but it is no less remarkable for that .
it is the story of how a middle class , privately-educated barrister - the son of a would-be tory mp - went on to become the most successful leader in the history of the labour party , profoundly changing it and the country in the process .
and how a man once seen as a lightweight - preoccupied with his own image and popularity - became one of the most powerful and controversial figures on the world stage .
tory leanings anthony charles lynton blair was born in 1953 in edinburgh , the second son of hazel and leo blair .
the student tony blair had a rebellious streak he spent the first few years of his life in adelaide , australia , where leo lectured in law at the city 's university .
they returned to the uk in late 1950s and blair spent the remainder of his childhood in durham , where he was a day pupil at the fee-paying choristers school .
leo was chairman of the local conservative association but had to abandon his ambition to become a tory mp when he suffered a stroke .
his political leanings appeared to have rubbed off on the young tony , who stood in a mock school election as the conservative candidate .
' maddening ' blair 's teachers at exclusive edinburgh boarding school fettes recall a cheeky , rebellious figure ; a talented actor who loved being the centre of attention and who cultivated a " cool " image among his peers .
blair 's cv born : 6 may 1953 educated : choristers school , fettes , oxford family : married , four children 1976 : barrister specialising in trade union and employment law 1983 : labour mp for sedgefield , shadow city spokesman 1984 - 87 : shadow trade and industry minister 1987 - 88 : shadow energy secretary 1989 - 92 : shadow employment secretary 1992 - 94 : shadow home secretary 1994 - 97 : opposition leader 1997 - prime minister " tony was full of life .
maddening at times , full of himself and very argumentative , " blair 's housemaster eric anderson told blair 's biographer john rentoul .
" he was an expert at testing the rules to the limit , and i would n't swear that he stuck rigidly to the rules on not drinking , smoking or breaking bounds .
but he was a live wire and fun to have around . "
at the age of 17 he was given " six of the best " for persistently flouting the school rules .
then he was threatened with expulsion .
it was his girlfriend 's father , lord mackenzie stewart , an old fettesian and cross bench peer , who came to the rescue , striking a deal with the school that allowed blair to spend the final few weeks of the summer term living with him .
mackenzie stewart 's daughter , amanda , was the first girl to be admitted to fettes .
typically , it was the super-confident blair who beat the 440 other boys to win her heart .
rock music blair also met charlie falconer while at fettes .
the man who would later become his lord chancellor was a pupil at the rival edinburgh academy .
blair left fettes with three a levels and a place at st john 's college , oxford , to study law .
the young barrister impressed michael foot with his enthusiasm like many teenage boys in the late 1960s he was besotted by rock music .
he idolised mick jagger but he also dreamed of wielding power behind the scenes , as a manager or promoter .
before taking up his place at oxford , he headed for london , where he spent a carefree year " managing " student rock bands and putting on gigs and discos with his friend alan collenette .
to make ends meet , the pair stacked shelves at barkers food hall , in kensington .
at oxford he briefly fronted a rock band , ugly rumours .
friends recall his charismatic stage presence , but also his professional attitude .
trainee barrister " he even wanted to rehearse , " said band mate mark ellen .
but blair was also developing a more thoughtful side .
he began to talk about left wing politics and , unusually for the times , became increasingly serious about his christian faith , taking confirmation classes .
he lost his mother to cancer while he was at oxford , which also appears to have profoundly affected his outlook .
in his first year at the university , he befriended an australian priest , peter thompson , with whom he would debate social issues and theology late into the night .
blair later credited thompson with awakening in him an interest in christian socialism , and a desire for social change .
how tony blair has aged during 10 years in office enlarge image blair was also unusual , in the pot-smoking student milieu of the early 1970s , in that he appears to have avoided drugs .
there are also few reports of him being incapacitated by drink .
his only real vice was smoking cigarettes , a habit wife cherie later made him quit .
he smoked his last one 15 minutes before their wedding .
blair left oxford with a second class degree and in 1976 became a trainee barrister in the chambers of derry irvine , who would later become his first lord chancellor .
it was here that he met cherie booth , a fellow pupil in irvine 's chambers .
she had a first class degree and was seen as being more of a high flyer than blair .
activist friends recall a christmas party , during a game which involved passing a balloon between their knees , when it became obvious they would be more than just colleagues .
blair properties 1980 : mapledene road , hackney , bought £ 40,000 , sold 1986 £ 80,000 1983 : myrobella , trimdon village , nr sedgefield , bought £ 30,000 1986 : stavordale road , islington , bought £ 120,000 , sold 1993 £ 200,000 1993 : richmond crescent , islington , bought £ 375,000 , sold 1997 £ 615,000 1997:11 downing street - rent free flat next door to prime minister 's traditional residence 2002 : clifton , bristol , two flats bought for £ 525,000 in total 2004 : connaught square , bayswater , bought £ 3.6m 2007 : bayswater .
two bed house behind connaught square property , bought £ 800,000 .
blairs plan to join buildings together to create extra space " the next day we went out to lunch and hours later we were still there , " blair later recalled .
" i found her immensely physically attractive and i wanted her as a friend as well . "
the couple married in 1980 , setting up home in hackney , east london , in a £ 40,000 end-of-terrace house , and threw themselves into local labour party politics .
blair had joined the party shortly after leaving oxford , but it was only now that he became more involved as an activist , encouraged by neighbour - and future home secretary - charles clarke , who shared his centre-left outlook .
in 1981 , through his father-in-law , the actor and left wing campaigner tony booth , blair contacted labour mp tom pendry to ask for help in becoming an mp .
pendry gave him a tour of the commons and advised him to stand for selection as a candidate in a forthcoming by-election in beaconsfield .
blair never stood a chance in such a safe conservative seat but he managed to attract the attention of labour leader michael foot , who was impressed by his enthusiasm and told him he had a " big future in politics " .
manifesto concerns nevertheless , it looked as if he would miss out on a chance to contest the 1983 general election .
it was only at the very last minute that he found a vacant seat , in the newly-created constituency of sedgefield , near where he grew up in county durham , securing the nomination ahead of several sitting mps and his future chief whip hilary armstrong , the daughter of a local labour mp .
the 1983 labour manifesto was one of the most left wing ever to be put before the british electorate .
it included commitments to nationalisation of industry and unilateral nuclear disarmament .
presentation was crucial to the new labour project blair made it clear privately to john burton , his election agent and mentor , that he did not agree with key parts of it , particularly proposals to withdraw britain from the eu .
his victory , in a rock solid labour area , was assured , although labour had a bad night nationally .
the early 1980s was a grim era of factory closures and job losses in the north east of england , with unemployment in the former mining villages that made up most of blair 's constituency soaring above 20 % .
within weeks of entering parliament , blair , who at 30 was the youngest labour mp , led a delegation of pit men and their families to london , where he joined forces with national union of mineworkers -lrb- num -rrb- leader arthur scargill to petition the national coal board over the planned closure of a coke works .
middle class appeal the young " london barrister , " as local newspapers described him , fought for his constituents ' jobs in traditional heavy industries but he also made no effort to hide his belief that the labour party had to modernise - and broaden its appeal to middle class voters - or die .
in an article for the northern echo , he argued " to win power for the low-paid , unemployed and the north , we must also appeal to the 60 % of the population in private housing , to the employed on the average wage and to the south " .

at one party meeting , he was shocked to find himself being denounced as a " traitor to socialism " by labour mp dennis skinner , after he made a speech urging reform .
" it was a very early lesson in politics because i said exactly what i thought .
i said we were living in a new age but we were talking like everybody had just got black and white tvs , " he later recalled in an interview with the northern echo .
cherie had also contested the 1983 general election , but after losing the no-hope seat of thanet in kent , she threw herself into her legal career , going on to become one of the country 's leading human rights lawyers .
by the end of blair 's first year in parliament , she had also given birth to the first of the couple 's four children , euan .
that first year also saw blair gain a crucial ally in his mission to modernise the labour party .
new agenda colleagues recall him being initially somewhat in awe of gordon brown , the young scottish mp he shared an office with in parliament .
blair 's favourite food bananas , beck 's lager and pistachio nuts - maid who served blair at labour conference fresh fettucini garnished with an exotic sauce of olive oil , sun-dried tomatoes and capers - nspcc islington cook book fish and chips - sedgefield labour party election leaflet unlike him , brown had been steeped in labour politics from a very early age and already had a knack for making headlines .
but together with peter mandelson , then a senior aide to party leader neil kinnock , the pair set about laying the foundations for what would become new labour .
blair , brown and mandelson were determined to make labour electable again by ditching unpopular labour policies , such as unilateral disarmament , and forging a new agenda marrying free market economics with social justice .
but they also wanted to improve the way labour communicated with voters .
focus groups , previously distrusted by labour politicians - if they had even heard of such things at all - would became key tools in shaping the party 's message .
advertising executives and pollsters , previously treated with suspicion by left wing politicians , were drafted into the modernisers ' inner circle to advise on presentation .
leadership deal blair and brown were promoted rapidly through the shadow cabinet ranks , but when it came to who would stand as the " modernising " candidate when leader john smith died of a heart attack in 1994 , their supporters were split .
many assumed brown , as the older of the two , would take precedence .
blair 's favourite music the beatles the rolling stones led zeppelin free bruce springsteen u2 coldplay the foo fighters simply red but the shadow chancellor hesitated , eventually agreeing to give blair a clear run at the top job .
the deal was supposedly struck over dinner at granita , an islington restaurant , with blair reportedly pledging to hand over to brown after two terms - and to give him , as chancellor , unprecedented control over the domestic agenda .
but the precise terms of any deal remain hotly contested .
what appears to have been decisive is the decision of mandelson to switch his backing from brown to blair - believing the shadow home secretary to be the better communicator of the two .
it was a decision that caused a " rift " in new labour from the beginning , mandelson recently admitted , with the distrust and feuding between blair and brown , or more often their respective supporters , coming to dominate british politics .
soundbites the new labour leader was initially seen as something of a political lightweight .
he had easily defeated left wingers john prescott and margaret beckett to snatch the leadership - and he had set about reforming the party with single-minded determination - but he was dubbed " bambi " by the press and cartoonists depicted him as a slick , permanently grinning public relations man .
like many in the labour party , blair believed neil kinnock 's chances of becoming prime minister in 1992 had been destroyed by a hostile tabloid press .
british troops saw much action during the blair years he was determined not to let that happen to him and he hired tough talking former tabloid journalist alastair campbell to sharpen up its press operation .
the pair would obsess over every aspect of blair 's image , placing bets on which of their carefully crafted soundbites would make it on to the evening news bulletins .
campbell normally won .
blair also courted showbusiness personalities - attempting to align labour with a new wave of british pop stars and artists emerging in the mid 1990s , dubbed by the style press " cool britannia " .
his speeches at the time bordered on the messianic , tapping into what he saw as a pre-millennial mood of optimism .
sleaze promise his specific policies were modest in scope , but his rhetoric was dizzying : he promised nothing less than a country reborn , sweeping away the " sleaze " and drift of the major years .
and he deployed all of his charm and charisma on tv chat shows , showing himself to be a natural in front of the cameras , in contrast to the more stilted major .
it worked .
blair swept to a landslide victory in 1997 , becoming , at 43 , the youngest prime minister in nearly 200 years .
blair 's family man image was a key part of his appeal always nervous on polling day , he was still gloomily contemplating a possible coalition with the liberal democrats , even as the scale of his victory was becoming obvious .
two hours after polls closed - with the early results indicating a landslide - he ordered supporters in the royal festival hall to stop celebrating for fear of appearing complacent or " triumphalist " .
he need not have feared .
blair entered downing street on a wave of optimism and good will , on 2 may 1997 .
he promised to restore trust in politics and breathe new life into britain 's tired institutions .
in the early weeks of his premiership , he held a series of glittering receptions in downing street to celebrate his victory .
but behind the scenes , he was haunted by the splits and in-fighting he believed had destroyed previous labour administrations .
honeymoon period he continued to rule over his party with an iron will , battling to impose his own choice of candidates in the first london mayoral contest and devolved assembly elections and ensuring ministers remained " on message " at all times .
wary of the civil service 's ability to deliver his policy goals , he centralised power in downing street .
he preferred to make decisions with a small band of trusted advisors , rather than through more formal cabinet procedures , prompting accusations of " cronyism " and claims he was running a presidential style of government .
the public backlash against iraq prompted thoughts of quitting the media manipulation techniques that had served him so well in opposition were also beginning to earn his government a reputation for " spin " .
but blair 's personality - and his ability to connect with people through television - continued to be central to labour 's appeal .
within weeks of being elected , he delivered a halting , emotionally-charged eulogy to princess diana , on the morning of her death .
it was a performance which seemed to capture the public mood .
he would later insist that the phrase " the people 's princess " was his own and not alastair campbell 's invention , as cynics claimed .
euro decision then , when he was engulfed by his first party funding scandal , accused of offering favours in return for a £ 1m donation from formula one boss bernie ecclestone , he again took to the airwaves , pleading with the public to keep their faith in him .
" i think most people who have dealt with me , think i 'm a pretty straight sort of guy and i am , " he told the bbc 's john humphrys .
blair 's honeymoon period with the electorate felt like it would go on forever and his popularity received a further boost in 2000 , when cherie announced that , at the age of 45 , she was to become a mother again .
leo blair became the first legitimate child to be born to a serving prime minister in 150 years .

the timidity and reliance on focus groups that had characterised much of his first term began to be replaced by more sure-footed and decisive leadership .
he had already angered the left by talking about the " scars on his back " from his early , tentative attempts to make the public services more efficient .
now he was determined to be more bold in his approach , reasoning that the unions could hardly complain about market reforms with record amounts of cash pouring into schools and hospitals .
the only cloud on blair 's horizon was his worsening relationship with gordon brown , which , observers said , alternated between table-thumping rows and sullen periods of silence .
fresh mandate emboldened by his fresh mandate , he appointed blairites to key positions across government , from david blunkett at the home office to estelle morris at education , in an attempt to wrest control of the domestic agenda from the treasury .
but it was brown , who was said to be increasingly obsessed with becoming prime minister , that held all the aces when it came to the one thing blair really wanted .
he had long planned to take britain into the euro , believing it would define his legacy and finally place britain at the " heart of europe " after years on the margins under the conservatives .
but brown was less convinced of the case for joining the euro and , crucially , he had seized control of the entry process , devising five " economic tests " that had to be passed before britain ditched the pound .
a referendum was promised for 2003 , but by then the economic argument for the euro had been lost .
the five tests had not been passed , brown decreed , and the single currency was kicked into the long grass , along with blair 's dreams of a european legacy .
iraq but by then blair had found another , larger mission - one that really would write his name into the history books , for better or worse .
blair had always taken a single-minded approach to foreign policy .
he appeared to enjoy the company of the no-nonsense men of action he found in the military .
they made a refreshing change from the naturally cautious civil servants that surrounded him in downing street - or the left-wing mps and union leaders who it seemed to him were forever trying to stand in the way of progress .
early successes in sierra leone and kosovo convinced blair of the value of military action in pursuit of humanitarian aims .
the blairs ' marriage has remained solid throughout colleagues said his christian faith gave him a clearer sense of moral purpose than many of those around him - but it was not a subject he was ever comfortable talking about in public .
he had forged a close relationship with us president bill clinton during his first term in office , with whom he shared a centre-left political philosophy .
but to the surprise and dismay of many in his own party , including his loyal deputy john prescott , he formed an even closer bond with clinton 's successor , the republican george w bush .
the 11 september attacks moved the relationship on to a different level .
failure blair toured the world , shoring up support for the bush administration , utterly convinced of his own powers of persuasion and advocacy ; instinctively believing britain 's place was at america 's side in her hour of need .
but it was the 2003 decision to invade iraq - without a un mandate and in the teeth of bitter opposition at home and abroad - that would link the two leaders together in the public mind for ever .
blair had drawn on every last ounce of his persuasive skill to make the case for war to mps and the wider public .
blair and brown buried the hatchet for the 2005 election campaign but the subsequent failure to find weapons of mass destruction in iraq appeared to confirm many people 's worst suspicions about him - that he relied too much on spin and was not to be trusted .
in the public backlash that followed he briefly considered quitting .
he was persuaded to carry on by cabinet supporters but in october 2004 he surprised everyone by announcing he would not seek a fourth term in office if he won the next election .
the announcement had been designed to end speculation about his health - he had undergone an operation to correct an irregular heart beat .
' lame duck ' but it only succeeded in sparking more damaging speculation about his departure date , leading opponents to brand him a " lame duck " premier .
for the 2005 general election campaign , alastair campbell devised what came to be known as the " masochism strategy " , with blair allowing voters to vent their anger about iraq at him in a series of tv debates .
he became the first labour leader to win three consecutive terms in office but any elation was short-lived .
his share of the popular vote was the lowest on record for any prime minister .
his self-belief and powers of persuasion remained undimmed .
over one remarkable 24 hour period , he flew to singapore to help london land the 2012 olympics - punching the air with glee as he did so - before flying back to gleneagles , in scotland , to unveil a debt relief package for africa .
they were the two of the biggest achievements of his premiership .
blair 's final conference speech was an emotional occasion but they were instantly overshadowed by the 7 july attack on the london transport system - the first suicide attacks mainland britain had ever witnessed .
his opinion poll ratings improved in the immediate aftermath of 7 july , as he once again proved his ability to capture the nation 's mood in a time of crisis .
but when a bombers ' taped testimony was released blaming the attack on blair 's foreign policy , it threw the spotlight back on to iraq and his refusal to apologise for what his opponents saw as a terrible miscalculation .
blair was convinced britain was engaged , with america , in a global " war on terror " but he was having trouble bringing many in his party with him .
final straw when he failed to condemn israel 's bombing of lebanon , once again standing four square with george bush in the face of mounting criticism around the world , it was the final straw for many normally loyal labour mps .
a series of resignations by junior ministers , who believed his failure to name a departure date was damaging the party , underlined his weakened position and he was forced to announce he would be gone by september 2007 .
it was not , he confessed , the way he had wanted it to end .
tony blair has been sedgefield 's mp for nearly 25 years in his own mind , and that of his supporters , he was a prime minister at the peak of his powers .
his extraordinary farewell speech at the 2006 party conference in manchester reminded even his harshest labour party critics what they would be losing when he was gone .
the charisma that had served him so well over the years was still intact .
the difference was that he no longer agonised over his own popularity .
it was enough for him to know that he had " done the right thing " .
his final months in office were dogged by a police investigation into allegations he had nominated party donors for peerages .
he became the first serving prime minister to be interviewed as part of a police investigation , although downing street was keen to stress he was being treated as a witness .
the affair had its origins before the 2005 general election when blair - concerned by the size of the tories ' war chest - sought massive loans from a series of wealthy individuals , which he kept secret from all but a few members of his inner circle .
even labour 's treasurer was kept in the dark .
i am not going to beg for my character in front of anyone .
people can make up their own mind about me tony blair four of the lenders were subsequently nominated for peerages , but were rejected by the independent appointments ' commission , sparking opposition claims they had been " sold " honours .
blair was accused of flouting his own rules on party funding , introduced as part of his drive to " clean up " politics .
parliamentary standards commissioner sir alastair graham accused him of destroying trust in politics , saying the issue would be associated with his time in office in the way " sleaze " was with john major .
but rather than pleading to be trusted , as he had in 1997 during the bernie ecclestone affair , blair simply refused to talk about the allegations .
" i am not going to beg for my character in front of anyone .
people can make up their own mind about me , " he told the bbc in february .
conviction politician he said he had " a deep respect for the british people and it 's been an honour and privilege to lead them " .
but he said he had " changed " over the past 10 years .
he was a " different sort of person " now , who was less concerned about being " liked " .
blair had been hardened by a decade in office .
he had become a conviction politician - a very different character to the one that had first walked into downing street in 1997 , guitar case in hand .

at school he drove his teachers to distraction , constantly questioning their authority .
at university , he acted out his rock star fantasies as the lead singer of a band .
few at that stage would have predicted a career in the sober world of politics , even though blair 's charisma and ability to charm people were evident from an early age .
blair was known as a cheeky , argumentative schoolboy the story of his rise to power is certainly not a rags to riches tale - he was born with every advantage in life - but it is no less remarkable for that .
it is the story of how a middle class , privately-educated barrister - the son of a would-be tory mp - went on to become the most successful leader in the history of the labour party , profoundly changing it and the country in the process .
and how a man once seen as a lightweight - preoccupied with his own image and popularity - became one of the most powerful and controversial figures on the world stage .
tory leanings anthony charles lynton blair was born in 1953 in edinburgh , the second son of hazel and leo blair .
the student tony blair had a rebellious streak he spent the first few years of his life in adelaide , australia , where leo lectured in law at the city 's university .
they returned to the uk in late 1950s and blair spent the remainder of his childhood in durham , where he was a day pupil at the fee-paying choristers school .
leo was chairman of the local conservative association but had to abandon his ambition to become a tory mp when he suffered a stroke .
his political leanings appeared to have rubbed off on the young tony , who stood in a mock school election as the conservative candidate .
' maddening ' blair 's teachers at exclusive edinburgh boarding school fettes recall a cheeky , rebellious figure ; a talented actor who loved being the centre of attention and who cultivated a " cool " image among his peers .
blair 's cv born : 6 may 1953 educated : choristers school , fettes , oxford family : married , four children 1976 : barrister specialising in trade union and employment law 1983 : labour mp for sedgefield , shadow city spokesman 1984 - 87 : shadow trade and industry minister 1987 - 88 : shadow energy secretary 1989 - 92 : shadow employment secretary 1992 - 94 : shadow home secretary 1994 - 97 : opposition leader 1997 - prime minister " tony was full of life .
maddening at times , full of himself and very argumentative , " blair 's housemaster eric anderson told blair 's biographer john rentoul .
" he was an expert at testing the rules to the limit , and i would n't swear that he stuck rigidly to the rules on not drinking , smoking or breaking bounds .
but he was a live wire and fun to have around . "
at the age of 17 he was given " six of the best " for persistently flouting the school rules .
then he was threatened with expulsion .
it was his girlfriend 's father , lord mackenzie stewart , an old fettesian and cross bench peer , who came to the rescue , striking a deal with the school that allowed blair to spend the final few weeks of the summer term living with him .
mackenzie stewart 's daughter , amanda , was the first girl to be admitted to fettes .
typically , it was the super-confident blair who beat the 440 other boys to win her heart .
rock music blair also met charlie falconer while at fettes .
the man who would later become his lord chancellor was a pupil at the rival edinburgh academy .
blair left fettes with three a levels and a place at st john 's college , oxford , to study law .
the young barrister impressed michael foot with his enthusiasm like many teenage boys in the late 1960s he was besotted by rock music .
he idolised mick jagger but he also dreamed of wielding power behind the scenes , as a manager or promoter .
before taking up his place at oxford , he headed for london , where he spent a carefree year " managing " student rock bands and putting on gigs and discos with his friend alan collenette .
to make ends meet , the pair stacked shelves at barkers food hall , in kensington .
at oxford he briefly fronted a rock band , ugly rumours .
friends recall his charismatic stage presence , but also his professional attitude .
trainee barrister " he even wanted to rehearse , " said band mate mark ellen .
but blair was also developing a more thoughtful side .
he began to talk about left wing politics and , unusually for the times , became increasingly serious about his christian faith , taking confirmation classes .
he lost his mother to cancer while he was at oxford , which also appears to have profoundly affected his outlook .
in his first year at the university , he befriended an australian priest , peter thompson , with whom he would debate social issues and theology late into the night .
blair later credited thompson with awakening in him an interest in christian socialism , and a desire for social change .
how tony blair has aged during 10 years in office enlarge image blair was also unusual , in the pot-smoking student milieu of the early 1970s , in that he appears to have avoided drugs .
there are also few reports of him being incapacitated by drink .
his only real vice was smoking cigarettes , a habit wife cherie later made him quit .
he smoked his last one 15 minutes before their wedding .
blair left oxford with a second class degree and in 1976 became a trainee barrister in the chambers of derry irvine , who would later become his first lord chancellor .
it was here that he met cherie booth , a fellow pupil in irvine 's chambers .
she had a first class degree and was seen as being more of a high flyer than blair .
activist friends recall a christmas party , during a game which involved passing a balloon between their knees , when it became obvious they would be more than just colleagues .
blair properties 1980 : mapledene road , hackney , bought £ 40,000 , sold 1986 £ 80,000 1983 : myrobella , trimdon village , nr sedgefield , bought £ 30,000 1986 : stavordale road , islington , bought £ 120,000 , sold 1993 £ 200,000 1993 : richmond crescent , islington , bought £ 375,000 , sold 1997 £ 615,000 1997:11 downing street - rent free flat next door to prime minister 's traditional residence 2002 : clifton , bristol , two flats bought for £ 525,000 in total 2004 : connaught square , bayswater , bought £ 3.6m 2007 : bayswater .
two bed house behind connaught square property , bought £ 800,000 .
blairs plan to join buildings together to create extra space " the next day we went out to lunch and hours later we were still there , " blair later recalled .
" i found her immensely physically attractive and i wanted her as a friend as well . "
the couple married in 1980 , setting up home in hackney , east london , in a £ 40,000 end-of-terrace house , and threw themselves into local labour party politics .
blair had joined the party shortly after leaving oxford , but it was only now that he became more involved as an activist , encouraged by neighbour - and future home secretary - charles clarke , who shared his centre-left outlook .
in 1981 , through his father-in-law , the actor and left wing campaigner tony booth , blair contacted labour mp tom pendry to ask for help in becoming an mp .
pendry gave him a tour of the commons and advised him to stand for selection as a candidate in a forthcoming by-election in beaconsfield .
blair never stood a chance in such a safe conservative seat but he managed to attract the attention of labour leader michael foot , who was impressed by his enthusiasm and told him he had a " big future in politics " .
manifesto concerns nevertheless , it looked as if he would miss out on a chance to contest the 1983 general election .
it was only at the very last minute that he found a vacant seat , in the newly-created constituency of sedgefield , near where he grew up in county durham , securing the nomination ahead of several sitting mps and his future chief whip hilary armstrong , the daughter of a local labour mp .
the 1983 labour manifesto was one of the most left wing ever to be put before the british electorate .
it included commitments to nationalisation of industry and unilateral nuclear disarmament .
presentation was crucial to the new labour project blair made it clear privately to john burton , his election agent and mentor , that he did not agree with key parts of it , particularly proposals to withdraw britain from the eu .
his victory , in a rock solid labour area , was assured , although labour had a bad night nationally .
the early 1980s was a grim era of factory closures and job losses in the north east of england , with unemployment in the former mining villages that made up most of blair 's constituency soaring above 20 % .
within weeks of entering parliament , blair , who at 30 was the youngest labour mp , led a delegation of pit men and their families to london , where he joined forces with national union of mineworkers -lrb- num -rrb- leader arthur scargill to petition the national coal board over the planned closure of a coke works .
middle class appeal the young " london barrister , " as local newspapers described him , fought for his constituents ' jobs in traditional heavy industries but he also made no effort to hide his belief that the labour party had to modernise - and broaden its appeal to middle class voters - or die .
in an article for the northern echo , he argued " to win power for the low-paid , unemployed and the north , we must also appeal to the 60 % of the population in private housing , to the employed on the average wage and to the south " .

at one party meeting , he was shocked to find himself being denounced as a " traitor to socialism " by labour mp dennis skinner , after he made a speech urging reform .
" it was a very early lesson in politics because i said exactly what i thought .
i said we were living in a new age but we were talking like everybody had just got black and white tvs , " he later recalled in an interview with the northern echo .
cherie had also contested the 1983 general election , but after losing the no-hope seat of thanet in kent , she threw herself into her legal career , going on to become one of the country 's leading human rights lawyers .
by the end of blair 's first year in parliament , she had also given birth to the first of the couple 's four children , euan .
that first year also saw blair gain a crucial ally in his mission to modernise the labour party .
new agenda colleagues recall him being initially somewhat in awe of gordon brown , the young scottish mp he shared an office with in parliament .
blair 's favourite food bananas , beck 's lager and pistachio nuts - maid who served blair at labour conference fresh fettucini garnished with an exotic sauce of olive oil , sun-dried tomatoes and capers - nspcc islington cook book fish and chips - sedgefield labour party election leaflet unlike him , brown had been steeped in labour politics from a very early age and already had a knack for making headlines .
but together with peter mandelson , then a senior aide to party leader neil kinnock , the pair set about laying the foundations for what would become new labour .
blair , brown and mandelson were determined to make labour electable again by ditching unpopular labour policies , such as unilateral disarmament , and forging a new agenda marrying free market economics with social justice .
but they also wanted to improve the way labour communicated with voters .
focus groups , previously distrusted by labour politicians - if they had even heard of such things at all - would became key tools in shaping the party 's message .
advertising executives and pollsters , previously treated with suspicion by left wing politicians , were drafted into the modernisers ' inner circle to advise on presentation .
leadership deal blair and brown were promoted rapidly through the shadow cabinet ranks , but when it came to who would stand as the " modernising " candidate when leader john smith died of a heart attack in 1994 , their supporters were split .
many assumed brown , as the older of the two , would take precedence .
blair 's favourite music the beatles the rolling stones led zeppelin free bruce springsteen u2 coldplay the foo fighters simply red but the shadow chancellor hesitated , eventually agreeing to give blair a clear run at the top job .
the deal was supposedly struck over dinner at granita , an islington restaurant , with blair reportedly pledging to hand over to brown after two terms - and to give him , as chancellor , unprecedented control over the domestic agenda .
but the precise terms of any deal remain hotly contested .
what appears to have been decisive is the decision of mandelson to switch his backing from brown to blair - believing the shadow home secretary to be the better communicator of the two .
it was a decision that caused a " rift " in new labour from the beginning , mandelson recently admitted , with the distrust and feuding between blair and brown , or more often their respective supporters , coming to dominate british politics .
soundbites the new labour leader was initially seen as something of a political lightweight .
he had easily defeated left wingers john prescott and margaret beckett to snatch the leadership - and he had set about reforming the party with single-minded determination - but he was dubbed " bambi " by the press and cartoonists depicted him as a slick , permanently grinning public relations man .
like many in the labour party , blair believed neil kinnock 's chances of becoming prime minister in 1992 had been destroyed by a hostile tabloid press .
british troops saw much action during the blair years he was determined not to let that happen to him and he hired tough talking former tabloid journalist alastair campbell to sharpen up its press operation .
the pair would obsess over every aspect of blair 's image , placing bets on which of their carefully crafted soundbites would make it on to the evening news bulletins .
campbell normally won .
blair also courted showbusiness personalities - attempting to align labour with a new wave of british pop stars and artists emerging in the mid 1990s , dubbed by the style press " cool britannia " .
his speeches at the time bordered on the messianic , tapping into what he saw as a pre-millennial mood of optimism .
sleaze promise his specific policies were modest in scope , but his rhetoric was dizzying : he promised nothing less than a country reborn , sweeping away the " sleaze " and drift of the major years .
and he deployed all of his charm and charisma on tv chat shows , showing himself to be a natural in front of the cameras , in contrast to the more stilted major .
it worked .
blair swept to a landslide victory in 1997 , becoming , at 43 , the youngest prime minister in nearly 200 years .
blair 's family man image was a key part of his appeal always nervous on polling day , he was still gloomily contemplating a possible coalition with the liberal democrats , even as the scale of his victory was becoming obvious .
two hours after polls closed - with the early results indicating a landslide - he ordered supporters in the royal festival hall to stop celebrating for fear of appearing complacent or " triumphalist " .
he need not have feared .
blair entered downing street on a wave of optimism and good will , on 2 may 1997 .
he promised to restore trust in politics and breathe new life into britain 's tired institutions .
in the early weeks of his premiership , he held a series of glittering receptions in downing street to celebrate his victory .
but behind the scenes , he was haunted by the splits and in-fighting he believed had destroyed previous labour administrations .
honeymoon period he continued to rule over his party with an iron will , battling to impose his own choice of candidates in the first london mayoral contest and devolved assembly elections and ensuring ministers remained " on message " at all times .
wary of the civil service 's ability to deliver his policy goals , he centralised power in downing street .
he preferred to make decisions with a small band of trusted advisors , rather than through more formal cabinet procedures , prompting accusations of " cronyism " and claims he was running a presidential style of government .
the public backlash against iraq prompted thoughts of quitting the media manipulation techniques that had served him so well in opposition were also beginning to earn his government a reputation for " spin " .
but blair 's personality - and his ability to connect with people through television - continued to be central to labour 's appeal .
within weeks of being elected , he delivered a halting , emotionally-charged eulogy to princess diana , on the morning of her death .
it was a performance which seemed to capture the public mood .
he would later insist that the phrase " the people 's princess " was his own and not alastair campbell 's invention , as cynics claimed .
euro decision then , when he was engulfed by his first party funding scandal , accused of offering favours in return for a £ 1m donation from formula one boss bernie ecclestone , he again took to the airwaves , pleading with the public to keep their faith in him .
" i think most people who have dealt with me , think i 'm a pretty straight sort of guy and i am , " he told the bbc 's john humphrys .
blair 's honeymoon period with the electorate felt like it would go on forever and his popularity received a further boost in 2000 , when cherie announced that , at the age of 45 , she was to become a mother again .
leo blair became the first legitimate child to be born to a serving prime minister in 150 years .

the timidity and reliance on focus groups that had characterised much of his first term began to be replaced by more sure-footed and decisive leadership .
he had already angered the left by talking about the " scars on his back " from his early , tentative attempts to make the public services more efficient .
now he was determined to be more bold in his approach , reasoning that the unions could hardly complain about market reforms with record amounts of cash pouring into schools and hospitals .
the only cloud on blair 's horizon was his worsening relationship with gordon brown , which , observers said , alternated between table-thumping rows and sullen periods of silence .
fresh mandate emboldened by his fresh mandate , he appointed blairites to key positions across government , from david blunkett at the home office to estelle morris at education , in an attempt to wrest control of the domestic agenda from the treasury .
but it was brown , who was said to be increasingly obsessed with becoming prime minister , that held all the aces when it came to the one thing blair really wanted .
he had long planned to take britain into the euro , believing it would define his legacy and finally place britain at the " heart of europe " after years on the margins under the conservatives .
but brown was less convinced of the case for joining the euro and , crucially , he had seized control of the entry process , devising five " economic tests " that had to be passed before britain ditched the pound .
a referendum was promised for 2003 , but by then the economic argument for the euro had been lost .
the five tests had not been passed , brown decreed , and the single currency was kicked into the long grass , along with blair 's dreams of a european legacy .
iraq but by then blair had found another , larger mission - one that really would write his name into the history books , for better or worse .
blair had always taken a single-minded approach to foreign policy .
he appeared to enjoy the company of the no-nonsense men of action he found in the military .
they made a refreshing change from the naturally cautious civil servants that surrounded him in downing street - or the left-wing mps and union leaders who it seemed to him were forever trying to stand in the way of progress .
early successes in sierra leone and kosovo convinced blair of the value of military action in pursuit of humanitarian aims .
the blairs ' marriage has remained solid throughout colleagues said his christian faith gave him a clearer sense of moral purpose than many of those around him - but it was not a subject he was ever comfortable talking about in public .
he had forged a close relationship with us president bill clinton during his first term in office , with whom he shared a centre-left political philosophy .
but to the surprise and dismay of many in his own party , including his loyal deputy john prescott , he formed an even closer bond with clinton 's successor , the republican george w bush .
the 11 september attacks moved the relationship on to a different level .
failure blair toured the world , shoring up support for the bush administration , utterly convinced of his own powers of persuasion and advocacy ; instinctively believing britain 's place was at america 's side in her hour of need .
but it was the 2003 decision to invade iraq - without a un mandate and in the teeth of bitter opposition at home and abroad - that would link the two leaders together in the public mind for ever .
blair had drawn on every last ounce of his persuasive skill to make the case for war to mps and the wider public .
blair and brown buried the hatchet for the 2005 election campaign but the subsequent failure to find weapons of mass destruction in iraq appeared to confirm many people 's worst suspicions about him - that he relied too much on spin and was not to be trusted .
in the public backlash that followed he briefly considered quitting .
he was persuaded to carry on by cabinet supporters but in october 2004 he surprised everyone by announcing he would not seek a fourth term in office if he won the next election .
the announcement had been designed to end speculation about his health - he had undergone an operation to correct an irregular heart beat .
' lame duck ' but it only succeeded in sparking more damaging speculation about his departure date , leading opponents to brand him a " lame duck " premier .
for the 2005 general election campaign , alastair campbell devised what came to be known as the " masochism strategy " , with blair allowing voters to vent their anger about iraq at him in a series of tv debates .
he became the first labour leader to win three consecutive terms in office but any elation was short-lived .
his share of the popular vote was the lowest on record for any prime minister .
his self-belief and powers of persuasion remained undimmed .
over one remarkable 24 hour period , he flew to singapore to help london land the 2012 olympics - punching the air with glee as he did so - before flying back to gleneagles , in scotland , to unveil a debt relief package for africa .
they were the two of the biggest achievements of his premiership .
blair 's final conference speech was an emotional occasion but they were instantly overshadowed by the 7 july attack on the london transport system - the first suicide attacks mainland britain had ever witnessed .
his opinion poll ratings improved in the immediate aftermath of 7 july , as he once again proved his ability to capture the nation 's mood in a time of crisis .
but when a bombers ' taped testimony was released blaming the attack on blair 's foreign policy , it threw the spotlight back on to iraq and his refusal to apologise for what his opponents saw as a terrible miscalculation .
blair was convinced britain was engaged , with america , in a global " war on terror " but he was having trouble bringing many in his party with him .
final straw when he failed to condemn israel 's bombing of lebanon , once again standing four square with george bush in the face of mounting criticism around the world , it was the final straw for many normally loyal labour mps .
a series of resignations by junior ministers , who believed his failure to name a departure date was damaging the party , underlined his weakened position and he was forced to announce he would be gone by september 2007 .
it was not , he confessed , the way he had wanted it to end .
tony blair has been sedgefield 's mp for nearly 25 years in his own mind , and that of his supporters , he was a prime minister at the peak of his powers .
his extraordinary farewell speech at the 2006 party conference in manchester reminded even his harshest labour party critics what they would be losing when he was gone .
the charisma that had served him so well over the years was still intact .
the difference was that he no longer agonised over his own popularity .
it was enough for him to know that he had " done the right thing " .
his final months in office were dogged by a police investigation into allegations he had nominated party donors for peerages .
he became the first serving prime minister to be interviewed as part of a police investigation , although downing street was keen to stress he was being treated as a witness .
the affair had its origins before the 2005 general election when blair - concerned by the size of the tories ' war chest - sought massive loans from a series of wealthy individuals , which he kept secret from all but a few members of his inner circle .
even labour 's treasurer was kept in the dark .
i am not going to beg for my character in front of anyone .
people can make up their own mind about me tony blair four of the lenders were subsequently nominated for peerages , but were rejected by the independent appointments ' commission , sparking opposition claims they had been " sold " honours .
blair was accused of flouting his own rules on party funding , introduced as part of his drive to " clean up " politics .
parliamentary standards commissioner sir alastair graham accused him of destroying trust in politics , saying the issue would be associated with his time in office in the way " sleaze " was with john major .
but rather than pleading to be trusted , as he had in 1997 during the bernie ecclestone affair , blair simply refused to talk about the allegations .
" i am not going to beg for my character in front of anyone .
people can make up their own mind about me , " he told the bbc in february .
conviction politician he said he had " a deep respect for the british people and it 's been an honour and privilege to lead them " .
but he said he had " changed " over the past 10 years .
he was a " different sort of person " now , who was less concerned about being " liked " .
blair had been hardened by a decade in office .
he had become a conviction politician - a very different character to the one that had first walked into downing street in 1997 , guitar case in hand .

at school he drove his teachers to distraction , constantly questioning their authority .
at university , he acted out his rock star fantasies as the lead singer of a band .
few at that stage would have predicted a career in the sober world of politics , even though blair 's charisma and ability to charm people were evident from an early age .
blair was known as a cheeky , argumentative schoolboy the story of his rise to power is certainly not a rags to riches tale - he was born with every advantage in life - but it is no less remarkable for that .
it is the story of how a middle class , privately-educated barrister - the son of a would-be tory mp - went on to become the most successful leader in the history of the labour party , profoundly changing it and the country in the process .
and how a man once seen as a lightweight - preoccupied with his own image and popularity - became one of the most powerful and controversial figures on the world stage .
tory leanings anthony charles lynton blair was born in 1953 in edinburgh , the second son of hazel and leo blair .
the student tony blair had a rebellious streak he spent the first few years of his life in adelaide , australia , where leo lectured in law at the city 's university .
they returned to the uk in late 1950s and blair spent the remainder of his childhood in durham , where he was a day pupil at the fee-paying choristers school .
leo was chairman of the local conservative association but had to abandon his ambition to become a tory mp when he suffered a stroke .
his political leanings appeared to have rubbed off on the young tony , who stood in a mock school election as the conservative candidate .
' maddening ' blair 's teachers at exclusive edinburgh boarding school fettes recall a cheeky , rebellious figure ; a talented actor who loved being the centre of attention and who cultivated a " cool " image among his peers .
blair 's cv born : 6 may 1953 educated : choristers school , fettes , oxford family : married , four children 1976 : barrister specialising in trade union and employment law 1983 : labour mp for sedgefield , shadow city spokesman 1984 - 87 : shadow trade and industry minister 1987 - 88 : shadow energy secretary 1989 - 92 : shadow employment secretary 1992 - 94 : shadow home secretary 1994 - 97 : opposition leader 1997 - prime minister " tony was full of life .
maddening at times , full of himself and very argumentative , " blair 's housemaster eric anderson told blair 's biographer john rentoul .
" he was an expert at testing the rules to the limit , and i would n't swear that he stuck rigidly to the rules on not drinking , smoking or breaking bounds .
but he was a live wire and fun to have around . "
at the age of 17 he was given " six of the best " for persistently flouting the school rules .
then he was threatened with expulsion .
it was his girlfriend 's father , lord mackenzie stewart , an old fettesian and cross bench peer , who came to the rescue , striking a deal with the school that allowed blair to spend the final few weeks of the summer term living with him .
mackenzie stewart 's daughter , amanda , was the first girl to be admitted to fettes .
typically , it was the super-confident blair who beat the 440 other boys to win her heart .
rock music blair also met charlie falconer while at fettes .
the man who would later become his lord chancellor was a pupil at the rival edinburgh academy .
blair left fettes with three a levels and a place at st john 's college , oxford , to study law .
the young barrister impressed michael foot with his enthusiasm like many teenage boys in the late 1960s he was besotted by rock music .
he idolised mick jagger but he also dreamed of wielding power behind the scenes , as a manager or promoter .
before taking up his place at oxford , he headed for london , where he spent a carefree year " managing " student rock bands and putting on gigs and discos with his friend alan collenette .
to make ends meet , the pair stacked shelves at barkers food hall , in kensington .
at oxford he briefly fronted a rock band , ugly rumours .
friends recall his charismatic stage presence , but also his professional attitude .
trainee barrister " he even wanted to rehearse , " said band mate mark ellen .
but blair was also developing a more thoughtful side .
he began to talk about left wing politics and , unusually for the times , became increasingly serious about his christian faith , taking confirmation classes .
he lost his mother to cancer while he was at oxford , which also appears to have profoundly affected his outlook .
in his first year at the university , he befriended an australian priest , peter thompson , with whom he would debate social issues and theology late into the night .
blair later credited thompson with awakening in him an interest in christian socialism , and a desire for social change .
how tony blair has aged during 10 years in office enlarge image blair was also unusual , in the pot-smoking student milieu of the early 1970s , in that he appears to have avoided drugs .
there are also few reports of him being incapacitated by drink .
his only real vice was smoking cigarettes , a habit wife cherie later made him quit .
he smoked his last one 15 minutes before their wedding .
blair left oxford with a second class degree and in 1976 became a trainee barrister in the chambers of derry irvine , who would later become his first lord chancellor .
it was here that he met cherie booth , a fellow pupil in irvine 's chambers .
she had a first class degree and was seen as being more of a high flyer than blair .
activist friends recall a christmas party , during a game which involved passing a balloon between their knees , when it became obvious they would be more than just colleagues .
blair properties 1980 : mapledene road , hackney , bought £ 40,000 , sold 1986 £ 80,000 1983 : myrobella , trimdon village , nr sedgefield , bought £ 30,000 1986 : stavordale road , islington , bought £ 120,000 , sold 1993 £ 200,000 1993 : richmond crescent , islington , bought £ 375,000 , sold 1997 £ 615,000 1997:11 downing street - rent free flat next door to prime minister 's traditional residence 2002 : clifton , bristol , two flats bought for £ 525,000 in total 2004 : connaught square , bayswater , bought £ 3.6m 2007 : bayswater .
two bed house behind connaught square property , bought £ 800,000 .
blairs plan to join buildings together to create extra space " the next day we went out to lunch and hours later we were still there , " blair later recalled .
" i found her immensely physically attractive and i wanted her as a friend as well . "
the couple married in 1980 , setting up home in hackney , east london , in a £ 40,000 end-of-terrace house , and threw themselves into local labour party politics .
blair had joined the party shortly after leaving oxford , but it was only now that he became more involved as an activist , encouraged by neighbour - and future home secretary - charles clarke , who shared his centre-left outlook .
in 1981 , through his father-in-law , the actor and left wing campaigner tony booth , blair contacted labour mp tom pendry to ask for help in becoming an mp .
pendry gave him a tour of the commons and advised him to stand for selection as a candidate in a forthcoming by-election in beaconsfield .
blair never stood a chance in such a safe conservative seat but he managed to attract the attention of labour leader michael foot , who was impressed by his enthusiasm and told him he had a " big future in politics " .
manifesto concerns nevertheless , it looked as if he would miss out on a chance to contest the 1983 general election .
it was only at the very last minute that he found a vacant seat , in the newly-created constituency of sedgefield , near where he grew up in county durham , securing the nomination ahead of several sitting mps and his future chief whip hilary armstrong , the daughter of a local labour mp .
the 1983 labour manifesto was one of the most left wing ever to be put before the british electorate .
it included commitments to nationalisation of industry and unilateral nuclear disarmament .
presentation was crucial to the new labour project blair made it clear privately to john burton , his election agent and mentor , that he did not agree with key parts of it , particularly proposals to withdraw britain from the eu .
his victory , in a rock solid labour area , was assured , although labour had a bad night nationally .
the early 1980s was a grim era of factory closures and job losses in the north east of england , with unemployment in the former mining villages that made up most of blair 's constituency soaring above 20 % .
within weeks of entering parliament , blair , who at 30 was the youngest labour mp , led a delegation of pit men and their families to london , where he joined forces with national union of mineworkers -lrb- num -rrb- leader arthur scargill to petition the national coal board over the planned closure of a coke works .
middle class appeal the young " london barrister , " as local newspapers described him , fought for his constituents ' jobs in traditional heavy industries but he also made no effort to hide his belief that the labour party had to modernise - and broaden its appeal to middle class voters - or die .
in an article for the northern echo , he argued " to win power for the low-paid , unemployed and the north , we must also appeal to the 60 % of the population in private housing , to the employed on the average wage and to the south " .

at one party meeting , he was shocked to find himself being denounced as a " traitor to socialism " by labour mp dennis skinner , after he made a speech urging reform .
" it was a very early lesson in politics because i said exactly what i thought .
i said we were living in a new age but we were talking like everybody had just got black and white tvs , " he later recalled in an interview with the northern echo .
cherie had also contested the 1983 general election , but after losing the no-hope seat of thanet in kent , she threw herself into her legal career , going on to become one of the country 's leading human rights lawyers .
by the end of blair 's first year in parliament , she had also given birth to the first of the couple 's four children , euan .
that first year also saw blair gain a crucial ally in his mission to modernise the labour party .
new agenda colleagues recall him being initially somewhat in awe of gordon brown , the young scottish mp he shared an office with in parliament .
blair 's favourite food bananas , beck 's lager and pistachio nuts - maid who served blair at labour conference fresh fettucini garnished with an exotic sauce of olive oil , sun-dried tomatoes and capers - nspcc islington cook book fish and chips - sedgefield labour party election leaflet unlike him , brown had been steeped in labour politics from a very early age and already had a knack for making headlines .
but together with peter mandelson , then a senior aide to party leader neil kinnock , the pair set about laying the foundations for what would become new labour .
blair , brown and mandelson were determined to make labour electable again by ditching unpopular labour policies , such as unilateral disarmament , and forging a new agenda marrying free market economics with social justice .
but they also wanted to improve the way labour communicated with voters .
focus groups , previously distrusted by labour politicians - if they had even heard of such things at all - would became key tools in shaping the party 's message .
advertising executives and pollsters , previously treated with suspicion by left wing politicians , were drafted into the modernisers ' inner circle to advise on presentation .
leadership deal blair and brown were promoted rapidly through the shadow cabinet ranks , but when it came to who would stand as the " modernising " candidate when leader john smith died of a heart attack in 1994 , their supporters were split .
many assumed brown , as the older of the two , would take precedence .
blair 's favourite music the beatles the rolling stones led zeppelin free bruce springsteen u2 coldplay the foo fighters simply red but the shadow chancellor hesitated , eventually agreeing to give blair a clear run at the top job .
the deal was supposedly struck over dinner at granita , an islington restaurant , with blair reportedly pledging to hand over to brown after two terms - and to give him , as chancellor , unprecedented control over the domestic agenda .
but the precise terms of any deal remain hotly contested .
what appears to have been decisive is the decision of mandelson to switch his backing from brown to blair - believing the shadow home secretary to be the better communicator of the two .
it was a decision that caused a " rift " in new labour from the beginning , mandelson recently admitted , with the distrust and feuding between blair and brown , or more often their respective supporters , coming to dominate british politics .
soundbites the new labour leader was initially seen as something of a political lightweight .
he had easily defeated left wingers john prescott and margaret beckett to snatch the leadership - and he had set about reforming the party with single-minded determination - but he was dubbed " bambi " by the press and cartoonists depicted him as a slick , permanently grinning public relations man .
like many in the labour party , blair believed neil kinnock 's chances of becoming prime minister in 1992 had been destroyed by a hostile tabloid press .
british troops saw much action during the blair years he was determined not to let that happen to him and he hired tough talking former tabloid journalist alastair campbell to sharpen up its press operation .
the pair would obsess over every aspect of blair 's image , placing bets on which of their carefully crafted soundbites would make it on to the evening news bulletins .
campbell normally won .
blair also courted showbusiness personalities - attempting to align labour with a new wave of british pop stars and artists emerging in the mid 1990s , dubbed by the style press " cool britannia " .
his speeches at the time bordered on the messianic , tapping into what he saw as a pre-millennial mood of optimism .
sleaze promise his specific policies were modest in scope , but his rhetoric was dizzying : he promised nothing less than a country reborn , sweeping away the " sleaze " and drift of the major years .
and he deployed all of his charm and charisma on tv chat shows , showing himself to be a natural in front of the cameras , in contrast to the more stilted major .
it worked .
blair swept to a landslide victory in 1997 , becoming , at 43 , the youngest prime minister in nearly 200 years .
blair 's family man image was a key part of his appeal always nervous on polling day , he was still gloomily contemplating a possible coalition with the liberal democrats , even as the scale of his victory was becoming obvious .
two hours after polls closed - with the early results indicating a landslide - he ordered supporters in the royal festival hall to stop celebrating for fear of appearing complacent or " triumphalist " .
he need not have feared .
blair entered downing street on a wave of optimism and good will , on 2 may 1997 .
he promised to restore trust in politics and breathe new life into britain 's tired institutions .
in the early weeks of his premiership , he held a series of glittering receptions in downing street to celebrate his victory .
but behind the scenes , he was haunted by the splits and in-fighting he believed had destroyed previous labour administrations .
honeymoon period he continued to rule over his party with an iron will , battling to impose his own choice of candidates in the first london mayoral contest and devolved assembly elections and ensuring ministers remained " on message " at all times .
wary of the civil service 's ability to deliver his policy goals , he centralised power in downing street .
he preferred to make decisions with a small band of trusted advisors , rather than through more formal cabinet procedures , prompting accusations of " cronyism " and claims he was running a presidential style of government .
the public backlash against iraq prompted thoughts of quitting the media manipulation techniques that had served him so well in opposition were also beginning to earn his government a reputation for " spin " .
but blair 's personality - and his ability to connect with people through television - continued to be central to labour 's appeal .
within weeks of being elected , he delivered a halting , emotionally-charged eulogy to princess diana , on the morning of her death .
it was a performance which seemed to capture the public mood .
he would later insist that the phrase " the people 's princess " was his own and not alastair campbell 's invention , as cynics claimed .
euro decision then , when he was engulfed by his first party funding scandal , accused of offering favours in return for a £ 1m donation from formula one boss bernie ecclestone , he again took to the airwaves , pleading with the public to keep their faith in him .
" i think most people who have dealt with me , think i 'm a pretty straight sort of guy and i am , " he told the bbc 's john humphrys .
blair 's honeymoon period with the electorate felt like it would go on forever and his popularity received a further boost in 2000 , when cherie announced that , at the age of 45 , she was to become a mother again .
leo blair became the first legitimate child to be born to a serving prime minister in 150 years .

the timidity and reliance on focus groups that had characterised much of his first term began to be replaced by more sure-footed and decisive leadership .
he had already angered the left by talking about the " scars on his back " from his early , tentative attempts to make the public services more efficient .
now he was determined to be more bold in his approach , reasoning that the unions could hardly complain about market reforms with record amounts of cash pouring into schools and hospitals .
the only cloud on blair 's horizon was his worsening relationship with gordon brown , which , observers said , alternated between table-thumping rows and sullen periods of silence .
fresh mandate emboldened by his fresh mandate , he appointed blairites to key positions across government , from david blunkett at the home office to estelle morris at education , in an attempt to wrest control of the domestic agenda from the treasury .
but it was brown , who was said to be increasingly obsessed with becoming prime minister , that held all the aces when it came to the one thing blair really wanted .
he had long planned to take britain into the euro , believing it would define his legacy and finally place britain at the " heart of europe " after years on the margins under the conservatives .
but brown was less convinced of the case for joining the euro and , crucially , he had seized control of the entry process , devising five " economic tests " that had to be passed before britain ditched the pound .
a referendum was promised for 2003 , but by then the economic argument for the euro had been lost .
the five tests had not been passed , brown decreed , and the single currency was kicked into the long grass , along with blair 's dreams of a european legacy .
iraq but by then blair had found another , larger mission - one that really would write his name into the history books , for better or worse .
blair had always taken a single-minded approach to foreign policy .
he appeared to enjoy the company of the no-nonsense men of action he found in the military .
they made a refreshing change from the naturally cautious civil servants that surrounded him in downing street - or the left-wing mps and union leaders who it seemed to him were forever trying to stand in the way of progress .
early successes in sierra leone and kosovo convinced blair of the value of military action in pursuit of humanitarian aims .
the blairs ' marriage has remained solid throughout colleagues said his christian faith gave him a clearer sense of moral purpose than many of those around him - but it was not a subject he was ever comfortable talking about in public .
he had forged a close relationship with us president bill clinton during his first term in office , with whom he shared a centre-left political philosophy .
but to the surprise and dismay of many in his own party , including his loyal deputy john prescott , he formed an even closer bond with clinton 's successor , the republican george w bush .
the 11 september attacks moved the relationship on to a different level .
failure blair toured the world , shoring up support for the bush administration , utterly convinced of his own powers of persuasion and advocacy ; instinctively believing britain 's place was at america 's side in her hour of need .
but it was the 2003 decision to invade iraq - without a un mandate and in the teeth of bitter opposition at home and abroad - that would link the two leaders together in the public mind for ever .
blair had drawn on every last ounce of his persuasive skill to make the case for war to mps and the wider public .
blair and brown buried the hatchet for the 2005 election campaign but the subsequent failure to find weapons of mass destruction in iraq appeared to confirm many people 's worst suspicions about him - that he relied too much on spin and was not to be trusted .
in the public backlash that followed he briefly considered quitting .
he was persuaded to carry on by cabinet supporters but in october 2004 he surprised everyone by announcing he would not seek a fourth term in office if he won the next election .
the announcement had been designed to end speculation about his health - he had undergone an operation to correct an irregular heart beat .
' lame duck ' but it only succeeded in sparking more damaging speculation about his departure date , leading opponents to brand him a " lame duck " premier .
for the 2005 general election campaign , alastair campbell devised what came to be known as the " masochism strategy " , with blair allowing voters to vent their anger about iraq at him in a series of tv debates .
he became the first labour leader to win three consecutive terms in office but any elation was short-lived .
his share of the popular vote was the lowest on record for any prime minister .
his self-belief and powers of persuasion remained undimmed .
over one remarkable 24 hour period , he flew to singapore to help london land the 2012 olympics - punching the air with glee as he did so - before flying back to gleneagles , in scotland , to unveil a debt relief package for africa .
they were the two of the biggest achievements of his premiership .
blair 's final conference speech was an emotional occasion but they were instantly overshadowed by the 7 july attack on the london transport system - the first suicide attacks mainland britain had ever witnessed .
his opinion poll ratings improved in the immediate aftermath of 7 july , as he once again proved his ability to capture the nation 's mood in a time of crisis .
but when a bombers ' taped testimony was released blaming the attack on blair 's foreign policy , it threw the spotlight back on to iraq and his refusal to apologise for what his opponents saw as a terrible miscalculation .
blair was convinced britain was engaged , with america , in a global " war on terror " but he was having trouble bringing many in his party with him .
final straw when he failed to condemn israel 's bombing of lebanon , once again standing four square with george bush in the face of mounting criticism around the world , it was the final straw for many normally loyal labour mps .
a series of resignations by junior ministers , who believed his failure to name a departure date was damaging the party , underlined his weakened position and he was forced to announce he would be gone by september 2007 .
it was not , he confessed , the way he had wanted it to end .
tony blair has been sedgefield 's mp for nearly 25 years in his own mind , and that of his supporters , he was a prime minister at the peak of his powers .
his extraordinary farewell speech at the 2006 party conference in manchester reminded even his harshest labour party critics what they would be losing when he was gone .
the charisma that had served him so well over the years was still intact .
the difference was that he no longer agonised over his own popularity .
it was enough for him to know that he had " done the right thing " .
his final months in office were dogged by a police investigation into allegations he had nominated party donors for peerages .
he became the first serving prime minister to be interviewed as part of a police investigation , although downing street was keen to stress he was being treated as a witness .
the affair had its origins before the 2005 general election when blair - concerned by the size of the tories ' war chest - sought massive loans from a series of wealthy individuals , which he kept secret from all but a few members of his inner circle .
even labour 's treasurer was kept in the dark .
i am not going to beg for my character in front of anyone .
people can make up their own mind about me tony blair four of the lenders were subsequently nominated for peerages , but were rejected by the independent appointments ' commission , sparking opposition claims they had been " sold " honours .
blair was accused of flouting his own rules on party funding , introduced as part of his drive to " clean up " politics .
parliamentary standards commissioner sir alastair graham accused him of destroying trust in politics , saying the issue would be associated with his time in office in the way " sleaze " was with john major .
but rather than pleading to be trusted , as he had in 1997 during the bernie ecclestone affair , blair simply refused to talk about the allegations .
" i am not going to beg for my character in front of anyone .
people can make up their own mind about me , " he told the bbc in february .
conviction politician he said he had " a deep respect for the british people and it 's been an honour and privilege to lead them " .
but he said he had " changed " over the past 10 years .
he was a " different sort of person " now , who was less concerned about being " liked " .
blair had been hardened by a decade in office .
he had become a conviction politician - a very different character to the one that had first walked into downing street in 1997 , guitar case in hand .

at school he drove his teachers to distraction , constantly questioning their authority .
at university , he acted out his rock star fantasies as the lead singer of a band .
few at that stage would have predicted a career in the sober world of politics , even though blair 's charisma and ability to charm people were evident from an early age .
blair was known as a cheeky , argumentative schoolboy the story of his rise to power is certainly not a rags to riches tale - he was born with every advantage in life - but it is no less remarkable for that .
it is the story of how a middle class , privately-educated barrister - the son of a would-be tory mp - went on to become the most successful leader in the history of the labour party , profoundly changing it and the country in the process .
and how a man once seen as a lightweight - preoccupied with his own image and popularity - became one of the most powerful and controversial figures on the world stage .
tory leanings anthony charles lynton blair was born in 1953 in edinburgh , the second son of hazel and leo blair .
the student tony blair had a rebellious streak he spent the first few years of his life in adelaide , australia , where leo lectured in law at the city 's university .
they returned to the uk in late 1950s and blair spent the remainder of his childhood in durham , where he was a day pupil at the fee-paying choristers school .
leo was chairman of the local conservative association but had to abandon his ambition to become a tory mp when he suffered a stroke .
his political leanings appeared to have rubbed off on the young tony , who stood in a mock school election as the conservative candidate .
' maddening ' blair 's teachers at exclusive edinburgh boarding school fettes recall a cheeky , rebellious figure ; a talented actor who loved being the centre of attention and who cultivated a " cool " image among his peers .
blair 's cv born : 6 may 1953 educated : choristers school , fettes , oxford family : married , four children 1976 : barrister specialising in trade union and employment law 1983 : labour mp for sedgefield , shadow city spokesman 1984 - 87 : shadow trade and industry minister 1987 - 88 : shadow energy secretary 1989 - 92 : shadow employment secretary 1992 - 94 : shadow home secretary 1994 - 97 : opposition leader 1997 - prime minister " tony was full of life .
maddening at times , full of himself and very argumentative , " blair 's housemaster eric anderson told blair 's biographer john rentoul .
" he was an expert at testing the rules to the limit , and i would n't swear that he stuck rigidly to the rules on not drinking , smoking or breaking bounds .
but he was a live wire and fun to have around . "
at the age of 17 he was given " six of the best " for persistently flouting the school rules .
then he was threatened with expulsion .
it was his girlfriend 's father , lord mackenzie stewart , an old fettesian and cross bench peer , who came to the rescue , striking a deal with the school that allowed blair to spend the final few weeks of the summer term living with him .
mackenzie stewart 's daughter , amanda , was the first girl to be admitted to fettes .
typically , it was the super-confident blair who beat the 440 other boys to win her heart .
rock music blair also met charlie falconer while at fettes .
the man who would later become his lord chancellor was a pupil at the rival edinburgh academy .
blair left fettes with three a levels and a place at st john 's college , oxford , to study law .
the young barrister impressed michael foot with his enthusiasm like many teenage boys in the late 1960s he was besotted by rock music .
he idolised mick jagger but he also dreamed of wielding power behind the scenes , as a manager or promoter .
before taking up his place at oxford , he headed for london , where he spent a carefree year " managing " student rock bands and putting on gigs and discos with his friend alan collenette .
to make ends meet , the pair stacked shelves at barkers food hall , in kensington .
at oxford he briefly fronted a rock band , ugly rumours .
friends recall his charismatic stage presence , but also his professional attitude .
trainee barrister " he even wanted to rehearse , " said band mate mark ellen .
but blair was also developing a more thoughtful side .
he began to talk about left wing politics and , unusually for the times , became increasingly serious about his christian faith , taking confirmation classes .
he lost his mother to cancer while he was at oxford , which also appears to have profoundly affected his outlook .
in his first year at the university , he befriended an australian priest , peter thompson , with whom he would debate social issues and theology late into the night .
blair later credited thompson with awakening in him an interest in christian socialism , and a desire for social change .
how tony blair has aged during 10 years in office enlarge image blair was also unusual , in the pot-smoking student milieu of the early 1970s , in that he appears to have avoided drugs .
there are also few reports of him being incapacitated by drink .
his only real vice was smoking cigarettes , a habit wife cherie later made him quit .
he smoked his last one 15 minutes before their wedding .
blair left oxford with a second class degree and in 1976 became a trainee barrister in the chambers of derry irvine , who would later become his first lord chancellor .
it was here that he met cherie booth , a fellow pupil in irvine 's chambers .
she had a first class degree and was seen as being more of a high flyer than blair .
activist friends recall a christmas party , during a game which involved passing a balloon between their knees , when it became obvious they would be more than just colleagues .
blair properties 1980 : mapledene road , hackney , bought £ 40,000 , sold 1986 £ 80,000 1983 : myrobella , trimdon village , nr sedgefield , bought £ 30,000 1986 : stavordale road , islington , bought £ 120,000 , sold 1993 £ 200,000 1993 : richmond crescent , islington , bought £ 375,000 , sold 1997 £ 615,000 1997:11 downing street - rent free flat next door to prime minister 's traditional residence 2002 : clifton , bristol , two flats bought for £ 525,000 in total 2004 : connaught square , bayswater , bought £ 3.6m 2007 : bayswater .
two bed house behind connaught square property , bought £ 800,000 .
blairs plan to join buildings together to create extra space " the next day we went out to lunch and hours later we were still there , " blair later recalled .
" i found her immensely physically attractive and i wanted her as a friend as well . "
the couple married in 1980 , setting up home in hackney , east london , in a £ 40,000 end-of-terrace house , and threw themselves into local labour party politics .
blair had joined the party shortly after leaving oxford , but it was only now that he became more involved as an activist , encouraged by neighbour - and future home secretary - charles clarke , who shared his centre-left outlook .
in 1981 , through his father-in-law , the actor and left wing campaigner tony booth , blair contacted labour mp tom pendry to ask for help in becoming an mp .
pendry gave him a tour of the commons and advised him to stand for selection as a candidate in a forthcoming by-election in beaconsfield .
blair never stood a chance in such a safe conservative seat but he managed to attract the attention of labour leader michael foot , who was impressed by his enthusiasm and told him he had a " big future in politics " .
manifesto concerns nevertheless , it looked as if he would miss out on a chance to contest the 1983 general election .
it was only at the very last minute that he found a vacant seat , in the newly-created constituency of sedgefield , near where he grew up in county durham , securing the nomination ahead of several sitting mps and his future chief whip hilary armstrong , the daughter of a local labour mp .
the 1983 labour manifesto was one of the most left wing ever to be put before the british electorate .
it included commitments to nationalisation of industry and unilateral nuclear disarmament .
presentation was crucial to the new labour project blair made it clear privately to john burton , his election agent and mentor , that he did not agree with key parts of it , particularly proposals to withdraw britain from the eu .
his victory , in a rock solid labour area , was assured , although labour had a bad night nationally .
the early 1980s was a grim era of factory closures and job losses in the north east of england , with unemployment in the former mining villages that made up most of blair 's constituency soaring above 20 % .
within weeks of entering parliament , blair , who at 30 was the youngest labour mp , led a delegation of pit men and their families to london , where he joined forces with national union of mineworkers -lrb- num -rrb- leader arthur scargill to petition the national coal board over the planned closure of a coke works .
middle class appeal the young " london barrister , " as local newspapers described him , fought for his constituents ' jobs in traditional heavy industries but he also made no effort to hide his belief that the labour party had to modernise - and broaden its appeal to middle class voters - or die .
in an article for the northern echo , he argued " to win power for the low-paid , unemployed and the north , we must also appeal to the 60 % of the population in private housing , to the employed on the average wage and to the south " .
blair 's weekend guests sting elton john bono david bowie bob geldof mick hucknall lord attenborough joan collins dame judi dench cilla black john birt sir richard branson delia smith stephen fry kevin keegan source : downing street list of guests at chequers between 1997 and 2001 he soon learned this was not a message everyone in the labour party wanted to hear .
at one party meeting , he was shocked to find himself being denounced as a " traitor to socialism " by labour mp dennis skinner , after he made a speech urging reform .
" it was a very early lesson in politics because i said exactly what i thought .
i said we were living in a new age but we were talking like everybody had just got black and white tvs , " he later recalled in an interview with the northern echo .
cherie had also contested the 1983 general election , but after losing the no-hope seat of thanet in kent , she threw herself into her legal career , going on to become one of the country 's leading human rights lawyers .
by the end of blair 's first year in parliament , she had also given birth to the first of the couple 's four children , euan .
that first year also saw blair gain a crucial ally in his mission to modernise the labour party .
new agenda colleagues recall him being initially somewhat in awe of gordon brown , the young scottish mp he shared an office with in parliament .
blair 's favourite food bananas , beck 's lager and pistachio nuts - maid who served blair at labour conference fresh fettucini garnished with an exotic sauce of olive oil , sun-dried tomatoes and capers - nspcc islington cook book fish and chips - sedgefield labour party election leaflet unlike him , brown had been steeped in labour politics from a very early age and already had a knack for making headlines .
but together with peter mandelson , then a senior aide to party leader neil kinnock , the pair set about laying the foundations for what would become new labour .
blair , brown and mandelson were determined to make labour electable again by ditching unpopular labour policies , such as unilateral disarmament , and forging a new agenda marrying free market economics with social justice .
but they also wanted to improve the way labour communicated with voters .
focus groups , previously distrusted by labour politicians - if they had even heard of such things at all - would became key tools in shaping the party 's message .
advertising executives and pollsters , previously treated with suspicion by left wing politicians , were drafted into the modernisers ' inner circle to advise on presentation .
leadership deal blair and brown were promoted rapidly through the shadow cabinet ranks , but when it came to who would stand as the " modernising " candidate when leader john smith died of a heart attack in 1994 , their supporters were split .
many assumed brown , as the older of the two , would take precedence .
blair 's favourite music the beatles the rolling stones led zeppelin free bruce springsteen u2 coldplay the foo fighters simply red but the shadow chancellor hesitated , eventually agreeing to give blair a clear run at the top job .
the deal was supposedly struck over dinner at granita , an islington restaurant , with blair reportedly pledging to hand over to brown after two terms - and to give him , as chancellor , unprecedented control over the domestic agenda .
but the precise terms of any deal remain hotly contested .
what appears to have been decisive is the decision of mandelson to switch his backing from brown to blair - believing the shadow home secretary to be the better communicator of the two .
it was a decision that caused a " rift " in new labour from the beginning , mandelson recently admitted , with the distrust and feuding between blair and brown , or more often their respective supporters , coming to dominate british politics .
soundbites the new labour leader was initially seen as something of a political lightweight .
he had easily defeated left wingers john prescott and margaret beckett to snatch the leadership - and he had set about reforming the party with single-minded determination - but he was dubbed " bambi " by the press and cartoonists depicted him as a slick , permanently grinning public relations man .
like many in the labour party , blair believed neil kinnock 's chances of becoming prime minister in 1992 had been destroyed by a hostile tabloid press .
british troops saw much action during the blair years he was determined not to let that happen to him and he hired tough talking former tabloid journalist alastair campbell to sharpen up its press operation .
the pair would obsess over every aspect of blair 's image , placing bets on which of their carefully crafted soundbites would make it on to the evening news bulletins .
campbell normally won .
blair also courted showbusiness personalities - attempting to align labour with a new wave of british pop stars and artists emerging in the mid 1990s , dubbed by the style press " cool britannia " .
his speeches at the time bordered on the messianic , tapping into what he saw as a pre-millennial mood of optimism .
sleaze promise his specific policies were modest in scope , but his rhetoric was dizzying : he promised nothing less than a country reborn , sweeping away the " sleaze " and drift of the major years .
and he deployed all of his charm and charisma on tv chat shows , showing himself to be a natural in front of the cameras , in contrast to the more stilted major .
it worked .
blair swept to a landslide victory in 1997 , becoming , at 43 , the youngest prime minister in nearly 200 years .
blair 's family man image was a key part of his appeal always nervous on polling day , he was still gloomily contemplating a possible coalition with the liberal democrats , even as the scale of his victory was becoming obvious .
two hours after polls closed - with the early results indicating a landslide - he ordered supporters in the royal festival hall to stop celebrating for fear of appearing complacent or " triumphalist " .
he need not have feared .
blair entered downing street on a wave of optimism and good will , on 2 may 1997 .
he promised to restore trust in politics and breathe new life into britain 's tired institutions .
in the early weeks of his premiership , he held a series of glittering receptions in downing street to celebrate his victory .
but behind the scenes , he was haunted by the splits and in-fighting he believed had destroyed previous labour administrations .
honeymoon period he continued to rule over his party with an iron will , battling to impose his own choice of candidates in the first london mayoral contest and devolved assembly elections and ensuring ministers remained " on message " at all times .
wary of the civil service 's ability to deliver his policy goals , he centralised power in downing street .
he preferred to make decisions with a small band of trusted advisors , rather than through more formal cabinet procedures , prompting accusations of " cronyism " and claims he was running a presidential style of government .
the public backlash against iraq prompted thoughts of quitting the media manipulation techniques that had served him so well in opposition were also beginning to earn his government a reputation for " spin " .
but blair 's personality - and his ability to connect with people through television - continued to be central to labour 's appeal .
within weeks of being elected , he delivered a halting , emotionally-charged eulogy to princess diana , on the morning of her death .
it was a performance which seemed to capture the public mood .
he would later insist that the phrase " the people 's princess " was his own and not alastair campbell 's invention , as cynics claimed .
euro decision then , when he was engulfed by his first party funding scandal , accused of offering favours in return for a £ 1m donation from formula one boss bernie ecclestone , he again took to the airwaves , pleading with the public to keep their faith in him .
" i think most people who have dealt with me , think i 'm a pretty straight sort of guy and i am , " he told the bbc 's john humphrys .
blair 's honeymoon period with the electorate felt like it would go on forever and his popularity received a further boost in 2000 , when cherie announced that , at the age of 45 , she was to become a mother again .
leo blair became the first legitimate child to be born to a serving prime minister in 150 years .
blair holidays 1997 : tuscany , guest of geoffrey robinson , labour mp and businessman 1998 : tuscany , prince girolamo strozzi , law professor and family friend 1999 : tuscany , vannino chiti , tuscan president 2001 : ariege , southern france , sir martin keene , high court judge and family friend 2003 - 06 : barbados , sir cliff richard , singer 2004 : sardinia , silvio berlusconi , italian premier and media mogul 2006 : barbados , sir anthony bamford , jcb boss and tory donor 2007 : miami , robin gibb , bee gees member blair swept to another landslide election victory in 2001 , pledging to deliver improvements to health and education he had been promising since 1997 .
the timidity and reliance on focus groups that had characterised much of his first term began to be replaced by more sure-footed and decisive leadership .
he had already angered the left by talking about the " scars on his back " from his early , tentative attempts to make the public services more efficient .
now he was determined to be more bold in his approach , reasoning that the unions could hardly complain about market reforms with record amounts of cash pouring into schools and hospitals .
the only cloud on blair 's horizon was his worsening relationship with gordon brown , which , observers said , alternated between table-thumping rows and sullen periods of silence .
fresh mandate emboldened by his fresh mandate , he appointed blairites to key positions across government , from david blunkett at the home office to estelle morris at education , in an attempt to wrest control of the domestic agenda from the treasury .
but it was brown , who was said to be increasingly obsessed with becoming prime minister , that held all the aces when it came to the one thing blair really wanted .
he had long planned to take britain into the euro , believing it would define his legacy and finally place britain at the " heart of europe " after years on the margins under the conservatives .
but brown was less convinced of the case for joining the euro and , crucially , he had seized control of the entry process , devising five " economic tests " that had to be passed before britain ditched the pound .
a referendum was promised for 2003 , but by then the economic argument for the euro had been lost .
the five tests had not been passed , brown decreed , and the single currency was kicked into the long grass , along with blair 's dreams of a european legacy .
iraq but by then blair had found another , larger mission - one that really would write his name into the history books , for better or worse .
blair had always taken a single-minded approach to foreign policy .
he appeared to enjoy the company of the no-nonsense men of action he found in the military .
they made a refreshing change from the naturally cautious civil servants that surrounded him in downing street - or the left-wing mps and union leaders who it seemed to him were forever trying to stand in the way of progress .
early successes in sierra leone and kosovo convinced blair of the value of military action in pursuit of humanitarian aims .
the blairs ' marriage has remained solid throughout colleagues said his christian faith gave him a clearer sense of moral purpose than many of those around him - but it was not a subject he was ever comfortable talking about in public .
he had forged a close relationship with us president bill clinton during his first term in office , with whom he shared a centre-left political philosophy .
but to the surprise and dismay of many in his own party , including his loyal deputy john prescott , he formed an even closer bond with clinton 's successor , the republican george w bush .
the 11 september attacks moved the relationship on to a different level .
failure blair toured the world , shoring up support for the bush administration , utterly convinced of his own powers of persuasion and advocacy ; instinctively believing britain 's place was at america 's side in her hour of need .
but it was the 2003 decision to invade iraq - without a un mandate and in the teeth of bitter opposition at home and abroad - that would link the two leaders together in the public mind for ever .
blair had drawn on every last ounce of his persuasive skill to make the case for war to mps and the wider public .
blair and brown buried the hatchet for the 2005 election campaign but the subsequent failure to find weapons of mass destruction in iraq appeared to confirm many people 's worst suspicions about him - that he relied too much on spin and was not to be trusted .
in the public backlash that followed he briefly considered quitting .
he was persuaded to carry on by cabinet supporters but in october 2004 he surprised everyone by announcing he would not seek a fourth term in office if he won the next election .
the announcement had been designed to end speculation about his health - he had undergone an operation to correct an irregular heart beat .
' lame duck ' but it only succeeded in sparking more damaging speculation about his departure date , leading opponents to brand him a " lame duck " premier .
for the 2005 general election campaign , alastair campbell devised what came to be known as the " masochism strategy " , with blair allowing voters to vent their anger about iraq at him in a series of tv debates .
he became the first labour leader to win three consecutive terms in office but any elation was short-lived .
his share of the popular vote was the lowest on record for any prime minister .
his self-belief and powers of persuasion remained undimmed .
over one remarkable 24 hour period , he flew to singapore to help london land the 2012 olympics - punching the air with glee as he did so - before flying back to gleneagles , in scotland , to unveil a debt relief package for africa .
they were the two of the biggest achievements of his premiership .
blair 's final conference speech was an emotional occasion but they were instantly overshadowed by the 7 july attack on the london transport system - the first suicide attacks mainland britain had ever witnessed .
his opinion poll ratings improved in the immediate aftermath of 7 july , as he once again proved his ability to capture the nation 's mood in a time of crisis .
but when a bombers ' taped testimony was released blaming the attack on blair 's foreign policy , it threw the spotlight back on to iraq and his refusal to apologise for what his opponents saw as a terrible miscalculation .
blair was convinced britain was engaged , with america , in a global " war on terror " but he was having trouble bringing many in his party with him .
final straw when he failed to condemn israel 's bombing of lebanon , once again standing four square with george bush in the face of mounting criticism around the world , it was the final straw for many normally loyal labour mps .
a series of resignations by junior ministers , who believed his failure to name a departure date was damaging the party , underlined his weakened position and he was forced to announce he would be gone by september 2007 .
it was not , he confessed , the way he had wanted it to end .
tony blair has been sedgefield 's mp for nearly 25 years in his own mind , and that of his supporters , he was a prime minister at the peak of his powers .
his extraordinary farewell speech at the 2006 party conference in manchester reminded even his harshest labour party critics what they would be losing when he was gone .
the charisma that had served him so well over the years was still intact .
the difference was that he no longer agonised over his own popularity .
it was enough for him to know that he had " done the right thing " .
his final months in office were dogged by a police investigation into allegations he had nominated party donors for peerages .
he became the first serving prime minister to be interviewed as part of a police investigation , although downing street was keen to stress he was being treated as a witness .
the affair had its origins before the 2005 general election when blair - concerned by the size of the tories ' war chest - sought massive loans from a series of wealthy individuals , which he kept secret from all but a few members of his inner circle .
even labour 's treasurer was kept in the dark .
i am not going to beg for my character in front of anyone .
people can make up their own mind about me tony blair four of the lenders were subsequently nominated for peerages , but were rejected by the independent appointments ' commission , sparking opposition claims they had been " sold " honours .
blair was accused of flouting his own rules on party funding , introduced as part of his drive to " clean up " politics .
parliamentary standards commissioner sir alastair graham accused him of destroying trust in politics , saying the issue would be associated with his time in office in the way " sleaze " was with john major .
but rather than pleading to be trusted , as he had in 1997 during the bernie ecclestone affair , blair simply refused to talk about the allegations .
" i am not going to beg for my character in front of anyone .
people can make up their own mind about me , " he told the bbc in february .
conviction politician he said he had " a deep respect for the british people and it 's been an honour and privilege to lead them " .
but he said he had " changed " over the past 10 years .
he was a " different sort of person " now , who was less concerned about being " liked " .

at school he drove his teachers to distraction , constantly questioning their authority .
at university , he acted out his rock star fantasies as the lead singer of a band .
few at that stage would have predicted a career in the sober world of politics , even though blair 's charisma and ability to charm people were evident from an early age .
blair was known as a cheeky , argumentative schoolboy the story of his rise to power is certainly not a rags to riches tale - he was born with every advantage in life - but it is no less remarkable for that .
it is the story of how a middle class , privately-educated barrister - the son of a would-be tory mp - went on to become the most successful leader in the history of the labour party , profoundly changing it and the country in the process .
and how a man once seen as a lightweight - preoccupied with his own image and popularity - became one of the most powerful and controversial figures on the world stage .
tory leanings anthony charles lynton blair was born in 1953 in edinburgh , the second son of hazel and leo blair .
the student tony blair had a rebellious streak he spent the first few years of his life in adelaide , australia , where leo lectured in law at the city 's university .
they returned to the uk in late 1950s and blair spent the remainder of his childhood in durham , where he was a day pupil at the fee-paying choristers school .
leo was chairman of the local conservative association but had to abandon his ambition to become a tory mp when he suffered a stroke .
his political leanings appeared to have rubbed off on the young tony , who stood in a mock school election as the conservative candidate .
' maddening ' blair 's teachers at exclusive edinburgh boarding school fettes recall a cheeky , rebellious figure ; a talented actor who loved being the centre of attention and who cultivated a " cool " image among his peers .
blair 's cv born : 6 may 1953 educated : choristers school , fettes , oxford family : married , four children 1976 : barrister specialising in trade union and employment law 1983 : labour mp for sedgefield , shadow city spokesman 1984 - 87 : shadow trade and industry minister 1987 - 88 : shadow energy secretary 1989 - 92 : shadow employment secretary 1992 - 94 : shadow home secretary 1994 - 97 : opposition leader 1997 - prime minister " tony was full of life .
maddening at times , full of himself and very argumentative , " blair 's housemaster eric anderson told blair 's biographer john rentoul .
" he was an expert at testing the rules to the limit , and i would n't swear that he stuck rigidly to the rules on not drinking , smoking or breaking bounds .
but he was a live wire and fun to have around . "
at the age of 17 he was given " six of the best " for persistently flouting the school rules .
then he was threatened with expulsion .
it was his girlfriend 's father , lord mackenzie stewart , an old fettesian and cross bench peer , who came to the rescue , striking a deal with the school that allowed blair to spend the final few weeks of the summer term living with him .
mackenzie stewart 's daughter , amanda , was the first girl to be admitted to fettes .
typically , it was the super-confident blair who beat the 440 other boys to win her heart .
rock music blair also met charlie falconer while at fettes .
the man who would later become his lord chancellor was a pupil at the rival edinburgh academy .
blair left fettes with three a levels and a place at st john 's college , oxford , to study law .
the young barrister impressed michael foot with his enthusiasm like many teenage boys in the late 1960s he was besotted by rock music .
he idolised mick jagger but he also dreamed of wielding power behind the scenes , as a manager or promoter .
before taking up his place at oxford , he headed for london , where he spent a carefree year " managing " student rock bands and putting on gigs and discos with his friend alan collenette .
to make ends meet , the pair stacked shelves at barkers food hall , in kensington .
at oxford he briefly fronted a rock band , ugly rumours .
friends recall his charismatic stage presence , but also his professional attitude .
trainee barrister " he even wanted to rehearse , " said band mate mark ellen .
but blair was also developing a more thoughtful side .
he began to talk about left wing politics and , unusually for the times , became increasingly serious about his christian faith , taking confirmation classes .
he lost his mother to cancer while he was at oxford , which also appears to have profoundly affected his outlook .
in his first year at the university , he befriended an australian priest , peter thompson , with whom he would debate social issues and theology late into the night .
blair later credited thompson with awakening in him an interest in christian socialism , and a desire for social change .
how tony blair has aged during 10 years in office enlarge image blair was also unusual , in the pot-smoking student milieu of the early 1970s , in that he appears to have avoided drugs .
there are also few reports of him being incapacitated by drink .
his only real vice was smoking cigarettes , a habit wife cherie later made him quit .
he smoked his last one 15 minutes before their wedding .
blair left oxford with a second class degree and in 1976 became a trainee barrister in the chambers of derry irvine , who would later become his first lord chancellor .
it was here that he met cherie booth , a fellow pupil in irvine 's chambers .
she had a first class degree and was seen as being more of a high flyer than blair .
activist friends recall a christmas party , during a game which involved passing a balloon between their knees , when it became obvious they would be more than just colleagues .
blair properties 1980 : mapledene road , hackney , bought £ 40,000 , sold 1986 £ 80,000 1983 : myrobella , trimdon village , nr sedgefield , bought £ 30,000 1986 : stavordale road , islington , bought £ 120,000 , sold 1993 £ 200,000 1993 : richmond crescent , islington , bought £ 375,000 , sold 1997 £ 615,000 1997:11 downing street - rent free flat next door to prime minister 's traditional residence 2002 : clifton , bristol , two flats bought for £ 525,000 in total 2004 : connaught square , bayswater , bought £ 3.6m 2007 : bayswater .
two bed house behind connaught square property , bought £ 800,000 .
blairs plan to join buildings together to create extra space " the next day we went out to lunch and hours later we were still there , " blair later recalled .
" i found her immensely physically attractive and i wanted her as a friend as well . "
the couple married in 1980 , setting up home in hackney , east london , in a £ 40,000 end-of-terrace house , and threw themselves into local labour party politics .
blair had joined the party shortly after leaving oxford , but it was only now that he became more involved as an activist , encouraged by neighbour - and future home secretary - charles clarke , who shared his centre-left outlook .
in 1981 , through his father-in-law , the actor and left wing campaigner tony booth , blair contacted labour mp tom pendry to ask for help in becoming an mp .
pendry gave him a tour of the commons and advised him to stand for selection as a candidate in a forthcoming by-election in beaconsfield .
blair never stood a chance in such a safe conservative seat but he managed to attract the attention of labour leader michael foot , who was impressed by his enthusiasm and told him he had a " big future in politics " .
manifesto concerns nevertheless , it looked as if he would miss out on a chance to contest the 1983 general election .
it was only at the very last minute that he found a vacant seat , in the newly-created constituency of sedgefield , near where he grew up in county durham , securing the nomination ahead of several sitting mps and his future chief whip hilary armstrong , the daughter of a local labour mp .
the 1983 labour manifesto was one of the most left wing ever to be put before the british electorate .
it included commitments to nationalisation of industry and unilateral nuclear disarmament .
presentation was crucial to the new labour project blair made it clear privately to john burton , his election agent and mentor , that he did not agree with key parts of it , particularly proposals to withdraw britain from the eu .
his victory , in a rock solid labour area , was assured , although labour had a bad night nationally .
the early 1980s was a grim era of factory closures and job losses in the north east of england , with unemployment in the former mining villages that made up most of blair 's constituency soaring above 20 % .
within weeks of entering parliament , blair , who at 30 was the youngest labour mp , led a delegation of pit men and their families to london , where he joined forces with national union of mineworkers -lrb- num -rrb- leader arthur scargill to petition the national coal board over the planned closure of a coke works .
middle class appeal the young " london barrister , " as local newspapers described him , fought for his constituents ' jobs in traditional heavy industries but he also made no effort to hide his belief that the labour party had to modernise - and broaden its appeal to middle class voters - or die .
in an article for the northern echo , he argued " to win power for the low-paid , unemployed and the north , we must also appeal to the 60 % of the population in private housing , to the employed on the average wage and to the south " .

at one party meeting , he was shocked to find himself being denounced as a " traitor to socialism " by labour mp dennis skinner , after he made a speech urging reform .
" it was a very early lesson in politics because i said exactly what i thought .
i said we were living in a new age but we were talking like everybody had just got black and white tvs , " he later recalled in an interview with the northern echo .
cherie had also contested the 1983 general election , but after losing the no-hope seat of thanet in kent , she threw herself into her legal career , going on to become one of the country 's leading human rights lawyers .
by the end of blair 's first year in parliament , she had also given birth to the first of the couple 's four children , euan .
that first year also saw blair gain a crucial ally in his mission to modernise the labour party .
new agenda colleagues recall him being initially somewhat in awe of gordon brown , the young scottish mp he shared an office with in parliament .
blair 's favourite food bananas , beck 's lager and pistachio nuts - maid who served blair at labour conference fresh fettucini garnished with an exotic sauce of olive oil , sun-dried tomatoes and capers - nspcc islington cook book fish and chips - sedgefield labour party election leaflet unlike him , brown had been steeped in labour politics from a very early age and already had a knack for making headlines .
but together with peter mandelson , then a senior aide to party leader neil kinnock , the pair set about laying the foundations for what would become new labour .
blair , brown and mandelson were determined to make labour electable again by ditching unpopular labour policies , such as unilateral disarmament , and forging a new agenda marrying free market economics with social justice .
but they also wanted to improve the way labour communicated with voters .
focus groups , previously distrusted by labour politicians - if they had even heard of such things at all - would became key tools in shaping the party 's message .
advertising executives and pollsters , previously treated with suspicion by left wing politicians , were drafted into the modernisers ' inner circle to advise on presentation .
leadership deal blair and brown were promoted rapidly through the shadow cabinet ranks , but when it came to who would stand as the " modernising " candidate when leader john smith died of a heart attack in 1994 , their supporters were split .
many assumed brown , as the older of the two , would take precedence .
blair 's favourite music the beatles the rolling stones led zeppelin free bruce springsteen u2 coldplay the foo fighters simply red but the shadow chancellor hesitated , eventually agreeing to give blair a clear run at the top job .
the deal was supposedly struck over dinner at granita , an islington restaurant , with blair reportedly pledging to hand over to brown after two terms - and to give him , as chancellor , unprecedented control over the domestic agenda .
but the precise terms of any deal remain hotly contested .
what appears to have been decisive is the decision of mandelson to switch his backing from brown to blair - believing the shadow home secretary to be the better communicator of the two .
it was a decision that caused a " rift " in new labour from the beginning , mandelson recently admitted , with the distrust and feuding between blair and brown , or more often their respective supporters , coming to dominate british politics .
soundbites the new labour leader was initially seen as something of a political lightweight .
he had easily defeated left wingers john prescott and margaret beckett to snatch the leadership - and he had set about reforming the party with single-minded determination - but he was dubbed " bambi " by the press and cartoonists depicted him as a slick , permanently grinning public relations man .
like many in the labour party , blair believed neil kinnock 's chances of becoming prime minister in 1992 had been destroyed by a hostile tabloid press .
british troops saw much action during the blair years he was determined not to let that happen to him and he hired tough talking former tabloid journalist alastair campbell to sharpen up its press operation .
the pair would obsess over every aspect of blair 's image , placing bets on which of their carefully crafted soundbites would make it on to the evening news bulletins .
campbell normally won .
blair also courted showbusiness personalities - attempting to align labour with a new wave of british pop stars and artists emerging in the mid 1990s , dubbed by the style press " cool britannia " .
his speeches at the time bordered on the messianic , tapping into what he saw as a pre-millennial mood of optimism .
sleaze promise his specific policies were modest in scope , but his rhetoric was dizzying : he promised nothing less than a country reborn , sweeping away the " sleaze " and drift of the major years .
and he deployed all of his charm and charisma on tv chat shows , showing himself to be a natural in front of the cameras , in contrast to the more stilted major .
it worked .
blair swept to a landslide victory in 1997 , becoming , at 43 , the youngest prime minister in nearly 200 years .
blair 's family man image was a key part of his appeal always nervous on polling day , he was still gloomily contemplating a possible coalition with the liberal democrats , even as the scale of his victory was becoming obvious .
two hours after polls closed - with the early results indicating a landslide - he ordered supporters in the royal festival hall to stop celebrating for fear of appearing complacent or " triumphalist " .
he need not have feared .
blair entered downing street on a wave of optimism and good will , on 2 may 1997 .
he promised to restore trust in politics and breathe new life into britain 's tired institutions .
in the early weeks of his premiership , he held a series of glittering receptions in downing street to celebrate his victory .
but behind the scenes , he was haunted by the splits and in-fighting he believed had destroyed previous labour administrations .
honeymoon period he continued to rule over his party with an iron will , battling to impose his own choice of candidates in the first london mayoral contest and devolved assembly elections and ensuring ministers remained " on message " at all times .
wary of the civil service 's ability to deliver his policy goals , he centralised power in downing street .
he preferred to make decisions with a small band of trusted advisors , rather than through more formal cabinet procedures , prompting accusations of " cronyism " and claims he was running a presidential style of government .
the public backlash against iraq prompted thoughts of quitting the media manipulation techniques that had served him so well in opposition were also beginning to earn his government a reputation for " spin " .
but blair 's personality - and his ability to connect with people through television - continued to be central to labour 's appeal .
within weeks of being elected , he delivered a halting , emotionally-charged eulogy to princess diana , on the morning of her death .
it was a performance which seemed to capture the public mood .
he would later insist that the phrase " the people 's princess " was his own and not alastair campbell 's invention , as cynics claimed .
euro decision then , when he was engulfed by his first party funding scandal , accused of offering favours in return for a £ 1m donation from formula one boss bernie ecclestone , he again took to the airwaves , pleading with the public to keep their faith in him .
" i think most people who have dealt with me , think i 'm a pretty straight sort of guy and i am , " he told the bbc 's john humphrys .
blair 's honeymoon period with the electorate felt like it would go on forever and his popularity received a further boost in 2000 , when cherie announced that , at the age of 45 , she was to become a mother again .
leo blair became the first legitimate child to be born to a serving prime minister in 150 years .
blair holidays 1997 : tuscany , guest of geoffrey robinson , labour mp and businessman 1998 : tuscany , prince girolamo strozzi , law professor and family friend 1999 : tuscany , vannino chiti , tuscan president 2001 : ariege , southern france , sir martin keene , high court judge and family friend 2003 - 06 : barbados , sir cliff richard , singer 2004 : sardinia , silvio berlusconi , italian premier and media mogul 2006 : barbados , sir anthony bamford , jcb boss and tory donor 2007 : miami , robin gibb , bee gees member blair swept to another landslide election victory in 2001 , pledging to deliver improvements to health and education he had been promising since 1997 .
the timidity and reliance on focus groups that had characterised much of his first term began to be replaced by more sure-footed and decisive leadership .
he had already angered the left by talking about the " scars on his back " from his early , tentative attempts to make the public services more efficient .
now he was determined to be more bold in his approach , reasoning that the unions could hardly complain about market reforms with record amounts of cash pouring into schools and hospitals .
the only cloud on blair 's horizon was his worsening relationship with gordon brown , which , observers said , alternated between table-thumping rows and sullen periods of silence .
fresh mandate emboldened by his fresh mandate , he appointed blairites to key positions across government , from david blunkett at the home office to estelle morris at education , in an attempt to wrest control of the domestic agenda from the treasury .
but it was brown , who was said to be increasingly obsessed with becoming prime minister , that held all the aces when it came to the one thing blair really wanted .
he had long planned to take britain into the euro , believing it would define his legacy and finally place britain at the " heart of europe " after years on the margins under the conservatives .
but brown was less convinced of the case for joining the euro and , crucially , he had seized control of the entry process , devising five " economic tests " that had to be passed before britain ditched the pound .
a referendum was promised for 2003 , but by then the economic argument for the euro had been lost .
the five tests had not been passed , brown decreed , and the single currency was kicked into the long grass , along with blair 's dreams of a european legacy .
iraq but by then blair had found another , larger mission - one that really would write his name into the history books , for better or worse .
blair had always taken a single-minded approach to foreign policy .
he appeared to enjoy the company of the no-nonsense men of action he found in the military .
they made a refreshing change from the naturally cautious civil servants that surrounded him in downing street - or the left-wing mps and union leaders who it seemed to him were forever trying to stand in the way of progress .
early successes in sierra leone and kosovo convinced blair of the value of military action in pursuit of humanitarian aims .
the blairs ' marriage has remained solid throughout colleagues said his christian faith gave him a clearer sense of moral purpose than many of those around him - but it was not a subject he was ever comfortable talking about in public .
he had forged a close relationship with us president bill clinton during his first term in office , with whom he shared a centre-left political philosophy .
but to the surprise and dismay of many in his own party , including his loyal deputy john prescott , he formed an even closer bond with clinton 's successor , the republican george w bush .
the 11 september attacks moved the relationship on to a different level .
failure blair toured the world , shoring up support for the bush administration , utterly convinced of his own powers of persuasion and advocacy ; instinctively believing britain 's place was at america 's side in her hour of need .
but it was the 2003 decision to invade iraq - without a un mandate and in the teeth of bitter opposition at home and abroad - that would link the two leaders together in the public mind for ever .
blair had drawn on every last ounce of his persuasive skill to make the case for war to mps and the wider public .
blair and brown buried the hatchet for the 2005 election campaign but the subsequent failure to find weapons of mass destruction in iraq appeared to confirm many people 's worst suspicions about him - that he relied too much on spin and was not to be trusted .
in the public backlash that followed he briefly considered quitting .
he was persuaded to carry on by cabinet supporters but in october 2004 he surprised everyone by announcing he would not seek a fourth term in office if he won the next election .
the announcement had been designed to end speculation about his health - he had undergone an operation to correct an irregular heart beat .
' lame duck ' but it only succeeded in sparking more damaging speculation about his departure date , leading opponents to brand him a " lame duck " premier .
for the 2005 general election campaign , alastair campbell devised what came to be known as the " masochism strategy " , with blair allowing voters to vent their anger about iraq at him in a series of tv debates .
he became the first labour leader to win three consecutive terms in office but any elation was short-lived .
his share of the popular vote was the lowest on record for any prime minister .
his self-belief and powers of persuasion remained undimmed .
over one remarkable 24 hour period , he flew to singapore to help london land the 2012 olympics - punching the air with glee as he did so - before flying back to gleneagles , in scotland , to unveil a debt relief package for africa .
they were the two of the biggest achievements of his premiership .
blair 's final conference speech was an emotional occasion but they were instantly overshadowed by the 7 july attack on the london transport system - the first suicide attacks mainland britain had ever witnessed .
his opinion poll ratings improved in the immediate aftermath of 7 july , as he once again proved his ability to capture the nation 's mood in a time of crisis .
but when a bombers ' taped testimony was released blaming the attack on blair 's foreign policy , it threw the spotlight back on to iraq and his refusal to apologise for what his opponents saw as a terrible miscalculation .
blair was convinced britain was engaged , with america , in a global " war on terror " but he was having trouble bringing many in his party with him .
final straw when he failed to condemn israel 's bombing of lebanon , once again standing four square with george bush in the face of mounting criticism around the world , it was the final straw for many normally loyal labour mps .
a series of resignations by junior ministers , who believed his failure to name a departure date was damaging the party , underlined his weakened position and he was forced to announce he would be gone by september 2007 .
it was not , he confessed , the way he had wanted it to end .
tony blair has been sedgefield 's mp for nearly 25 years in his own mind , and that of his supporters , he was a prime minister at the peak of his powers .
his extraordinary farewell speech at the 2006 party conference in manchester reminded even his harshest labour party critics what they would be losing when he was gone .
the charisma that had served him so well over the years was still intact .
the difference was that he no longer agonised over his own popularity .
it was enough for him to know that he had " done the right thing " .
his final months in office were dogged by a police investigation into allegations he had nominated party donors for peerages .
he became the first serving prime minister to be interviewed as part of a police investigation , although downing street was keen to stress he was being treated as a witness .
the affair had its origins before the 2005 general election when blair - concerned by the size of the tories ' war chest - sought massive loans from a series of wealthy individuals , which he kept secret from all but a few members of his inner circle .
even labour 's treasurer was kept in the dark .
i am not going to beg for my character in front of anyone .
people can make up their own mind about me tony blair four of the lenders were subsequently nominated for peerages , but were rejected by the independent appointments ' commission , sparking opposition claims they had been " sold " honours .
blair was accused of flouting his own rules on party funding , introduced as part of his drive to " clean up " politics .
parliamentary standards commissioner sir alastair graham accused him of destroying trust in politics , saying the issue would be associated with his time in office in the way " sleaze " was with john major .
but rather than pleading to be trusted , as he had in 1997 during the bernie ecclestone affair , blair simply refused to talk about the allegations .
" i am not going to beg for my character in front of anyone .
people can make up their own mind about me , " he told the bbc in february .
conviction politician he said he had " a deep respect for the british people and it 's been an honour and privilege to lead them " .
but he said he had " changed " over the past 10 years .
he was a " different sort of person " now , who was less concerned about being " liked " .
blair had been hardened by a decade in office .
he had become a conviction politician - a very different character to the one that had first walked into downing street in 1997 , guitar case in hand .

at school he drove his teachers to distraction , constantly questioning their authority .
at university , he acted out his rock star fantasies as the lead singer of a band .
few at that stage would have predicted a career in the sober world of politics , even though blair 's charisma and ability to charm people were evident from an early age .
blair was known as a cheeky , argumentative schoolboy the story of his rise to power is certainly not a rags to riches tale - he was born with every advantage in life - but it is no less remarkable for that .
it is the story of how a middle class , privately-educated barrister - the son of a would-be tory mp - went on to become the most successful leader in the history of the labour party , profoundly changing it and the country in the process .
and how a man once seen as a lightweight - preoccupied with his own image and popularity - became one of the most powerful and controversial figures on the world stage .
tory leanings anthony charles lynton blair was born in 1953 in edinburgh , the second son of hazel and leo blair .
the student tony blair had a rebellious streak he spent the first few years of his life in adelaide , australia , where leo lectured in law at the city 's university .
they returned to the uk in late 1950s and blair spent the remainder of his childhood in durham , where he was a day pupil at the fee-paying choristers school .
leo was chairman of the local conservative association but had to abandon his ambition to become a tory mp when he suffered a stroke .
his political leanings appeared to have rubbed off on the young tony , who stood in a mock school election as the conservative candidate .
' maddening ' blair 's teachers at exclusive edinburgh boarding school fettes recall a cheeky , rebellious figure ; a talented actor who loved being the centre of attention and who cultivated a " cool " image among his peers .
blair 's cv born : 6 may 1953 educated : choristers school , fettes , oxford family : married , four children 1976 : barrister specialising in trade union and employment law 1983 : labour mp for sedgefield , shadow city spokesman 1984 - 87 : shadow trade and industry minister 1987 - 88 : shadow energy secretary 1989 - 92 : shadow employment secretary 1992 - 94 : shadow home secretary 1994 - 97 : opposition leader 1997 - prime minister " tony was full of life .
maddening at times , full of himself and very argumentative , " blair 's housemaster eric anderson told blair 's biographer john rentoul .
" he was an expert at testing the rules to the limit , and i would n't swear that he stuck rigidly to the rules on not drinking , smoking or breaking bounds .
but he was a live wire and fun to have around . "
at the age of 17 he was given " six of the best " for persistently flouting the school rules .
then he was threatened with expulsion .
it was his girlfriend 's father , lord mackenzie stewart , an old fettesian and cross bench peer , who came to the rescue , striking a deal with the school that allowed blair to spend the final few weeks of the summer term living with him .
mackenzie stewart 's daughter , amanda , was the first girl to be admitted to fettes .
typically , it was the super-confident blair who beat the 440 other boys to win her heart .
rock music blair also met charlie falconer while at fettes .
the man who would later become his lord chancellor was a pupil at the rival edinburgh academy .
blair left fettes with three a levels and a place at st john 's college , oxford , to study law .
the young barrister impressed michael foot with his enthusiasm like many teenage boys in the late 1960s he was besotted by rock music .
he idolised mick jagger but he also dreamed of wielding power behind the scenes , as a manager or promoter .
before taking up his place at oxford , he headed for london , where he spent a carefree year " managing " student rock bands and putting on gigs and discos with his friend alan collenette .
to make ends meet , the pair stacked shelves at barkers food hall , in kensington .
at oxford he briefly fronted a rock band , ugly rumours .
friends recall his charismatic stage presence , but also his professional attitude .
trainee barrister " he even wanted to rehearse , " said band mate mark ellen .
but blair was also developing a more thoughtful side .
he began to talk about left wing politics and , unusually for the times , became increasingly serious about his christian faith , taking confirmation classes .
he lost his mother to cancer while he was at oxford , which also appears to have profoundly affected his outlook .
in his first year at the university , he befriended an australian priest , peter thompson , with whom he would debate social issues and theology late into the night .
blair later credited thompson with awakening in him an interest in christian socialism , and a desire for social change .
how tony blair has aged during 10 years in office enlarge image blair was also unusual , in the pot-smoking student milieu of the early 1970s , in that he appears to have avoided drugs .
there are also few reports of him being incapacitated by drink .
his only real vice was smoking cigarettes , a habit wife cherie later made him quit .
he smoked his last one 15 minutes before their wedding .
blair left oxford with a second class degree and in 1976 became a trainee barrister in the chambers of derry irvine , who would later become his first lord chancellor .
it was here that he met cherie booth , a fellow pupil in irvine 's chambers .
she had a first class degree and was seen as being more of a high flyer than blair .
activist friends recall a christmas party , during a game which involved passing a balloon between their knees , when it became obvious they would be more than just colleagues .
blair properties 1980 : mapledene road , hackney , bought £ 40,000 , sold 1986 £ 80,000 1983 : myrobella , trimdon village , nr sedgefield , bought £ 30,000 1986 : stavordale road , islington , bought £ 120,000 , sold 1993 £ 200,000 1993 : richmond crescent , islington , bought £ 375,000 , sold 1997 £ 615,000 1997:11 downing street - rent free flat next door to prime minister 's traditional residence 2002 : clifton , bristol , two flats bought for £ 525,000 in total 2004 : connaught square , bayswater , bought £ 3.6m 2007 : bayswater .
two bed house behind connaught square property , bought £ 800,000 .
blairs plan to join buildings together to create extra space " the next day we went out to lunch and hours later we were still there , " blair later recalled .
" i found her immensely physically attractive and i wanted her as a friend as well . "
the couple married in 1980 , setting up home in hackney , east london , in a £ 40,000 end-of-terrace house , and threw themselves into local labour party politics .
blair had joined the party shortly after leaving oxford , but it was only now that he became more involved as an activist , encouraged by neighbour - and future home secretary - charles clarke , who shared his centre-left outlook .
in 1981 , through his father-in-law , the actor and left wing campaigner tony booth , blair contacted labour mp tom pendry to ask for help in becoming an mp .
pendry gave him a tour of the commons and advised him to stand for selection as a candidate in a forthcoming by-election in beaconsfield .
blair never stood a chance in such a safe conservative seat but he managed to attract the attention of labour leader michael foot , who was impressed by his enthusiasm and told him he had a " big future in politics " .
manifesto concerns nevertheless , it looked as if he would miss out on a chance to contest the 1983 general election .
it was only at the very last minute that he found a vacant seat , in the newly-created constituency of sedgefield , near where he grew up in county durham , securing the nomination ahead of several sitting mps and his future chief whip hilary armstrong , the daughter of a local labour mp .
the 1983 labour manifesto was one of the most left wing ever to be put before the british electorate .
it included commitments to nationalisation of industry and unilateral nuclear disarmament .
presentation was crucial to the new labour project blair made it clear privately to john burton , his election agent and mentor , that he did not agree with key parts of it , particularly proposals to withdraw britain from the eu .
his victory , in a rock solid labour area , was assured , although labour had a bad night nationally .
the early 1980s was a grim era of factory closures and job losses in the north east of england , with unemployment in the former mining villages that made up most of blair 's constituency soaring above 20 % .
within weeks of entering parliament , blair , who at 30 was the youngest labour mp , led a delegation of pit men and their families to london , where he joined forces with national union of mineworkers -lrb- num -rrb- leader arthur scargill to petition the national coal board over the planned closure of a coke works .
middle class appeal the young " london barrister , " as local newspapers described him , fought for his constituents ' jobs in traditional heavy industries but he also made no effort to hide his belief that the labour party had to modernise - and broaden its appeal to middle class voters - or die .
in an article for the northern echo , he argued " to win power for the low-paid , unemployed and the north , we must also appeal to the 60 % of the population in private housing , to the employed on the average wage and to the south " .

at one party meeting , he was shocked to find himself being denounced as a " traitor to socialism " by labour mp dennis skinner , after he made a speech urging reform .
" it was a very early lesson in politics because i said exactly what i thought .
i said we were living in a new age but we were talking like everybody had just got black and white tvs , " he later recalled in an interview with the northern echo .
cherie had also contested the 1983 general election , but after losing the no-hope seat of thanet in kent , she threw herself into her legal career , going on to become one of the country 's leading human rights lawyers .
by the end of blair 's first year in parliament , she had also given birth to the first of the couple 's four children , euan .
that first year also saw blair gain a crucial ally in his mission to modernise the labour party .
new agenda colleagues recall him being initially somewhat in awe of gordon brown , the young scottish mp he shared an office with in parliament .
blair 's favourite food bananas , beck 's lager and pistachio nuts - maid who served blair at labour conference fresh fettucini garnished with an exotic sauce of olive oil , sun-dried tomatoes and capers - nspcc islington cook book fish and chips - sedgefield labour party election leaflet unlike him , brown had been steeped in labour politics from a very early age and already had a knack for making headlines .
but together with peter mandelson , then a senior aide to party leader neil kinnock , the pair set about laying the foundations for what would become new labour .
blair , brown and mandelson were determined to make labour electable again by ditching unpopular labour policies , such as unilateral disarmament , and forging a new agenda marrying free market economics with social justice .
but they also wanted to improve the way labour communicated with voters .
focus groups , previously distrusted by labour politicians - if they had even heard of such things at all - would became key tools in shaping the party 's message .
advertising executives and pollsters , previously treated with suspicion by left wing politicians , were drafted into the modernisers ' inner circle to advise on presentation .
leadership deal blair and brown were promoted rapidly through the shadow cabinet ranks , but when it came to who would stand as the " modernising " candidate when leader john smith died of a heart attack in 1994 , their supporters were split .
many assumed brown , as the older of the two , would take precedence .
blair 's favourite music the beatles the rolling stones led zeppelin free bruce springsteen u2 coldplay the foo fighters simply red but the shadow chancellor hesitated , eventually agreeing to give blair a clear run at the top job .
the deal was supposedly struck over dinner at granita , an islington restaurant , with blair reportedly pledging to hand over to brown after two terms - and to give him , as chancellor , unprecedented control over the domestic agenda .
but the precise terms of any deal remain hotly contested .
what appears to have been decisive is the decision of mandelson to switch his backing from brown to blair - believing the shadow home secretary to be the better communicator of the two .
it was a decision that caused a " rift " in new labour from the beginning , mandelson recently admitted , with the distrust and feuding between blair and brown , or more often their respective supporters , coming to dominate british politics .
soundbites the new labour leader was initially seen as something of a political lightweight .
he had easily defeated left wingers john prescott and margaret beckett to snatch the leadership - and he had set about reforming the party with single-minded determination - but he was dubbed " bambi " by the press and cartoonists depicted him as a slick , permanently grinning public relations man .
like many in the labour party , blair believed neil kinnock 's chances of becoming prime minister in 1992 had been destroyed by a hostile tabloid press .
british troops saw much action during the blair years he was determined not to let that happen to him and he hired tough talking former tabloid journalist alastair campbell to sharpen up its press operation .
the pair would obsess over every aspect of blair 's image , placing bets on which of their carefully crafted soundbites would make it on to the evening news bulletins .
campbell normally won .
blair also courted showbusiness personalities - attempting to align labour with a new wave of british pop stars and artists emerging in the mid 1990s , dubbed by the style press " cool britannia " .
his speeches at the time bordered on the messianic , tapping into what he saw as a pre-millennial mood of optimism .
sleaze promise his specific policies were modest in scope , but his rhetoric was dizzying : he promised nothing less than a country reborn , sweeping away the " sleaze " and drift of the major years .
and he deployed all of his charm and charisma on tv chat shows , showing himself to be a natural in front of the cameras , in contrast to the more stilted major .
it worked .
blair swept to a landslide victory in 1997 , becoming , at 43 , the youngest prime minister in nearly 200 years .
blair 's family man image was a key part of his appeal always nervous on polling day , he was still gloomily contemplating a possible coalition with the liberal democrats , even as the scale of his victory was becoming obvious .
two hours after polls closed - with the early results indicating a landslide - he ordered supporters in the royal festival hall to stop celebrating for fear of appearing complacent or " triumphalist " .
he need not have feared .
blair entered downing street on a wave of optimism and good will , on 2 may 1997 .
he promised to restore trust in politics and breathe new life into britain 's tired institutions .
in the early weeks of his premiership , he held a series of glittering receptions in downing street to celebrate his victory .
but behind the scenes , he was haunted by the splits and in-fighting he believed had destroyed previous labour administrations .
honeymoon period he continued to rule over his party with an iron will , battling to impose his own choice of candidates in the first london mayoral contest and devolved assembly elections and ensuring ministers remained " on message " at all times .
wary of the civil service 's ability to deliver his policy goals , he centralised power in downing street .
he preferred to make decisions with a small band of trusted advisors , rather than through more formal cabinet procedures , prompting accusations of " cronyism " and claims he was running a presidential style of government .
the public backlash against iraq prompted thoughts of quitting the media manipulation techniques that had served him so well in opposition were also beginning to earn his government a reputation for " spin " .
but blair 's personality - and his ability to connect with people through television - continued to be central to labour 's appeal .
within weeks of being elected , he delivered a halting , emotionally-charged eulogy to princess diana , on the morning of her death .
it was a performance which seemed to capture the public mood .
he would later insist that the phrase " the people 's princess " was his own and not alastair campbell 's invention , as cynics claimed .
euro decision then , when he was engulfed by his first party funding scandal , accused of offering favours in return for a £ 1m donation from formula one boss bernie ecclestone , he again took to the airwaves , pleading with the public to keep their faith in him .
" i think most people who have dealt with me , think i 'm a pretty straight sort of guy and i am , " he told the bbc 's john humphrys .
blair 's honeymoon period with the electorate felt like it would go on forever and his popularity received a further boost in 2000 , when cherie announced that , at the age of 45 , she was to become a mother again .
leo blair became the first legitimate child to be born to a serving prime minister in 150 years .
blair holidays 1997 : tuscany , guest of geoffrey robinson , labour mp and businessman 1998 : tuscany , prince girolamo strozzi , law professor and family friend 1999 : tuscany , vannino chiti , tuscan president 2001 : ariege , southern france , sir martin keene , high court judge and family friend 2003 - 06 : barbados , sir cliff richard , singer 2004 : sardinia , silvio berlusconi , italian premier and media mogul 2006 : barbados , sir anthony bamford , jcb boss and tory donor 2007 : miami , robin gibb , bee gees member blair swept to another landslide election victory in 2001 , pledging to deliver improvements to health and education he had been promising since 1997 .
the timidity and reliance on focus groups that had characterised much of his first term began to be replaced by more sure-footed and decisive leadership .
he had already angered the left by talking about the " scars on his back " from his early , tentative attempts to make the public services more efficient .
now he was determined to be more bold in his approach , reasoning that the unions could hardly complain about market reforms with record amounts of cash pouring into schools and hospitals .
the only cloud on blair 's horizon was his worsening relationship with gordon brown , which , observers said , alternated between table-thumping rows and sullen periods of silence .
fresh mandate emboldened by his fresh mandate , he appointed blairites to key positions across government , from david blunkett at the home office to estelle morris at education , in an attempt to wrest control of the domestic agenda from the treasury .
but it was brown , who was said to be increasingly obsessed with becoming prime minister , that held all the aces when it came to the one thing blair really wanted .
he had long planned to take britain into the euro , believing it would define his legacy and finally place britain at the " heart of europe " after years on the margins under the conservatives .
but brown was less convinced of the case for joining the euro and , crucially , he had seized control of the entry process , devising five " economic tests " that had to be passed before britain ditched the pound .
a referendum was promised for 2003 , but by then the economic argument for the euro had been lost .
the five tests had not been passed , brown decreed , and the single currency was kicked into the long grass , along with blair 's dreams of a european legacy .
iraq but by then blair had found another , larger mission - one that really would write his name into the history books , for better or worse .
blair had always taken a single-minded approach to foreign policy .
he appeared to enjoy the company of the no-nonsense men of action he found in the military .
they made a refreshing change from the naturally cautious civil servants that surrounded him in downing street - or the left-wing mps and union leaders who it seemed to him were forever trying to stand in the way of progress .
early successes in sierra leone and kosovo convinced blair of the value of military action in pursuit of humanitarian aims .
the blairs ' marriage has remained solid throughout colleagues said his christian faith gave him a clearer sense of moral purpose than many of those around him - but it was not a subject he was ever comfortable talking about in public .
he had forged a close relationship with us president bill clinton during his first term in office , with whom he shared a centre-left political philosophy .
but to the surprise and dismay of many in his own party , including his loyal deputy john prescott , he formed an even closer bond with clinton 's successor , the republican george w bush .
the 11 september attacks moved the relationship on to a different level .
failure blair toured the world , shoring up support for the bush administration , utterly convinced of his own powers of persuasion and advocacy ; instinctively believing britain 's place was at america 's side in her hour of need .
but it was the 2003 decision to invade iraq - without a un mandate and in the teeth of bitter opposition at home and abroad - that would link the two leaders together in the public mind for ever .
blair had drawn on every last ounce of his persuasive skill to make the case for war to mps and the wider public .
blair and brown buried the hatchet for the 2005 election campaign but the subsequent failure to find weapons of mass destruction in iraq appeared to confirm many people 's worst suspicions about him - that he relied too much on spin and was not to be trusted .
in the public backlash that followed he briefly considered quitting .
he was persuaded to carry on by cabinet supporters but in october 2004 he surprised everyone by announcing he would not seek a fourth term in office if he won the next election .
the announcement had been designed to end speculation about his health - he had undergone an operation to correct an irregular heart beat .
' lame duck ' but it only succeeded in sparking more damaging speculation about his departure date , leading opponents to brand him a " lame duck " premier .
for the 2005 general election campaign , alastair campbell devised what came to be known as the " masochism strategy " , with blair allowing voters to vent their anger about iraq at him in a series of tv debates .
he became the first labour leader to win three consecutive terms in office but any elation was short-lived .
his share of the popular vote was the lowest on record for any prime minister .
his self-belief and powers of persuasion remained undimmed .
over one remarkable 24 hour period , he flew to singapore to help london land the 2012 olympics - punching the air with glee as he did so - before flying back to gleneagles , in scotland , to unveil a debt relief package for africa .
they were the two of the biggest achievements of his premiership .
blair 's final conference speech was an emotional occasion but they were instantly overshadowed by the 7 july attack on the london transport system - the first suicide attacks mainland britain had ever witnessed .
his opinion poll ratings improved in the immediate aftermath of 7 july , as he once again proved his ability to capture the nation 's mood in a time of crisis .
but when a bombers ' taped testimony was released blaming the attack on blair 's foreign policy , it threw the spotlight back on to iraq and his refusal to apologise for what his opponents saw as a terrible miscalculation .
blair was convinced britain was engaged , with america , in a global " war on terror " but he was having trouble bringing many in his party with him .
final straw when he failed to condemn israel 's bombing of lebanon , once again standing four square with george bush in the face of mounting criticism around the world , it was the final straw for many normally loyal labour mps .
a series of resignations by junior ministers , who believed his failure to name a departure date was damaging the party , underlined his weakened position and he was forced to announce he would be gone by september 2007 .
it was not , he confessed , the way he had wanted it to end .
tony blair has been sedgefield 's mp for nearly 25 years in his own mind , and that of his supporters , he was a prime minister at the peak of his powers .
his extraordinary farewell speech at the 2006 party conference in manchester reminded even his harshest labour party critics what they would be losing when he was gone .
the charisma that had served him so well over the years was still intact .
the difference was that he no longer agonised over his own popularity .
it was enough for him to know that he had " done the right thing " .
his final months in office were dogged by a police investigation into allegations he had nominated party donors for peerages .
he became the first serving prime minister to be interviewed as part of a police investigation , although downing street was keen to stress he was being treated as a witness .
the affair had its origins before the 2005 general election when blair - concerned by the size of the tories ' war chest - sought massive loans from a series of wealthy individuals , which he kept secret from all but a few members of his inner circle .
even labour 's treasurer was kept in the dark .
i am not going to beg for my character in front of anyone .
people can make up their own mind about me tony blair four of the lenders were subsequently nominated for peerages , but were rejected by the independent appointments ' commission , sparking opposition claims they had been " sold " honours .
blair was accused of flouting his own rules on party funding , introduced as part of his drive to " clean up " politics .
parliamentary standards commissioner sir alastair graham accused him of destroying trust in politics , saying the issue would be associated with his time in office in the way " sleaze " was with john major .
but rather than pleading to be trusted , as he had in 1997 during the bernie ecclestone affair , blair simply refused to talk about the allegations .
" i am not going to beg for my character in front of anyone .
people can make up their own mind about me , " he told the bbc in february .
conviction politician he said he had " a deep respect for the british people and it 's been an honour and privilege to lead them " .
but he said he had " changed " over the past 10 years .
he was a " different sort of person " now , who was less concerned about being " liked " .
blair had been hardened by a decade in office .
he had become a conviction politician - a very different character to the one that had first walked into downing street in 1997 , guitar case in hand .

at school he drove his teachers to distraction , constantly questioning their authority .
at university , he acted out his rock star fantasies as the lead singer of a band .
few at that stage would have predicted a career in the sober world of politics , even though blair 's charisma and ability to charm people were evident from an early age .
blair was known as a cheeky , argumentative schoolboy the story of his rise to power is certainly not a rags to riches tale - he was born with every advantage in life - but it is no less remarkable for that .
it is the story of how a middle class , privately-educated barrister - the son of a would-be tory mp - went on to become the most successful leader in the history of the labour party , profoundly changing it and the country in the process .
and how a man once seen as a lightweight - preoccupied with his own image and popularity - became one of the most powerful and controversial figures on the world stage .
tory leanings anthony charles lynton blair was born in 1953 in edinburgh , the second son of hazel and leo blair .
the student tony blair had a rebellious streak he spent the first few years of his life in adelaide , australia , where leo lectured in law at the city 's university .
they returned to the uk in late 1950s and blair spent the remainder of his childhood in durham , where he was a day pupil at the fee-paying choristers school .
leo was chairman of the local conservative association but had to abandon his ambition to become a tory mp when he suffered a stroke .
his political leanings appeared to have rubbed off on the young tony , who stood in a mock school election as the conservative candidate .
' maddening ' blair 's teachers at exclusive edinburgh boarding school fettes recall a cheeky , rebellious figure ; a talented actor who loved being the centre of attention and who cultivated a " cool " image among his peers .
blair 's cv born : 6 may 1953 educated : choristers school , fettes , oxford family : married , four children 1976 : barrister specialising in trade union and employment law 1983 : labour mp for sedgefield , shadow city spokesman 1984 - 87 : shadow trade and industry minister 1987 - 88 : shadow energy secretary 1989 - 92 : shadow employment secretary 1992 - 94 : shadow home secretary 1994 - 97 : opposition leader 1997 - prime minister " tony was full of life .
maddening at times , full of himself and very argumentative , " blair 's housemaster eric anderson told blair 's biographer john rentoul .
" he was an expert at testing the rules to the limit , and i would n't swear that he stuck rigidly to the rules on not drinking , smoking or breaking bounds .
but he was a live wire and fun to have around . "
at the age of 17 he was given " six of the best " for persistently flouting the school rules .
then he was threatened with expulsion .
it was his girlfriend 's father , lord mackenzie stewart , an old fettesian and cross bench peer , who came to the rescue , striking a deal with the school that allowed blair to spend the final few weeks of the summer term living with him .
mackenzie stewart 's daughter , amanda , was the first girl to be admitted to fettes .
typically , it was the super-confident blair who beat the 440 other boys to win her heart .
rock music blair also met charlie falconer while at fettes .
the man who would later become his lord chancellor was a pupil at the rival edinburgh academy .
blair left fettes with three a levels and a place at st john 's college , oxford , to study law .
the young barrister impressed michael foot with his enthusiasm like many teenage boys in the late 1960s he was besotted by rock music .
he idolised mick jagger but he also dreamed of wielding power behind the scenes , as a manager or promoter .
before taking up his place at oxford , he headed for london , where he spent a carefree year " managing " student rock bands and putting on gigs and discos with his friend alan collenette .
to make ends meet , the pair stacked shelves at barkers food hall , in kensington .
at oxford he briefly fronted a rock band , ugly rumours .
friends recall his charismatic stage presence , but also his professional attitude .
trainee barrister " he even wanted to rehearse , " said band mate mark ellen .
but blair was also developing a more thoughtful side .
he began to talk about left wing politics and , unusually for the times , became increasingly serious about his christian faith , taking confirmation classes .
he lost his mother to cancer while he was at oxford , which also appears to have profoundly affected his outlook .
in his first year at the university , he befriended an australian priest , peter thompson , with whom he would debate social issues and theology late into the night .
blair later credited thompson with awakening in him an interest in christian socialism , and a desire for social change .
how tony blair has aged during 10 years in office enlarge image blair was also unusual , in the pot-smoking student milieu of the early 1970s , in that he appears to have avoided drugs .
there are also few reports of him being incapacitated by drink .
his only real vice was smoking cigarettes , a habit wife cherie later made him quit .
he smoked his last one 15 minutes before their wedding .
blair left oxford with a second class degree and in 1976 became a trainee barrister in the chambers of derry irvine , who would later become his first lord chancellor .
it was here that he met cherie booth , a fellow pupil in irvine 's chambers .
she had a first class degree and was seen as being more of a high flyer than blair .
activist friends recall a christmas party , during a game which involved passing a balloon between their knees , when it became obvious they would be more than just colleagues .
blair properties 1980 : mapledene road , hackney , bought £ 40,000 , sold 1986 £ 80,000 1983 : myrobella , trimdon village , nr sedgefield , bought £ 30,000 1986 : stavordale road , islington , bought £ 120,000 , sold 1993 £ 200,000 1993 : richmond crescent , islington , bought £ 375,000 , sold 1997 £ 615,000 1997:11 downing street - rent free flat next door to prime minister 's traditional residence 2002 : clifton , bristol , two flats bought for £ 525,000 in total 2004 : connaught square , bayswater , bought £ 3.6m 2007 : bayswater .

blairs plan to join buildings together to create extra space " the next day we went out to lunch and hours later we were still there , " blair later recalled .
" i found her immensely physically attractive and i wanted her as a friend as well . "
the couple married in 1980 , setting up home in hackney , east london , in a £ 40,000 end-of-terrace house , and threw themselves into local labour party politics .
blair had joined the party shortly after leaving oxford , but it was only now that he became more involved as an activist , encouraged by neighbour - and future home secretary - charles clarke , who shared his centre-left outlook .
in 1981 , through his father-in-law , the actor and left wing campaigner tony booth , blair contacted labour mp tom pendry to ask for help in becoming an mp .
pendry gave him a tour of the commons and advised him to stand for selection as a candidate in a forthcoming by-election in beaconsfield .
blair never stood a chance in such a safe conservative seat but he managed to attract the attention of labour leader michael foot , who was impressed by his enthusiasm and told him he had a " big future in politics " .
manifesto concerns nevertheless , it looked as if he would miss out on a chance to contest the 1983 general election .
it was only at the very last minute that he found a vacant seat , in the newly-created constituency of sedgefield , near where he grew up in county durham , securing the nomination ahead of several sitting mps and his future chief whip hilary armstrong , the daughter of a local labour mp .
the 1983 labour manifesto was one of the most left wing ever to be put before the british electorate .
it included commitments to nationalisation of industry and unilateral nuclear disarmament .
presentation was crucial to the new labour project blair made it clear privately to john burton , his election agent and mentor , that he did not agree with key parts of it , particularly proposals to withdraw britain from the eu .
his victory , in a rock solid labour area , was assured , although labour had a bad night nationally .
the early 1980s was a grim era of factory closures and job losses in the north east of england , with unemployment in the former mining villages that made up most of blair 's constituency soaring above 20 % .
within weeks of entering parliament , blair , who at 30 was the youngest labour mp , led a delegation of pit men and their families to london , where he joined forces with national union of mineworkers -lrb- num -rrb- leader arthur scargill to petition the national coal board over the planned closure of a coke works .
middle class appeal the young " london barrister , " as local newspapers described him , fought for his constituents ' jobs in traditional heavy industries but he also made no effort to hide his belief that the labour party had to modernise - and broaden its appeal to middle class voters - or die .
in an article for the northern echo , he argued " to win power for the low-paid , unemployed and the north , we must also appeal to the 60 % of the population in private housing , to the employed on the average wage and to the south " .

at one party meeting , he was shocked to find himself being denounced as a " traitor to socialism " by labour mp dennis skinner , after he made a speech urging reform .
" it was a very early lesson in politics because i said exactly what i thought .
i said we were living in a new age but we were talking like everybody had just got black and white tvs , " he later recalled in an interview with the northern echo .
cherie had also contested the 1983 general election , but after losing the no-hope seat of thanet in kent , she threw herself into her legal career , going on to become one of the country 's leading human rights lawyers .
by the end of blair 's first year in parliament , she had also given birth to the first of the couple 's four children , euan .
that first year also saw blair gain a crucial ally in his mission to modernise the labour party .
new agenda colleagues recall him being initially somewhat in awe of gordon brown , the young scottish mp he shared an office with in parliament .
blair 's favourite food bananas , beck 's lager and pistachio nuts - maid who served blair at labour conference fresh fettucini garnished with an exotic sauce of olive oil , sun-dried tomatoes and capers - nspcc islington cook book fish and chips - sedgefield labour party election leaflet unlike him , brown had been steeped in labour politics from a very early age and already had a knack for making headlines .
but together with peter mandelson , then a senior aide to party leader neil kinnock , the pair set about laying the foundations for what would become new labour .
blair , brown and mandelson were determined to make labour electable again by ditching unpopular labour policies , such as unilateral disarmament , and forging a new agenda marrying free market economics with social justice .
but they also wanted to improve the way labour communicated with voters .
focus groups , previously distrusted by labour politicians - if they had even heard of such things at all - would became key tools in shaping the party 's message .
advertising executives and pollsters , previously treated with suspicion by left wing politicians , were drafted into the modernisers ' inner circle to advise on presentation .
leadership deal blair and brown were promoted rapidly through the shadow cabinet ranks , but when it came to who would stand as the " modernising " candidate when leader john smith died of a heart attack in 1994 , their supporters were split .
many assumed brown , as the older of the two , would take precedence .
blair 's favourite music the beatles the rolling stones led zeppelin free bruce springsteen u2 coldplay the foo fighters simply red but the shadow chancellor hesitated , eventually agreeing to give blair a clear run at the top job .
the deal was supposedly struck over dinner at granita , an islington restaurant , with blair reportedly pledging to hand over to brown after two terms - and to give him , as chancellor , unprecedented control over the domestic agenda .
but the precise terms of any deal remain hotly contested .
what appears to have been decisive is the decision of mandelson to switch his backing from brown to blair - believing the shadow home secretary to be the better communicator of the two .
it was a decision that caused a " rift " in new labour from the beginning , mandelson recently admitted , with the distrust and feuding between blair and brown , or more often their respective supporters , coming to dominate british politics .
soundbites the new labour leader was initially seen as something of a political lightweight .
he had easily defeated left wingers john prescott and margaret beckett to snatch the leadership - and he had set about reforming the party with single-minded determination - but he was dubbed " bambi " by the press and cartoonists depicted him as a slick , permanently grinning public relations man .
like many in the labour party , blair believed neil kinnock 's chances of becoming prime minister in 1992 had been destroyed by a hostile tabloid press .
british troops saw much action during the blair years he was determined not to let that happen to him and he hired tough talking former tabloid journalist alastair campbell to sharpen up its press operation .
the pair would obsess over every aspect of blair 's image , placing bets on which of their carefully crafted soundbites would make it on to the evening news bulletins .
campbell normally won .
blair also courted showbusiness personalities - attempting to align labour with a new wave of british pop stars and artists emerging in the mid 1990s , dubbed by the style press " cool britannia " .
his speeches at the time bordered on the messianic , tapping into what he saw as a pre-millennial mood of optimism .
sleaze promise his specific policies were modest in scope , but his rhetoric was dizzying : he promised nothing less than a country reborn , sweeping away the " sleaze " and drift of the major years .
and he deployed all of his charm and charisma on tv chat shows , showing himself to be a natural in front of the cameras , in contrast to the more stilted major .
it worked .
blair swept to a landslide victory in 1997 , becoming , at 43 , the youngest prime minister in nearly 200 years .
blair 's family man image was a key part of his appeal always nervous on polling day , he was still gloomily contemplating a possible coalition with the liberal democrats , even as the scale of his victory was becoming obvious .
two hours after polls closed - with the early results indicating a landslide - he ordered supporters in the royal festival hall to stop celebrating for fear of appearing complacent or " triumphalist " .
he need not have feared .
blair entered downing street on a wave of optimism and good will , on 2 may 1997 .
he promised to restore trust in politics and breathe new life into britain 's tired institutions .
in the early weeks of his premiership , he held a series of glittering receptions in downing street to celebrate his victory .
but behind the scenes , he was haunted by the splits and in-fighting he believed had destroyed previous labour administrations .
honeymoon period he continued to rule over his party with an iron will , battling to impose his own choice of candidates in the first london mayoral contest and devolved assembly elections and ensuring ministers remained " on message " at all times .
wary of the civil service 's ability to deliver his policy goals , he centralised power in downing street .
he preferred to make decisions with a small band of trusted advisors , rather than through more formal cabinet procedures , prompting accusations of " cronyism " and claims he was running a presidential style of government .
the public backlash against iraq prompted thoughts of quitting the media manipulation techniques that had served him so well in opposition were also beginning to earn his government a reputation for " spin " .
but blair 's personality - and his ability to connect with people through television - continued to be central to labour 's appeal .
within weeks of being elected , he delivered a halting , emotionally-charged eulogy to princess diana , on the morning of her death .
it was a performance which seemed to capture the public mood .
he would later insist that the phrase " the people 's princess " was his own and not alastair campbell 's invention , as cynics claimed .
euro decision then , when he was engulfed by his first party funding scandal , accused of offering favours in return for a £ 1m donation from formula one boss bernie ecclestone , he again took to the airwaves , pleading with the public to keep their faith in him .
" i think most people who have dealt with me , think i 'm a pretty straight sort of guy and i am , " he told the bbc 's john humphrys .
blair 's honeymoon period with the electorate felt like it would go on forever and his popularity received a further boost in 2000 , when cherie announced that , at the age of 45 , she was to become a mother again .
leo blair became the first legitimate child to be born to a serving prime minister in 150 years .
blair holidays 1997 : tuscany , guest of geoffrey robinson , labour mp and businessman 1998 : tuscany , prince girolamo strozzi , law professor and family friend 1999 : tuscany , vannino chiti , tuscan president 2001 : ariege , southern france , sir martin keene , high court judge and family friend 2003 - 06 : barbados , sir cliff richard , singer 2004 : sardinia , silvio berlusconi , italian premier and media mogul 2006 : barbados , sir anthony bamford , jcb boss and tory donor 2007 : miami , robin gibb , bee gees member blair swept to another landslide election victory in 2001 , pledging to deliver improvements to health and education he had been promising since 1997 .
the timidity and reliance on focus groups that had characterised much of his first term began to be replaced by more sure-footed and decisive leadership .
he had already angered the left by talking about the " scars on his back " from his early , tentative attempts to make the public services more efficient .
now he was determined to be more bold in his approach , reasoning that the unions could hardly complain about market reforms with record amounts of cash pouring into schools and hospitals .
the only cloud on blair 's horizon was his worsening relationship with gordon brown , which , observers said , alternated between table-thumping rows and sullen periods of silence .
fresh mandate emboldened by his fresh mandate , he appointed blairites to key positions across government , from david blunkett at the home office to estelle morris at education , in an attempt to wrest control of the domestic agenda from the treasury .
but it was brown , who was said to be increasingly obsessed with becoming prime minister , that held all the aces when it came to the one thing blair really wanted .
he had long planned to take britain into the euro , believing it would define his legacy and finally place britain at the " heart of europe " after years on the margins under the conservatives .
but brown was less convinced of the case for joining the euro and , crucially , he had seized control of the entry process , devising five " economic tests " that had to be passed before britain ditched the pound .
a referendum was promised for 2003 , but by then the economic argument for the euro had been lost .
the five tests had not been passed , brown decreed , and the single currency was kicked into the long grass , along with blair 's dreams of a european legacy .
iraq but by then blair had found another , larger mission - one that really would write his name into the history books , for better or worse .
blair had always taken a single-minded approach to foreign policy .
he appeared to enjoy the company of the no-nonsense men of action he found in the military .
they made a refreshing change from the naturally cautious civil servants that surrounded him in downing street - or the left-wing mps and union leaders who it seemed to him were forever trying to stand in the way of progress .
early successes in sierra leone and kosovo convinced blair of the value of military action in pursuit of humanitarian aims .
the blairs ' marriage has remained solid throughout colleagues said his christian faith gave him a clearer sense of moral purpose than many of those around him - but it was not a subject he was ever comfortable talking about in public .
he had forged a close relationship with us president bill clinton during his first term in office , with whom he shared a centre-left political philosophy .
but to the surprise and dismay of many in his own party , including his loyal deputy john prescott , he formed an even closer bond with clinton 's successor , the republican george w bush .
the 11 september attacks moved the relationship on to a different level .
failure blair toured the world , shoring up support for the bush administration , utterly convinced of his own powers of persuasion and advocacy ; instinctively believing britain 's place was at america 's side in her hour of need .
but it was the 2003 decision to invade iraq - without a un mandate and in the teeth of bitter opposition at home and abroad - that would link the two leaders together in the public mind for ever .
blair had drawn on every last ounce of his persuasive skill to make the case for war to mps and the wider public .
blair and brown buried the hatchet for the 2005 election campaign but the subsequent failure to find weapons of mass destruction in iraq appeared to confirm many people 's worst suspicions about him - that he relied too much on spin and was not to be trusted .
in the public backlash that followed he briefly considered quitting .
he was persuaded to carry on by cabinet supporters but in october 2004 he surprised everyone by announcing he would not seek a fourth term in office if he won the next election .
the announcement had been designed to end speculation about his health - he had undergone an operation to correct an irregular heart beat .
' lame duck ' but it only succeeded in sparking more damaging speculation about his departure date , leading opponents to brand him a " lame duck " premier .
for the 2005 general election campaign , alastair campbell devised what came to be known as the " masochism strategy " , with blair allowing voters to vent their anger about iraq at him in a series of tv debates .
he became the first labour leader to win three consecutive terms in office but any elation was short-lived .
his share of the popular vote was the lowest on record for any prime minister .
his self-belief and powers of persuasion remained undimmed .
over one remarkable 24 hour period , he flew to singapore to help london land the 2012 olympics - punching the air with glee as he did so - before flying back to gleneagles , in scotland , to unveil a debt relief package for africa .
they were the two of the biggest achievements of his premiership .
blair 's final conference speech was an emotional occasion but they were instantly overshadowed by the 7 july attack on the london transport system - the first suicide attacks mainland britain had ever witnessed .
his opinion poll ratings improved in the immediate aftermath of 7 july , as he once again proved his ability to capture the nation 's mood in a time of crisis .
but when a bombers ' taped testimony was released blaming the attack on blair 's foreign policy , it threw the spotlight back on to iraq and his refusal to apologise for what his opponents saw as a terrible miscalculation .
blair was convinced britain was engaged , with america , in a global " war on terror " but he was having trouble bringing many in his party with him .
final straw when he failed to condemn israel 's bombing of lebanon , once again standing four square with george bush in the face of mounting criticism around the world , it was the final straw for many normally loyal labour mps .
a series of resignations by junior ministers , who believed his failure to name a departure date was damaging the party , underlined his weakened position and he was forced to announce he would be gone by september 2007 .
it was not , he confessed , the way he had wanted it to end .
tony blair has been sedgefield 's mp for nearly 25 years in his own mind , and that of his supporters , he was a prime minister at the peak of his powers .
his extraordinary farewell speech at the 2006 party conference in manchester reminded even his harshest labour party critics what they would be losing when he was gone .
the charisma that had served him so well over the years was still intact .
the difference was that he no longer agonised over his own popularity .
it was enough for him to know that he had " done the right thing " .
his final months in office were dogged by a police investigation into allegations he had nominated party donors for peerages .
he became the first serving prime minister to be interviewed as part of a police investigation , although downing street was keen to stress he was being treated as a witness .
the affair had its origins before the 2005 general election when blair - concerned by the size of the tories ' war chest - sought massive loans from a series of wealthy individuals , which he kept secret from all but a few members of his inner circle .
even labour 's treasurer was kept in the dark .
i am not going to beg for my character in front of anyone .
people can make up their own mind about me tony blair four of the lenders were subsequently nominated for peerages , but were rejected by the independent appointments ' commission , sparking opposition claims they had been " sold " honours .
blair was accused of flouting his own rules on party funding , introduced as part of his drive to " clean up " politics .
parliamentary standards commissioner sir alastair graham accused him of destroying trust in politics , saying the issue would be associated with his time in office in the way " sleaze " was with john major .
but rather than pleading to be trusted , as he had in 1997 during the bernie ecclestone affair , blair simply refused to talk about the allegations .
" i am not going to beg for my character in front of anyone .
people can make up their own mind about me , " he told the bbc in february .
conviction politician he said he had " a deep respect for the british people and it 's been an honour and privilege to lead them " .
but he said he had " changed " over the past 10 years .
he was a " different sort of person " now , who was less concerned about being " liked " .
blair had been hardened by a decade in office .
he had become a conviction politician - a very different character to the one that had first walked into downing street in 1997 , guitar case in hand .

the mobile machines create maps of areas they have already explored and then use this information to predict what unknown environments will be like .
trials in office buildings showed that the robots were able to find their way around , new scientist reported .
making robots that can navigate without prior knowledge of their surroundings was a huge challenge , the team said .
it works well in indoor environments professor george lee most mobile robots do this using a technique called slam -lrb- simultaneous localisation and mapping -rrb- , whereby they build up a map of their unknown environment , using various sensors , whilst keeping track of their current position at the same time .
but this technique is slow because a robot must explore a great deal of terrain to know its precise location .
it is also prone to errors .
so the team from purdue university , in indiana , has developed a new approach .
the robots create a 2d map of the area they are exploring , but when they come to an unknown area , they check back through this information to see if it seems similar to any areas that have already explored .
they do this using an algorithm - a step-by-step problem solving procedure .
professor george lee who carried out the research , said : " the robot gets to a new area and thinks : ' have i seen these sorts of things before ? '
then it goes back and looks at its stored data .
" it might then think : ' hey , this is very , very similar to something i 've seen before , i do n't need to explore that room or corner . '
and this saves time for it to explore other areas . "
he said it was similar to the human navigational process , where we build up a " mental map " of our surroundings by recognising familiar sights .
some limitations the scientists first tested the algorithm using virtual mazes and offices .

how will history judge tony blair 's premiership ?
time will tell , but here are three instant expert views : ten years of presidential-style government have eroded the authority of the house of commons ian kershaw the burning out of al qaeda and the taleban from the most important areas of afghanistan is another of his achievements andrew roberts his election victories alone guarantee that he will be remembered as labour 's most accomplished electoral leader anthony seldon ian kershaw , professor of modern history , sheffield university measured against the peace-time record of british prime ministers since the end of the first world war , few of whom achieved much , mr blair 's premiership compares favourably .
ian kershaw said there were unrealistic expectations in 1997 measured against the shambolic record of the last conservative government , under mr major , it compares even better .
but measured against the expectations of 1997 -lrb- for the moment leaving iraq out of the equation -rrb- , and judged by perceptions of the present state of british society , the 10 years of mr blair will surely go down in history as a lost opportunity , a time when much was promised but relatively little attained .
of course , blair transformed the labour party and presided over three consecutive general election victories , a feat which had eluded every previous labour leader .
but to what purpose ?
undeniably , a decade of sustained prosperity and economic stability , unparalleled in recent times , has been a remarkable achievement , even if gordon brown was the main architect of the economic success .
on constitutional matters , devolution in scotland and wales has been successful , at least in the short term , though probably it has only fended off rather than excluded a more damaging nationalist challenge -lrb- at least in scotland -rrb- to the united kingdom 's integrity .
the expectations of 1997 were quite unrealistic and in northern ireland , though he did not begin the process , blair 's negotiation of the good friday agreement was the real start of major change for the better .
but in the workings of british government , the blair era has not been beneficial .
the use of " spin doctors " and unelected advisers has been harmful to democracy .
ten years of presidential-style government have eroded the authority of the house of commons .
and effective reform of the house of lords is still a distant dream .
the expectations of 1997 were quite unrealistic .
in the euphoria of finally getting rid of a clapped-out , shoddy conservative government long past its sell-by date , quite illusory hopes were invested in the new labour regime .
deep-seated problems blair 's own propaganda inflated these hopes by hyped-up claims that his premiership marked the start of a new era .
disillusionment was inevitable .
in reality , the deep-seated structural problems of the health system , education , transport , crime , juvenile disorder , urban decay , and inner-city deprivation were never going to be overcome , whatever the colour of the government , within a decade or so .
even so , there is remarkably little substantial improvement to show for 10 years of labour government , particularly in the position of the less well-off in society .
yet what is labour for , if not above all to serve their interests .
could iraq be mr blair 's suez ?
the introduction of a minimum wage , set at a modest level , was admittedly a step in the right direction .
the government also uses statistics ad nauseam to demonstrate major improvements in health , education , crime reduction , and so on .
but few people are persuaded .
to those at the sharp end , the improvements are often scarcely visible .
overall , the feeling is that taxes have gone up while public services have deteriorated .
for many living in the most deprived inner-city areas , there is little sense that the insecurity produced by crime , disorder , vandalism and anti-social behaviour has been much reduced .
in schools and hospitals marginal improvements at best can be seen , and many professionals complain that things are even worse than when labour took power .
despite the money poured in , the health service is still in poor shape .
in schools , new buildings can provide better conditions .
but the stress levels for teachers are enormous .
students now face high fees and indebtedness , though few of their lecturers would acknowledge a significant positive transformation in universities .
doctors , nurses , teachers , policemen and others suffer , too , more than ever from the oppressive bureaucracy of an unconstrained control culture .
disappearing idealism meanwhile , transport remains a mess , with no integrated planning or joined-up thinking in view .
heads here have been firmly stuck in the sand while the problems mount .
the litany could continue .
the biggest indictment overall is that , after ten years of a labour government , people have little or no sense of greater social fairness .
the idealism built into labour 's social vision has all but disappeared .
no wonder there is widespread apathy about party politics , which are as riddled with sleaze as ever they were under the tories .
labour now seems to stand for little more than the claim that it can manage the problems of british society a bit better , and a bit more humanely , than can the conservatives .
and even that claim is open to question .
however blair 's domestic achievements are judged , his place in history will be primarily shaped by the iraq war .
iraq will forever stand out in bold red in the debit column of his time in office .
it was an avoidable disaster .
and it was a disaster bearing blair 's personal hallmark .
one word can epitomise a premiership for posterity .
for anthony eden it was " suez " .
for blair , it will be " iraq " .
return to top andrew roberts , historian and biographer before 11 september 2001 , tony blair was set to go down in history as a second-division prime minister , one of those who stayed in power for a long time but without having any appreciable effect on the story of his times .
mr roberts said blair was a good war leader he followed the opinions of focus groups and opinion polls , carefully judging every option with the sole criterion of getting new labour re-elected .
if anything , he was something of a mild wrecker : over devolution , the house of lords , hunting , and the lord chancellorship , he seemed happy to rip up ancient british arrangements without giving much thought as to what would be likely to replace them .
then came 9/11 .
suddenly , everything changed .
' shoulder to shoulder ' no fewer than 67 britons died on that day , and blair showed a side of his personality that had been impossible to discern before : churchillian leadership .
with his announcement that britain would stand " shoulder to shoulder " with the united states , and backing that up with sending large numbers of british troops to both afghanistan and iraq , he carved a place for himself in the first rank of british premiers since 1900 .
was blair , like churchill , in the first rank of prime ministers ?
blair was watching television in brighton when the third plane hit the pentagon at 2.43pm -lrb- british time -rrb- , and then put in a short appearance at the trade union conference there .
visibly shaken , he told the delegates : " there have been the most terrible , shocking events in the united states of america in the last hours .
" i am afraid we can only imagine the terror and carnage there and the many , many innocent people who have lost their lives .
this mass terrorism is the new evil in our world today . "
later he recalled , in an interview on boston television : " sometimes things happen in politics , an event so cataclysmic that , in a curious way , all the doubt is removed .
" from the outset , i really felt very certain as to what had to be said and done . "
blair proved himself an exemplary war leader this was underlined soon afterwards in his powerful address to the labour party conference the next month , in which blair said of the american people : " we were with you at the first .
we will stay with you till the last . "
in this he was as good as his word .
blair had fought wars before , of course .
kosovo and sierra leone had seen british troops deployed by him , both successfully and with minimum casualties .
the post-9/11 invasions of afghanistan and iraq were to be of an altogether different - and larger - order , although the casualties were also amazingly light .
blair proved himself an exemplary war leader .
wmd danger under the sincere impression that saddam hussein of iraq possessed chemical and biological weapons of mass destruction -lrb- wmd -rrb- - a view shared by the intelligence services of every major country in the world , as well as by the united nations ' own weapons inspectors - he appreciated the importance of overthrowing the baathist regime as soon as the taleban regime was deposed in afghanistan .
the dangers of wmds possibly falling into the hands of anti-western terrorists groups could only be obviated by a full-scale us-led invasion by the coalition of the willing , and none proved more willing than blair .
-lrb- the fact that it later transpired that saddam had most probably destroyed his wmd was entirely immaterial ; blair believed saddam had had them at the time , not least because he had used them extensively on his own people in the late 1980s . -rrb-
prime ministers ... are judged by the one big thing that happens during their premierships .
in britain a vicious and disgraceful campaign began , attempting , on the flimsiest of evidence taken wildly out of context , to accuse blair of deliberately lying in order to take the country to war .
its smears and slurs will not stand the test of historical analysis .
the defeat of the enormous iraqi army in only three weeks in march 2003 ; the establishment of democracy in iraq , with a 70 % turnout in nationwide elections on 15 december 2005 ; the stalwart defence of iraq against an unexpectedly long and violent terrorist insurgency ; the loss of only tiny numbers of british troops by any historical or operational standards : all will be credited to tony blair by posterity .
similarly the burning out of al qaeda and the taleban from the most important areas of afghanistan is another of his fine achievements .
prime ministers are not judged by posterity on issues to do with transport , health , education , or even - most of them - on economic indicators .
they are judged by the one big thing that happens during their premierships .
that is why neville chamberlain 's munich agreement , anthony eden 's suez crisis , edward heath 's three-day week , and john major 's erm debacle have left them branded as failures .
equally , winston churchill 's blitz orations , margaret thatcher 's saving of british capitalism and tony blair 's vigorous prosecution of the war against terror will leave them noted by history as highly successful prime ministers .
return to top anthony seldon , tony blair 's biographer the verdict of history on all prime ministers as they leave office is hotly disputed , but few in modern british history have been subject to so much departing hostility as tony blair .
anthony seldon said mr blair had high ambitions for public services parts of the british media give the impression of a man who had no clear idea why he wanted to be the prime minister , who led the country into a senseless war in iraq , and lied in doing so , who has kow-towed to not one but two american presidents , and whose record domestically has been full of lies , spin , empty rhetoric and unfulfilled promises .
yet tony blair 's successive election victories alone guarantee that he will be remembered as labour 's most accomplished electoral leader .
having succeeded john smith as labour party leader in 1994 , he spent three years preparing his party to be fit for office , and stripping it of " old labour " policies on defence , trade unions and the economy .
the party came to power in may 1997 on the crest of a wave of popular emotion which swept away john major 's discredited and exhausted tories .
the party won a second landslide in 2001 , and , in 2005 a third victory , albeit on a much reduced majority .
economic strength underpinning these victories was britain 's powerful economic performance .
tony blair was fortunate in this inheritance in 1997 , and in having such a capable chancellor in gordon brown , but good leaders to some extent create their own luck .
at home , blair had high ambitions for building world-class public services , transforming the constitution , reducing inequality and attacking lawlessness .
but in the beginning progress was painfully slow .
in his first term -lrb- 1997-2001 -rrb- , blair focused on reforming the constitution and introducing welfare reforms , which paved the way for reductions in pensioner and child poverty .
blair prepared his party for three years before coming to power but the former owed more to the legacy of his predecessor , john smith , while the latter was the achievement principally of gordon brown .
for blair personally , his first term was a learning experience , when mistakes were made and valuable time squandered .
only in the second and third terms did his personal ideas fructify into his " choice and diversity " agenda , extending margaret thatcher 's liberal reforms into the welfare state .
but by the time he began to introduce these policies , including top-up fees for universities , foundation hospitals and city academies , his political capital was waning and he had to push his agenda through in the face of opposition from his own party .
in his third term -lrb- 2005-2007 -rrb- , shorn of the need to win another general election , he extended his policies into new areas , including nuclear energy , welfare , pensions reform , road pricing and greater independence for schools and health .
fighting off the successive brown challenges were essential for a prime minister who , unlike mrs thatcher , was embedding his personal agenda so late .
northern ireland push the popular view is that blair 's first term was his most successful , and the second and third terms then became progressively worse .
in fact , the very opposite is the case .
to no area of british life did tony blair give more consistent attention as prime minister than the affairs of northern ireland .
from his earliest weeks in power he decided that completing the peace process would remain a priority and his hard work reaped dividends through the good friday agreement of 1998 .
signing the good friday peace agreement was a priority for blair he never lost sight of the need to give attention to the province and the fact that it has been largely peaceful during his 10 years owes much to his own efforts and determination .
in europe he was less successful .
he was passionate about building a qualitatively new relationship between britain and the european union .
but in his early months in power he was outflanked by gordon brown and the treasury over taking britain into the euro .
his best chance gone , he was unable thereafter to take britain into the single currency , or to take part in the new constitution , which foundered in 2005 .
european role many commentators thought both failures a blessing for britain .
blair did , however , play a pivotal role in extending the membership of the eu from 15 to 27 states , and toiled hard to ensure free-market rather than dirigiste and federalist values prevailed .
blair 's european policy was hampered by the hostility , often vitriolic , of jacques chirac and gerhard schroeder .
but blair 's own lack of long-term thinking on the eu , or full follow-through to his seminal speech to the european parliament in june 2005 , in which he proposed a bold new vision for the eu , also was responsible .
abroad , his " gladstonian " or " wilsonian " foreign policy inspired his major speech in chicago in april 1999 in which he articulated the doctrine of the " international community " .
blair still believes that it was right for britain to support the americans over iraq , to remove a brutal dictator who he considered a menace to his own people and threat to world peace .
this advocated humanitarian intervention in the affairs of countries under tyrannical regime under certain conditions .
blair used this approach to justify his intervention in the kosovo crisis in 1999 , when he urged a more aggressive military approach upon a reluctant american administration .
it also , in blair 's mind , provided much of the intellectual justification for the war against iraq in 2003 .
iraq remains the most controversial aspect of tony blair 's premiership .
blair still believes that it was right for britain to support the americans over iraq , to remove a brutal dictator who he considered a menace to his own people and threat to world peace .
serious mistakes yet even loyal blairites must now concede that serious mistakes were made : in the overselling of the intelligence , in the woefully inadequate planning for the postwar situation -lrb- with the us chiefly culpable -rrb- and in not doing more to rein in the excesses and inconsistencies of the bush administration .
tony blair has always believed that britain 's interests were best served by standing shoulder to shoulder with the american administration , despite the resulting unpopularity at home and in europe , and that any criticism of washington should be made in private rather than in public .
the iraq war sacrificed some of tony blair 's domestic authority , his time , and ultimately detracted from his efforts to bring peace in the arab israeli conflict , to do more to eliminate poverty in africa and to combat global warming .
all three were cherished causes to him .
again , starting work earlier in these areas would have allowed blair to achieve much more .
that fact notwithstanding , few doubt that britain 's standing in the world , and in europe , is higher in 2007 than in 1997 .
all prime ministers are limited by external forces : in tony blair 's case it was the erosion of support due to the iraq war , the unremitting hostility to much of his reform agenda from his chancellor , gordon brown , a lack of blairite ministers of quality to run the departments of state , or supporters in the party at large .
at his best , as in his response to the death of princess diana in 1997 , to 9/11 , or to the london bombings in july 2005 , he was able to find a language that chimed with the national mood that few prime ministers , or indeed us presidents , have matched .
but the obstacles he encountered , his lack of governing experience , and his lateness in discovering his personal agenda , meant his achievements were less than he hoped for , or promised .
prime ministers leave amid the noise of the immediate , in blair 's case the cash-for-honours scandal , anger over iraq , turbulence over his succession and rows over the future direction of policy .
but , as long as a transition is free of scandal , history judges premierships in a more dispassionate way .
no-one can know for sure what his successors will do - the key factor which forges historical judgments .
but it is very unlikely that blair 's successors will revert to old labour , or that david cameron will not build substantially on what blair has achieved in power since 1997 .
these will be the ultimate tests of his legacy .

how will history judge tony blair 's premiership ?
time will tell , but here are three instant expert views : ten years of presidential-style government have eroded the authority of the house of commons ian kershaw the burning out of al qaeda and the taleban from the most important areas of afghanistan is another of his achievements andrew roberts his election victories alone guarantee that he will be remembered as labour 's most accomplished electoral leader anthony seldon ian kershaw , professor of modern history , sheffield university measured against the peace-time record of british prime ministers since the end of the first world war , few of whom achieved much , mr blair 's premiership compares favourably .
ian kershaw said there were unrealistic expectations in 1997 measured against the shambolic record of the last conservative government , under mr major , it compares even better .
but measured against the expectations of 1997 -lrb- for the moment leaving iraq out of the equation -rrb- , and judged by perceptions of the present state of british society , the 10 years of mr blair will surely go down in history as a lost opportunity , a time when much was promised but relatively little attained .
of course , blair transformed the labour party and presided over three consecutive general election victories , a feat which had eluded every previous labour leader .
but to what purpose ?
undeniably , a decade of sustained prosperity and economic stability , unparalleled in recent times , has been a remarkable achievement , even if gordon brown was the main architect of the economic success .
on constitutional matters , devolution in scotland and wales has been successful , at least in the short term , though probably it has only fended off rather than excluded a more damaging nationalist challenge -lrb- at least in scotland -rrb- to the united kingdom 's integrity .
the expectations of 1997 were quite unrealistic and in northern ireland , though he did not begin the process , blair 's negotiation of the good friday agreement was the real start of major change for the better .
but in the workings of british government , the blair era has not been beneficial .
the use of " spin doctors " and unelected advisers has been harmful to democracy .
ten years of presidential-style government have eroded the authority of the house of commons .
and effective reform of the house of lords is still a distant dream .
the expectations of 1997 were quite unrealistic .
in the euphoria of finally getting rid of a clapped-out , shoddy conservative government long past its sell-by date , quite illusory hopes were invested in the new labour regime .
deep-seated problems blair 's own propaganda inflated these hopes by hyped-up claims that his premiership marked the start of a new era .
disillusionment was inevitable .
in reality , the deep-seated structural problems of the health system , education , transport , crime , juvenile disorder , urban decay , and inner-city deprivation were never going to be overcome , whatever the colour of the government , within a decade or so .
even so , there is remarkably little substantial improvement to show for 10 years of labour government , particularly in the position of the less well-off in society .
yet what is labour for , if not above all to serve their interests .
could iraq be mr blair 's suez ?
the introduction of a minimum wage , set at a modest level , was admittedly a step in the right direction .
the government also uses statistics ad nauseam to demonstrate major improvements in health , education , crime reduction , and so on .
but few people are persuaded .
to those at the sharp end , the improvements are often scarcely visible .
overall , the feeling is that taxes have gone up while public services have deteriorated .
for many living in the most deprived inner-city areas , there is little sense that the insecurity produced by crime , disorder , vandalism and anti-social behaviour has been much reduced .
in schools and hospitals marginal improvements at best can be seen , and many professionals complain that things are even worse than when labour took power .
despite the money poured in , the health service is still in poor shape .
in schools , new buildings can provide better conditions .
but the stress levels for teachers are enormous .
students now face high fees and indebtedness , though few of their lecturers would acknowledge a significant positive transformation in universities .
doctors , nurses , teachers , policemen and others suffer , too , more than ever from the oppressive bureaucracy of an unconstrained control culture .
disappearing idealism meanwhile , transport remains a mess , with no integrated planning or joined-up thinking in view .
heads here have been firmly stuck in the sand while the problems mount .
the litany could continue .
the biggest indictment overall is that , after ten years of a labour government , people have little or no sense of greater social fairness .
the idealism built into labour 's social vision has all but disappeared .
no wonder there is widespread apathy about party politics , which are as riddled with sleaze as ever they were under the tories .
labour now seems to stand for little more than the claim that it can manage the problems of british society a bit better , and a bit more humanely , than can the conservatives .
and even that claim is open to question .
however blair 's domestic achievements are judged , his place in history will be primarily shaped by the iraq war .
iraq will forever stand out in bold red in the debit column of his time in office .
it was an avoidable disaster .
and it was a disaster bearing blair 's personal hallmark .

for anthony eden it was " suez " .
for blair , it will be " iraq " .

no-one can know for sure what his successors will do - the key factor which forges historical judgments .
but it is very unlikely that blair 's successors will revert to old labour , or that david cameron will not build substantially on what blair has achieved in power since 1997 .
these will be the ultimate tests of his legacy .

how will history judge tony blair 's premiership ?
time will tell , but here are three instant expert views : ten years of presidential-style government have eroded the authority of the house of commons ian kershaw the burning out of al qaeda and the taleban from the most important areas of afghanistan is another of his achievements andrew roberts his election victories alone guarantee that he will be remembered as labour 's most accomplished electoral leader anthony seldon ian kershaw , professor of modern history , sheffield university measured against the peace-time record of british prime ministers since the end of the first world war , few of whom achieved much , mr blair 's premiership compares favourably .
ian kershaw said there were unrealistic expectations in 1997 measured against the shambolic record of the last conservative government , under mr major , it compares even better .
but measured against the expectations of 1997 -lrb- for the moment leaving iraq out of the equation -rrb- , and judged by perceptions of the present state of british society , the 10 years of mr blair will surely go down in history as a lost opportunity , a time when much was promised but relatively little attained .
of course , blair transformed the labour party and presided over three consecutive general election victories , a feat which had eluded every previous labour leader .
but to what purpose ?
undeniably , a decade of sustained prosperity and economic stability , unparalleled in recent times , has been a remarkable achievement , even if gordon brown was the main architect of the economic success .
on constitutional matters , devolution in scotland and wales has been successful , at least in the short term , though probably it has only fended off rather than excluded a more damaging nationalist challenge -lrb- at least in scotland -rrb- to the united kingdom 's integrity .
the expectations of 1997 were quite unrealistic and in northern ireland , though he did not begin the process , blair 's negotiation of the good friday agreement was the real start of major change for the better .
but in the workings of british government , the blair era has not been beneficial .
the use of " spin doctors " and unelected advisers has been harmful to democracy .
ten years of presidential-style government have eroded the authority of the house of commons .
and effective reform of the house of lords is still a distant dream .
the expectations of 1997 were quite unrealistic .
in the euphoria of finally getting rid of a clapped-out , shoddy conservative government long past its sell-by date , quite illusory hopes were invested in the new labour regime .
deep-seated problems blair 's own propaganda inflated these hopes by hyped-up claims that his premiership marked the start of a new era .
disillusionment was inevitable .
in reality , the deep-seated structural problems of the health system , education , transport , crime , juvenile disorder , urban decay , and inner-city deprivation were never going to be overcome , whatever the colour of the government , within a decade or so .
even so , there is remarkably little substantial improvement to show for 10 years of labour government , particularly in the position of the less well-off in society .
yet what is labour for , if not above all to serve their interests .
could iraq be mr blair 's suez ?
the introduction of a minimum wage , set at a modest level , was admittedly a step in the right direction .
the government also uses statistics ad nauseam to demonstrate major improvements in health , education , crime reduction , and so on .
but few people are persuaded .
to those at the sharp end , the improvements are often scarcely visible .
overall , the feeling is that taxes have gone up while public services have deteriorated .
for many living in the most deprived inner-city areas , there is little sense that the insecurity produced by crime , disorder , vandalism and anti-social behaviour has been much reduced .
in schools and hospitals marginal improvements at best can be seen , and many professionals complain that things are even worse than when labour took power .
despite the money poured in , the health service is still in poor shape .
in schools , new buildings can provide better conditions .
but the stress levels for teachers are enormous .
students now face high fees and indebtedness , though few of their lecturers would acknowledge a significant positive transformation in universities .
doctors , nurses , teachers , policemen and others suffer , too , more than ever from the oppressive bureaucracy of an unconstrained control culture .
disappearing idealism meanwhile , transport remains a mess , with no integrated planning or joined-up thinking in view .
heads here have been firmly stuck in the sand while the problems mount .
the litany could continue .
the biggest indictment overall is that , after ten years of a labour government , people have little or no sense of greater social fairness .
the idealism built into labour 's social vision has all but disappeared .
no wonder there is widespread apathy about party politics , which are as riddled with sleaze as ever they were under the tories .
labour now seems to stand for little more than the claim that it can manage the problems of british society a bit better , and a bit more humanely , than can the conservatives .
and even that claim is open to question .
however blair 's domestic achievements are judged , his place in history will be primarily shaped by the iraq war .
iraq will forever stand out in bold red in the debit column of his time in office .
it was an avoidable disaster .
and it was a disaster bearing blair 's personal hallmark .
one word can epitomise a premiership for posterity .
for anthony eden it was " suez " .
for blair , it will be " iraq " .
return to top andrew roberts , historian and biographer before 11 september 2001 , tony blair was set to go down in history as a second-division prime minister , one of those who stayed in power for a long time but without having any appreciable effect on the story of his times .
mr roberts said blair was a good war leader he followed the opinions of focus groups and opinion polls , carefully judging every option with the sole criterion of getting new labour re-elected .
if anything , he was something of a mild wrecker : over devolution , the house of lords , hunting , and the lord chancellorship , he seemed happy to rip up ancient british arrangements without giving much thought as to what would be likely to replace them .
then came 9/11 .
suddenly , everything changed .
' shoulder to shoulder ' no fewer than 67 britons died on that day , and blair showed a side of his personality that had been impossible to discern before : churchillian leadership .
with his announcement that britain would stand " shoulder to shoulder " with the united states , and backing that up with sending large numbers of british troops to both afghanistan and iraq , he carved a place for himself in the first rank of british premiers since 1900 .
was blair , like churchill , in the first rank of prime ministers ?
blair was watching television in brighton when the third plane hit the pentagon at 2.43pm -lrb- british time -rrb- , and then put in a short appearance at the trade union conference there .
visibly shaken , he told the delegates : " there have been the most terrible , shocking events in the united states of america in the last hours .
" i am afraid we can only imagine the terror and carnage there and the many , many innocent people who have lost their lives .
this mass terrorism is the new evil in our world today . "
later he recalled , in an interview on boston television : " sometimes things happen in politics , an event so cataclysmic that , in a curious way , all the doubt is removed .
" from the outset , i really felt very certain as to what had to be said and done . "
blair proved himself an exemplary war leader this was underlined soon afterwards in his powerful address to the labour party conference the next month , in which blair said of the american people : " we were with you at the first .
we will stay with you till the last . "
in this he was as good as his word .
blair had fought wars before , of course .
kosovo and sierra leone had seen british troops deployed by him , both successfully and with minimum casualties .
the post-9/11 invasions of afghanistan and iraq were to be of an altogether different - and larger - order , although the casualties were also amazingly light .
blair proved himself an exemplary war leader .
wmd danger under the sincere impression that saddam hussein of iraq possessed chemical and biological weapons of mass destruction -lrb- wmd -rrb- - a view shared by the intelligence services of every major country in the world , as well as by the united nations ' own weapons inspectors - he appreciated the importance of overthrowing the baathist regime as soon as the taleban regime was deposed in afghanistan .
the dangers of wmds possibly falling into the hands of anti-western terrorists groups could only be obviated by a full-scale us-led invasion by the coalition of the willing , and none proved more willing than blair .
-lrb- the fact that it later transpired that saddam had most probably destroyed his wmd was entirely immaterial ; blair believed saddam had had them at the time , not least because he had used them extensively on his own people in the late 1980s . -rrb-
prime ministers ... are judged by the one big thing that happens during their premierships .
in britain a vicious and disgraceful campaign began , attempting , on the flimsiest of evidence taken wildly out of context , to accuse blair of deliberately lying in order to take the country to war .
its smears and slurs will not stand the test of historical analysis .
the defeat of the enormous iraqi army in only three weeks in march 2003 ; the establishment of democracy in iraq , with a 70 % turnout in nationwide elections on 15 december 2005 ; the stalwart defence of iraq against an unexpectedly long and violent terrorist insurgency ; the loss of only tiny numbers of british troops by any historical or operational standards : all will be credited to tony blair by posterity .
similarly the burning out of al qaeda and the taleban from the most important areas of afghanistan is another of his fine achievements .
prime ministers are not judged by posterity on issues to do with transport , health , education , or even - most of them - on economic indicators .
they are judged by the one big thing that happens during their premierships .
that is why neville chamberlain 's munich agreement , anthony eden 's suez crisis , edward heath 's three-day week , and john major 's erm debacle have left them branded as failures .
equally , winston churchill 's blitz orations , margaret thatcher 's saving of british capitalism and tony blair 's vigorous prosecution of the war against terror will leave them noted by history as highly successful prime ministers .
return to top anthony seldon , tony blair 's biographer the verdict of history on all prime ministers as they leave office is hotly disputed , but few in modern british history have been subject to so much departing hostility as tony blair .
anthony seldon said mr blair had high ambitions for public services parts of the british media give the impression of a man who had no clear idea why he wanted to be the prime minister , who led the country into a senseless war in iraq , and lied in doing so , who has kow-towed to not one but two american presidents , and whose record domestically has been full of lies , spin , empty rhetoric and unfulfilled promises .
yet tony blair 's successive election victories alone guarantee that he will be remembered as labour 's most accomplished electoral leader .
having succeeded john smith as labour party leader in 1994 , he spent three years preparing his party to be fit for office , and stripping it of " old labour " policies on defence , trade unions and the economy .
the party came to power in may 1997 on the crest of a wave of popular emotion which swept away john major 's discredited and exhausted tories .
the party won a second landslide in 2001 , and , in 2005 a third victory , albeit on a much reduced majority .
economic strength underpinning these victories was britain 's powerful economic performance .
tony blair was fortunate in this inheritance in 1997 , and in having such a capable chancellor in gordon brown , but good leaders to some extent create their own luck .
at home , blair had high ambitions for building world-class public services , transforming the constitution , reducing inequality and attacking lawlessness .
but in the beginning progress was painfully slow .
in his first term -lrb- 1997-2001 -rrb- , blair focused on reforming the constitution and introducing welfare reforms , which paved the way for reductions in pensioner and child poverty .
blair prepared his party for three years before coming to power but the former owed more to the legacy of his predecessor , john smith , while the latter was the achievement principally of gordon brown .
for blair personally , his first term was a learning experience , when mistakes were made and valuable time squandered .
only in the second and third terms did his personal ideas fructify into his " choice and diversity " agenda , extending margaret thatcher 's liberal reforms into the welfare state .
but by the time he began to introduce these policies , including top-up fees for universities , foundation hospitals and city academies , his political capital was waning and he had to push his agenda through in the face of opposition from his own party .
in his third term -lrb- 2005-2007 -rrb- , shorn of the need to win another general election , he extended his policies into new areas , including nuclear energy , welfare , pensions reform , road pricing and greater independence for schools and health .
fighting off the successive brown challenges were essential for a prime minister who , unlike mrs thatcher , was embedding his personal agenda so late .
northern ireland push the popular view is that blair 's first term was his most successful , and the second and third terms then became progressively worse .
in fact , the very opposite is the case .
to no area of british life did tony blair give more consistent attention as prime minister than the affairs of northern ireland .
from his earliest weeks in power he decided that completing the peace process would remain a priority and his hard work reaped dividends through the good friday agreement of 1998 .
signing the good friday peace agreement was a priority for blair he never lost sight of the need to give attention to the province and the fact that it has been largely peaceful during his 10 years owes much to his own efforts and determination .
in europe he was less successful .
he was passionate about building a qualitatively new relationship between britain and the european union .
but in his early months in power he was outflanked by gordon brown and the treasury over taking britain into the euro .
his best chance gone , he was unable thereafter to take britain into the single currency , or to take part in the new constitution , which foundered in 2005 .
european role many commentators thought both failures a blessing for britain .
blair did , however , play a pivotal role in extending the membership of the eu from 15 to 27 states , and toiled hard to ensure free-market rather than dirigiste and federalist values prevailed .
blair 's european policy was hampered by the hostility , often vitriolic , of jacques chirac and gerhard schroeder .
but blair 's own lack of long-term thinking on the eu , or full follow-through to his seminal speech to the european parliament in june 2005 , in which he proposed a bold new vision for the eu , also was responsible .
abroad , his " gladstonian " or " wilsonian " foreign policy inspired his major speech in chicago in april 1999 in which he articulated the doctrine of the " international community " .
blair still believes that it was right for britain to support the americans over iraq , to remove a brutal dictator who he considered a menace to his own people and threat to world peace .
this advocated humanitarian intervention in the affairs of countries under tyrannical regime under certain conditions .
blair used this approach to justify his intervention in the kosovo crisis in 1999 , when he urged a more aggressive military approach upon a reluctant american administration .
it also , in blair 's mind , provided much of the intellectual justification for the war against iraq in 2003 .
iraq remains the most controversial aspect of tony blair 's premiership .
blair still believes that it was right for britain to support the americans over iraq , to remove a brutal dictator who he considered a menace to his own people and threat to world peace .
serious mistakes yet even loyal blairites must now concede that serious mistakes were made : in the overselling of the intelligence , in the woefully inadequate planning for the postwar situation -lrb- with the us chiefly culpable -rrb- and in not doing more to rein in the excesses and inconsistencies of the bush administration .
tony blair has always believed that britain 's interests were best served by standing shoulder to shoulder with the american administration , despite the resulting unpopularity at home and in europe , and that any criticism of washington should be made in private rather than in public .
the iraq war sacrificed some of tony blair 's domestic authority , his time , and ultimately detracted from his efforts to bring peace in the arab israeli conflict , to do more to eliminate poverty in africa and to combat global warming .
all three were cherished causes to him .
again , starting work earlier in these areas would have allowed blair to achieve much more .
that fact notwithstanding , few doubt that britain 's standing in the world , and in europe , is higher in 2007 than in 1997 .
all prime ministers are limited by external forces : in tony blair 's case it was the erosion of support due to the iraq war , the unremitting hostility to much of his reform agenda from his chancellor , gordon brown , a lack of blairite ministers of quality to run the departments of state , or supporters in the party at large .
at his best , as in his response to the death of princess diana in 1997 , to 9/11 , or to the london bombings in july 2005 , he was able to find a language that chimed with the national mood that few prime ministers , or indeed us presidents , have matched .
but the obstacles he encountered , his lack of governing experience , and his lateness in discovering his personal agenda , meant his achievements were less than he hoped for , or promised .
prime ministers leave amid the noise of the immediate , in blair 's case the cash-for-honours scandal , anger over iraq , turbulence over his succession and rows over the future direction of policy .
but , as long as a transition is free of scandal , history judges premierships in a more dispassionate way .
no-one can know for sure what his successors will do - the key factor which forges historical judgments .
but it is very unlikely that blair 's successors will revert to old labour , or that david cameron will not build substantially on what blair has achieved in power since 1997 .
these will be the ultimate tests of his legacy .

how will history judge tony blair 's premiership ?

the party came to power in may 1997 on the crest of a wave of popular emotion which swept away john major 's discredited and exhausted tories .
the party won a second landslide in 2001 , and , in 2005 a third victory , albeit on a much reduced majority .
economic strength underpinning these victories was britain 's powerful economic performance .
tony blair was fortunate in this inheritance in 1997 , and in having such a capable chancellor in gordon brown , but good leaders to some extent create their own luck .
at home , blair had high ambitions for building world-class public services , transforming the constitution , reducing inequality and attacking lawlessness .
but in the beginning progress was painfully slow .
in his first term -lrb- 1997-2001 -rrb- , blair focused on reforming the constitution and introducing welfare reforms , which paved the way for reductions in pensioner and child poverty .
blair prepared his party for three years before coming to power but the former owed more to the legacy of his predecessor , john smith , while the latter was the achievement principally of gordon brown .
for blair personally , his first term was a learning experience , when mistakes were made and valuable time squandered .
only in the second and third terms did his personal ideas fructify into his " choice and diversity " agenda , extending margaret thatcher 's liberal reforms into the welfare state .
but by the time he began to introduce these policies , including top-up fees for universities , foundation hospitals and city academies , his political capital was waning and he had to push his agenda through in the face of opposition from his own party .
in his third term -lrb- 2005-2007 -rrb- , shorn of the need to win another general election , he extended his policies into new areas , including nuclear energy , welfare , pensions reform , road pricing and greater independence for schools and health .
fighting off the successive brown challenges were essential for a prime minister who , unlike mrs thatcher , was embedding his personal agenda so late .
northern ireland push the popular view is that blair 's first term was his most successful , and the second and third terms then became progressively worse .
in fact , the very opposite is the case .
to no area of british life did tony blair give more consistent attention as prime minister than the affairs of northern ireland .
from his earliest weeks in power he decided that completing the peace process would remain a priority and his hard work reaped dividends through the good friday agreement of 1998 .
signing the good friday peace agreement was a priority for blair he never lost sight of the need to give attention to the province and the fact that it has been largely peaceful during his 10 years owes much to his own efforts and determination .
in europe he was less successful .
he was passionate about building a qualitatively new relationship between britain and the european union .
but in his early months in power he was outflanked by gordon brown and the treasury over taking britain into the euro .
his best chance gone , he was unable thereafter to take britain into the single currency , or to take part in the new constitution , which foundered in 2005 .
european role many commentators thought both failures a blessing for britain .
blair did , however , play a pivotal role in extending the membership of the eu from 15 to 27 states , and toiled hard to ensure free-market rather than dirigiste and federalist values prevailed .
blair 's european policy was hampered by the hostility , often vitriolic , of jacques chirac and gerhard schroeder .
but blair 's own lack of long-term thinking on the eu , or full follow-through to his seminal speech to the european parliament in june 2005 , in which he proposed a bold new vision for the eu , also was responsible .
abroad , his " gladstonian " or " wilsonian " foreign policy inspired his major speech in chicago in april 1999 in which he articulated the doctrine of the " international community " .
blair still believes that it was right for britain to support the americans over iraq , to remove a brutal dictator who he considered a menace to his own people and threat to world peace .
this advocated humanitarian intervention in the affairs of countries under tyrannical regime under certain conditions .
blair used this approach to justify his intervention in the kosovo crisis in 1999 , when he urged a more aggressive military approach upon a reluctant american administration .
it also , in blair 's mind , provided much of the intellectual justification for the war against iraq in 2003 .
iraq remains the most controversial aspect of tony blair 's premiership .
blair still believes that it was right for britain to support the americans over iraq , to remove a brutal dictator who he considered a menace to his own people and threat to world peace .
serious mistakes yet even loyal blairites must now concede that serious mistakes were made : in the overselling of the intelligence , in the woefully inadequate planning for the postwar situation -lrb- with the us chiefly culpable -rrb- and in not doing more to rein in the excesses and inconsistencies of the bush administration .
tony blair has always believed that britain 's interests were best served by standing shoulder to shoulder with the american administration , despite the resulting unpopularity at home and in europe , and that any criticism of washington should be made in private rather than in public .
the iraq war sacrificed some of tony blair 's domestic authority , his time , and ultimately detracted from his efforts to bring peace in the arab israeli conflict , to do more to eliminate poverty in africa and to combat global warming .
all three were cherished causes to him .
again , starting work earlier in these areas would have allowed blair to achieve much more .
that fact notwithstanding , few doubt that britain 's standing in the world , and in europe , is higher in 2007 than in 1997 .
all prime ministers are limited by external forces : in tony blair 's case it was the erosion of support due to the iraq war , the unremitting hostility to much of his reform agenda from his chancellor , gordon brown , a lack of blairite ministers of quality to run the departments of state , or supporters in the party at large .
at his best , as in his response to the death of princess diana in 1997 , to 9/11 , or to the london bombings in july 2005 , he was able to find a language that chimed with the national mood that few prime ministers , or indeed us presidents , have matched .
but the obstacles he encountered , his lack of governing experience , and his lateness in discovering his personal agenda , meant his achievements were less than he hoped for , or promised .
prime ministers leave amid the noise of the immediate , in blair 's case the cash-for-honours scandal , anger over iraq , turbulence over his succession and rows over the future direction of policy .
but , as long as a transition is free of scandal , history judges premierships in a more dispassionate way .
no-one can know for sure what his successors will do - the key factor which forges historical judgments .
but it is very unlikely that blair 's successors will revert to old labour , or that david cameron will not build substantially on what blair has achieved in power since 1997 .
these will be the ultimate tests of his legacy .

how will history judge tony blair 's premiership ?
time will tell , but here are three instant expert views : ten years of presidential-style government have eroded the authority of the house of commons ian kershaw the burning out of al qaeda and the taleban from the most important areas of afghanistan is another of his achievements andrew roberts his election victories alone guarantee that he will be remembered as labour 's most accomplished electoral leader anthony seldon ian kershaw , professor of modern history , sheffield university measured against the peace-time record of british prime ministers since the end of the first world war , few of whom achieved much , mr blair 's premiership compares favourably .
ian kershaw said there were unrealistic expectations in 1997 measured against the shambolic record of the last conservative government , under mr major , it compares even better .
but measured against the expectations of 1997 -lrb- for the moment leaving iraq out of the equation -rrb- , and judged by perceptions of the present state of british society , the 10 years of mr blair will surely go down in history as a lost opportunity , a time when much was promised but relatively little attained .
of course , blair transformed the labour party and presided over three consecutive general election victories , a feat which had eluded every previous labour leader .
but to what purpose ?
undeniably , a decade of sustained prosperity and economic stability , unparalleled in recent times , has been a remarkable achievement , even if gordon brown was the main architect of the economic success .
on constitutional matters , devolution in scotland and wales has been successful , at least in the short term , though probably it has only fended off rather than excluded a more damaging nationalist challenge -lrb- at least in scotland -rrb- to the united kingdom 's integrity .
the expectations of 1997 were quite unrealistic and in northern ireland , though he did not begin the process , blair 's negotiation of the good friday agreement was the real start of major change for the better .
but in the workings of british government , the blair era has not been beneficial .
the use of " spin doctors " and unelected advisers has been harmful to democracy .
ten years of presidential-style government have eroded the authority of the house of commons .
and effective reform of the house of lords is still a distant dream .
the expectations of 1997 were quite unrealistic .
in the euphoria of finally getting rid of a clapped-out , shoddy conservative government long past its sell-by date , quite illusory hopes were invested in the new labour regime .
deep-seated problems blair 's own propaganda inflated these hopes by hyped-up claims that his premiership marked the start of a new era .
disillusionment was inevitable .
in reality , the deep-seated structural problems of the health system , education , transport , crime , juvenile disorder , urban decay , and inner-city deprivation were never going to be overcome , whatever the colour of the government , within a decade or so .
even so , there is remarkably little substantial improvement to show for 10 years of labour government , particularly in the position of the less well-off in society .
yet what is labour for , if not above all to serve their interests .
could iraq be mr blair 's suez ?
the introduction of a minimum wage , set at a modest level , was admittedly a step in the right direction .
the government also uses statistics ad nauseam to demonstrate major improvements in health , education , crime reduction , and so on .
but few people are persuaded .
to those at the sharp end , the improvements are often scarcely visible .
overall , the feeling is that taxes have gone up while public services have deteriorated .
for many living in the most deprived inner-city areas , there is little sense that the insecurity produced by crime , disorder , vandalism and anti-social behaviour has been much reduced .
in schools and hospitals marginal improvements at best can be seen , and many professionals complain that things are even worse than when labour took power .
despite the money poured in , the health service is still in poor shape .
in schools , new buildings can provide better conditions .
but the stress levels for teachers are enormous .
students now face high fees and indebtedness , though few of their lecturers would acknowledge a significant positive transformation in universities .
doctors , nurses , teachers , policemen and others suffer , too , more than ever from the oppressive bureaucracy of an unconstrained control culture .
disappearing idealism meanwhile , transport remains a mess , with no integrated planning or joined-up thinking in view .
heads here have been firmly stuck in the sand while the problems mount .
the litany could continue .
the biggest indictment overall is that , after ten years of a labour government , people have little or no sense of greater social fairness .
the idealism built into labour 's social vision has all but disappeared .
no wonder there is widespread apathy about party politics , which are as riddled with sleaze as ever they were under the tories .
labour now seems to stand for little more than the claim that it can manage the problems of british society a bit better , and a bit more humanely , than can the conservatives .
and even that claim is open to question .
however blair 's domestic achievements are judged , his place in history will be primarily shaped by the iraq war .
iraq will forever stand out in bold red in the debit column of his time in office .
it was an avoidable disaster .
and it was a disaster bearing blair 's personal hallmark .
one word can epitomise a premiership for posterity .
for anthony eden it was " suez " .
for blair , it will be " iraq " .
return to top andrew roberts , historian and biographer before 11 september 2001 , tony blair was set to go down in history as a second-division prime minister , one of those who stayed in power for a long time but without having any appreciable effect on the story of his times .
mr roberts said blair was a good war leader he followed the opinions of focus groups and opinion polls , carefully judging every option with the sole criterion of getting new labour re-elected .
if anything , he was something of a mild wrecker : over devolution , the house of lords , hunting , and the lord chancellorship , he seemed happy to rip up ancient british arrangements without giving much thought as to what would be likely to replace them .
then came 9/11 .
suddenly , everything changed .
' shoulder to shoulder ' no fewer than 67 britons died on that day , and blair showed a side of his personality that had been impossible to discern before : churchillian leadership .
with his announcement that britain would stand " shoulder to shoulder " with the united states , and backing that up with sending large numbers of british troops to both afghanistan and iraq , he carved a place for himself in the first rank of british premiers since 1900 .
was blair , like churchill , in the first rank of prime ministers ?
blair was watching television in brighton when the third plane hit the pentagon at 2.43pm -lrb- british time -rrb- , and then put in a short appearance at the trade union conference there .
visibly shaken , he told the delegates : " there have been the most terrible , shocking events in the united states of america in the last hours .
" i am afraid we can only imagine the terror and carnage there and the many , many innocent people who have lost their lives .
this mass terrorism is the new evil in our world today . "
later he recalled , in an interview on boston television : " sometimes things happen in politics , an event so cataclysmic that , in a curious way , all the doubt is removed .
" from the outset , i really felt very certain as to what had to be said and done . "
blair proved himself an exemplary war leader this was underlined soon afterwards in his powerful address to the labour party conference the next month , in which blair said of the american people : " we were with you at the first .
we will stay with you till the last . "
in this he was as good as his word .
blair had fought wars before , of course .
kosovo and sierra leone had seen british troops deployed by him , both successfully and with minimum casualties .
the post-9/11 invasions of afghanistan and iraq were to be of an altogether different - and larger - order , although the casualties were also amazingly light .
blair proved himself an exemplary war leader .
wmd danger under the sincere impression that saddam hussein of iraq possessed chemical and biological weapons of mass destruction -lrb- wmd -rrb- - a view shared by the intelligence services of every major country in the world , as well as by the united nations ' own weapons inspectors - he appreciated the importance of overthrowing the baathist regime as soon as the taleban regime was deposed in afghanistan .
the dangers of wmds possibly falling into the hands of anti-western terrorists groups could only be obviated by a full-scale us-led invasion by the coalition of the willing , and none proved more willing than blair .
-lrb- the fact that it later transpired that saddam had most probably destroyed his wmd was entirely immaterial ; blair believed saddam had had them at the time , not least because he had used them extensively on his own people in the late 1980s . -rrb-
prime ministers ... are judged by the one big thing that happens during their premierships .
in britain a vicious and disgraceful campaign began , attempting , on the flimsiest of evidence taken wildly out of context , to accuse blair of deliberately lying in order to take the country to war .
its smears and slurs will not stand the test of historical analysis .
the defeat of the enormous iraqi army in only three weeks in march 2003 ; the establishment of democracy in iraq , with a 70 % turnout in nationwide elections on 15 december 2005 ; the stalwart defence of iraq against an unexpectedly long and violent terrorist insurgency ; the loss of only tiny numbers of british troops by any historical or operational standards : all will be credited to tony blair by posterity .
similarly the burning out of al qaeda and the taleban from the most important areas of afghanistan is another of his fine achievements .
prime ministers are not judged by posterity on issues to do with transport , health , education , or even - most of them - on economic indicators .
they are judged by the one big thing that happens during their premierships .
that is why neville chamberlain 's munich agreement , anthony eden 's suez crisis , edward heath 's three-day week , and john major 's erm debacle have left them branded as failures .
equally , winston churchill 's blitz orations , margaret thatcher 's saving of british capitalism and tony blair 's vigorous prosecution of the war against terror will leave them noted by history as highly successful prime ministers .
return to top anthony seldon , tony blair 's biographer the verdict of history on all prime ministers as they leave office is hotly disputed , but few in modern british history have been subject to so much departing hostility as tony blair .
anthony seldon said mr blair had high ambitions for public services parts of the british media give the impression of a man who had no clear idea why he wanted to be the prime minister , who led the country into a senseless war in iraq , and lied in doing so , who has kow-towed to not one but two american presidents , and whose record domestically has been full of lies , spin , empty rhetoric and unfulfilled promises .
yet tony blair 's successive election victories alone guarantee that he will be remembered as labour 's most accomplished electoral leader .
having succeeded john smith as labour party leader in 1994 , he spent three years preparing his party to be fit for office , and stripping it of " old labour " policies on defence , trade unions and the economy .
the party came to power in may 1997 on the crest of a wave of popular emotion which swept away john major 's discredited and exhausted tories .
the party won a second landslide in 2001 , and , in 2005 a third victory , albeit on a much reduced majority .
economic strength underpinning these victories was britain 's powerful economic performance .

how will history judge tony blair 's premiership ?

in reality , the deep-seated structural problems of the health system , education , transport , crime , juvenile disorder , urban decay , and inner-city deprivation were never going to be overcome , whatever the colour of the government , within a decade or so .
even so , there is remarkably little substantial improvement to show for 10 years of labour government , particularly in the position of the less well-off in society .
yet what is labour for , if not above all to serve their interests .
could iraq be mr blair 's suez ?
the introduction of a minimum wage , set at a modest level , was admittedly a step in the right direction .
the government also uses statistics ad nauseam to demonstrate major improvements in health , education , crime reduction , and so on .
but few people are persuaded .
to those at the sharp end , the improvements are often scarcely visible .
overall , the feeling is that taxes have gone up while public services have deteriorated .
for many living in the most deprived inner-city areas , there is little sense that the insecurity produced by crime , disorder , vandalism and anti-social behaviour has been much reduced .
in schools and hospitals marginal improvements at best can be seen , and many professionals complain that things are even worse than when labour took power .
despite the money poured in , the health service is still in poor shape .
in schools , new buildings can provide better conditions .
but the stress levels for teachers are enormous .
students now face high fees and indebtedness , though few of their lecturers would acknowledge a significant positive transformation in universities .
doctors , nurses , teachers , policemen and others suffer , too , more than ever from the oppressive bureaucracy of an unconstrained control culture .
disappearing idealism meanwhile , transport remains a mess , with no integrated planning or joined-up thinking in view .
heads here have been firmly stuck in the sand while the problems mount .
the litany could continue .
the biggest indictment overall is that , after ten years of a labour government , people have little or no sense of greater social fairness .
the idealism built into labour 's social vision has all but disappeared .
no wonder there is widespread apathy about party politics , which are as riddled with sleaze as ever they were under the tories .
labour now seems to stand for little more than the claim that it can manage the problems of british society a bit better , and a bit more humanely , than can the conservatives .
and even that claim is open to question .
however blair 's domestic achievements are judged , his place in history will be primarily shaped by the iraq war .
iraq will forever stand out in bold red in the debit column of his time in office .
it was an avoidable disaster .
and it was a disaster bearing blair 's personal hallmark .
one word can epitomise a premiership for posterity .
for anthony eden it was " suez " .
for blair , it will be " iraq " .
return to top andrew roberts , historian and biographer before 11 september 2001 , tony blair was set to go down in history as a second-division prime minister , one of those who stayed in power for a long time but without having any appreciable effect on the story of his times .
mr roberts said blair was a good war leader he followed the opinions of focus groups and opinion polls , carefully judging every option with the sole criterion of getting new labour re-elected .
if anything , he was something of a mild wrecker : over devolution , the house of lords , hunting , and the lord chancellorship , he seemed happy to rip up ancient british arrangements without giving much thought as to what would be likely to replace them .
then came 9/11 .
suddenly , everything changed .
' shoulder to shoulder ' no fewer than 67 britons died on that day , and blair showed a side of his personality that had been impossible to discern before : churchillian leadership .
with his announcement that britain would stand " shoulder to shoulder " with the united states , and backing that up with sending large numbers of british troops to both afghanistan and iraq , he carved a place for himself in the first rank of british premiers since 1900 .
was blair , like churchill , in the first rank of prime ministers ?
blair was watching television in brighton when the third plane hit the pentagon at 2.43pm -lrb- british time -rrb- , and then put in a short appearance at the trade union conference there .
visibly shaken , he told the delegates : " there have been the most terrible , shocking events in the united states of america in the last hours .
" i am afraid we can only imagine the terror and carnage there and the many , many innocent people who have lost their lives .
this mass terrorism is the new evil in our world today . "
later he recalled , in an interview on boston television : " sometimes things happen in politics , an event so cataclysmic that , in a curious way , all the doubt is removed .
" from the outset , i really felt very certain as to what had to be said and done . "
blair proved himself an exemplary war leader this was underlined soon afterwards in his powerful address to the labour party conference the next month , in which blair said of the american people : " we were with you at the first .
we will stay with you till the last . "
in this he was as good as his word .
blair had fought wars before , of course .
kosovo and sierra leone had seen british troops deployed by him , both successfully and with minimum casualties .
the post-9/11 invasions of afghanistan and iraq were to be of an altogether different - and larger - order , although the casualties were also amazingly light .
blair proved himself an exemplary war leader .
wmd danger under the sincere impression that saddam hussein of iraq possessed chemical and biological weapons of mass destruction -lrb- wmd -rrb- - a view shared by the intelligence services of every major country in the world , as well as by the united nations ' own weapons inspectors - he appreciated the importance of overthrowing the baathist regime as soon as the taleban regime was deposed in afghanistan .
the dangers of wmds possibly falling into the hands of anti-western terrorists groups could only be obviated by a full-scale us-led invasion by the coalition of the willing , and none proved more willing than blair .
-lrb- the fact that it later transpired that saddam had most probably destroyed his wmd was entirely immaterial ; blair believed saddam had had them at the time , not least because he had used them extensively on his own people in the late 1980s . -rrb-
prime ministers ... are judged by the one big thing that happens during their premierships .
in britain a vicious and disgraceful campaign began , attempting , on the flimsiest of evidence taken wildly out of context , to accuse blair of deliberately lying in order to take the country to war .
its smears and slurs will not stand the test of historical analysis .
the defeat of the enormous iraqi army in only three weeks in march 2003 ; the establishment of democracy in iraq , with a 70 % turnout in nationwide elections on 15 december 2005 ; the stalwart defence of iraq against an unexpectedly long and violent terrorist insurgency ; the loss of only tiny numbers of british troops by any historical or operational standards : all will be credited to tony blair by posterity .
similarly the burning out of al qaeda and the taleban from the most important areas of afghanistan is another of his fine achievements .
prime ministers are not judged by posterity on issues to do with transport , health , education , or even - most of them - on economic indicators .
they are judged by the one big thing that happens during their premierships .
that is why neville chamberlain 's munich agreement , anthony eden 's suez crisis , edward heath 's three-day week , and john major 's erm debacle have left them branded as failures .
equally , winston churchill 's blitz orations , margaret thatcher 's saving of british capitalism and tony blair 's vigorous prosecution of the war against terror will leave them noted by history as highly successful prime ministers .
return to top anthony seldon , tony blair 's biographer the verdict of history on all prime ministers as they leave office is hotly disputed , but few in modern british history have been subject to so much departing hostility as tony blair .
anthony seldon said mr blair had high ambitions for public services parts of the british media give the impression of a man who had no clear idea why he wanted to be the prime minister , who led the country into a senseless war in iraq , and lied in doing so , who has kow-towed to not one but two american presidents , and whose record domestically has been full of lies , spin , empty rhetoric and unfulfilled promises .
yet tony blair 's successive election victories alone guarantee that he will be remembered as labour 's most accomplished electoral leader .
having succeeded john smith as labour party leader in 1994 , he spent three years preparing his party to be fit for office , and stripping it of " old labour " policies on defence , trade unions and the economy .
the party came to power in may 1997 on the crest of a wave of popular emotion which swept away john major 's discredited and exhausted tories .
the party won a second landslide in 2001 , and , in 2005 a third victory , albeit on a much reduced majority .
economic strength underpinning these victories was britain 's powerful economic performance .
tony blair was fortunate in this inheritance in 1997 , and in having such a capable chancellor in gordon brown , but good leaders to some extent create their own luck .
at home , blair had high ambitions for building world-class public services , transforming the constitution , reducing inequality and attacking lawlessness .
but in the beginning progress was painfully slow .
in his first term -lrb- 1997-2001 -rrb- , blair focused on reforming the constitution and introducing welfare reforms , which paved the way for reductions in pensioner and child poverty .
blair prepared his party for three years before coming to power but the former owed more to the legacy of his predecessor , john smith , while the latter was the achievement principally of gordon brown .
for blair personally , his first term was a learning experience , when mistakes were made and valuable time squandered .
only in the second and third terms did his personal ideas fructify into his " choice and diversity " agenda , extending margaret thatcher 's liberal reforms into the welfare state .
but by the time he began to introduce these policies , including top-up fees for universities , foundation hospitals and city academies , his political capital was waning and he had to push his agenda through in the face of opposition from his own party .
in his third term -lrb- 2005-2007 -rrb- , shorn of the need to win another general election , he extended his policies into new areas , including nuclear energy , welfare , pensions reform , road pricing and greater independence for schools and health .
fighting off the successive brown challenges were essential for a prime minister who , unlike mrs thatcher , was embedding his personal agenda so late .
northern ireland push the popular view is that blair 's first term was his most successful , and the second and third terms then became progressively worse .
in fact , the very opposite is the case .
to no area of british life did tony blair give more consistent attention as prime minister than the affairs of northern ireland .
from his earliest weeks in power he decided that completing the peace process would remain a priority and his hard work reaped dividends through the good friday agreement of 1998 .
signing the good friday peace agreement was a priority for blair he never lost sight of the need to give attention to the province and the fact that it has been largely peaceful during his 10 years owes much to his own efforts and determination .
in europe he was less successful .
he was passionate about building a qualitatively new relationship between britain and the european union .
but in his early months in power he was outflanked by gordon brown and the treasury over taking britain into the euro .
his best chance gone , he was unable thereafter to take britain into the single currency , or to take part in the new constitution , which foundered in 2005 .
european role many commentators thought both failures a blessing for britain .
blair did , however , play a pivotal role in extending the membership of the eu from 15 to 27 states , and toiled hard to ensure free-market rather than dirigiste and federalist values prevailed .
blair 's european policy was hampered by the hostility , often vitriolic , of jacques chirac and gerhard schroeder .
but blair 's own lack of long-term thinking on the eu , or full follow-through to his seminal speech to the european parliament in june 2005 , in which he proposed a bold new vision for the eu , also was responsible .
abroad , his " gladstonian " or " wilsonian " foreign policy inspired his major speech in chicago in april 1999 in which he articulated the doctrine of the " international community " .
blair still believes that it was right for britain to support the americans over iraq , to remove a brutal dictator who he considered a menace to his own people and threat to world peace .
this advocated humanitarian intervention in the affairs of countries under tyrannical regime under certain conditions .
blair used this approach to justify his intervention in the kosovo crisis in 1999 , when he urged a more aggressive military approach upon a reluctant american administration .
it also , in blair 's mind , provided much of the intellectual justification for the war against iraq in 2003 .
iraq remains the most controversial aspect of tony blair 's premiership .
blair still believes that it was right for britain to support the americans over iraq , to remove a brutal dictator who he considered a menace to his own people and threat to world peace .
serious mistakes yet even loyal blairites must now concede that serious mistakes were made : in the overselling of the intelligence , in the woefully inadequate planning for the postwar situation -lrb- with the us chiefly culpable -rrb- and in not doing more to rein in the excesses and inconsistencies of the bush administration .
tony blair has always believed that britain 's interests were best served by standing shoulder to shoulder with the american administration , despite the resulting unpopularity at home and in europe , and that any criticism of washington should be made in private rather than in public .
the iraq war sacrificed some of tony blair 's domestic authority , his time , and ultimately detracted from his efforts to bring peace in the arab israeli conflict , to do more to eliminate poverty in africa and to combat global warming .
all three were cherished causes to him .
again , starting work earlier in these areas would have allowed blair to achieve much more .
that fact notwithstanding , few doubt that britain 's standing in the world , and in europe , is higher in 2007 than in 1997 .
all prime ministers are limited by external forces : in tony blair 's case it was the erosion of support due to the iraq war , the unremitting hostility to much of his reform agenda from his chancellor , gordon brown , a lack of blairite ministers of quality to run the departments of state , or supporters in the party at large .
at his best , as in his response to the death of princess diana in 1997 , to 9/11 , or to the london bombings in july 2005 , he was able to find a language that chimed with the national mood that few prime ministers , or indeed us presidents , have matched .
but the obstacles he encountered , his lack of governing experience , and his lateness in discovering his personal agenda , meant his achievements were less than he hoped for , or promised .
prime ministers leave amid the noise of the immediate , in blair 's case the cash-for-honours scandal , anger over iraq , turbulence over his succession and rows over the future direction of policy .
but , as long as a transition is free of scandal , history judges premierships in a more dispassionate way .
no-one can know for sure what his successors will do - the key factor which forges historical judgments .
but it is very unlikely that blair 's successors will revert to old labour , or that david cameron will not build substantially on what blair has achieved in power since 1997 .
these will be the ultimate tests of his legacy .

how will history judge tony blair 's premiership ?
time will tell , but here are three instant expert views : ten years of presidential-style government have eroded the authority of the house of commons ian kershaw the burning out of al qaeda and the taleban from the most important areas of afghanistan is another of his achievements andrew roberts his election victories alone guarantee that he will be remembered as labour 's most accomplished electoral leader anthony seldon ian kershaw , professor of modern history , sheffield university measured against the peace-time record of british prime ministers since the end of the first world war , few of whom achieved much , mr blair 's premiership compares favourably .
ian kershaw said there were unrealistic expectations in 1997 measured against the shambolic record of the last conservative government , under mr major , it compares even better .
but measured against the expectations of 1997 -lrb- for the moment leaving iraq out of the equation -rrb- , and judged by perceptions of the present state of british society , the 10 years of mr blair will surely go down in history as a lost opportunity , a time when much was promised but relatively little attained .
of course , blair transformed the labour party and presided over three consecutive general election victories , a feat which had eluded every previous labour leader .
but to what purpose ?
undeniably , a decade of sustained prosperity and economic stability , unparalleled in recent times , has been a remarkable achievement , even if gordon brown was the main architect of the economic success .
on constitutional matters , devolution in scotland and wales has been successful , at least in the short term , though probably it has only fended off rather than excluded a more damaging nationalist challenge -lrb- at least in scotland -rrb- to the united kingdom 's integrity .
the expectations of 1997 were quite unrealistic and in northern ireland , though he did not begin the process , blair 's negotiation of the good friday agreement was the real start of major change for the better .
but in the workings of british government , the blair era has not been beneficial .
the use of " spin doctors " and unelected advisers has been harmful to democracy .
ten years of presidential-style government have eroded the authority of the house of commons .
and effective reform of the house of lords is still a distant dream .
the expectations of 1997 were quite unrealistic .
in the euphoria of finally getting rid of a clapped-out , shoddy conservative government long past its sell-by date , quite illusory hopes were invested in the new labour regime .
deep-seated problems blair 's own propaganda inflated these hopes by hyped-up claims that his premiership marked the start of a new era .
disillusionment was inevitable .
in reality , the deep-seated structural problems of the health system , education , transport , crime , juvenile disorder , urban decay , and inner-city deprivation were never going to be overcome , whatever the colour of the government , within a decade or so .
even so , there is remarkably little substantial improvement to show for 10 years of labour government , particularly in the position of the less well-off in society .
yet what is labour for , if not above all to serve their interests .
could iraq be mr blair 's suez ?

despite the money poured in , the health service is still in poor shape .
in schools , new buildings can provide better conditions .
but the stress levels for teachers are enormous .
students now face high fees and indebtedness , though few of their lecturers would acknowledge a significant positive transformation in universities .
doctors , nurses , teachers , policemen and others suffer , too , more than ever from the oppressive bureaucracy of an unconstrained control culture .

heads here have been firmly stuck in the sand while the problems mount .

it also , in blair 's mind , provided much of the intellectual justification for the war against iraq in 2003 .
iraq remains the most controversial aspect of tony blair 's premiership .
blair still believes that it was right for britain to support the americans over iraq , to remove a brutal dictator who he considered a menace to his own people and threat to world peace .
serious mistakes yet even loyal blairites must now concede that serious mistakes were made : in the overselling of the intelligence , in the woefully inadequate planning for the postwar situation -lrb- with the us chiefly culpable -rrb- and in not doing more to rein in the excesses and inconsistencies of the bush administration .
tony blair has always believed that britain 's interests were best served by standing shoulder to shoulder with the american administration , despite the resulting unpopularity at home and in europe , and that any criticism of washington should be made in private rather than in public .
the iraq war sacrificed some of tony blair 's domestic authority , his time , and ultimately detracted from his efforts to bring peace in the arab israeli conflict , to do more to eliminate poverty in africa and to combat global warming .
all three were cherished causes to him .
again , starting work earlier in these areas would have allowed blair to achieve much more .
that fact notwithstanding , few doubt that britain 's standing in the world , and in europe , is higher in 2007 than in 1997 .
all prime ministers are limited by external forces : in tony blair 's case it was the erosion of support due to the iraq war , the unremitting hostility to much of his reform agenda from his chancellor , gordon brown , a lack of blairite ministers of quality to run the departments of state , or supporters in the party at large .
at his best , as in his response to the death of princess diana in 1997 , to 9/11 , or to the london bombings in july 2005 , he was able to find a language that chimed with the national mood that few prime ministers , or indeed us presidents , have matched .
but the obstacles he encountered , his lack of governing experience , and his lateness in discovering his personal agenda , meant his achievements were less than he hoped for , or promised .
prime ministers leave amid the noise of the immediate , in blair 's case the cash-for-honours scandal , anger over iraq , turbulence over his succession and rows over the future direction of policy .
but , as long as a transition is free of scandal , history judges premierships in a more dispassionate way .
no-one can know for sure what his successors will do - the key factor which forges historical judgments .
but it is very unlikely that blair 's successors will revert to old labour , or that david cameron will not build substantially on what blair has achieved in power since 1997 .
these will be the ultimate tests of his legacy .

how will history judge tony blair 's premiership ?
time will tell , but here are three instant expert views : ten years of presidential-style government have eroded the authority of the house of commons ian kershaw the burning out of al qaeda and the taleban from the most important areas of afghanistan is another of his achievements andrew roberts his election victories alone guarantee that he will be remembered as labour 's most accomplished electoral leader anthony seldon ian kershaw , professor of modern history , sheffield university measured against the peace-time record of british prime ministers since the end of the first world war , few of whom achieved much , mr blair 's premiership compares favourably .
ian kershaw said there were unrealistic expectations in 1997 measured against the shambolic record of the last conservative government , under mr major , it compares even better .
but measured against the expectations of 1997 -lrb- for the moment leaving iraq out of the equation -rrb- , and judged by perceptions of the present state of british society , the 10 years of mr blair will surely go down in history as a lost opportunity , a time when much was promised but relatively little attained .
of course , blair transformed the labour party and presided over three consecutive general election victories , a feat which had eluded every previous labour leader .
but to what purpose ?
undeniably , a decade of sustained prosperity and economic stability , unparalleled in recent times , has been a remarkable achievement , even if gordon brown was the main architect of the economic success .
on constitutional matters , devolution in scotland and wales has been successful , at least in the short term , though probably it has only fended off rather than excluded a more damaging nationalist challenge -lrb- at least in scotland -rrb- to the united kingdom 's integrity .
the expectations of 1997 were quite unrealistic and in northern ireland , though he did not begin the process , blair 's negotiation of the good friday agreement was the real start of major change for the better .
but in the workings of british government , the blair era has not been beneficial .
the use of " spin doctors " and unelected advisers has been harmful to democracy .
ten years of presidential-style government have eroded the authority of the house of commons .
and effective reform of the house of lords is still a distant dream .
the expectations of 1997 were quite unrealistic .
in the euphoria of finally getting rid of a clapped-out , shoddy conservative government long past its sell-by date , quite illusory hopes were invested in the new labour regime .
deep-seated problems blair 's own propaganda inflated these hopes by hyped-up claims that his premiership marked the start of a new era .
disillusionment was inevitable .
in reality , the deep-seated structural problems of the health system , education , transport , crime , juvenile disorder , urban decay , and inner-city deprivation were never going to be overcome , whatever the colour of the government , within a decade or so .
even so , there is remarkably little substantial improvement to show for 10 years of labour government , particularly in the position of the less well-off in society .
yet what is labour for , if not above all to serve their interests .
could iraq be mr blair 's suez ?
the introduction of a minimum wage , set at a modest level , was admittedly a step in the right direction .
the government also uses statistics ad nauseam to demonstrate major improvements in health , education , crime reduction , and so on .
but few people are persuaded .
to those at the sharp end , the improvements are often scarcely visible .
overall , the feeling is that taxes have gone up while public services have deteriorated .
for many living in the most deprived inner-city areas , there is little sense that the insecurity produced by crime , disorder , vandalism and anti-social behaviour has been much reduced .
in schools and hospitals marginal improvements at best can be seen , and many professionals complain that things are even worse than when labour took power .
despite the money poured in , the health service is still in poor shape .
in schools , new buildings can provide better conditions .
but the stress levels for teachers are enormous .
students now face high fees and indebtedness , though few of their lecturers would acknowledge a significant positive transformation in universities .
doctors , nurses , teachers , policemen and others suffer , too , more than ever from the oppressive bureaucracy of an unconstrained control culture .
disappearing idealism meanwhile , transport remains a mess , with no integrated planning or joined-up thinking in view .
heads here have been firmly stuck in the sand while the problems mount .
the litany could continue .
the biggest indictment overall is that , after ten years of a labour government , people have little or no sense of greater social fairness .
the idealism built into labour 's social vision has all but disappeared .
no wonder there is widespread apathy about party politics , which are as riddled with sleaze as ever they were under the tories .
labour now seems to stand for little more than the claim that it can manage the problems of british society a bit better , and a bit more humanely , than can the conservatives .
and even that claim is open to question .
however blair 's domestic achievements are judged , his place in history will be primarily shaped by the iraq war .
iraq will forever stand out in bold red in the debit column of his time in office .
it was an avoidable disaster .
and it was a disaster bearing blair 's personal hallmark .
one word can epitomise a premiership for posterity .
for anthony eden it was " suez " .
for blair , it will be " iraq " .
return to top andrew roberts , historian and biographer before 11 september 2001 , tony blair was set to go down in history as a second-division prime minister , one of those who stayed in power for a long time but without having any appreciable effect on the story of his times .
mr roberts said blair was a good war leader he followed the opinions of focus groups and opinion polls , carefully judging every option with the sole criterion of getting new labour re-elected .
if anything , he was something of a mild wrecker : over devolution , the house of lords , hunting , and the lord chancellorship , he seemed happy to rip up ancient british arrangements without giving much thought as to what would be likely to replace them .
then came 9/11 .
suddenly , everything changed .
' shoulder to shoulder ' no fewer than 67 britons died on that day , and blair showed a side of his personality that had been impossible to discern before : churchillian leadership .
with his announcement that britain would stand " shoulder to shoulder " with the united states , and backing that up with sending large numbers of british troops to both afghanistan and iraq , he carved a place for himself in the first rank of british premiers since 1900 .
was blair , like churchill , in the first rank of prime ministers ?
blair was watching television in brighton when the third plane hit the pentagon at 2.43pm -lrb- british time -rrb- , and then put in a short appearance at the trade union conference there .
visibly shaken , he told the delegates : " there have been the most terrible , shocking events in the united states of america in the last hours .
" i am afraid we can only imagine the terror and carnage there and the many , many innocent people who have lost their lives .
this mass terrorism is the new evil in our world today . "
later he recalled , in an interview on boston television : " sometimes things happen in politics , an event so cataclysmic that , in a curious way , all the doubt is removed .
" from the outset , i really felt very certain as to what had to be said and done . "
blair proved himself an exemplary war leader this was underlined soon afterwards in his powerful address to the labour party conference the next month , in which blair said of the american people : " we were with you at the first .
we will stay with you till the last . "
in this he was as good as his word .
blair had fought wars before , of course .
kosovo and sierra leone had seen british troops deployed by him , both successfully and with minimum casualties .
the post-9/11 invasions of afghanistan and iraq were to be of an altogether different - and larger - order , although the casualties were also amazingly light .
blair proved himself an exemplary war leader .
wmd danger under the sincere impression that saddam hussein of iraq possessed chemical and biological weapons of mass destruction -lrb- wmd -rrb- - a view shared by the intelligence services of every major country in the world , as well as by the united nations ' own weapons inspectors - he appreciated the importance of overthrowing the baathist regime as soon as the taleban regime was deposed in afghanistan .
the dangers of wmds possibly falling into the hands of anti-western terrorists groups could only be obviated by a full-scale us-led invasion by the coalition of the willing , and none proved more willing than blair .
-lrb- the fact that it later transpired that saddam had most probably destroyed his wmd was entirely immaterial ; blair believed saddam had had them at the time , not least because he had used them extensively on his own people in the late 1980s . -rrb-
prime ministers ... are judged by the one big thing that happens during their premierships .
in britain a vicious and disgraceful campaign began , attempting , on the flimsiest of evidence taken wildly out of context , to accuse blair of deliberately lying in order to take the country to war .
its smears and slurs will not stand the test of historical analysis .
the defeat of the enormous iraqi army in only three weeks in march 2003 ; the establishment of democracy in iraq , with a 70 % turnout in nationwide elections on 15 december 2005 ; the stalwart defence of iraq against an unexpectedly long and violent terrorist insurgency ; the loss of only tiny numbers of british troops by any historical or operational standards : all will be credited to tony blair by posterity .
similarly the burning out of al qaeda and the taleban from the most important areas of afghanistan is another of his fine achievements .
prime ministers are not judged by posterity on issues to do with transport , health , education , or even - most of them - on economic indicators .
they are judged by the one big thing that happens during their premierships .
that is why neville chamberlain 's munich agreement , anthony eden 's suez crisis , edward heath 's three-day week , and john major 's erm debacle have left them branded as failures .
equally , winston churchill 's blitz orations , margaret thatcher 's saving of british capitalism and tony blair 's vigorous prosecution of the war against terror will leave them noted by history as highly successful prime ministers .
return to top anthony seldon , tony blair 's biographer the verdict of history on all prime ministers as they leave office is hotly disputed , but few in modern british history have been subject to so much departing hostility as tony blair .
anthony seldon said mr blair had high ambitions for public services parts of the british media give the impression of a man who had no clear idea why he wanted to be the prime minister , who led the country into a senseless war in iraq , and lied in doing so , who has kow-towed to not one but two american presidents , and whose record domestically has been full of lies , spin , empty rhetoric and unfulfilled promises .
yet tony blair 's successive election victories alone guarantee that he will be remembered as labour 's most accomplished electoral leader .
having succeeded john smith as labour party leader in 1994 , he spent three years preparing his party to be fit for office , and stripping it of " old labour " policies on defence , trade unions and the economy .
the party came to power in may 1997 on the crest of a wave of popular emotion which swept away john major 's discredited and exhausted tories .
the party won a second landslide in 2001 , and , in 2005 a third victory , albeit on a much reduced majority .
economic strength underpinning these victories was britain 's powerful economic performance .
tony blair was fortunate in this inheritance in 1997 , and in having such a capable chancellor in gordon brown , but good leaders to some extent create their own luck .
at home , blair had high ambitions for building world-class public services , transforming the constitution , reducing inequality and attacking lawlessness .
but in the beginning progress was painfully slow .
in his first term -lrb- 1997-2001 -rrb- , blair focused on reforming the constitution and introducing welfare reforms , which paved the way for reductions in pensioner and child poverty .
blair prepared his party for three years before coming to power but the former owed more to the legacy of his predecessor , john smith , while the latter was the achievement principally of gordon brown .
for blair personally , his first term was a learning experience , when mistakes were made and valuable time squandered .
only in the second and third terms did his personal ideas fructify into his " choice and diversity " agenda , extending margaret thatcher 's liberal reforms into the welfare state .
but by the time he began to introduce these policies , including top-up fees for universities , foundation hospitals and city academies , his political capital was waning and he had to push his agenda through in the face of opposition from his own party .
in his third term -lrb- 2005-2007 -rrb- , shorn of the need to win another general election , he extended his policies into new areas , including nuclear energy , welfare , pensions reform , road pricing and greater independence for schools and health .
fighting off the successive brown challenges were essential for a prime minister who , unlike mrs thatcher , was embedding his personal agenda so late .
northern ireland push the popular view is that blair 's first term was his most successful , and the second and third terms then became progressively worse .
in fact , the very opposite is the case .
to no area of british life did tony blair give more consistent attention as prime minister than the affairs of northern ireland .
from his earliest weeks in power he decided that completing the peace process would remain a priority and his hard work reaped dividends through the good friday agreement of 1998 .
signing the good friday peace agreement was a priority for blair he never lost sight of the need to give attention to the province and the fact that it has been largely peaceful during his 10 years owes much to his own efforts and determination .
in europe he was less successful .
he was passionate about building a qualitatively new relationship between britain and the european union .
but in his early months in power he was outflanked by gordon brown and the treasury over taking britain into the euro .
his best chance gone , he was unable thereafter to take britain into the single currency , or to take part in the new constitution , which foundered in 2005 .
european role many commentators thought both failures a blessing for britain .
blair did , however , play a pivotal role in extending the membership of the eu from 15 to 27 states , and toiled hard to ensure free-market rather than dirigiste and federalist values prevailed .
blair 's european policy was hampered by the hostility , often vitriolic , of jacques chirac and gerhard schroeder .
but blair 's own lack of long-term thinking on the eu , or full follow-through to his seminal speech to the european parliament in june 2005 , in which he proposed a bold new vision for the eu , also was responsible .
abroad , his " gladstonian " or " wilsonian " foreign policy inspired his major speech in chicago in april 1999 in which he articulated the doctrine of the " international community " .
blair still believes that it was right for britain to support the americans over iraq , to remove a brutal dictator who he considered a menace to his own people and threat to world peace .
this advocated humanitarian intervention in the affairs of countries under tyrannical regime under certain conditions .
blair used this approach to justify his intervention in the kosovo crisis in 1999 , when he urged a more aggressive military approach upon a reluctant american administration .

how will history judge tony blair 's premiership ?
time will tell , but here are three instant expert views : " ten years of presidential-style government have eroded the authority of the house of commons " " the burning out of al qaeda and the taleban from the most important areas of afghanistan is another of his achievements " " his election victories alone guarantee that he will be remembered as labour 's most accomplished electoral leader " ian kershaw , professor of modern history , sheffield university measured against the peace-time record of british prime ministers since the end of the first world war , few of whom achieved much , mr blair 's premiership compares favourably .

" i am afraid we can only imagine the terror and carnage there and the many , many innocent people who have lost their lives .
this mass terrorism is the new evil in our world today . "
later he recalled , in an interview on boston television : " sometimes things happen in politics , an event so cataclysmic that , in a curious way , all the doubt is removed .
" from the outset , i really felt very certain as to what had to be said and done . "
" blair proved himself an exemplary war leader " this was underlined soon afterwards in his powerful address to the labour party conference the next month , in which blair said of the american people : " we were with you at the first .
we will stay with you till the last . "
in this he was as good as his word .
blair had fought wars before , of course .
kosovo and sierra leone had seen british troops deployed by him , both successfully and with minimum casualties .
the post-9/11 invasions of afghanistan and iraq were to be of an altogether different - and larger - order , although the casualties were also amazingly light .
blair proved himself an exemplary war leader .
wmd danger under the sincere impression that saddam hussein of iraq possessed chemical and biological weapons of mass destruction -lrb- wmd -rrb- - a view shared by the intelligence services of every major country in the world , as well as by the united nations ' own weapons inspectors - he appreciated the importance of overthrowing the baathist regime as soon as the taleban regime was deposed in afghanistan .
the dangers of wmds possibly falling into the hands of anti-western terrorists groups could only be obviated by a full-scale us-led invasion by the coalition of the willing , and none proved more willing than blair .
-lrb- the fact that it later transpired that saddam had most probably destroyed his wmd was entirely immaterial ; blair believed saddam had had them at the time , not least because he had used them extensively on his own people in the late 1980s . -rrb-
" prime ministers ... are judged by the one big thing that happens during their premierships . "
in britain a vicious and disgraceful campaign began , attempting , on the flimsiest of evidence taken wildly out of context , to accuse blair of deliberately lying in order to take the country to war .
its smears and slurs will not stand the test of historical analysis .
the defeat of the enormous iraqi army in only three weeks in march 2003 ; the establishment of democracy in iraq , with a 70 % turnout in nationwide elections on 15 december 2005 ; the stalwart defence of iraq against an unexpectedly long and violent terrorist insurgency ; the loss of only tiny numbers of british troops by any historical or operational standards : all will be credited to tony blair by posterity .
similarly the burning out of al qaeda and the taleban from the most important areas of afghanistan is another of his fine achievements .
prime ministers are not judged by posterity on issues to do with transport , health , education , or even - most of them - on economic indicators .
they are judged by the one big thing that happens during their premierships .
that is why neville chamberlain 's munich agreement , anthony eden 's suez crisis , edward heath 's three-day week , and john major 's erm debacle have left them branded as failures .
equally , winston churchill 's blitz orations , margaret thatcher 's saving of british capitalism and tony blair 's vigorous prosecution of the war against terror will leave them noted by history as highly successful prime ministers .
anthony seldon , tony blair 's biographer the verdict of history on all prime ministers as they leave office is hotly disputed , but few in modern british history have been subject to so much departing hostility as tony blair .
parts of the british media give the impression of a man who had no clear idea why he wanted to be the prime minister , who led the country into a senseless war in iraq , and lied in doing so , who has kow-towed to not one but two american presidents , and whose record domestically has been full of lies , spin , empty rhetoric and unfulfilled promises .
yet tony blair 's successive election victories alone guarantee that he will be remembered as labour 's most accomplished electoral leader .
having succeeded john smith as labour party leader in 1994 , he spent three years preparing his party to be fit for office , and stripping it of " old labour " policies on defence , trade unions and the economy .
the party came to power in may 1997 on the crest of a wave of popular emotion which swept away john major 's discredited and exhausted tories .
the party won a second landslide in 2001 , and , in 2005 a third victory , albeit on a much reduced majority .
economic strength underpinning these victories was britain 's powerful economic performance .
tony blair was fortunate in this inheritance in 1997 , and in having such a capable chancellor in gordon brown , but good leaders to some extent create their own luck .
at home , blair had high ambitions for building world-class public services , transforming the constitution , reducing inequality and attacking lawlessness .
but in the beginning progress was painfully slow .
in his first term -lrb- 1997-2001 -rrb- , blair focused on reforming the constitution and introducing welfare reforms , which paved the way for reductions in pensioner and child poverty .
but the former owed more to the legacy of his predecessor , john smith , while the latter was the achievement principally of gordon brown .
for blair personally , his first term was a learning experience , when mistakes were made and valuable time squandered .
only in the second and third terms did his personal ideas fructify into his " choice and diversity " agenda , extending margaret thatcher 's liberal reforms into the welfare state .
but by the time he began to introduce these policies , including top-up fees for universities , foundation hospitals and city academies , his political capital was waning and he had to push his agenda through in the face of opposition from his own party .
in his third term -lrb- 2005-2007 -rrb- , shorn of the need to win another general election , he extended his policies into new areas , including nuclear energy , welfare , pensions reform , road pricing and greater independence for schools and health .
fighting off the successive brown challenges were essential for a prime minister who , unlike mrs thatcher , was embedding his personal agenda so late .
northern ireland push the popular view is that blair 's first term was his most successful , and the second and third terms then became progressively worse .
in fact , the very opposite is the case .
to no area of british life did tony blair give more consistent attention as prime minister than the affairs of northern ireland .
from his earliest weeks in power he decided that completing the peace process would remain a priority and his hard work reaped dividends through the good friday agreement of 1998 .
he never lost sight of the need to give attention to the province and the fact that it has been largely peaceful during his 10 years owes much to his own efforts and determination .
in europe he was less successful .
he was passionate about building a qualitatively new relationship between britain and the european union .
but in his early months in power he was outflanked by gordon brown and the treasury over taking britain into the euro .
his best chance gone , he was unable thereafter to take britain into the single currency , or to take part in the new constitution , which foundered in 2005 .
european role many commentators thought both failures a blessing for britain .
blair did , however , play a pivotal role in extending the membership of the eu from 15 to 27 states , and toiled hard to ensure free-market rather than dirigiste and federalist values prevailed .
blair 's european policy was hampered by the hostility , often vitriolic , of jacques chirac and gerhard schroeder .
but blair 's own lack of long-term thinking on the eu , or full follow-through to his seminal speech to the european parliament in june 2005 , in which he proposed a bold new vision for the eu , also was responsible .
abroad , his " gladstonian " or " wilsonian " foreign policy inspired his major speech in chicago in april 1999 in which he articulated the doctrine of the " international community " . "
blair still believes that it was right for britain to support the americans over iraq , to remove a brutal dictator who he considered a menace to his own people and threat to world peace . "
this advocated humanitarian intervention in the affairs of countries under tyrannical regime under certain conditions .
blair used this approach to justify his intervention in the kosovo crisis in 1999 , when he urged a more aggressive military approach upon a reluctant american administration .
it also , in blair 's mind , provided much of the intellectual justification for the war against iraq in 2003 .
iraq remains the most controversial aspect of tony blair 's premiership .
blair still believes that it was right for britain to support the americans over iraq , to remove a brutal dictator who he considered a menace to his own people and threat to world peace .
serious mistakes yet even loyal blairites must now concede that serious mistakes were made : in the overselling of the intelligence , in the woefully inadequate planning for the postwar situation -lrb- with the us chiefly culpable -rrb- and in not doing more to rein in the excesses and inconsistencies of the bush administration .
tony blair has always believed that britain 's interests were best served by standing shoulder to shoulder with the american administration , despite the resulting unpopularity at home and in europe , and that any criticism of washington should be made in private rather than in public .
the iraq war sacrificed some of tony blair 's domestic authority , his time , and ultimately detracted from his efforts to bring peace in the arab israeli conflict , to do more to eliminate poverty in africa and to combat global warming .
all three were cherished causes to him .
again , starting work earlier in these areas would have allowed blair to achieve much more .
that fact notwithstanding , few doubt that britain 's standing in the world , and in europe , is higher in 2007 than in 1997 .
all prime ministers are limited by external forces : in tony blair 's case it was the erosion of support due to the iraq war , the unremitting hostility to much of his reform agenda from his chancellor , gordon brown , a lack of blairite ministers of quality to run the departments of state , or supporters in the party at large .
at his best , as in his response to the death of princess diana in 1997 , to 9/11 , or to the london bombings in july 2005 , he was able to find a language that chimed with the national mood that few prime ministers , or indeed us presidents , have matched .
but the obstacles he encountered , his lack of governing experience , and his lateness in discovering his personal agenda , meant his achievements were less than he hoped for , or promised .
prime ministers leave amid the noise of the immediate , in blair 's case the cash-for-honours scandal , anger over iraq , turbulence over his succession and rows over the future direction of policy .
but , as long as a transition is free of scandal , history judges premierships in a more dispassionate way .
no-one can know for sure what his successors will do - the key factor which forges historical judgments .
but it is very unlikely that blair 's successors will revert to old labour , or that david cameron will not build substantially on what blair has achieved in power since 1997 .
these will be the ultimate tests of his legacy .

hpv infection was found to be a much stronger risk factor than tobacco or alcohol use , the johns hopkins university study of 300 people found .
the new england journal of medicine study said the risk was almost nine times higher for people who reported oral sex with more than six partners .
but experts said a larger study was needed to confirm the findings .
hpv infection is the cause of the majority of cervical cancers , and 80 % of sexually active women can expect to have an hpv infection at some point in their lives . "
it is important for health care providers to know that people without the traditional risk factors of tobacco and alcohol use can nevertheless be at risk of oropharyngeal cancer " dr gypsyamber d 'souza , study author the johns hopkins study took blood and saliva from 100 men and women newly diagnosed with oropharyngeal cancer which affects the throat , tonsils and back of the tongue .
they also asked questions about sex practices and other risk factors for the disease , such as family history .
those who had evidence of prior oral hpv infection had a 32-fold increased risk of throat cancer .
hpv16 - one of the most common cancer-causing strains of the virus - was present in the tumours of 72 % of cancer patients in the study .
risk factors there was no added risk for people infected with hpv who also smoked and drank alcohol , suggesting the virus itself is driving the risk of the cancer .
oral sex was said to be the main mode of transmission of hpv but the researchers said mouth-to-mouth transmission , for example through kissing , could not be ruled out .
most hpv infections clear with little or no symptoms but a small percentage of people who acquired high-risk strains may develop a cancer , the researchers added .
study author dr gypsyamber d 'souza said : " it is important for health care providers to know that people without the traditional risk factors of tobacco and alcohol use can nevertheless be at risk of oropharyngeal cancer . "
co-researcher dr maura gillison said previous research by the team had suggested there was a strong link .
but she added : " people should be reassured that oropharyngeal cancer is relatively uncommon and the overwhelming majority of people with an oral hpv infection probably will not get throat cancer . "
a vaccine which protects against cervical cancer caused by hpv strains 6 , 11 , 16 and 18 , and also against genital warts is available and the researchers said the study provided a rationale for vaccinating both girls and boys .
but whether the vaccine would protect against oral hpv infection is not yet known .
dr julie sharp , science information officer at cancer research uk , said : " there is conflicting evidence about the role of hpv , and this rare type of mouth cancer .
" as this was a small study , further research is needed to confirm these observations . "
" we know that after age , the main causes of mouth cancer are smoking or chewing tobacco or betel nut , and drinking too much alcohol . "

risk factors there was no added risk for people infected with hpv who also smoked and drank alcohol , suggesting the virus itself is driving the risk of the cancer .
oral sex was said to be the main mode of transmission of hpv but the researchers said mouth-to-mouth transmission , for example through kissing , could not be ruled out .
most hpv infections clear with little or no symptoms but a small percentage of people who acquired high-risk strains may develop a cancer , the researchers added .
study author dr gypsyamber d 'souza said : " it is important for health care providers to know that people without the traditional risk factors of tobacco and alcohol use can nevertheless be at risk of oropharyngeal cancer . "
co-researcher dr maura gillison said previous research by the team had suggested there was a strong link .
but she added : " people should be reassured that oropharyngeal cancer is relatively uncommon and the overwhelming majority of people with an oral hpv infection probably will not get throat cancer . "
a vaccine which protects against cervical cancer caused by hpv strains 6 , 11 , 16 and 18 , and also against genital warts is available and the researchers said the study provided a rationale for vaccinating both girls and boys .
but whether the vaccine would protect against oral hpv infection is not yet known .
dr julie sharp , science information officer at cancer research uk , said : " there is conflicting evidence about the role of hpv , and this rare type of mouth cancer .
" as this was a small study , further research is needed to confirm these observations . "
" we know that after age , the main causes of mouth cancer are smoking or chewing tobacco or betel nut , and drinking too much alcohol . "

here are some reflections from those engaged in the debate .
what did the blair years mean for education ?
john dunford , association of school and college leaders " in terms of highs , the top of the list must be funding and , in particular , the injection of capital funding to start to put right the serious neglect of school buildings over the previous 18 years .
" second , the priority given to helping schools in challenging circumstances .
previously there had been little or no support for schools serving our most challenging communities - excellence in cities and other projects ensured that many -lrb- although not all -rrb- of those schools had the resources to tackle their very considerable problems .
" another advance has been the very clear focus in the first term on raising standards of literacy and numeracy in primary schools .
" but in terms of lows , although it was good that tony blair put education -lrb- in triplicate -rrb- at the top of his priorities , this has led to incessant headline-grabbing initiatives which have often seemed to be more about politics than for the benefit of education .
heads are now ' initiatived out ' .
" another low has been the emphasis on testing for accountability instead of assessment for learning - and the failure to stem the growth in the examinations and testing industry on which schools and colleges are now spending a princely fortune .
" also , there has been a failure to match the increased pressure on schools with a coherent framework of support when schools are in difficulty . "
sir mike tomlinson , former ofsted chief " more money has been put into education than ever before - and it 's been a consistent increase .
" schools are in a better state than they have ever been in my experience , they 're very well resourced .
" if you just take information technology , we lead the world in the level of resourcing in our schools .
" the nursery and early years investment will have done an enormous amount of good , particularly for low-income families " the education maintenance allowances have been positive - and there has been the recognition for teachers and head teachers in the honours system .
" there is no doubt that the attention given by the government to literacy and numeracy was the right thing to do - and no doubt that it did bring improvements in standards .
but that has plateaued . "
and sir mike says that the pupils from the most deprived areas " have benefited least from the overall progress made by pupils in general " .
he also warns that there has been a negative impact for the most talented pupils from the shift towards modular courses , short-answer questions and coursework .
" over the past 10 years , the most able pupils have been let down by the assessment system , particularly at gcse , a and as-level .
i have a real worry that we are killing scholarship . "
sir mike , who led a major inquiry into reforming the qualifications system for secondary schools , also expressed " grave fears " for the vocational diplomas which are set to be introduced .
" we are outstandingly alone as a country not to have a first-class vocational offer for young people - most other successful economies have such a provision . "
in organisational terms , he says city academies have been a " bold experiment " and he forecasts that local education authorities will no longer exist in 20 years .
there have also been social changes , he says .
schools have to pick up the pieces from parents who are unable or unwilling to teach their children how to behave .
and there has been an " enormous increase in children with mental health problems " .
steve sinnott , national union of teachers general secretary " the blair years have brought education substantial and much needed investment in our schools both in equipment and in buildings .
" they have also brought us universal nursery education which lays a crucial foundation for children 's learning later in life as well as a limit on class sizes for five to seven year olds .
" sadly there have been structural changes to the organisation of our education service which are not beneficial .
" in particular , trust schools and academies hand young people 's minds over to groups , individuals or companies that will have their own agenda and take the schools out of the local family of schools which work together supporting each other 's development . "
david willetts , shadow education secretary " blair 's most disastrous mistake was to undo conservative reforms in education such as grant maintained schools and city technology colleges , only painfully to reinvent watered-down versions of them as trust schools and academies .
" ambitious targets have been set in schools which have led them to ' teach to the test ' rather than raise overall standards in the classroom .
whilst headline exam scores have risen , the proportion of pupils gaining five good gcses in the core subjects has actually fallen , truancy has risen , and we are facing a crisis in teacher recruitment and retention .
" those teachers who remain in the profession are increasingly demoralised and fed up with having their professionalism undermined by the barrage of ill-conceived central guidance .
it is that erosion of trust between government , teachers and parents which is perhaps the most damaging legacy of the last 10 years . "
barry sheerman , education select committee " people will look back on this as a golden age of investment in education .
" and there 's no doubt that this vast commitment in spending will start to bear fruit - but it 's about long-term change , it takes time .
" early intervention is at the heart of breaking through the cycle of poverty and underachievement - but some of the big expensive programmes like sure start , free nursery places and children 's centres , will take many years to work through .
" have we found a formula for a systemic raising of standards in secondary ?
time will only tell . "
mr sheerman , who chairs the house of commons education select committee , says that too much debate about education is about expecting instant results - when the impact of change is often not seen within the lifetime of a government .
will the sure start programme lead to more children staying on in education ?
that could take another 16 or 18 years to find out .
such innovations - along with shaking up local control of schools and experiments such as city academies - have to be long-term " acts of faith " , he says .
will they succeed ?
" the historians will have to tell us . "

what did the blair years mean for education ?
john dunford , association of school and college leaders extra funding has helped but " heads are initiatived out " " in terms of highs , the top of the list must be funding and , in particular , the injection of capital funding to start to put right the serious neglect of school buildings over the previous 18 years .

here are some reflections from those engaged in the debate .
what did the blair years mean for education ?
john dunford , association of school and college leaders extra funding has helped but " heads are initiatived out " " in terms of highs , the top of the list must be funding and , in particular , the injection of capital funding to start to put right the serious neglect of school buildings over the previous 18 years .
" second , the priority given to helping schools in challenging circumstances .
previously there had been little or no support for schools serving our most challenging communities - excellence in cities and other projects ensured that many -lrb- although not all -rrb- of those schools had the resources to tackle their very considerable problems .
" another advance has been the very clear focus in the first term on raising standards of literacy and numeracy in primary schools .
" but in terms of lows , although it was good that tony blair put education -lrb- in triplicate -rrb- at the top of his priorities , this has led to incessant headline-grabbing initiatives which have often seemed to be more about politics than for the benefit of education .
heads are now ' initiatived out ' .
" another low has been the emphasis on testing for accountability instead of assessment for learning - and the failure to stem the growth in the examinations and testing industry on which schools and colleges are now spending a princely fortune .
" also , there has been a failure to match the increased pressure on schools with a coherent framework of support when schools are in difficulty . "
sir mike tomlinson , former ofsted chief schools are in good shape - but there are worries over scholarship " more money has been put into education than ever before - and it 's been a consistent increase .
" schools are in a better state than they have ever been in my experience , they 're very well resourced .
" if you just take information technology , we lead the world in the level of resourcing in our schools .
" the nursery and early years investment will have done an enormous amount of good , particularly for low-income families " the education maintenance allowances have been positive - and there has been the recognition for teachers and head teachers in the honours system .
" there is no doubt that the attention given by the government to literacy and numeracy was the right thing to do - and no doubt that it did bring improvements in standards .
but that has plateaued . "
and sir mike says that the pupils from the most deprived areas " have benefited least from the overall progress made by pupils in general " .
he also warns that there has been a negative impact for the most talented pupils from the shift towards modular courses , short-answer questions and coursework .
" over the past 10 years , the most able pupils have been let down by the assessment system , particularly at gcse , a and as-level .
i have a real worry that we are killing scholarship . "
sir mike , who led a major inquiry into reforming the qualifications system for secondary schools , also expressed " grave fears " for the vocational diplomas which are set to be introduced .
" we are outstandingly alone as a country not to have a first-class vocational offer for young people - most other successful economies have such a provision . "
in organisational terms , he says city academies have been a " bold experiment " and he forecasts that local education authorities will no longer exist in 20 years .
there have also been social changes , he says .
schools have to pick up the pieces from parents who are unable or unwilling to teach their children how to behave .
and there has been an " enormous increase in children with mental health problems " .
steve sinnott , national union of teachers general secretary reforms have threatened the " local family of schools " " the blair years have brought education substantial and much needed investment in our schools both in equipment and in buildings .
" they have also brought us universal nursery education which lays a crucial foundation for children 's learning later in life as well as a limit on class sizes for five to seven year olds .
" sadly there have been structural changes to the organisation of our education service which are not beneficial .
" in particular , trust schools and academies hand young people 's minds over to groups , individuals or companies that will have their own agenda and take the schools out of the local family of schools which work together supporting each other 's development . "
david willetts , shadow education secretary trust schools and academies are re-inventions of conservative ideas " blair 's most disastrous mistake was to undo conservative reforms in education such as grant maintained schools and city technology colleges , only painfully to reinvent watered-down versions of them as trust schools and academies .
" ambitious targets have been set in schools which have led them to ' teach to the test ' rather than raise overall standards in the classroom .
whilst headline exam scores have risen , the proportion of pupils gaining five good gcses in the core subjects has actually fallen , truancy has risen , and we are facing a crisis in teacher recruitment and retention .
" those teachers who remain in the profession are increasingly demoralised and fed up with having their professionalism undermined by the barrage of ill-conceived central guidance .
it is that erosion of trust between government , teachers and parents which is perhaps the most damaging legacy of the last 10 years . "
barry sheerman , education select committee changes in education can take many years to make a difference " people will look back on this as a golden age of investment in education .
" and there 's no doubt that this vast commitment in spending will start to bear fruit - but it 's about long-term change , it takes time .
" early intervention is at the heart of breaking through the cycle of poverty and underachievement - but some of the big expensive programmes like sure start , free nursery places and children 's centres , will take many years to work through .
" have we found a formula for a systemic raising of standards in secondary ?
time will only tell . "
mr sheerman , who chairs the house of commons education select committee , says that too much debate about education is about expecting instant results - when the impact of change is often not seen within the lifetime of a government .
will the sure start programme lead to more children staying on in education ?
that could take another 16 or 18 years to find out .
such innovations - along with shaking up local control of schools and experiments such as city academies - have to be long-term " acts of faith " , he says .
will they succeed ?
" the historians will have to tell us . "

you have probably heard of sats - and if you 're stuck on the others that may give you a clue - but cats ?
the first bunch are school tests produced by durham university 's curriculum , evaluation and management centre .
ye11is , for example , is the year 11 information system , currently taken by about 200,000 students in more than 1,200 secondary schools , which then have a baseline against which to track their progress to gcse exams .
the centre is inviting schools to try out yet another : sosca -lrb- secondary on screen curriculum assessments -rrb- , which are new curriculum-based tests in reading , maths and science for pupils at the end of year 9 or s2 , to be launched next year .
statutory tests in england key stage 2 -lrb- year 6 -rrb- : mon 14 - fri 18 may key stage 3 -lrb- year 9 -rrb- : tues 8 - fri 11 may year 7 progress tests : mon 14 - fri 18 may uk tests : who takes what incas -lrb- interactive computerised assessment system -rrb- is a personalised diagnostic test for primary pupils in the uk .
centre director professor peter tymms estimates that its materials are used in about 4,000 primary schools and half of all secondary schools .
they measure not only attainment but also attitudes - for example , in each gcse subject , how do children feel about it , do they like it , how much homework do they get ?
the emphasis is on diagnosing in some detail how different children are learning , in order to help their teachers do their jobs better .
this is all the more important now in light of the official emphasis on personalising learning , which prof tymms says good teachers have always sought to do .
scrutiny but the sats at the end of key stage 2 and 3 , which in the uk are now compulsory only in england , are different .
" key stage tests are there to hold the school to account , that was their original purpose and main function . "
after all , tests children take as they leave primary school are not going to help it improve their learning .
instead they hold it up to public scrutiny in the government 's performance tables .
cats are cognitive abilities tests produced by nfernelson and are more like the 11-plus tests children in many areas still take for entry to grammar schools .
schools are so keen on measuring children 's progress they not only administer the statutory tests , they spend considerable sums of money on official optional ones for the years in between .
the national assessment agency within england 's qualifications and curriculum authority administers the statutory national curriculum tests , popularly known as sats .
but it also produces progress tests for years 3 , 4 and 5 , and for children who began secondary school without having reached the attainment level expected at the end of primary school -lrb- level 4 -rrb- .
a spokesman told the bbc news website that this year 80 % of england 's primary schools are using these optional papers - at a cost of about £ 5 per pack of 10 for each subject .
about 40 % of secondary schools are using the year 7 and 8 progress tests for low achievers .
boycott it is all a far cry from 2003 , which was a heady time for those opposed to the mandatory testing of children in england .
" complaints grow over school tests " and " teachers denounce national tests " ran the headlines .
" i and a number of other parents are on the verge of refusing to let our children take their sats , " one parent said .
a primary school head teacher told his association annual conference tests were " a crime against children " .
dozens of children 's authors complained that the tests distorted the curriculum .
the biggest schoolteachers ' union , the national union of teachers , voted to ballot its members on a mass boycott .
but this month , the latest mandatory tests are going ahead as they still do every year .
so what happened ?
changes the proposed nut boycott failed to win the support of the membership , in sufficient numbers anyway .
under the union 's rules it needed at least 51,866 votes - but attracted the backing of only 30,452 .
another 4,875 members voted against .
only about a third of ballot papers were returned .
and one of the main causes of complaint , the testing of children aged six and seven , at the end of their first two years of compulsory education , was already being changed .
the key stage 1 progress measures now rely primarily on teachers ' assessments of their charges ' attainments , informed if they wish by testing .
but the fact is schools like tests .
snapshot a year ago the new general secretary of the national association of head teachers , mick brookes , suggested to his members at their annual conference that they could disrupt this year 's tests across england by asking parents to send their children in late .
it has come to nothing , and mr brookes now accepts after having spoken to members around the country that they are in no mind to do such a thing .
mick brookes believes people are losing patience " there were a few enthusiasts but most colleagues did n't want to do that .
they think it 's a good snapshot of whether their teacher assessments are correct , " he said .
" it 's what 's done with them in the league tables that 's the problem . "
so instead the union has set up an inquiry into the system .
but mr brookes said he was not surprised that so many schools were using so many optional tests .
" people want to have a concrete idea and using tests for assessment for learning purposes is something schools have been doing forever , " he said .
the tests provided nationally benchmarked checks that identified strengths and weaknesses within a school .
patience this is just what the department for education and skills itself says - that tests provide valuable objective evidence which helps inform further improvements to teaching and learning .
but mr brookes believes the government 's routinely repeated " tests are here to stay " can not hold .
" if the government keeps saying ' this is not negotiable ' , sooner or later people are going to run out of patience , " he said .
they were beginning to connect constant testing and league tables with other issues such as misbehaviour and truancy .
it was no coincidence that the two countries at the bottom of the recent unicef appraisal of children 's well-being were those with the most testing , the usa and the uk - specifically england , he said .

you have probably heard of sats - and if you 're stuck on the others that may give you a clue - but cats ?
the first bunch are school tests produced by durham university 's curriculum , evaluation and management centre .
ye11is , for example , is the year 11 information system , currently taken by about 200,000 students in more than 1,200 secondary schools , which then have a baseline against which to track their progress to gcse exams .
the centre is inviting schools to try out yet another : sosca -lrb- secondary on screen curriculum assessments -rrb- , which are new curriculum-based tests in reading , maths and science for pupils at the end of year 9 or s2 , to be launched next year .
statutory tests in england key stage 2 -lrb- year 6 -rrb- : mon 14 - fri 18 may key stage 3 -lrb- year 9 -rrb- : tues 8 - fri 11 may year 7 progress tests : mon 14 - fri 18 may uk tests : who takes what incas -lrb- interactive computerised assessment system -rrb- is a personalised diagnostic test for primary pupils in the uk .
centre director professor peter tymms estimates that its materials are used in about 4,000 primary schools and half of all secondary schools .
they measure not only attainment but also attitudes - for example , in each gcse subject , how do children feel about it , do they like it , how much homework do they get ?
the emphasis is on diagnosing in some detail how different children are learning , in order to help their teachers do their jobs better .
this is all the more important now in light of the official emphasis on personalising learning , which prof tymms says good teachers have always sought to do .
scrutiny but the sats at the end of key stage 2 and 3 , which in the uk are now compulsory only in england , are different .
" key stage tests are there to hold the school to account , that was their original purpose and main function . "
after all , tests children take as they leave primary school are not going to help it improve their learning .
instead they hold it up to public scrutiny in the government 's performance tables .
cats are cognitive abilities tests produced by nfernelson and are more like the 11-plus tests children in many areas still take for entry to grammar schools .
schools are so keen on measuring children 's progress they not only administer the statutory tests , they spend considerable sums of money on official optional ones for the years in between .
the national assessment agency within england 's qualifications and curriculum authority administers the statutory national curriculum tests , popularly known as sats .
but it also produces progress tests for years 3 , 4 and 5 , and for children who began secondary school without having reached the attainment level expected at the end of primary school -lrb- level 4 -rrb- .
a spokesman told the bbc news website that this year 80 % of england 's primary schools are using these optional papers - at a cost of about £ 5 per pack of 10 for each subject .
about 40 % of secondary schools are using the year 7 and 8 progress tests for low achievers .
boycott it is all a far cry from 2003 , which was a heady time for those opposed to the mandatory testing of children in england .
" complaints grow over school tests " and " teachers denounce national tests " ran the headlines .
" i and a number of other parents are on the verge of refusing to let our children take their sats , " one parent said .
a primary school head teacher told his association annual conference tests were " a crime against children " .
dozens of children 's authors complained that the tests distorted the curriculum .
the biggest schoolteachers ' union , the national union of teachers , voted to ballot its members on a mass boycott .
but this month , the latest mandatory tests are going ahead as they still do every year .
so what happened ?
changes the proposed nut boycott failed to win the support of the membership , in sufficient numbers anyway .
under the union 's rules it needed at least 51,866 votes - but attracted the backing of only 30,452 .
another 4,875 members voted against .
only about a third of ballot papers were returned .
and one of the main causes of complaint , the testing of children aged six and seven , at the end of their first two years of compulsory education , was already being changed .
the key stage 1 progress measures now rely primarily on teachers ' assessments of their charges ' attainments , informed if they wish by testing .
but the fact is schools like tests .
snapshot a year ago the new general secretary of the national association of head teachers , mick brookes , suggested to his members at their annual conference that they could disrupt this year 's tests across england by asking parents to send their children in late .
it has come to nothing , and mr brookes now accepts after having spoken to members around the country that they are in no mind to do such a thing .
mick brookes believes people are losing patience " there were a few enthusiasts but most colleagues did n't want to do that .
they think it 's a good snapshot of whether their teacher assessments are correct , " he said .
" it 's what 's done with them in the league tables that 's the problem . "
so instead the union has set up an inquiry into the system .
but mr brookes said he was not surprised that so many schools were using so many optional tests .
" people want to have a concrete idea and using tests for assessment for learning purposes is something schools have been doing forever , " he said .
the tests provided nationally benchmarked checks that identified strengths and weaknesses within a school .
patience this is just what the department for education and skills itself says - that tests provide valuable objective evidence which helps inform further improvements to teaching and learning .
but mr brookes believes the government 's routinely repeated " tests are here to stay " can not hold .
" if the government keeps saying ' this is not negotiable ' , sooner or later people are going to run out of patience , " he said .
they were beginning to connect constant testing and league tables with other issues such as misbehaviour and truancy .
it was no coincidence that the two countries at the bottom of the recent unicef appraisal of children 's well-being were those with the most testing , the usa and the uk - specifically england , he said .

statutory tests in england key stage 2 -lrb- year 6 -rrb- : mon 14 - fri 18 may key stage 3 -lrb- year 9 -rrb- : tues 8 - fri 11 may year 7 progress tests : mon 14 - fri 18 may uk tests : who takes what incas -lrb- interactive computerised assessment system -rrb- is a personalised diagnostic test for primary pupils in the uk .
centre director professor peter tymms estimates that its materials are used in about 4,000 primary schools and half of all secondary schools .
they measure not only attainment but also attitudes - for example , in each gcse subject , how do children feel about it , do they like it , how much homework do they get ?
the emphasis is on diagnosing in some detail how different children are learning , in order to help their teachers do their jobs better .
this is all the more important now in light of the official emphasis on personalising learning , which prof tymms says good teachers have always sought to do .
scrutiny but the sats at the end of key stage 2 and 3 , which in the uk are now compulsory only in england , are different .
" key stage tests are there to hold the school to account , that was their original purpose and main function . "
after all , tests children take as they leave primary school are not going to help it improve their learning .
instead they hold it up to public scrutiny in the government 's performance tables .
cats are cognitive abilities tests produced by nfernelson and are more like the 11-plus tests children in many areas still take for entry to grammar schools .
schools are so keen on measuring children 's progress they not only administer the statutory tests , they spend considerable sums of money on official optional ones for the years in between .
the national assessment agency within england 's qualifications and curriculum authority administers the statutory national curriculum tests , popularly known as sats .
but it also produces progress tests for years 3 , 4 and 5 , and for children who began secondary school without having reached the attainment level expected at the end of primary school -lrb- level 4 -rrb- .
a spokesman told the bbc news website that this year 80 % of england 's primary schools are using these optional papers - at a cost of about £ 5 per pack of 10 for each subject .
about 40 % of secondary schools are using the year 7 and 8 progress tests for low achievers .
boycott it is all a far cry from 2003 , which was a heady time for those opposed to the mandatory testing of children in england .
" complaints grow over school tests " and " teachers denounce national tests " ran the headlines .
" i and a number of other parents are on the verge of refusing to let our children take their sats , " one parent said .
a primary school head teacher told his association annual conference tests were " a crime against children " .
dozens of children 's authors complained that the tests distorted the curriculum .
the biggest schoolteachers ' union , the national union of teachers , voted to ballot its members on a mass boycott .
but this month , the latest mandatory tests are going ahead as they still do every year .
so what happened ?
changes the proposed nut boycott failed to win the support of the membership , in sufficient numbers anyway .
under the union 's rules it needed at least 51,866 votes - but attracted the backing of only 30,452 .
another 4,875 members voted against .
only about a third of ballot papers were returned .
and one of the main causes of complaint , the testing of children aged six and seven , at the end of their first two years of compulsory education , was already being changed .
the key stage 1 progress measures now rely primarily on teachers ' assessments of their charges ' attainments , informed if they wish by testing .
but the fact is schools like tests .
snapshot a year ago the new general secretary of the national association of head teachers , mick brookes , suggested to his members at their annual conference that they could disrupt this year 's tests across england by asking parents to send their children in late .
it has come to nothing , and mr brookes now accepts after having spoken to members around the country that they are in no mind to do such a thing .
mick brookes believes people are losing patience " there were a few enthusiasts but most colleagues did n't want to do that .
they think it 's a good snapshot of whether their teacher assessments are correct , " he said .
" it 's what 's done with them in the league tables that 's the problem . "
so instead the union has set up an inquiry into the system .
but mr brookes said he was not surprised that so many schools were using so many optional tests .
" people want to have a concrete idea and using tests for assessment for learning purposes is something schools have been doing forever , " he said .
the tests provided nationally benchmarked checks that identified strengths and weaknesses within a school .
patience this is just what the department for education and skills itself says - that tests provide valuable objective evidence which helps inform further improvements to teaching and learning .
but mr brookes believes the government 's routinely repeated " tests are here to stay " can not hold .
" if the government keeps saying ' this is not negotiable ' , sooner or later people are going to run out of patience , " he said .
they were beginning to connect constant testing and league tables with other issues such as misbehaviour and truancy .
it was no coincidence that the two countries at the bottom of the recent unicef appraisal of children 's well-being were those with the most testing , the usa and the uk - specifically england , he said .

mick brookes believes people are losing patience " there were a few enthusiasts but most colleagues did n't want to do that .
they think it 's a good snapshot of whether their teacher assessments are correct , " he said .
" it 's what 's done with them in the league tables that 's the problem . "
so instead the union has set up an inquiry into the system .
but mr brookes said he was not surprised that so many schools were using so many optional tests .
" people want to have a concrete idea and using tests for assessment for learning purposes is something schools have been doing forever , " he said .
the tests provided nationally benchmarked checks that identified strengths and weaknesses within a school .
patience this is just what the department for education and skills itself says - that tests provide valuable objective evidence which helps inform further improvements to teaching and learning .
but mr brookes believes the government 's routinely repeated " tests are here to stay " can not hold .
" if the government keeps saying ' this is not negotiable ' , sooner or later people are going to run out of patience , " he said .
they were beginning to connect constant testing and league tables with other issues such as misbehaviour and truancy .
it was no coincidence that the two countries at the bottom of the recent unicef appraisal of children 's well-being were those with the most testing , the usa and the uk - specifically england , he said .

you have probably heard of sats - and if you 're stuck on the others that may give you a clue - but cats ?
the first bunch are school tests produced by durham university 's curriculum , evaluation and management centre .
ye11is , for example , is the year 11 information system , currently taken by about 200,000 students in more than 1,200 secondary schools , which then have a baseline against which to track their progress to gcse exams .
the centre is inviting schools to try out yet another : sosca -lrb- secondary on screen curriculum assessments -rrb- , which are new curriculum-based tests in reading , maths and science for pupils at the end of year 9 or s2 , to be launched next year .
statutory tests in england key stage 2 -lrb- year 6 -rrb- : mon 14 - fri 18 may key stage 3 -lrb- year 9 -rrb- : tues 8 - fri 11 may year 7 progress tests : mon 14 - fri 18 may uk tests : who takes what incas -lrb- interactive computerised assessment system -rrb- is a personalised diagnostic test for primary pupils in the uk .
centre director professor peter tymms estimates that its materials are used in about 4,000 primary schools and half of all secondary schools .
they measure not only attainment but also attitudes - for example , in each gcse subject , how do children feel about it , do they like it , how much homework do they get ?
the emphasis is on diagnosing in some detail how different children are learning , in order to help their teachers do their jobs better .
this is all the more important now in light of the official emphasis on personalising learning , which prof tymms says good teachers have always sought to do .
scrutiny but the sats at the end of key stage 2 and 3 , which in the uk are now compulsory only in england , are different .
" key stage tests are there to hold the school to account , that was their original purpose and main function . "
after all , tests children take as they leave primary school are not going to help it improve their learning .
instead they hold it up to public scrutiny in the government 's performance tables .
cats are cognitive abilities tests produced by nfernelson and are more like the 11-plus tests children in many areas still take for entry to grammar schools .
schools are so keen on measuring children 's progress they not only administer the statutory tests , they spend considerable sums of money on official optional ones for the years in between .
the national assessment agency within england 's qualifications and curriculum authority administers the statutory national curriculum tests , popularly known as sats .
but it also produces progress tests for years 3 , 4 and 5 , and for children who began secondary school without having reached the attainment level expected at the end of primary school -lrb- level 4 -rrb- .
a spokesman told the bbc news website that this year 80 % of england 's primary schools are using these optional papers - at a cost of about £ 5 per pack of 10 for each subject .
about 40 % of secondary schools are using the year 7 and 8 progress tests for low achievers .
boycott it is all a far cry from 2003 , which was a heady time for those opposed to the mandatory testing of children in england .
" complaints grow over school tests " and " teachers denounce national tests " ran the headlines .
" i and a number of other parents are on the verge of refusing to let our children take their sats , " one parent said .
a primary school head teacher told his association annual conference tests were " a crime against children " .
dozens of children 's authors complained that the tests distorted the curriculum .
the biggest schoolteachers ' union , the national union of teachers , voted to ballot its members on a mass boycott .
but this month , the latest mandatory tests are going ahead as they still do every year .
so what happened ?
changes the proposed nut boycott failed to win the support of the membership , in sufficient numbers anyway .
under the union 's rules it needed at least 51,866 votes - but attracted the backing of only 30,452 .
another 4,875 members voted against .
only about a third of ballot papers were returned .
and one of the main causes of complaint , the testing of children aged six and seven , at the end of their first two years of compulsory education , was already being changed .
the key stage 1 progress measures now rely primarily on teachers ' assessments of their charges ' attainments , informed if they wish by testing .
but the fact is schools like tests .
snapshot a year ago the new general secretary of the national association of head teachers , mick brookes , suggested to his members at their annual conference that they could disrupt this year 's tests across england by asking parents to send their children in late .

as a long-serving prime minister goes , with all the backwash of disappointment , anger and weariness , it 's easy to forget how fresh he once seemed .
but right from the start , a big part of that was what we now call " spin " .
yes , it comes from bowling - baseball as much as cricket - but back in the mid-1990s , its use in politics was rather technical , a term used by westminster wonks and trying-hard-to-impress columnists .
" spin doctor " was being used in the ' 80s in the us but it is part of the legacy of blairism that " spin " became a term understood by most of the british people , and not in the older senses of going for a ride in a car , or washing clothes .
' hostile ' journalism new labour was the most media-obsessed government britain had had in modern times .
with alastair campbell , a former tabloid newspaper journalist , and peter mandelson , a former television current affairs producer , working so closely with blair , this was hardly surprising .
from the first , there seemed to be a tendency to browbeat and cajole journalists , to fight for every comma and exclamation mark in every headline , contest every quote , challenge every piece of analysis .
some of this had started in the kinnock years , and it was originally defensive .
blair , brown , mandelson and campbell had watched neil kinnock being torn to shreds by hostile journalism , abetted by a pretty ruthless number 10 operation in the thatcher era , and had resolved " this will never happen to us again " .
and that was understandable .
journalists should not complain too much : most of those at the other end of the telephone were well-paid people who could stand up to spin doctors if they chose to .
tobacco scandal more worrying was the tendency to tell different newspapers and proprietors what they wanted to hear .
with rupert murdoch , blair seemed robustly anti-euro .
with pro-eu papers , he seemed strongly europhile .
sometimes he sounded a keen civil libertarian .
at other times , he was mr law and order .
people began to ask : where 's the real blair ?
that was background stuff , until he reached government , when almost immediately the bernie ecclestone formula one tobacco sponsorship row put him on the back foot , and he found himself desperately pleading to be trusted .
a string of minor scandals followed , and the number 10 press operation began to win a reputation for deviousness as well as aggression .
the " non-denial denial " and finicky analysis of the grammar of what was said became essential tools in explaining what was going on .
sometimes , outright lies were told .
as relations deteriorated between the media and number 10 , spin began to look less like a brilliantly clever and successful way of governing a liberal democracy , and more like a terrible mistake .
things got so bad that even when blair was saying something obvious , he was disbelieved .
" well , the spin is that ... , " began a thousand reports .
media cynicism curdled further .
the spinning became angrier still .
hutton inquiry all this culminated in the political-media crisis over who had really thought iraq had weapons of mass destruction , and whether journalists and the country had been misled .
most such westminster " battles " are virtual and do n't draw real blood .
but the death of david kelly and the meltdown in the bbc after the hutton inquiry signalled a different level of crisis .
blair was vindicated by lord hutton , at least on the main charge , but understood that spin was doing him far more harm than good .
alastair campbell left , and a new , calmer and more traditional regime was installed under his successor , david hill .
this has not meant that controversy over spin disappeared .
it will be as associated with the blair years as " sleaze " was - thanks in part to team blair - with the major years .
it was not ever the most important thing .
it was never the whole truth .
but it became a kind of grubby , smeared , opaque and distorting glass between blair at his best and the rest of the country - just the opposite of the effective communication it had promised to be a dozen years before .

it follows a huge rise in cases of lyme disease in scotland and encephalitis amongst travellers to mainland europe , spread by ticks .
both infections are severely debilitating and can be fatal .
a decade ago there were just 10 cases of lyme disease in scotland , but last year that figure had risen to 177 .
in mainland europe , tick-borne encephalitis is also on the rise and is now endemic in 27 countries . "
make sure you know about bite prevention , how to look out for the early symptoms and remember to seek advice " tick alert spokesman the advice to anyone heading into the countryside is to wear insect repellent and long trousers if possible and to check themselves thoroughly afterwards .
ticks should be removed by gripping them close to the skin with tweezers and pulling backwards without jerking or twisting .
they are common in woodland , heath land and in particular areas in scotland where deer graze .
more recently they have also been found in urban parks .
a spokesman for the tick alert campaign said : " ticks are second only to mosquitoes for carrying disease to humans .
" travellers and holidaymakers visiting rural areas are at risk from tick bites , but also when spending time in public spaces including beer gardens , picnic spots and parks and gardens .
" make sure you know about bite prevention , how to look out for the early symptoms and remember to seek advice well before your travel date . "
bite prevention wear trousers tucked into socks use insect repellent check yourself thoroughly check warm folds of the skin carefully remove with tweezers never burn off do not try to drown in vaseline be aware of favoured habitats lyme disease varies widely but can include a rash and flu-like symptoms in its initial stage , followed by the possibility of musculoskeletal , arthritic , neurological , psychiatric and cardiac problems .
most cases of lyme disease can be cured with antibiotics , especially if treatment is begun early in the course of illness .
katrina anderson , from edinburgh , became ill after she was bitten by a tick in 1991 .
she was misdiagnosed by her gp who blamed me for her chronic fatigue and it took another two years before she was told by a specialist that she had contracted lyme disease .
ms anderson said : " at the time i was actually very ill .
i became very flu-like with muscle pains , constant headaches .
" it was like having a virus .
it 's like a hidden illness .
you do n't actually see what the person is suffering from .
" it can affect all aspects of your nervous system . "
