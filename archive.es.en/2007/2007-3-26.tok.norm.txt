the calls came amid worries that a fragile peace deal would to collapse , worsening the humanitarian crisis . german chancellor angela merkel offered harsh criticism of sudan 's president omar hassan al-bashir for not allowing united nations peacekeepers into the country .
her remarks came amid the pomp of the european union 's 50th anniversary celebrations in berlin . " we think of the people in zimbabwe and darfur .
the suffering there is unbearable , " merkel said .
" we must look at stronger sanctions . " the sudanese government in khartoum has blocked plans to deploy un peacekeepers to replace african union troops struggling to contain the violence in the western region .
the eu imposed an arms embargo on khartoum in january 2004 .
but this weekend eu leaders and human rights activists said more needs to be done to end one of the world 's worst humanitarian disasters . situation " intolerable " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu leaders discussed darfur during the weekend 's eu celebrations britain 's prime minister tony blair said the situation in the western sudanese region was " intolerable . "
he said had been a major area of discussion as eu leaders met over the weekend . blair called for enforcing a no-fly zone over the vast darfur region of sudan to keep government planes from firing on fleeing refugees . " the issue is : we need to get a new resolution to extend the sanctions regime against key individuals , " blair said .
" the brutal action of the sudanese government is completely unacceptable . " blair was accompanied by ishag mekki , a representative of a london-based group , darfur union .
mekki 's elder sister , a mother of eight , was killed in her home in darfur .
mekki issued an emotional plea to world leaders to help stop .
the eu should not celebrate its achievements of the past century while people in darfur are being killed , mekki said . " every time genocide happens the leaders of the eu say ' never again , " ' mekki said .

" it is a spurious idea that we have lots to celebrate - the sense of betrayal is much greater , " he said .
" the eu arose out of genocide and we have failed to honor that shared value . " since fighting between rebels and government-supported militias started in 2003 , approximately 200,000 people have died and 2.5 million have fled their homes .

the slm has threatened to resume fighting and move the conflict to the capital city of khartoum , the afp reported . " what happened reveals a will to move from peace to a state of war , " slm leader minni minnawi said .
he accused the government of provoking the incident as " an attempt by the government to sabotage the peace process . " " we are prepared to resume the war and from khartoum , if the government wants to fight , " khamis tayeb , a spokesman for the slm , told afp . the united nations ' new humanitarian chief john holmes said the humanitarian effort in darfur remains fragile .
if fighting resumes , the humanitarian crisis could worsen , holmes warned , after touring a refugee camp in sudan on sunday . " people are n't starving and health conditions are decent , " he told reporters at the camp .
" this shows the enormous humanitarian effort that has been made here for three years , but this humanitarian effort is fragile . " if the situation deteriorates , it could collapse , " he added .
" the risk is high , it is not imminent but if things deteriorate , people -lrb- aid groups -rrb- may not want to maintain their efforts , which could lead to a humanitarian collapse .

the calls came amid worries that a fragile peace deal would to collapse , worsening the humanitarian crisis . german chancellor angela merkel offered harsh criticism of sudan 's president omar hassan al-bashir for not allowing united nations peacekeepers into the country .
her remarks came amid the pomp of the european union 's 50th anniversary celebrations in berlin . " we think of the people in zimbabwe and darfur .
the suffering there is unbearable , " merkel said .
" we must look at stronger sanctions . " the sudanese government in khartoum has blocked plans to deploy un peacekeepers to replace african union troops struggling to contain the violence in the western region .
the eu imposed an arms embargo on khartoum in january 2004 .
but this weekend eu leaders and human rights activists said more needs to be done to end one of the world 's worst humanitarian disasters . situation " intolerable " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu leaders discussed darfur during the weekend 's eu celebrations britain 's prime minister tony blair said the situation in the western sudanese region was " intolerable . "
he said had been a major area of discussion as eu leaders met over the weekend . blair called for enforcing a no-fly zone over the vast darfur region of sudan to keep government planes from firing on fleeing refugees . " the issue is : we need to get a new resolution to extend the sanctions regime against key individuals , " blair said .
" the brutal action of the sudanese government is completely unacceptable . " blair was accompanied by ishag mekki , a representative of a london-based group , darfur union .
mekki 's elder sister , a mother of eight , was killed in her home in darfur .
mekki issued an emotional plea to world leaders to help stop .
the eu should not celebrate its achievements of the past century while people in darfur are being killed , mekki said . " every time genocide happens the leaders of the eu say ' never again , " ' mekki said .
" these are empty words because it is happening now . " eu urged to take action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : african union soldiers have struggled to control the violence in darfur the press conference was organized by live aid founder geldof , who called for an immediate travel ban and an asset-freeze against sudanese officials . " you should refuse to let them travel to europe for their dental and hair appointments , you should stop them buying our luxury goods and freeze all assets of the sudanese government , " geldolf said . those immediate steps should be " followed within weeks by tougher sanctions , a no-fly zone over darfur and the deployment of a un force to impose peace , " he said . on saturday , 10 leading european thinkers and writers , including nobel literature laureates harold pinter and günter grass , urged eu leaders in an open letter to interrupt the anniversary celebrations and act to stop the bloodshed in darfur . geldof called the conflict a genocide and said it was shameful that the eu was not doing more to stop it as the bloc was born in response to world war ii and the holocaust . " it is a spurious idea that we have lots to celebrate - the sense of betrayal is much greater , " he said .
" the eu arose out of genocide and we have failed to honor that shared value . " since fighting between rebels and government-supported militias started in 2003 , approximately 200,000 people have died and 2.5 million have fled their homes .
the conflict has caused one of the world 's worst humanitarian crises . peace deal near collapse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : humanitarian help in darfur remains fragile , the un says on sunday , a fragile peace deal signed between the government and the rebel sudan liberation movement -lrb- slm -rrb- seemed ready to collapse after slm members got into a shootout with police saturday .
the shooting left approximately a dozen people dead .
the slm has threatened to resume fighting and move the conflict to the capital city of khartoum , the afp reported . " what happened reveals a will to move from peace to a state of war , " slm leader minni minnawi said .
he accused the government of provoking the incident as " an attempt by the government to sabotage the peace process . " " we are prepared to resume the war and from khartoum , if the government wants to fight , " khamis tayeb , a spokesman for the slm , told afp . the united nations ' new humanitarian chief john holmes said the humanitarian effort in darfur remains fragile .
if fighting resumes , the humanitarian crisis could worsen , holmes warned , after touring a refugee camp in sudan on sunday . " people are n't starving and health conditions are decent , " he told reporters at the camp .
" this shows the enormous humanitarian effort that has been made here for three years , but this humanitarian effort is fragile . " if the situation deteriorates , it could collapse , " he added .
" the risk is high , it is not imminent but if things deteriorate , people -lrb- aid groups -rrb- may not want to maintain their efforts , which could lead to a humanitarian collapse .

the european union celebrated its 50th birthday on sunday , but critics said a much publicized statement marking the occasion papers over the cracks and the divisive differences over how to meet new challenges . the blueprint for the future was contained in a berlin declaration signed by chancellor angela merkel during an informal gathering with the other 26 eu leaders in the german capital . while the two-page document proudly noted the progress made since the eu was founded , it avoided mentioning controversial issues like the bloc 's christian roots , enlargement and the eu constitution . instead there were general references to fighting " terrorism , organized crime and illegal immigration together , " as well as intentions to " jointly lead the way in energy policy and climate protection . " but it fell a long way short of " the creative madness " which italian premier romano prodi said was needed by the eu to show that the world can be changed . party snubs and enlargement fatigue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey was unhappy at not being invited to the party accession candidates like turkey had complained in advance about prospective newcomers not being invited to the birthday party , saying " it would have been meaningful , in terms of demonstrating once again the unity of the european family . " this unity has given way to " enlargement fatigue " in countries like germany where polls show there is little appetite to take on more members after the 12 mostly eastern european nations that have joined since 2004 . but other states like ireland and britain are in favor of newcomers joining the bloc , which has seen its population balloon to nearly 500 million since the founding treaty of rome was signed in 1957 . the german chancellor said the eu has become so big that it needs to take on a new role to become more effective .
a constitution is the best way to achieve this , she believes . resuscitating the treaty , which has been on ice since its rejection by french and dutch voters in 2005 , was so divisive that it was omitted from the berlin declaration altogether . merkel dedicated to eu constitution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is leading the championing of the constitution merkel hopes to present a road map on how to proceed with the treaty before germany 's six-month presidency of the union expires at the end of june . " we are united in our aim of placing the european union on a renewed common basis before the european parliament elections in 2009 , " was the compromise formula that appeared in the berlin declaration . while merkel would like to keep the " substance " of the moribund 485-page constitution , objections have come from britain , poland and the czech republic , among others . britain opposes surrendering control of its foreign policy to an eu foreign minister , while the czech republic believes the target date of 2009 , when it will hold the eu presidency , is too early . poland fears it is unfairly treated in the proposed voting system in the treaty , which gives votes according to population , thus making germany the major beneficiary in decision-making issues because it is europe 's biggest nation . critics say declaration ignores real problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is still a lot of work to be done " the real problem issues are just being postponed , " said daniela schwarzer , a senior fellow at the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- . if merkel insists on having the treaty ready by 2009 the differences will have to be sorted out by the end of this year , according to german television analyst udo van kampen . this is because the document will need to be ratified by all 27 national parliaments , a cumbersome process that could take as long as 18 months . failure to do this could revive the discussion of a two-speed europe , with one group pressing ahead with political and economic union ahead of the rest . however , the german presidency remains optimistic and insists " the goal remains a constitution , " effectively dismissing suggestions that some kind of watered-down document that addresses only the administrative difficulties would suffice . the berlin declaration did not please pope benedict xvi , who said that europe was facing an identity crisis because of policies which had also resulted in a low birthrate . the pontiff was especially critical of the fact that there was no reference to europe being a christian community , something which was left out of the berlin declaration despite objections from poland . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu leaders adopt 50th anniversary berlin declaration european union leaders adopted sunday a 50th anniversary declaration setting 2009 as the deadline for preparing a new treaty , following the failure of the bloc 's constitution .

" we are united in our aim of placing the european union on a renewed common basis before the european parliament elections in 2009 , " was the compromise formula that appeared in the berlin declaration . while merkel would like to keep the " substance " of the moribund 485-page constitution , objections have come from britain , poland and the czech republic , among others . britain opposes surrendering control of its foreign policy to an eu foreign minister , while the czech republic believes the target date of 2009 , when it will hold the eu presidency , is too early . poland fears it is unfairly treated in the proposed voting system in the treaty , which gives votes according to population , thus making germany the major beneficiary in decision-making issues because it is europe 's biggest nation . critics say declaration ignores real problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is still a lot of work to be done " the real problem issues are just being postponed , " said daniela schwarzer , a senior fellow at the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- . if merkel insists on having the treaty ready by 2009 the differences will have to be sorted out by the end of this year , according to german television analyst udo van kampen . this is because the document will need to be ratified by all 27 national parliaments , a cumbersome process that could take as long as 18 months . failure to do this could revive the discussion of a two-speed europe , with one group pressing ahead with political and economic union ahead of the rest . however , the german presidency remains optimistic and insists " the goal remains a constitution , " effectively dismissing suggestions that some kind of watered-down document that addresses only the administrative difficulties would suffice . the berlin declaration did not please pope benedict xvi , who said that europe was facing an identity crisis because of policies which had also resulted in a low birthrate . the pontiff was especially critical of the fact that there was no reference to europe being a christian community , something which was left out of the berlin declaration despite objections from poland . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu leaders adopt 50th anniversary berlin declaration european union leaders adopted sunday a 50th anniversary declaration setting 2009 as the deadline for preparing a new treaty , following the failure of the bloc 's constitution .

now , after the sniping between animal-lovers and irate farmers has died down , the struggle has become a political row between germany and italy over ownership . bruno began his fateful last journey from the adamello-brenta nature reserve in italy 's northern trentino region last spring , where italian authorities recently reintroduced his species .
ambling off as wild bears are wont to do , bruno unknowingly crossed the alpine border , first into austria and then germany where he was shot dead last summer . and this is where the problem lies .
the state of bavaria says that bruno should be laid to rest where he died , while the italian environment minister alfonso scanio wants the corpse back in trentino .
at the moment , bruno is on ice at an undisclosed secure location somewhere in bavaria - but for how long ? fur flies in carcass tug-of-war bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bear necessity : everyone wants a piece of bruno scanio appears to be a man who will not rest until he gets his bear .
he continues to lobby his german counterpart sigmar gabriel for his support in getting bruno repatriated , who in turn has " passed on " the italian 's wishes a number of times to werner schnappauf , bavaria 's minister of the environment . however , schnappauf is having none of it : the bear stays here , he says - and has told gabriel many times that the increasingly aggressive requests from the italians for the return of the corpse have " no judicial basis . "
schnappauf has said that it does n't matter how many times gabriel passes on scanio 's demands .
the legal situation is unquestionable .
" an animal born in the wilderness belongs to the land in which it dies , " he says . the italians strongly disagree .
a recent fax from rome to the bavarian environment minister stated that bruno was part of the italian project for the reintroduction of the brown bear and therefore property of the italian state . who bears wins bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schnauppauf : " bruno stays where he died " schnappauf believes that bruno , the first brown bear to be spotted in germany for over 170 years , should be made " accessible to the general public , " which means he thinks the bear should be stuffed and housed in a museum .
while schnappauf has n't actually gone as far as saying those actual words , it is believed that the munich museum is already being lined up to take the corpse . the bavarians seem confident that bruno will stay with them while the italians will not take no for an answer .
neither side is ready to give ground or strike a deal ; no compromise over parts of fur , bones or innards .
whoever gets the bear gets the whole package .
winner takes all . bruno , it seems , in death as in life , continues to be a problem bear . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fringe opinion : the cult of knut knut the polar bear cub is the darling of the world 's media at the moment - and with his unbearable cuteness and heart-warming story of survival , rightly so .

the european union celebrated its 50th birthday on sunday , but critics said a much publicized statement marking the occasion papers over the cracks and the divisive differences over how to meet new challenges . the blueprint for the future was contained in a berlin declaration signed by chancellor angela merkel during an informal gathering with the other 26 eu leaders in the german capital . while the two-page document proudly noted the progress made since the eu was founded , it avoided mentioning controversial issues like the bloc 's christian roots , enlargement and the eu constitution . instead there were general references to fighting " terrorism , organized crime and illegal immigration together , " as well as intentions to " jointly lead the way in energy policy and climate protection . " but it fell a long way short of " the creative madness " which italian premier romano prodi said was needed by the eu to show that the world can be changed . party snubs and enlargement fatigue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey was unhappy at not being invited to the party accession candidates like turkey had complained in advance about prospective newcomers not being invited to the birthday party , saying " it would have been meaningful , in terms of demonstrating once again the unity of the european family .

now , after the sniping between animal-lovers and irate farmers has died down , the struggle has become a political row between germany and italy over ownership . bruno began his fateful last journey from the adamello-brenta nature reserve in italy 's northern trentino region last spring , where italian authorities recently reintroduced his species .
ambling off as wild bears are wont to do , bruno unknowingly crossed the alpine border , first into austria and then germany where he was shot dead last summer . and this is where the problem lies .
the state of bavaria says that bruno should be laid to rest where he died , while the italian environment minister alfonso scanio wants the corpse back in trentino .
at the moment , bruno is on ice at an undisclosed secure location somewhere in bavaria - but for how long ? fur flies in carcass tug-of-war bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bear necessity : everyone wants a piece of bruno scanio appears to be a man who will not rest until he gets his bear .
he continues to lobby his german counterpart sigmar gabriel for his support in getting bruno repatriated , who in turn has " passed on " the italian 's wishes a number of times to werner schnappauf , bavaria 's minister of the environment . however , schnappauf is having none of it : the bear stays here , he says - and has told gabriel many times that the increasingly aggressive requests from the italians for the return of the corpse have " no judicial basis . "
schnappauf has said that it does n't matter how many times gabriel passes on scanio 's demands .
the legal situation is unquestionable .
" an animal born in the wilderness belongs to the land in which it dies , " he says . the italians strongly disagree .
a recent fax from rome to the bavarian environment minister stated that bruno was part of the italian project for the reintroduction of the brown bear and therefore property of the italian state . who bears wins bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schnauppauf : " bruno stays where he died " schnappauf believes that bruno , the first brown bear to be spotted in germany for over 170 years , should be made " accessible to the general public , " which means he thinks the bear should be stuffed and housed in a museum .
while schnappauf has n't actually gone as far as saying those actual words , it is believed that the munich museum is already being lined up to take the corpse . the bavarians seem confident that bruno will stay with them while the italians will not take no for an answer .
neither side is ready to give ground or strike a deal ; no compromise over parts of fur , bones or innards .
whoever gets the bear gets the whole package .
winner takes all . bruno , it seems , in death as in life , continues to be a problem bear . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fringe opinion : the cult of knut knut the polar bear cub is the darling of the world 's media at the moment - and with his unbearable cuteness and heart-warming story of survival , rightly so .

the african continent has been the object of numerous broken promises and has reason to be skeptical , according to reinhard hermle , former head of the association of german development non-governmental organizations . he said he remembers the 2001 meeting in gleneagles , where he and other participants agreed to invest $ 50 billion in development aid .
half of that aid was intended for africa , but hermle said that remains a goal from which " we are still very far . " " chancellor schröder had promised to spend 0.51 percent of the german gross social product on development aid by 2010 , " he said .
" now we are at 0.36 percent , but we are observing that much of what is being included in calculations does not result in money reaching africa . " one example of creative bookkeeping , according to hermle , was pointless debt relief for iraq from which the country did not benefit because it had already stopped servicing its debts . poverty decline spread unevenly bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few african nations are likely to halve poverty by 2015 similar statistical effects could also be employed with the un 's millennium development goals , to which 189 un member states agreed to cut in half the number of people living on less than $ 1 per day . it 's a goal hermle said would likely be achieved due to improving economic conditions in a few nations with large populations . " highly populated countries like india and china are making large economic progress , " he said , adding that when the countries ' total population of 2.5 billion is projected on the world 's population the goal of cutting poverty in half can be reached .
" but it is a statistical trick . " while the absolute number of people living in poverty will drop by 50 percent , few african nations will be able to claim poverty dropped in their country by the same rate , hermle said . working with emerging nations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : money helps but can not solve all africa 's problems , eid said representatives from brazil , india , mexico and south africa will be present at the meeting of g8 nations , made up of canada , france , germany , italy , japan , russia , the united kingdom and the united states , for the first time . the emerging countries ' presence is due to their increasing international political and economic influence that in turn has led to shift in international politics , according to german development minster heidemarie wieczorek-zeul , who is chairing the berlin summit . she said the countries ' increased influence could lead to triangle partnerships with a g8 member pairing with an emerging country to provide development aid for a third country . " one should shape the reformed partnerships with developing and emerging countries to answer the question of what changes to the partnership are necessary and what help we can provide , " eid said .
" we are focused on democratization , social reforms and economic growth . " more money needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wieczorek-zeul said new types of cooperation are required the tasks facing the industrialized world are clear , according to hermle . " more money has to be made available , " he said .
" the cooperation between north and south has to be improved .
the donor countries have to coordinate better , it should not be that every rich country runs its own bilateral development policy .
coordination reduces costs and makes the aid more efficient . " much , however , will also depend on african governments ' will to change and open to investment , eid added .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 26.03.2007 opinion : a pointless resolution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un security council 's latest resolution that imposes sanctions on iran for refusing to halt its nuclear program can only make it more difficult to solve the problem , writes dw 's peter philipp . un security council sanctions used to carry ominous weight .
that no longer seems to be the case - at least in the case of iran .
for the second time in four months , tehran has been condemned because of its nuclear policy .
the country 's foreign minister , manouchehr mottaki , may condemn the latest resolution as much as he wants , but he 'll probably be right when he says that the resolution will have no effect . after long and bitter debate , the mountain has given birth to a mouse : arms trade with iran is supposed to be outlawed and the bank accounts of a few more iranians , who work in the arms and nuclear sectors , are to be frozen . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : again tehran is called on for the last time to stop enriching uranium in order to begin negotiations about a peaceful nuclear collaboration .
disregarding any visa difficulties he might have had , iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad really did n't need to bother appearing before the council : such a resolution is as toothless as it is without effect . what , for example , is meant to be achieved with an arms embargo ?
in times , when even civilian airplanes can no longer be delivered to iran , no one will openly broker arms deals with tehran .
and why should a resolution - any more than the unifil troops - be able to stop iranian arms exports to the lebanese hezbollah ? iran rejects the council 's actions as unacceptable .
as chief witnesses for their case , tehran officials could draw on some un ambassadors - such as the french one - who emphasized before the meeting that iran naturally has a right to peaceful use of nuclear power . it 's a right that includes enriching uranium as long as this only happens in low concentrations .
but that 's exactly the center of the conflict : the security council does not differentiate between enriching for energy generation and producing arms .
it simply assumed that iran is aiming for nuclear weapons without having the slightest proof for this .
it 's doubtful whether people are even convinced themselves : would they otherwise stop at freezing bank accounts and banning an arms trade that 's impossible to control ? had the case remained with the international atomic energy agency in vienna , chances for a solution would have been much better .
to make washington happy , however , it was brought before the council , which has problems to deal with it .

the calls came amid worries that a fragile peace deal would to collapse , worsening the humanitarian crisis . german chancellor angela merkel offered harsh criticism of sudan 's president omar hassan al-bashir for not allowing united nations peacekeepers into the country .
her remarks came amid the pomp of the european union 's 50th anniversary celebrations in berlin . " we think of the people in zimbabwe and darfur .
the suffering there is unbearable , " merkel said .
" we must look at stronger sanctions . " the sudanese government in khartoum has blocked plans to deploy un peacekeepers to replace african union troops struggling to contain the violence in the western region .
the eu imposed an arms embargo on khartoum in january 2004 .
but this weekend eu leaders and human rights activists said more needs to be done to end one of the world 's worst humanitarian disasters . situation " intolerable " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu leaders discussed darfur during the weekend 's eu celebrations britain 's prime minister tony blair said the situation in the western sudanese region was " intolerable .

" the brutal action of the sudanese government is completely unacceptable . " blair was accompanied by ishag mekki , a representative of a london-based group , darfur union .
mekki 's elder sister , a mother of eight , was killed in her home in darfur .
mekki issued an emotional plea to world leaders to help stop .
the eu should not celebrate its achievements of the past century while people in darfur are being killed , mekki said . " every time genocide happens the leaders of the eu say ' never again , " ' mekki said .
" these are empty words because it is happening now .

" you should refuse to let them travel to europe for their dental and hair appointments , you should stop them buying our luxury goods and freeze all assets of the sudanese government , " geldolf said . those immediate steps should be " followed within weeks by tougher sanctions , a no-fly zone over darfur and the deployment of a un force to impose peace , " he said . on saturday , 10 leading european thinkers and writers , including nobel literature laureates harold pinter and günter grass , urged eu leaders in an open letter to interrupt the anniversary celebrations and act to stop the bloodshed in darfur . geldof called the conflict a genocide and said it was shameful that the eu was not doing more to stop it as the bloc was born in response to world war ii and the holocaust . " it is a spurious idea that we have lots to celebrate - the sense of betrayal is much greater , " he said .
" the eu arose out of genocide and we have failed to honor that shared value . " since fighting between rebels and government-supported militias started in 2003 , approximately 200,000 people have died and 2.5 million have fled their homes .
the conflict has caused one of the world 's worst humanitarian crises . peace deal near collapse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : humanitarian help in darfur remains fragile , the un says on sunday , a fragile peace deal signed between the government and the rebel sudan liberation movement -lrb- slm -rrb- seemed ready to collapse after slm members got into a shootout with police saturday .
the shooting left approximately a dozen people dead .
the slm has threatened to resume fighting and move the conflict to the capital city of khartoum , the afp reported . " what happened reveals a will to move from peace to a state of war , " slm leader minni minnawi said .
he accused the government of provoking the incident as " an attempt by the government to sabotage the peace process . " " we are prepared to resume the war and from khartoum , if the government wants to fight , " khamis tayeb , a spokesman for the slm , told afp . the united nations ' new humanitarian chief john holmes said the humanitarian effort in darfur remains fragile .
if fighting resumes , the humanitarian crisis could worsen , holmes warned , after touring a refugee camp in sudan on sunday . " people are n't starving and health conditions are decent , " he told reporters at the camp .
" this shows the enormous humanitarian effort that has been made here for three years , but this humanitarian effort is fragile . " if the situation deteriorates , it could collapse , " he added .

the eu should not celebrate its achievements of the past century while people in darfur are being killed , mekki said . " every time genocide happens the leaders of the eu say ' never again , " ' mekki said .
" these are empty words because it is happening now . " eu urged to take action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : african union soldiers have struggled to control the violence in darfur the press conference was organized by live aid founder geldof , who called for an immediate travel ban and an asset-freeze against sudanese officials . " you should refuse to let them travel to europe for their dental and hair appointments , you should stop them buying our luxury goods and freeze all assets of the sudanese government , " geldolf said . those immediate steps should be " followed within weeks by tougher sanctions , a no-fly zone over darfur and the deployment of a un force to impose peace , " he said . on saturday , 10 leading european thinkers and writers , including nobel literature laureates harold pinter and günter grass , urged eu leaders in an open letter to interrupt the anniversary celebrations and act to stop the bloodshed in darfur . geldof called the conflict a genocide and said it was shameful that the eu was not doing more to stop it as the bloc was born in response to world war ii and the holocaust . " it is a spurious idea that we have lots to celebrate - the sense of betrayal is much greater , " he said .
" the eu arose out of genocide and we have failed to honor that shared value . " since fighting between rebels and government-supported militias started in 2003 , approximately 200,000 people have died and 2.5 million have fled their homes .
the conflict has caused one of the world 's worst humanitarian crises . peace deal near collapse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : humanitarian help in darfur remains fragile , the un says on sunday , a fragile peace deal signed between the government and the rebel sudan liberation movement -lrb- slm -rrb- seemed ready to collapse after slm members got into a shootout with police saturday .
the shooting left approximately a dozen people dead .
the slm has threatened to resume fighting and move the conflict to the capital city of khartoum , the afp reported . " what happened reveals a will to move from peace to a state of war , " slm leader minni minnawi said .
he accused the government of provoking the incident as " an attempt by the government to sabotage the peace process . " " we are prepared to resume the war and from khartoum , if the government wants to fight , " khamis tayeb , a spokesman for the slm , told afp . the united nations ' new humanitarian chief john holmes said the humanitarian effort in darfur remains fragile .
if fighting resumes , the humanitarian crisis could worsen , holmes warned , after touring a refugee camp in sudan on sunday . " people are n't starving and health conditions are decent , " he told reporters at the camp .
" this shows the enormous humanitarian effort that has been made here for three years , but this humanitarian effort is fragile . " if the situation deteriorates , it could collapse , " he added .
" the risk is high , it is not imminent but if things deteriorate , people -lrb- aid groups -rrb- may not want to maintain their efforts , which could lead to a humanitarian collapse .

the fair offers intimate book browsing and prides itself in connecting readers of all ages to their favorite authors . at the leipzig book fair , families strolled through the bright fairgrounds , checking out the 2,348 exhibitors from 36 countries .
the fair , held in modern buildings outside the eastern german city of leipzig , has emerged as europe 's largest literary festival for author readings and events . organizer wolfgang marzin could n't have been happier with the fair , which ended sunday . " we had the nicest book fair , " marzin said .
" it 's the most peaceful and reader-friendly book fair . " finding an audience bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children settle down to read germany hosts two large book fairs each year .
the trade fair in frankfurt is the undisputed king of the book fair scene .
leipzig does not even strive to compete with frankfurt , but instead has established its own identity , especially with its popular concept , " leipzig reads . "
unlike frankfurt , which is geared towards trade professionals , leipzig generates much of its business from the general public . in the evenings , readings are offered around town in bookshops , cafes or at city hall .
there are appearances by famous authors such as nobel-prize winning german author günter grass . the fair has focused on attracting readers of all ages and exposing them to many different genres of literature . a young girl showed her delight while browsing picture books about horses , farms and fire trucks .
her younger brother slept in his stroller and their mother laughed at the costumed manga comic fans behind her . " there are simply things going on here , " she said .
" that 's cool . " getting young people to attend the fair is a central goal of the organizers , marzin said .
exhausted kids can be found sprawled on the floor of the central glass hall . german books take center stage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's no shortage of books in leipzig leipzig has a long tradition of printing and book trade .
after world war ii and the division of germany , leipzig became a focal point for east-west publishers .
after german reunification in 1990 , many publishing houses in the former east germany shut down or integrated into west german ones .
a year later , the leipzig book fair started . the fair focuses on german language books , introducing up-and-coming authors from central and eastern europe to the german market . the relaxed atmosphere is the secret to what makes this fair popular .
the laid back pace makes it easy for fairgoers to stumble across literary jewels . " you discover all the types of books here , ones that you ca n't find in the little bookstore in our town and ones you ca n't track down on the internet .
here you have them all in front of you , " a woman said . the next leipzig book fair will take place from march 13 to march 16 2008 . silke bartlick -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a bridge between literature and cinema how do you turn a book into a movie ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the european union turns 50 the day the eu was born eu leaders adopt 50th anniversary berlin declaration founding fathers : europeans behind the union text of the berlin declaration to mark 50 years of the eu europe -pipe- 26.03.2007 eu ponders more questions than answers amid celebrations großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the berlin declaration set out plans for the eu 's future but how much is it really worth ?
the european union celebrated its 50th birthday on sunday , but critics said a much publicized statement marking the occasion papers over the cracks and the divisive differences over how to meet new challenges . the blueprint for the future was contained in a berlin declaration signed by chancellor angela merkel during an informal gathering with the other 26 eu leaders in the german capital . while the two-page document proudly noted the progress made since the eu was founded , it avoided mentioning controversial issues like the bloc 's christian roots , enlargement and the eu constitution . instead there were general references to fighting " terrorism , organized crime and illegal immigration together , " as well as intentions to " jointly lead the way in energy policy and climate protection . " but it fell a long way short of " the creative madness " which italian premier romano prodi said was needed by the eu to show that the world can be changed . party snubs and enlargement fatigue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey was unhappy at not being invited to the party accession candidates like turkey had complained in advance about prospective newcomers not being invited to the birthday party , saying " it would have been meaningful , in terms of demonstrating once again the unity of the european family . " this unity has given way to " enlargement fatigue " in countries like germany where polls show there is little appetite to take on more members after the 12 mostly eastern european nations that have joined since 2004 . but other states like ireland and britain are in favor of newcomers joining the bloc , which has seen its population balloon to nearly 500 million since the founding treaty of rome was signed in 1957 . the german chancellor said the eu has become so big that it needs to take on a new role to become more effective .
a constitution is the best way to achieve this , she believes . resuscitating the treaty , which has been on ice since its rejection by french and dutch voters in 2005 , was so divisive that it was omitted from the berlin declaration altogether . merkel dedicated to eu constitution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is leading the championing of the constitution merkel hopes to present a road map on how to proceed with the treaty before germany 's six-month presidency of the union expires at the end of june . " we are united in our aim of placing the european union on a renewed common basis before the european parliament elections in 2009 , " was the compromise formula that appeared in the berlin declaration . while merkel would like to keep the " substance " of the moribund 485-page constitution , objections have come from britain , poland and the czech republic , among others . britain opposes surrendering control of its foreign policy to an eu foreign minister , while the czech republic believes the target date of 2009 , when it will hold the eu presidency , is too early . poland fears it is unfairly treated in the proposed voting system in the treaty , which gives votes according to population , thus making germany the major beneficiary in decision-making issues because it is europe 's biggest nation . critics say declaration ignores real problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is still a lot of work to be done " the real problem issues are just being postponed , " said daniela schwarzer , a senior fellow at the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- . if merkel insists on having the treaty ready by 2009 the differences will have to be sorted out by the end of this year , according to german television analyst udo van kampen . this is because the document will need to be ratified by all 27 national parliaments , a cumbersome process that could take as long as 18 months . failure to do this could revive the discussion of a two-speed europe , with one group pressing ahead with political and economic union ahead of the rest . however , the german presidency remains optimistic and insists " the goal remains a constitution , " effectively dismissing suggestions that some kind of watered-down document that addresses only the administrative difficulties would suffice . the berlin declaration did not please pope benedict xvi , who said that europe was facing an identity crisis because of policies which had also resulted in a low birthrate . the pontiff was especially critical of the fact that there was no reference to europe being a christian community , something which was left out of the berlin declaration despite objections from poland . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu leaders adopt 50th anniversary berlin declaration european union leaders adopted sunday a 50th anniversary declaration setting 2009 as the deadline for preparing a new treaty , following the failure of the bloc 's constitution .

now , after the sniping between animal-lovers and irate farmers has died down , the struggle has become a political row between germany and italy over ownership . bruno began his fateful last journey from the adamello-brenta nature reserve in italy 's northern trentino region last spring , where italian authorities recently reintroduced his species .
ambling off as wild bears are wont to do , bruno unknowingly crossed the alpine border , first into austria and then germany where he was shot dead last summer . and this is where the problem lies .
the state of bavaria says that bruno should be laid to rest where he died , while the italian environment minister alfonso scanio wants the corpse back in trentino .
at the moment , bruno is on ice at an undisclosed secure location somewhere in bavaria - but for how long ? fur flies in carcass tug-of-war bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bear necessity : everyone wants a piece of bruno scanio appears to be a man who will not rest until he gets his bear .
he continues to lobby his german counterpart sigmar gabriel for his support in getting bruno repatriated , who in turn has " passed on " the italian 's wishes a number of times to werner schnappauf , bavaria 's minister of the environment . however , schnappauf is having none of it : the bear stays here , he says - and has told gabriel many times that the increasingly aggressive requests from the italians for the return of the corpse have " no judicial basis . "
schnappauf has said that it does n't matter how many times gabriel passes on scanio 's demands .
the legal situation is unquestionable .
" an animal born in the wilderness belongs to the land in which it dies , " he says . the italians strongly disagree .
a recent fax from rome to the bavarian environment minister stated that bruno was part of the italian project for the reintroduction of the brown bear and therefore property of the italian state . who bears wins bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schnauppauf : " bruno stays where he died " schnappauf believes that bruno , the first brown bear to be spotted in germany for over 170 years , should be made " accessible to the general public , " which means he thinks the bear should be stuffed and housed in a museum .
while schnappauf has n't actually gone as far as saying those actual words , it is believed that the munich museum is already being lined up to take the corpse . the bavarians seem confident that bruno will stay with them while the italians will not take no for an answer .
neither side is ready to give ground or strike a deal ; no compromise over parts of fur , bones or innards .
whoever gets the bear gets the whole package .
winner takes all . bruno , it seems , in death as in life , continues to be a problem bear . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fringe opinion : the cult of knut knut the polar bear cub is the darling of the world 's media at the moment - and with his unbearable cuteness and heart-warming story of survival , rightly so .

data protection experts in the eu and the us are pushing for more security in the controversial gathering of key passenger data by us authorities from european airlines as part of measures to fight terrorism . the us and the european union are currently negotiating a permanent pact on the controversial sharing of key air passenger data which washington requires from airlines as part of heightened security measures after the september 11 terrorist attacks on new york and washington . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter schaar , germany 's top data protection official " there must be proof -lrb- that such data are useful in fighting terrorism -rrb- , there must be an independent audit or a joint review , including european data protection authorities , " german data protection commissioner peter schaar told reporters ahead of a hearing in the european parliament on monday . schaar warned that a new deal , which needs to be clinched by the end of july , might even result in a lower level of data protection than was guaranteed under previous agreements . us wants more data-sharing the us has called for more data-sharing , claiming that european privacy concerns had unreasonably hampered its counter-terrorism activities in the past few years . under the current interim pact , european air carriers are obliged to give us authorities up to 44 pieces of information on each passenger aboard america-bound flights .
the data includes credit card numbers , travel itineraries , addresses and telephone numbers . schaar said that personal data sent to us authorities should be made anonymous and the identity of their owner only be revealed if the data matched a profile in a terrorist database .
he also called for introducing a system under which data would be " pushed " to us authorities on specific request , rather than allowing the agency to " pull " the information from european airline computers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us has warned that airlines that fail to comply could face a fine a new data sharing deal has to be in place by the end of july to replace a current interim pact.however , schaar cautioned that " many , many questions remain and we are far from a solution . " washington has warned that airlines which failed to share passenger data would face fines of up to $ 6,000 per passenger and a possible loss of landing rights . " philosophical confusion " greek socialist mep stavros lambrinidis , vice-chair of the eu parliament 's civil liberties committee , said that the transatlantic privacy quarrels were signs of a " philosophical confusion between the eu and the us concerning terrorism . " " we have to look for a general understanding with the us on what is necessary to catch terrorists , " lambrinidis said .
" we are worried about the kind and quantity of data that is collected and we are concerned about how this data is used . " lambrinidis added that the eu should not only be concerned about data protection , " but also see if the data are really necessary , appropriate and important " in fighting terrorism . schaar added that a new transatlantic air passenger data deal could be challenged by national courts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : passengers flying to the us have to undergo stringent security checks the concerns were echoed by american data protection experts .
marc rotenberg , executive director and president of the electronic privacy information center in washington said in the european parliament that his group had always insisted on data protection for travelers and visitors but said that to date , persons who are not us citizens or do not have a residence permit for the country , are not afforded any protection . reconciling civil liberties with war on terror agreement on a new deal on sharing passenger data was required after the eu 's top court annulled an earlier transatlantic accord on air passenger data exchange .
however , the court 's objections related to the legal basis of the pact , not its actual contents . the eu and the us are increasingly at odds over how to reconcile civil liberties with the us-led fight against terrorism . european lawmakers have warned repeatedly that the privacy rights of eu citizens are currently unprotected against mistakes or abuse by us authorities . brussels and washington are also at loggerheads over a secret agreement between the us treasury and the belgium-based money transfer company swift , which has supplied us authorities with personal data for use in counter-terror inquiries . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu , us move closer to permanent deal of passenger data german interior minister wolfgang schäuble and us homeland security secretary michael chertoff met in berlin friday .

analysts believe that e.on faces an uphill battle to secure control of endesa as enel and acciona together already hold about a 46 per cent stake in endesa . under their takeover plan , acciona would raise its stake in endesa to 50.1 per cent , while enel would hold the rest . the cnmv ruled friday that enel and acciona could not launch a bid for six months after the e.on bid expires and gave e.on until monday to improve its offer . however , acciona told the cnmv that the joint bid with enel would be launched as soon as " legally possible .

analysts believe that e.on faces an uphill battle to secure control of endesa as enel and acciona together already hold about a 46 per cent stake in endesa . under their takeover plan , acciona would raise its stake in endesa to 50.1 per cent , while enel would hold the rest . the cnmv ruled friday that enel and acciona could not launch a bid for six months after the e.on bid expires and gave e.on until monday to improve its offer . however , acciona told the cnmv that the joint bid with enel would be launched as soon as " legally possible . "
the cnmv is to due to issue a new ruling on the acciona-enel proposed bid before markets open in spain on tuesday . e.on takes legal action against rivals but with tensions surrounding the endesa battle rising , e.on hit back launching legal moves against enel and acciona monday and calling on the cnmv to mount action against the two companies for market disruption , breaching tender offer rules , and insider trading . at the same time , e.on said that acciona and enel should be forced to divest their shareholdings in endesa and be prohibited from buying up any endesa shares . the german company also commenced court action in new york against acciona and enel , claiming that two companies had breached us disclosure rules . in a strongly worded statement , e.on lashed out at acciona and enel accusing them of " unlawful actions " which it said " were an attempt to deceive endesa 's shareholders and to manipulate the market price of endesa stock .

data protection experts in the eu and the us are pushing for more security in the controversial gathering of key passenger data by us authorities from european airlines as part of measures to fight terrorism . the us and the european union are currently negotiating a permanent pact on the controversial sharing of key air passenger data which washington requires from airlines as part of heightened security measures after the september 11 terrorist attacks on new york and washington . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter schaar , germany 's top data protection official " there must be proof -lrb- that such data are useful in fighting terrorism -rrb- , there must be an independent audit or a joint review , including european data protection authorities , " german data protection commissioner peter schaar told reporters ahead of a hearing in the european parliament on monday . schaar warned that a new deal , which needs to be clinched by the end of july , might even result in a lower level of data protection than was guaranteed under previous agreements . us wants more data-sharing the us has called for more data-sharing , claiming that european privacy concerns had unreasonably hampered its counter-terrorism activities in the past few years . under the current interim pact , european air carriers are obliged to give us authorities up to 44 pieces of information on each passenger aboard america-bound flights .
the data includes credit card numbers , travel itineraries , addresses and telephone numbers . schaar said that personal data sent to us authorities should be made anonymous and the identity of their owner only be revealed if the data matched a profile in a terrorist database .
he also called for introducing a system under which data would be " pushed " to us authorities on specific request , rather than allowing the agency to " pull " the information from european airline computers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us has warned that airlines that fail to comply could face a fine a new data sharing deal has to be in place by the end of july to replace a current interim pact.however , schaar cautioned that " many , many questions remain and we are far from a solution . " washington has warned that airlines which failed to share passenger data would face fines of up to $ 6,000 per passenger and a possible loss of landing rights . " philosophical confusion " greek socialist mep stavros lambrinidis , vice-chair of the eu parliament 's civil liberties committee , said that the transatlantic privacy quarrels were signs of a " philosophical confusion between the eu and the us concerning terrorism . " " we have to look for a general understanding with the us on what is necessary to catch terrorists , " lambrinidis said .
" we are worried about the kind and quantity of data that is collected and we are concerned about how this data is used . " lambrinidis added that the eu should not only be concerned about data protection , " but also see if the data are really necessary , appropriate and important " in fighting terrorism . schaar added that a new transatlantic air passenger data deal could be challenged by national courts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : passengers flying to the us have to undergo stringent security checks the concerns were echoed by american data protection experts .
marc rotenberg , executive director and president of the electronic privacy information center in washington said in the european parliament that his group had always insisted on data protection for travelers and visitors but said that to date , persons who are not us citizens or do not have a residence permit for the country , are not afforded any protection . reconciling civil liberties with war on terror agreement on a new deal on sharing passenger data was required after the eu 's top court annulled an earlier transatlantic accord on air passenger data exchange .
however , the court 's objections related to the legal basis of the pact , not its actual contents . the eu and the us are increasingly at odds over how to reconcile civil liberties with the us-led fight against terrorism . european lawmakers have warned repeatedly that the privacy rights of eu citizens are currently unprotected against mistakes or abuse by us authorities . brussels and washington are also at loggerheads over a secret agreement between the us treasury and the belgium-based money transfer company swift , which has supplied us authorities with personal data for use in counter-terror inquiries . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu , us move closer to permanent deal of passenger data german interior minister wolfgang schäuble and us homeland security secretary michael chertoff met in berlin friday .
an extension of the passenger data exchange deal between the eu and the us seems likely .

the calls came amid worries that a fragile peace deal would to collapse , worsening the humanitarian crisis . german chancellor angela merkel offered harsh criticism of sudan 's president omar hassan al-bashir for not allowing united nations peacekeepers into the country .
her remarks came amid the pomp of the european union 's 50th anniversary celebrations in berlin . " we think of the people in zimbabwe and darfur .
the suffering there is unbearable , " merkel said .
" we must look at stronger sanctions . " the sudanese government in khartoum has blocked plans to deploy un peacekeepers to replace african union troops struggling to contain the violence in the western region .
the eu imposed an arms embargo on khartoum in january 2004 .
but this weekend eu leaders and human rights activists said more needs to be done to end one of the world 's worst humanitarian disasters . situation " intolerable " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu leaders discussed darfur during the weekend 's eu celebrations britain 's prime minister tony blair said the situation in the western sudanese region was " intolerable . "
he said had been a major area of discussion as eu leaders met over the weekend . blair called for enforcing a no-fly zone over the vast darfur region of sudan to keep government planes from firing on fleeing refugees . " the issue is : we need to get a new resolution to extend the sanctions regime against key individuals , " blair said .
" the brutal action of the sudanese government is completely unacceptable . " blair was accompanied by ishag mekki , a representative of a london-based group , darfur union .
mekki 's elder sister , a mother of eight , was killed in her home in darfur .
mekki issued an emotional plea to world leaders to help stop .
the eu should not celebrate its achievements of the past century while people in darfur are being killed , mekki said . " every time genocide happens the leaders of the eu say ' never again , " ' mekki said .
" these are empty words because it is happening now . " eu urged to take action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : african union soldiers have struggled to control the violence in darfur the press conference was organized by live aid founder geldof , who called for an immediate travel ban and an asset-freeze against sudanese officials . " you should refuse to let them travel to europe for their dental and hair appointments , you should stop them buying our luxury goods and freeze all assets of the sudanese government , " geldolf said . those immediate steps should be " followed within weeks by tougher sanctions , a no-fly zone over darfur and the deployment of a un force to impose peace , " he said . on saturday , 10 leading european thinkers and writers , including nobel literature laureates harold pinter and günter grass , urged eu leaders in an open letter to interrupt the anniversary celebrations and act to stop the bloodshed in darfur . geldof called the conflict a genocide and said it was shameful that the eu was not doing more to stop it as the bloc was born in response to world war ii and the holocaust . " it is a spurious idea that we have lots to celebrate - the sense of betrayal is much greater , " he said .
" the eu arose out of genocide and we have failed to honor that shared value . " since fighting between rebels and government-supported militias started in 2003 , approximately 200,000 people have died and 2.5 million have fled their homes .
the conflict has caused one of the world 's worst humanitarian crises . peace deal near collapse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : humanitarian help in darfur remains fragile , the un says on sunday , a fragile peace deal signed between the government and the rebel sudan liberation movement -lrb- slm -rrb- seemed ready to collapse after slm members got into a shootout with police saturday .
the shooting left approximately a dozen people dead .
the slm has threatened to resume fighting and move the conflict to the capital city of khartoum , the afp reported . " what happened reveals a will to move from peace to a state of war , " slm leader minni minnawi said .
he accused the government of provoking the incident as " an attempt by the government to sabotage the peace process . " " we are prepared to resume the war and from khartoum , if the government wants to fight , " khamis tayeb , a spokesman for the slm , told afp . the united nations ' new humanitarian chief john holmes said the humanitarian effort in darfur remains fragile .
if fighting resumes , the humanitarian crisis could worsen , holmes warned , after touring a refugee camp in sudan on sunday . " people are n't starving and health conditions are decent , " he told reporters at the camp .
" this shows the enormous humanitarian effort that has been made here for three years , but this humanitarian effort is fragile . " if the situation deteriorates , it could collapse , " he added .
" the risk is high , it is not imminent but if things deteriorate , people -lrb- aid groups -rrb- may not want to maintain their efforts , which could lead to a humanitarian collapse .

the calls came amid worries that a fragile peace deal would to collapse , worsening the humanitarian crisis . german chancellor angela merkel offered harsh criticism of sudan 's president omar hassan al-bashir for not allowing united nations peacekeepers into the country .
her remarks came amid the pomp of the european union 's 50th anniversary celebrations in berlin . " we think of the people in zimbabwe and darfur .
the suffering there is unbearable , " merkel said .
" we must look at stronger sanctions . " the sudanese government in khartoum has blocked plans to deploy un peacekeepers to replace african union troops struggling to contain the violence in the western region .
the eu imposed an arms embargo on khartoum in january 2004 .
but this weekend eu leaders and human rights activists said more needs to be done to end one of the world 's worst humanitarian disasters . situation " intolerable " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu leaders discussed darfur during the weekend 's eu celebrations britain 's prime minister tony blair said the situation in the western sudanese region was " intolerable . "
he said had been a major area of discussion as eu leaders met over the weekend . blair called for enforcing a no-fly zone over the vast darfur region of sudan to keep government planes from firing on fleeing refugees . " the issue is : we need to get a new resolution to extend the sanctions regime against key individuals , " blair said .
" the brutal action of the sudanese government is completely unacceptable . " blair was accompanied by ishag mekki , a representative of a london-based group , darfur union .
mekki 's elder sister , a mother of eight , was killed in her home in darfur .
mekki issued an emotional plea to world leaders to help stop .
the eu should not celebrate its achievements of the past century while people in darfur are being killed , mekki said . " every time genocide happens the leaders of the eu say ' never again , " ' mekki said .
" these are empty words because it is happening now . " eu urged to take action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : african union soldiers have struggled to control the violence in darfur the press conference was organized by live aid founder geldof , who called for an immediate travel ban and an asset-freeze against sudanese officials . " you should refuse to let them travel to europe for their dental and hair appointments , you should stop them buying our luxury goods and freeze all assets of the sudanese government , " geldolf said . those immediate steps should be " followed within weeks by tougher sanctions , a no-fly zone over darfur and the deployment of a un force to impose peace , " he said . on saturday , 10 leading european thinkers and writers , including nobel literature laureates harold pinter and günter grass , urged eu leaders in an open letter to interrupt the anniversary celebrations and act to stop the bloodshed in darfur . geldof called the conflict a genocide and said it was shameful that the eu was not doing more to stop it as the bloc was born in response to world war ii and the holocaust . " it is a spurious idea that we have lots to celebrate - the sense of betrayal is much greater , " he said .
" the eu arose out of genocide and we have failed to honor that shared value . " since fighting between rebels and government-supported militias started in 2003 , approximately 200,000 people have died and 2.5 million have fled their homes .
the conflict has caused one of the world 's worst humanitarian crises . peace deal near collapse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : humanitarian help in darfur remains fragile , the un says on sunday , a fragile peace deal signed between the government and the rebel sudan liberation movement -lrb- slm -rrb- seemed ready to collapse after slm members got into a shootout with police saturday .
the shooting left approximately a dozen people dead .
the slm has threatened to resume fighting and move the conflict to the capital city of khartoum , the afp reported . " what happened reveals a will to move from peace to a state of war , " slm leader minni minnawi said .
he accused the government of provoking the incident as " an attempt by the government to sabotage the peace process . " " we are prepared to resume the war and from khartoum , if the government wants to fight , " khamis tayeb , a spokesman for the slm , told afp . the united nations ' new humanitarian chief john holmes said the humanitarian effort in darfur remains fragile .
if fighting resumes , the humanitarian crisis could worsen , holmes warned , after touring a refugee camp in sudan on sunday . " people are n't starving and health conditions are decent , " he told reporters at the camp .
" this shows the enormous humanitarian effort that has been made here for three years , but this humanitarian effort is fragile . " if the situation deteriorates , it could collapse , " he added .
" the risk is high , it is not imminent but if things deteriorate , people -lrb- aid groups -rrb- may not want to maintain their efforts , which could lead to a humanitarian collapse .

the european union celebrated its 50th birthday on sunday , but critics said a much publicized statement marking the occasion papers over the cracks and the divisive differences over how to meet new challenges . the blueprint for the future was contained in a berlin declaration signed by chancellor angela merkel during an informal gathering with the other 26 eu leaders in the german capital . while the two-page document proudly noted the progress made since the eu was founded , it avoided mentioning controversial issues like the bloc 's christian roots , enlargement and the eu constitution . instead there were general references to fighting " terrorism , organized crime and illegal immigration together , " as well as intentions to " jointly lead the way in energy policy and climate protection . " but it fell a long way short of " the creative madness " which italian premier romano prodi said was needed by the eu to show that the world can be changed . party snubs and enlargement fatigue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey was unhappy at not being invited to the party accession candidates like turkey had complained in advance about prospective newcomers not being invited to the birthday party , saying " it would have been meaningful , in terms of demonstrating once again the unity of the european family . " this unity has given way to " enlargement fatigue " in countries like germany where polls show there is little appetite to take on more members after the 12 mostly eastern european nations that have joined since 2004 . but other states like ireland and britain are in favor of newcomers joining the bloc , which has seen its population balloon to nearly 500 million since the founding treaty of rome was signed in 1957 . the german chancellor said the eu has become so big that it needs to take on a new role to become more effective .

the european union celebrated its 50th birthday on sunday , but critics said a much publicized statement marking the occasion papers over the cracks and the divisive differences over how to meet new challenges . the blueprint for the future was contained in a berlin declaration signed by chancellor angela merkel during an informal gathering with the other 26 eu leaders in the german capital . while the two-page document proudly noted the progress made since the eu was founded , it avoided mentioning controversial issues like the bloc 's christian roots , enlargement and the eu constitution . instead there were general references to fighting " terrorism , organized crime and illegal immigration together , " as well as intentions to " jointly lead the way in energy policy and climate protection . " but it fell a long way short of " the creative madness " which italian premier romano prodi said was needed by the eu to show that the world can be changed . party snubs and enlargement fatigue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey was unhappy at not being invited to the party accession candidates like turkey had complained in advance about prospective newcomers not being invited to the birthday party , saying " it would have been meaningful , in terms of demonstrating once again the unity of the european family . " this unity has given way to " enlargement fatigue " in countries like germany where polls show there is little appetite to take on more members after the 12 mostly eastern european nations that have joined since 2004 . but other states like ireland and britain are in favor of newcomers joining the bloc , which has seen its population balloon to nearly 500 million since the founding treaty of rome was signed in 1957 . the german chancellor said the eu has become so big that it needs to take on a new role to become more effective .
a constitution is the best way to achieve this , she believes . resuscitating the treaty , which has been on ice since its rejection by french and dutch voters in 2005 , was so divisive that it was omitted from the berlin declaration altogether . merkel dedicated to eu constitution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is leading the championing of the constitution merkel hopes to present a road map on how to proceed with the treaty before germany 's six-month presidency of the union expires at the end of june . " we are united in our aim of placing the european union on a renewed common basis before the european parliament elections in 2009 , " was the compromise formula that appeared in the berlin declaration . while merkel would like to keep the " substance " of the moribund 485-page constitution , objections have come from britain , poland and the czech republic , among others . britain opposes surrendering control of its foreign policy to an eu foreign minister , while the czech republic believes the target date of 2009 , when it will hold the eu presidency , is too early . poland fears it is unfairly treated in the proposed voting system in the treaty , which gives votes according to population , thus making germany the major beneficiary in decision-making issues because it is europe 's biggest nation . critics say declaration ignores real problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is still a lot of work to be done " the real problem issues are just being postponed , " said daniela schwarzer , a senior fellow at the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- . if merkel insists on having the treaty ready by 2009 the differences will have to be sorted out by the end of this year , according to german television analyst udo van kampen . this is because the document will need to be ratified by all 27 national parliaments , a cumbersome process that could take as long as 18 months . failure to do this could revive the discussion of a two-speed europe , with one group pressing ahead with political and economic union ahead of the rest . however , the german presidency remains optimistic and insists " the goal remains a constitution , " effectively dismissing suggestions that some kind of watered-down document that addresses only the administrative difficulties would suffice . the berlin declaration did not please pope benedict xvi , who said that europe was facing an identity crisis because of policies which had also resulted in a low birthrate . the pontiff was especially critical of the fact that there was no reference to europe being a christian community , something which was left out of the berlin declaration despite objections from poland . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu leaders adopt 50th anniversary berlin declaration european union leaders adopted sunday a 50th anniversary declaration setting 2009 as the deadline for preparing a new treaty , following the failure of the bloc 's constitution .

" but it fell a long way short of " the creative madness " which italian premier romano prodi said was needed by the eu to show that the world can be changed . party snubs and enlargement fatigue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey was unhappy at not being invited to the party accession candidates like turkey had complained in advance about prospective newcomers not being invited to the birthday party , saying " it would have been meaningful , in terms of demonstrating once again the unity of the european family . " this unity has given way to " enlargement fatigue " in countries like germany where polls show there is little appetite to take on more members after the 12 mostly eastern european nations that have joined since 2004 . but other states like ireland and britain are in favor of newcomers joining the bloc , which has seen its population balloon to nearly 500 million since the founding treaty of rome was signed in 1957 . the german chancellor said the eu has become so big that it needs to take on a new role to become more effective .
a constitution is the best way to achieve this , she believes . resuscitating the treaty , which has been on ice since its rejection by french and dutch voters in 2005 , was so divisive that it was omitted from the berlin declaration altogether . merkel dedicated to eu constitution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is leading the championing of the constitution merkel hopes to present a road map on how to proceed with the treaty before germany 's six-month presidency of the union expires at the end of june . " we are united in our aim of placing the european union on a renewed common basis before the european parliament elections in 2009 , " was the compromise formula that appeared in the berlin declaration . while merkel would like to keep the " substance " of the moribund 485-page constitution , objections have come from britain , poland and the czech republic , among others . britain opposes surrendering control of its foreign policy to an eu foreign minister , while the czech republic believes the target date of 2009 , when it will hold the eu presidency , is too early . poland fears it is unfairly treated in the proposed voting system in the treaty , which gives votes according to population , thus making germany the major beneficiary in decision-making issues because it is europe 's biggest nation . critics say declaration ignores real problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is still a lot of work to be done " the real problem issues are just being postponed , " said daniela schwarzer , a senior fellow at the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- . if merkel insists on having the treaty ready by 2009 the differences will have to be sorted out by the end of this year , according to german television analyst udo van kampen . this is because the document will need to be ratified by all 27 national parliaments , a cumbersome process that could take as long as 18 months . failure to do this could revive the discussion of a two-speed europe , with one group pressing ahead with political and economic union ahead of the rest . however , the german presidency remains optimistic and insists " the goal remains a constitution , " effectively dismissing suggestions that some kind of watered-down document that addresses only the administrative difficulties would suffice . the berlin declaration did not please pope benedict xvi , who said that europe was facing an identity crisis because of policies which had also resulted in a low birthrate . the pontiff was especially critical of the fact that there was no reference to europe being a christian community , something which was left out of the berlin declaration despite objections from poland . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu leaders adopt 50th anniversary berlin declaration european union leaders adopted sunday a 50th anniversary declaration setting 2009 as the deadline for preparing a new treaty , following the failure of the bloc 's constitution .

the calls came amid worries that a fragile peace deal would to collapse , worsening the humanitarian crisis . german chancellor angela merkel offered harsh criticism of sudan 's president omar hassan al-bashir for not allowing united nations peacekeepers into the country .
her remarks came amid the pomp of the european union 's 50th anniversary celebrations in berlin . " we think of the people in zimbabwe and darfur .
the suffering there is unbearable , " merkel said .
" we must look at stronger sanctions . " the sudanese government in khartoum has blocked plans to deploy un peacekeepers to replace african union troops struggling to contain the violence in the western region .
the eu imposed an arms embargo on khartoum in january 2004 .
but this weekend eu leaders and human rights activists said more needs to be done to end one of the world 's worst humanitarian disasters . situation " intolerable " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu leaders discussed darfur during the weekend 's eu celebrations britain 's prime minister tony blair said the situation in the western sudanese region was " intolerable . "
he said had been a major area of discussion as eu leaders met over the weekend . blair called for enforcing a no-fly zone over the vast darfur region of sudan to keep government planes from firing on fleeing refugees . " the issue is : we need to get a new resolution to extend the sanctions regime against key individuals , " blair said .
" the brutal action of the sudanese government is completely unacceptable . " blair was accompanied by ishag mekki , a representative of a london-based group , darfur union .
mekki 's elder sister , a mother of eight , was killed in her home in darfur .
mekki issued an emotional plea to world leaders to help stop .
the eu should not celebrate its achievements of the past century while people in darfur are being killed , mekki said . " every time genocide happens the leaders of the eu say ' never again , " ' mekki said .
" these are empty words because it is happening now . " eu urged to take action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : african union soldiers have struggled to control the violence in darfur the press conference was organized by live aid founder geldof , who called for an immediate travel ban and an asset-freeze against sudanese officials . " you should refuse to let them travel to europe for their dental and hair appointments , you should stop them buying our luxury goods and freeze all assets of the sudanese government , " geldolf said . those immediate steps should be " followed within weeks by tougher sanctions , a no-fly zone over darfur and the deployment of a un force to impose peace , " he said . on saturday , 10 leading european thinkers and writers , including nobel literature laureates harold pinter and günter grass , urged eu leaders in an open letter to interrupt the anniversary celebrations and act to stop the bloodshed in darfur . geldof called the conflict a genocide and said it was shameful that the eu was not doing more to stop it as the bloc was born in response to world war ii and the holocaust . " it is a spurious idea that we have lots to celebrate - the sense of betrayal is much greater , " he said .
" the eu arose out of genocide and we have failed to honor that shared value . " since fighting between rebels and government-supported militias started in 2003 , approximately 200,000 people have died and 2.5 million have fled their homes .
the conflict has caused one of the world 's worst humanitarian crises . peace deal near collapse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : humanitarian help in darfur remains fragile , the un says on sunday , a fragile peace deal signed between the government and the rebel sudan liberation movement -lrb- slm -rrb- seemed ready to collapse after slm members got into a shootout with police saturday .
the shooting left approximately a dozen people dead .
the slm has threatened to resume fighting and move the conflict to the capital city of khartoum , the afp reported . " what happened reveals a will to move from peace to a state of war , " slm leader minni minnawi said .
he accused the government of provoking the incident as " an attempt by the government to sabotage the peace process . " " we are prepared to resume the war and from khartoum , if the government wants to fight , " khamis tayeb , a spokesman for the slm , told afp . the united nations ' new humanitarian chief john holmes said the humanitarian effort in darfur remains fragile .
if fighting resumes , the humanitarian crisis could worsen , holmes warned , after touring a refugee camp in sudan on sunday . " people are n't starving and health conditions are decent , " he told reporters at the camp .
" this shows the enormous humanitarian effort that has been made here for three years , but this humanitarian effort is fragile . " if the situation deteriorates , it could collapse , " he added .
" the risk is high , it is not imminent but if things deteriorate , people -lrb- aid groups -rrb- may not want to maintain their efforts , which could lead to a humanitarian collapse .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de news -pipe- 26.03.2007 opinion : a pointless resolution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un security council 's latest resolution that imposes sanctions on iran for refusing to halt its nuclear program can only make it more difficult to solve the problem , writes dw 's peter philipp . un security council sanctions used to carry ominous weight .
that no longer seems to be the case - at least in the case of iran .
for the second time in four months , tehran has been condemned because of its nuclear policy .
the country 's foreign minister , manouchehr mottaki , may condemn the latest resolution as much as he wants , but he 'll probably be right when he says that the resolution will have no effect . after long and bitter debate , the mountain has given birth to a mouse : arms trade with iran is supposed to be outlawed and the bank accounts of a few more iranians , who work in the arms and nuclear sectors , are to be frozen . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : again tehran is called on for the last time to stop enriching uranium in order to begin negotiations about a peaceful nuclear collaboration .
disregarding any visa difficulties he might have had , iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad really did n't need to bother appearing before the council : such a resolution is as toothless as it is without effect . what , for example , is meant to be achieved with an arms embargo ?
in times , when even civilian airplanes can no longer be delivered to iran , no one will openly broker arms deals with tehran .
and why should a resolution - any more than the unifil troops - be able to stop iranian arms exports to the lebanese hezbollah ? iran rejects the council 's actions as unacceptable .
as chief witnesses for their case , tehran officials could draw on some un ambassadors - such as the french one - who emphasized before the meeting that iran naturally has a right to peaceful use of nuclear power . it 's a right that includes enriching uranium as long as this only happens in low concentrations .
but that 's exactly the center of the conflict : the security council does not differentiate between enriching for energy generation and producing arms .
it simply assumed that iran is aiming for nuclear weapons without having the slightest proof for this .
it 's doubtful whether people are even convinced themselves : would they otherwise stop at freezing bank accounts and banning an arms trade that 's impossible to control ? had the case remained with the international atomic energy agency in vienna , chances for a solution would have been much better .
to make washington happy , however , it was brought before the council , which has problems to deal with it .
everyone seems to know that a solution can not be found this way and that things could get even more complicated - as the incident regarding british soldiers who were arrested after allegedly entering iranian territory shows . middle east ex per t peter philipp is deutsche welle 's chief correspondent -lrb- win -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran faces isolation as security council agrees further sanctions the un security council has slapped new sanctions on iran over its suspect nuclear program as western powers warned tehran it faced becoming even more internationally isolated .

data protection experts in the eu and the us are pushing for more security in the controversial gathering of key passenger data by us authorities from european airlines as part of measures to fight terrorism . the us and the european union are currently negotiating a permanent pact on the controversial sharing of key air passenger data which washington requires from airlines as part of heightened security measures after the september 11 terrorist attacks on new york and washington . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter schaar , germany 's top data protection official " there must be proof -lrb- that such data are useful in fighting terrorism -rrb- , there must be an independent audit or a joint review , including european data protection authorities , " german data protection commissioner peter schaar told reporters ahead of a hearing in the european parliament on monday . schaar warned that a new deal , which needs to be clinched by the end of july , might even result in a lower level of data protection than was guaranteed under previous agreements . us wants more data-sharing the us has called for more data-sharing , claiming that european privacy concerns had unreasonably hampered its counter-terrorism activities in the past few years . under the current interim pact , european air carriers are obliged to give us authorities up to 44 pieces of information on each passenger aboard america-bound flights .
the data includes credit card numbers , travel itineraries , addresses and telephone numbers . schaar said that personal data sent to us authorities should be made anonymous and the identity of their owner only be revealed if the data matched a profile in a terrorist database .
he also called for introducing a system under which data would be " pushed " to us authorities on specific request , rather than allowing the agency to " pull " the information from european airline computers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us has warned that airlines that fail to comply could face a fine a new data sharing deal has to be in place by the end of july to replace a current interim pact.however , schaar cautioned that " many , many questions remain and we are far from a solution .

data protection experts in the eu and the us are pushing for more security in the controversial gathering of key passenger data by us authorities from european airlines as part of measures to fight terrorism . the us and the european union are currently negotiating a permanent pact on the controversial sharing of key air passenger data which washington requires from airlines as part of heightened security measures after the september 11 terrorist attacks on new york and washington . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter schaar , germany 's top data protection official " there must be proof -lrb- that such data are useful in fighting terrorism -rrb- , there must be an independent audit or a joint review , including european data protection authorities , " german data protection commissioner peter schaar told reporters ahead of a hearing in the european parliament on monday . schaar warned that a new deal , which needs to be clinched by the end of july , might even result in a lower level of data protection than was guaranteed under previous agreements . us wants more data-sharing the us has called for more data-sharing , claiming that european privacy concerns had unreasonably hampered its counter-terrorism activities in the past few years . under the current interim pact , european air carriers are obliged to give us authorities up to 44 pieces of information on each passenger aboard america-bound flights .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de news -pipe- 26.03.2007 opinion : a pointless resolution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un security council 's latest resolution that imposes sanctions on iran for refusing to halt its nuclear program can only make it more difficult to solve the problem , writes dw 's peter philipp . un security council sanctions used to carry ominous weight .
that no longer seems to be the case - at least in the case of iran .
for the second time in four months , tehran has been condemned because of its nuclear policy .
the country 's foreign minister , manouchehr mottaki , may condemn the latest resolution as much as he wants , but he 'll probably be right when he says that the resolution will have no effect . after long and bitter debate , the mountain has given birth to a mouse : arms trade with iran is supposed to be outlawed and the bank accounts of a few more iranians , who work in the arms and nuclear sectors , are to be frozen . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : again tehran is called on for the last time to stop enriching uranium in order to begin negotiations about a peaceful nuclear collaboration .
disregarding any visa difficulties he might have had , iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad really did n't need to bother appearing before the council : such a resolution is as toothless as it is without effect . what , for example , is meant to be achieved with an arms embargo ?
in times , when even civilian airplanes can no longer be delivered to iran , no one will openly broker arms deals with tehran .
and why should a resolution - any more than the unifil troops - be able to stop iranian arms exports to the lebanese hezbollah ? iran rejects the council 's actions as unacceptable .
as chief witnesses for their case , tehran officials could draw on some un ambassadors - such as the french one - who emphasized before the meeting that iran naturally has a right to peaceful use of nuclear power . it 's a right that includes enriching uranium as long as this only happens in low concentrations .
but that 's exactly the center of the conflict : the security council does not differentiate between enriching for energy generation and producing arms .
it simply assumed that iran is aiming for nuclear weapons without having the slightest proof for this .
it 's doubtful whether people are even convinced themselves : would they otherwise stop at freezing bank accounts and banning an arms trade that 's impossible to control ? had the case remained with the international atomic energy agency in vienna , chances for a solution would have been much better .
to make washington happy , however , it was brought before the council , which has problems to deal with it .
everyone seems to know that a solution can not be found this way and that things could get even more complicated - as the incident regarding british soldiers who were arrested after allegedly entering iranian territory shows . middle east ex per t peter philipp is deutsche welle 's chief correspondent -lrb- win -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran faces isolation as security council agrees further sanctions the un security council has slapped new sanctions on iran over its suspect nuclear program as western powers warned tehran it faced becoming even more internationally isolated .
-lrb- 25.03.2007 -rrb- britain searching for answers as troops remain held in iran international pressure mounted on iran on sunday to free 15 british naval personnel but british authorities admitted they do not know where the group are being held .

however , porsche revealed it had no immediate plans to absorb vw . in a statement , porsche - volkswagen 's largest shareholder - said it had exercised an option on 3.5 percent of vw 's shares to increase its 27.3 percent stake in europe 's biggest carmaker to 30.8 percent .
it will cost porsche an estimated 1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.34 billion -rrb- under german law , a 30-percent stake in a company obliges the holder to make a full takeover bid .
the shares would be transferred on wednesday . the move by porsche , which has been rumored for some time , seems to be an effort to protect vw from a hostile raid from another source . porsche to keep vw in german hands bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wiedeking wants to protect vw from foreign takeover in an interview with the bild newspaper published on monday , porsche 's ceo wendelin wiedeking said : " if a hedge fund dismantled vw and sold that on the stock market , we would lose our most important partner .
we can not let that happen , that 's why we acted . " the timing is significant because a european court is expected to rule soon against a german law dating from 1960 which caps the voting rights of shareholders at 20 percent , even if they own a greater share . on feb .
13 , the advocate general of the european court of justice advised that the law was incompatible with eu treaties guaranteeing the free movement of capital , and the court itself is certain to follow his advice later this year . the move by porsche to raise its stake also confirms its desire to tighten its control of a company with which it has close historical and industrial links .
porsche and vw developed the cayenne and touareg four-wheel-drive models in a joint venture , and two senior porsche executives sit on the vw board .
porsche 's increased stake will also protect vw from any foreign takeover . increased stake but no immediate takeover plans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : porsche is the largest but not the majority shareholder however , while analysts believe that the move signals porsche 's intent to lay the groundwork for an eventual takeover or merger involving vw , the company itself made it clear that it had no intention of acquiring a majority stake in vw . " we do not expect many volkswagen shareholders to offer us their shares , which means simply that we intend to go to 31 percent , " a spokesman said in a statement .
" we do not by any means intend to take over . " porsche is offering other shareholders 100.92 euros -lrb- $ -rrb- per share , 14 percent less than the € 117.70 closing price on friday which values the vw group at 33 billion euros . wiedeking said that as the global car market gets increasingly and fiercely competitive , the move to bolster the ability of both groups to meet the challenges of the industry was " a logical step .

" this forms the basis for enel 's development on the european electricity market , " said enel chief fulvio conti following the announcement of his company 's pact with acciona . while e.on 's latest bid values endesa at 42.4 billion euros , the enel-acciona offer would bring endesa 's value to 43.4 billion euros . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : e.on chief wulf bernotat is confident their offer will be accepted e.on chief wulf bernotat said his company was " convinced that our increased offer at 40 euros a share will be the only one for endesa in the foreseeable future . " a new force in the global energy market a tie-up between endesa and e.on would create a new force in the global energy market with more than 22 million customers and a business empire stretching from europe , through to the us and south america . e.on , however , needs at least 50 percent for its bid to succeed .
analysts believe that e.on faces an uphill battle to secure control of endesa as enel and acciona together already hold about a 46 per cent stake in endesa . under their takeover plan , acciona would raise its stake in endesa to 50.1 per cent , while enel would hold the rest . the cnmv ruled friday that enel and acciona could not launch a bid for six months after the e.on bid expires and gave e.on until monday to improve its offer . however , acciona told the cnmv that the joint bid with enel would be launched as soon as " legally possible . "
the cnmv is to due to issue a new ruling on the acciona-enel proposed bid before markets open in spain on tuesday . e.on takes legal action against rivals but with tensions surrounding the endesa battle rising , e.on hit back launching legal moves against enel and acciona monday and calling on the cnmv to mount action against the two companies for market disruption , breaching tender offer rules , and insider trading . at the same time , e.on said that acciona and enel should be forced to divest their shareholdings in endesa and be prohibited from buying up any endesa shares . the german company also commenced court action in new york against acciona and enel , claiming that two companies had breached us disclosure rules . in a strongly worded statement , e.on lashed out at acciona and enel accusing them of " unlawful actions " which it said " were an attempt to deceive endesa 's shareholders and to manipulate the market price of endesa stock . " this is the third time that e.on has been forced to raise it bid since launching its takeover push in february 2006 . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de e.on calls for european energy market , lowers endesa bid the head of germany 's largest energy concern , e.on , has called for a european energy market , grouping germany and six of its neighbors .

the african continent has been the object of numerous broken promises and has reason to be skeptical , according to reinhard hermle , former head of the association of german development non-governmental organizations . he said he remembers the 2001 meeting in gleneagles , where he and other participants agreed to invest $ 50 billion in development aid .
half of that aid was intended for africa , but hermle said that remains a goal from which " we are still very far . " " chancellor schröder had promised to spend 0.51 percent of the german gross social product on development aid by 2010 , " he said .
" now we are at 0.36 percent , but we are observing that much of what is being included in calculations does not result in money reaching africa . " one example of creative bookkeeping , according to hermle , was pointless debt relief for iraq from which the country did not benefit because it had already stopped servicing its debts . poverty decline spread unevenly bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few african nations are likely to halve poverty by 2015 similar statistical effects could also be employed with the un 's millennium development goals , to which 189 un member states agreed to cut in half the number of people living on less than $ 1 per day . it 's a goal hermle said would likely be achieved due to improving economic conditions in a few nations with large populations . " highly populated countries like india and china are making large economic progress , " he said , adding that when the countries ' total population of 2.5 billion is projected on the world 's population the goal of cutting poverty in half can be reached .
" but it is a statistical trick . " while the absolute number of people living in poverty will drop by 50 percent , few african nations will be able to claim poverty dropped in their country by the same rate , hermle said . working with emerging nations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : money helps but can not solve all africa 's problems , eid said representatives from brazil , india , mexico and south africa will be present at the meeting of g8 nations , made up of canada , france , germany , italy , japan , russia , the united kingdom and the united states , for the first time . the emerging countries ' presence is due to their increasing international political and economic influence that in turn has led to shift in international politics , according to german development minster heidemarie wieczorek-zeul , who is chairing the berlin summit . she said the countries ' increased influence could lead to triangle partnerships with a g8 member pairing with an emerging country to provide development aid for a third country . " one should shape the reformed partnerships with developing and emerging countries to answer the question of what changes to the partnership are necessary and what help we can provide , " eid said .
" we are focused on democratization , social reforms and economic growth . " more money needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wieczorek-zeul said new types of cooperation are required the tasks facing the industrialized world are clear , according to hermle . " more money has to be made available , " he said .
" the cooperation between north and south has to be improved .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the european union turns 50 the day the eu was born eu leaders adopt 50th anniversary berlin declaration founding fathers : europeans behind the union text of the berlin declaration to mark 50 years of the eu europe -pipe- 26.03.2007 eu ponders more questions than answers amid celebrations großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the berlin declaration set out plans for the eu 's future but how much is it really worth ?
the european union celebrated its 50th birthday on sunday , but critics said a much publicized statement marking the occasion papers over the cracks and the divisive differences over how to meet new challenges . the blueprint for the future was contained in a berlin declaration signed by chancellor angela merkel during an informal gathering with the other 26 eu leaders in the german capital . while the two-page document proudly noted the progress made since the eu was founded , it avoided mentioning controversial issues like the bloc 's christian roots , enlargement and the eu constitution . instead there were general references to fighting " terrorism , organized crime and illegal immigration together , " as well as intentions to " jointly lead the way in energy policy and climate protection . " but it fell a long way short of " the creative madness " which italian premier romano prodi said was needed by the eu to show that the world can be changed . party snubs and enlargement fatigue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey was unhappy at not being invited to the party accession candidates like turkey had complained in advance about prospective newcomers not being invited to the birthday party , saying " it would have been meaningful , in terms of demonstrating once again the unity of the european family . " this unity has given way to " enlargement fatigue " in countries like germany where polls show there is little appetite to take on more members after the 12 mostly eastern european nations that have joined since 2004 . but other states like ireland and britain are in favor of newcomers joining the bloc , which has seen its population balloon to nearly 500 million since the founding treaty of rome was signed in 1957 . the german chancellor said the eu has become so big that it needs to take on a new role to become more effective .
a constitution is the best way to achieve this , she believes . resuscitating the treaty , which has been on ice since its rejection by french and dutch voters in 2005 , was so divisive that it was omitted from the berlin declaration altogether . merkel dedicated to eu constitution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is leading the championing of the constitution merkel hopes to present a road map on how to proceed with the treaty before germany 's six-month presidency of the union expires at the end of june . " we are united in our aim of placing the european union on a renewed common basis before the european parliament elections in 2009 , " was the compromise formula that appeared in the berlin declaration . while merkel would like to keep the " substance " of the moribund 485-page constitution , objections have come from britain , poland and the czech republic , among others . britain opposes surrendering control of its foreign policy to an eu foreign minister , while the czech republic believes the target date of 2009 , when it will hold the eu presidency , is too early . poland fears it is unfairly treated in the proposed voting system in the treaty , which gives votes according to population , thus making germany the major beneficiary in decision-making issues because it is europe 's biggest nation . critics say declaration ignores real problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is still a lot of work to be done " the real problem issues are just being postponed , " said daniela schwarzer , a senior fellow at the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- . if merkel insists on having the treaty ready by 2009 the differences will have to be sorted out by the end of this year , according to german television analyst udo van kampen . this is because the document will need to be ratified by all 27 national parliaments , a cumbersome process that could take as long as 18 months . failure to do this could revive the discussion of a two-speed europe , with one group pressing ahead with political and economic union ahead of the rest . however , the german presidency remains optimistic and insists " the goal remains a constitution , " effectively dismissing suggestions that some kind of watered-down document that addresses only the administrative difficulties would suffice . the berlin declaration did not please pope benedict xvi , who said that europe was facing an identity crisis because of policies which had also resulted in a low birthrate . the pontiff was especially critical of the fact that there was no reference to europe being a christian community , something which was left out of the berlin declaration despite objections from poland . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu leaders adopt 50th anniversary berlin declaration european union leaders adopted sunday a 50th anniversary declaration setting 2009 as the deadline for preparing a new treaty , following the failure of the bloc 's constitution .

the european union celebrated its 50th birthday on sunday , but critics said a much publicized statement marking the occasion papers over the cracks and the divisive differences over how to meet new challenges . the blueprint for the future was contained in a berlin declaration signed by chancellor angela merkel during an informal gathering with the other 26 eu leaders in the german capital . while the two-page document proudly noted the progress made since the eu was founded , it avoided mentioning controversial issues like the bloc 's christian roots , enlargement and the eu constitution . instead there were general references to fighting " terrorism , organized crime and illegal immigration together , " as well as intentions to " jointly lead the way in energy policy and climate protection . " but it fell a long way short of " the creative madness " which italian premier romano prodi said was needed by the eu to show that the world can be changed . party snubs and enlargement fatigue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey was unhappy at not being invited to the party accession candidates like turkey had complained in advance about prospective newcomers not being invited to the birthday party , saying " it would have been meaningful , in terms of demonstrating once again the unity of the european family . " this unity has given way to " enlargement fatigue " in countries like germany where polls show there is little appetite to take on more members after the 12 mostly eastern european nations that have joined since 2004 . but other states like ireland and britain are in favor of newcomers joining the bloc , which has seen its population balloon to nearly 500 million since the founding treaty of rome was signed in 1957 . the german chancellor said the eu has become so big that it needs to take on a new role to become more effective .
a constitution is the best way to achieve this , she believes . resuscitating the treaty , which has been on ice since its rejection by french and dutch voters in 2005 , was so divisive that it was omitted from the berlin declaration altogether . merkel dedicated to eu constitution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is leading the championing of the constitution merkel hopes to present a road map on how to proceed with the treaty before germany 's six-month presidency of the union expires at the end of june .

now , after the sniping between animal-lovers and irate farmers has died down , the struggle has become a political row between germany and italy over ownership . bruno began his fateful last journey from the adamello-brenta nature reserve in italy 's northern trentino region last spring , where italian authorities recently reintroduced his species .
ambling off as wild bears are wont to do , bruno unknowingly crossed the alpine border , first into austria and then germany where he was shot dead last summer . and this is where the problem lies .
the state of bavaria says that bruno should be laid to rest where he died , while the italian environment minister alfonso scanio wants the corpse back in trentino .

schnappauf has said that it does n't matter how many times gabriel passes on scanio 's demands .
the legal situation is unquestionable .
" an animal born in the wilderness belongs to the land in which it dies , " he says . the italians strongly disagree .

while schnappauf has n't actually gone as far as saying those actual words , it is believed that the munich museum is already being lined up to take the corpse . the bavarians seem confident that bruno will stay with them while the italians will not take no for an answer .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de news -pipe- 26.03.2007 opinion : a pointless resolution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un security council 's latest resolution that imposes sanctions on iran for refusing to halt its nuclear program can only make it more difficult to solve the problem , writes dw 's peter philipp . un security council sanctions used to carry ominous weight .
that no longer seems to be the case - at least in the case of iran .
for the second time in four months , tehran has been condemned because of its nuclear policy .
the country 's foreign minister , manouchehr mottaki , may condemn the latest resolution as much as he wants , but he 'll probably be right when he says that the resolution will have no effect . after long and bitter debate , the mountain has given birth to a mouse : arms trade with iran is supposed to be outlawed and the bank accounts of a few more iranians , who work in the arms and nuclear sectors , are to be frozen . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : again tehran is called on for the last time to stop enriching uranium in order to begin negotiations about a peaceful nuclear collaboration .
disregarding any visa difficulties he might have had , iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad really did n't need to bother appearing before the council : such a resolution is as toothless as it is without effect . what , for example , is meant to be achieved with an arms embargo ?
in times , when even civilian airplanes can no longer be delivered to iran , no one will openly broker arms deals with tehran .
and why should a resolution - any more than the unifil troops - be able to stop iranian arms exports to the lebanese hezbollah ? iran rejects the council 's actions as unacceptable .
as chief witnesses for their case , tehran officials could draw on some un ambassadors - such as the french one - who emphasized before the meeting that iran naturally has a right to peaceful use of nuclear power . it 's a right that includes enriching uranium as long as this only happens in low concentrations .
but that 's exactly the center of the conflict : the security council does not differentiate between enriching for energy generation and producing arms .

that no longer seems to be the case - at least in the case of iran .
for the second time in four months , tehran has been condemned because of its nuclear policy .
the country 's foreign minister , manouchehr mottaki , may condemn the latest resolution as much as he wants , but he 'll probably be right when he says that the resolution will have no effect . after long and bitter debate , the mountain has given birth to a mouse : arms trade with iran is supposed to be outlawed and the bank accounts of a few more iranians , who work in the arms and nuclear sectors , are to be frozen . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : again tehran is called on for the last time to stop enriching uranium in order to begin negotiations about a peaceful nuclear collaboration .
disregarding any visa difficulties he might have had , iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad really did n't need to bother appearing before the council : such a resolution is as toothless as it is without effect . what , for example , is meant to be achieved with an arms embargo ?
in times , when even civilian airplanes can no longer be delivered to iran , no one will openly broker arms deals with tehran .
and why should a resolution - any more than the unifil troops - be able to stop iranian arms exports to the lebanese hezbollah ? iran rejects the council 's actions as unacceptable .
as chief witnesses for their case , tehran officials could draw on some un ambassadors - such as the french one - who emphasized before the meeting that iran naturally has a right to peaceful use of nuclear power . it 's a right that includes enriching uranium as long as this only happens in low concentrations .
but that 's exactly the center of the conflict : the security council does not differentiate between enriching for energy generation and producing arms .

data protection experts in the eu and the us are pushing for more security in the controversial gathering of key passenger data by us authorities from european airlines as part of measures to fight terrorism . the us and the european union are currently negotiating a permanent pact on the controversial sharing of key air passenger data which washington requires from airlines as part of heightened security measures after the september 11 terrorist attacks on new york and washington . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter schaar , germany 's top data protection official " there must be proof -lrb- that such data are useful in fighting terrorism -rrb- , there must be an independent audit or a joint review , including european data protection authorities , " german data protection commissioner peter schaar told reporters ahead of a hearing in the european parliament on monday . schaar warned that a new deal , which needs to be clinched by the end of july , might even result in a lower level of data protection than was guaranteed under previous agreements . us wants more data-sharing the us has called for more data-sharing , claiming that european privacy concerns had unreasonably hampered its counter-terrorism activities in the past few years . under the current interim pact , european air carriers are obliged to give us authorities up to 44 pieces of information on each passenger aboard america-bound flights .
the data includes credit card numbers , travel itineraries , addresses and telephone numbers . schaar said that personal data sent to us authorities should be made anonymous and the identity of their owner only be revealed if the data matched a profile in a terrorist database .
he also called for introducing a system under which data would be " pushed " to us authorities on specific request , rather than allowing the agency to " pull " the information from european airline computers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us has warned that airlines that fail to comply could face a fine a new data sharing deal has to be in place by the end of july to replace a current interim pact.however , schaar cautioned that " many , many questions remain and we are far from a solution . " washington has warned that airlines which failed to share passenger data would face fines of up to $ 6,000 per passenger and a possible loss of landing rights . " philosophical confusion " greek socialist mep stavros lambrinidis , vice-chair of the eu parliament 's civil liberties committee , said that the transatlantic privacy quarrels were signs of a " philosophical confusion between the eu and the us concerning terrorism .

" we are worried about the kind and quantity of data that is collected and we are concerned about how this data is used . " lambrinidis added that the eu should not only be concerned about data protection , " but also see if the data are really necessary , appropriate and important " in fighting terrorism . schaar added that a new transatlantic air passenger data deal could be challenged by national courts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : passengers flying to the us have to undergo stringent security checks the concerns were echoed by american data protection experts .
marc rotenberg , executive director and president of the electronic privacy information center in washington said in the european parliament that his group had always insisted on data protection for travelers and visitors but said that to date , persons who are not us citizens or do not have a residence permit for the country , are not afforded any protection . reconciling civil liberties with war on terror agreement on a new deal on sharing passenger data was required after the eu 's top court annulled an earlier transatlantic accord on air passenger data exchange .
however , the court 's objections related to the legal basis of the pact , not its actual contents . the eu and the us are increasingly at odds over how to reconcile civil liberties with the us-led fight against terrorism . european lawmakers have warned repeatedly that the privacy rights of eu citizens are currently unprotected against mistakes or abuse by us authorities . brussels and washington are also at loggerheads over a secret agreement between the us treasury and the belgium-based money transfer company swift , which has supplied us authorities with personal data for use in counter-terror inquiries . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu , us move closer to permanent deal of passenger data german interior minister wolfgang schäuble and us homeland security secretary michael chertoff met in berlin friday .

analysts believe that e.on faces an uphill battle to secure control of endesa as enel and acciona together already hold about a 46 per cent stake in endesa . under their takeover plan , acciona would raise its stake in endesa to 50.1 per cent , while enel would hold the rest . the cnmv ruled friday that enel and acciona could not launch a bid for six months after the e.on bid expires and gave e.on until monday to improve its offer . however , acciona told the cnmv that the joint bid with enel would be launched as soon as " legally possible .

if fighting resumes , the humanitarian crisis could worsen , holmes warned , after touring a refugee camp in sudan on sunday . " people are n't starving and health conditions are decent , " he told reporters at the camp .
" this shows the enormous humanitarian effort that has been made here for three years , but this humanitarian effort is fragile . " if the situation deteriorates , it could collapse , " he added .

the fair offers intimate book browsing and prides itself in connecting readers of all ages to their favorite authors . at the leipzig book fair , families strolled through the bright fairgrounds , checking out the 2,348 exhibitors from 36 countries .
the fair , held in modern buildings outside the eastern german city of leipzig , has emerged as europe 's largest literary festival for author readings and events . organizer wolfgang marzin could n't have been happier with the fair , which ended sunday . " we had the nicest book fair , " marzin said .
" it 's the most peaceful and reader-friendly book fair . " finding an audience bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children settle down to read germany hosts two large book fairs each year .
the trade fair in frankfurt is the undisputed king of the book fair scene .
leipzig does not even strive to compete with frankfurt , but instead has established its own identity , especially with its popular concept , " leipzig reads . "
unlike frankfurt , which is geared towards trade professionals , leipzig generates much of its business from the general public . in the evenings , readings are offered around town in bookshops , cafes or at city hall .
there are appearances by famous authors such as nobel-prize winning german author günter grass . the fair has focused on attracting readers of all ages and exposing them to many different genres of literature . a young girl showed her delight while browsing picture books about horses , farms and fire trucks .
her younger brother slept in his stroller and their mother laughed at the costumed manga comic fans behind her . " there are simply things going on here , " she said .
" that 's cool . " getting young people to attend the fair is a central goal of the organizers , marzin said .
exhausted kids can be found sprawled on the floor of the central glass hall . german books take center stage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's no shortage of books in leipzig leipzig has a long tradition of printing and book trade .
after world war ii and the division of germany , leipzig became a focal point for east-west publishers .
after german reunification in 1990 , many publishing houses in the former east germany shut down or integrated into west german ones .
a year later , the leipzig book fair started . the fair focuses on german language books , introducing up-and-coming authors from central and eastern europe to the german market . the relaxed atmosphere is the secret to what makes this fair popular .
the laid back pace makes it easy for fairgoers to stumble across literary jewels . " you discover all the types of books here , ones that you ca n't find in the little bookstore in our town and ones you ca n't track down on the internet .
here you have them all in front of you , " a woman said . the next leipzig book fair will take place from march 13 to march 16 2008 . silke bartlick -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a bridge between literature and cinema how do you turn a book into a movie ?

the african continent has been the object of numerous broken promises and has reason to be skeptical , according to reinhard hermle , former head of the association of german development non-governmental organizations . he said he remembers the 2001 meeting in gleneagles , where he and other participants agreed to invest $ 50 billion in development aid .
half of that aid was intended for africa , but hermle said that remains a goal from which " we are still very far . " " chancellor schröder had promised to spend 0.51 percent of the german gross social product on development aid by 2010 , " he said .
" now we are at 0.36 percent , but we are observing that much of what is being included in calculations does not result in money reaching africa . " one example of creative bookkeeping , according to hermle , was pointless debt relief for iraq from which the country did not benefit because it had already stopped servicing its debts . poverty decline spread unevenly bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few african nations are likely to halve poverty by 2015 similar statistical effects could also be employed with the un 's millennium development goals , to which 189 un member states agreed to cut in half the number of people living on less than $ 1 per day . it 's a goal hermle said would likely be achieved due to improving economic conditions in a few nations with large populations . " highly populated countries like india and china are making large economic progress , " he said , adding that when the countries ' total population of 2.5 billion is projected on the world 's population the goal of cutting poverty in half can be reached .
" but it is a statistical trick .

" one should shape the reformed partnerships with developing and emerging countries to answer the question of what changes to the partnership are necessary and what help we can provide , " eid said .

data protection experts in the eu and the us are pushing for more security in the controversial gathering of key passenger data by us authorities from european airlines as part of measures to fight terrorism . the us and the european union are currently negotiating a permanent pact on the controversial sharing of key air passenger data which washington requires from airlines as part of heightened security measures after the september 11 terrorist attacks on new york and washington . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter schaar , germany 's top data protection official " there must be proof -lrb- that such data are useful in fighting terrorism -rrb- , there must be an independent audit or a joint review , including european data protection authorities , " german data protection commissioner peter schaar told reporters ahead of a hearing in the european parliament on monday . schaar warned that a new deal , which needs to be clinched by the end of july , might even result in a lower level of data protection than was guaranteed under previous agreements . us wants more data-sharing the us has called for more data-sharing , claiming that european privacy concerns had unreasonably hampered its counter-terrorism activities in the past few years . under the current interim pact , european air carriers are obliged to give us authorities up to 44 pieces of information on each passenger aboard america-bound flights .
the data includes credit card numbers , travel itineraries , addresses and telephone numbers . schaar said that personal data sent to us authorities should be made anonymous and the identity of their owner only be revealed if the data matched a profile in a terrorist database .
he also called for introducing a system under which data would be " pushed " to us authorities on specific request , rather than allowing the agency to " pull " the information from european airline computers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us has warned that airlines that fail to comply could face a fine a new data sharing deal has to be in place by the end of july to replace a current interim pact.however , schaar cautioned that " many , many questions remain and we are far from a solution . " washington has warned that airlines which failed to share passenger data would face fines of up to $ 6,000 per passenger and a possible loss of landing rights . " philosophical confusion " greek socialist mep stavros lambrinidis , vice-chair of the eu parliament 's civil liberties committee , said that the transatlantic privacy quarrels were signs of a " philosophical confusion between the eu and the us concerning terrorism . " " we have to look for a general understanding with the us on what is necessary to catch terrorists , " lambrinidis said .
" we are worried about the kind and quantity of data that is collected and we are concerned about how this data is used . " lambrinidis added that the eu should not only be concerned about data protection , " but also see if the data are really necessary , appropriate and important " in fighting terrorism . schaar added that a new transatlantic air passenger data deal could be challenged by national courts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : passengers flying to the us have to undergo stringent security checks the concerns were echoed by american data protection experts .
marc rotenberg , executive director and president of the electronic privacy information center in washington said in the european parliament that his group had always insisted on data protection for travelers and visitors but said that to date , persons who are not us citizens or do not have a residence permit for the country , are not afforded any protection . reconciling civil liberties with war on terror agreement on a new deal on sharing passenger data was required after the eu 's top court annulled an earlier transatlantic accord on air passenger data exchange .
however , the court 's objections related to the legal basis of the pact , not its actual contents . the eu and the us are increasingly at odds over how to reconcile civil liberties with the us-led fight against terrorism . european lawmakers have warned repeatedly that the privacy rights of eu citizens are currently unprotected against mistakes or abuse by us authorities . brussels and washington are also at loggerheads over a secret agreement between the us treasury and the belgium-based money transfer company swift , which has supplied us authorities with personal data for use in counter-terror inquiries . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu , us move closer to permanent deal of passenger data german interior minister wolfgang schäuble and us homeland security secretary michael chertoff met in berlin friday .

the data includes credit card numbers , travel itineraries , addresses and telephone numbers . schaar said that personal data sent to us authorities should be made anonymous and the identity of their owner only be revealed if the data matched a profile in a terrorist database .
he also called for introducing a system under which data would be " pushed " to us authorities on specific request , rather than allowing the agency to " pull " the information from european airline computers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us has warned that airlines that fail to comply could face a fine a new data sharing deal has to be in place by the end of july to replace a current interim pact.however , schaar cautioned that " many , many questions remain and we are far from a solution .

the african continent has been the object of numerous broken promises and has reason to be skeptical , according to reinhard hermle , former head of the association of german development non-governmental organizations . he said he remembers the 2001 meeting in gleneagles , where he and other participants agreed to invest $ 50 billion in development aid .
half of that aid was intended for africa , but hermle said that remains a goal from which " we are still very far . " " chancellor schröder had promised to spend 0.51 percent of the german gross social product on development aid by 2010 , " he said .
" now we are at 0.36 percent , but we are observing that much of what is being included in calculations does not result in money reaching africa . " one example of creative bookkeeping , according to hermle , was pointless debt relief for iraq from which the country did not benefit because it had already stopped servicing its debts . poverty decline spread unevenly bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few african nations are likely to halve poverty by 2015 similar statistical effects could also be employed with the un 's millennium development goals , to which 189 un member states agreed to cut in half the number of people living on less than $ 1 per day . it 's a goal hermle said would likely be achieved due to improving economic conditions in a few nations with large populations . " highly populated countries like india and china are making large economic progress , " he said , adding that when the countries ' total population of 2.5 billion is projected on the world 's population the goal of cutting poverty in half can be reached .
" but it is a statistical trick . " while the absolute number of people living in poverty will drop by 50 percent , few african nations will be able to claim poverty dropped in their country by the same rate , hermle said . working with emerging nations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : money helps but can not solve all africa 's problems , eid said representatives from brazil , india , mexico and south africa will be present at the meeting of g8 nations , made up of canada , france , germany , italy , japan , russia , the united kingdom and the united states , for the first time . the emerging countries ' presence is due to their increasing international political and economic influence that in turn has led to shift in international politics , according to german development minster heidemarie wieczorek-zeul , who is chairing the berlin summit . she said the countries ' increased influence could lead to triangle partnerships with a g8 member pairing with an emerging country to provide development aid for a third country . " one should shape the reformed partnerships with developing and emerging countries to answer the question of what changes to the partnership are necessary and what help we can provide , " eid said .
" we are focused on democratization , social reforms and economic growth . " more money needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wieczorek-zeul said new types of cooperation are required the tasks facing the industrialized world are clear , according to hermle . " more money has to be made available , " he said .
" the cooperation between north and south has to be improved .
the donor countries have to coordinate better , it should not be that every rich country runs its own bilateral development policy .
coordination reduces costs and makes the aid more efficient . " much , however , will also depend on african governments ' will to change and open to investment , eid added . " to say that development cooperation can fundamentally solve africa 's problems is wrong , " she said . ina rottscheidt -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel : eu needs to do more to combat aids against a backdrop 40 million hiv infections around the world , eu officials met in bremen to discuss measures to combat the pandemic .

now , after the sniping between animal-lovers and irate farmers has died down , the struggle has become a political row between germany and italy over ownership . bruno began his fateful last journey from the adamello-brenta nature reserve in italy 's northern trentino region last spring , where italian authorities recently reintroduced his species .
ambling off as wild bears are wont to do , bruno unknowingly crossed the alpine border , first into austria and then germany where he was shot dead last summer . and this is where the problem lies .
the state of bavaria says that bruno should be laid to rest where he died , while the italian environment minister alfonso scanio wants the corpse back in trentino .
at the moment , bruno is on ice at an undisclosed secure location somewhere in bavaria - but for how long ? fur flies in carcass tug-of-war bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bear necessity : everyone wants a piece of bruno scanio appears to be a man who will not rest until he gets his bear .
he continues to lobby his german counterpart sigmar gabriel for his support in getting bruno repatriated , who in turn has " passed on " the italian 's wishes a number of times to werner schnappauf , bavaria 's minister of the environment . however , schnappauf is having none of it : the bear stays here , he says - and has told gabriel many times that the increasingly aggressive requests from the italians for the return of the corpse have " no judicial basis . "
schnappauf has said that it does n't matter how many times gabriel passes on scanio 's demands .

the european union celebrated its 50th birthday on sunday , but critics said a much publicized statement marking the occasion papers over the cracks and the divisive differences over how to meet new challenges . the blueprint for the future was contained in a berlin declaration signed by chancellor angela merkel during an informal gathering with the other 26 eu leaders in the german capital . while the two-page document proudly noted the progress made since the eu was founded , it avoided mentioning controversial issues like the bloc 's christian roots , enlargement and the eu constitution . instead there were general references to fighting " terrorism , organized crime and illegal immigration together , " as well as intentions to " jointly lead the way in energy policy and climate protection . " but it fell a long way short of " the creative madness " which italian premier romano prodi said was needed by the eu to show that the world can be changed . party snubs and enlargement fatigue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey was unhappy at not being invited to the party accession candidates like turkey had complained in advance about prospective newcomers not being invited to the birthday party , saying " it would have been meaningful , in terms of demonstrating once again the unity of the european family . " this unity has given way to " enlargement fatigue " in countries like germany where polls show there is little appetite to take on more members after the 12 mostly eastern european nations that have joined since 2004 . but other states like ireland and britain are in favor of newcomers joining the bloc , which has seen its population balloon to nearly 500 million since the founding treaty of rome was signed in 1957 . the german chancellor said the eu has become so big that it needs to take on a new role to become more effective .
a constitution is the best way to achieve this , she believes . resuscitating the treaty , which has been on ice since its rejection by french and dutch voters in 2005 , was so divisive that it was omitted from the berlin declaration altogether . merkel dedicated to eu constitution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is leading the championing of the constitution merkel hopes to present a road map on how to proceed with the treaty before germany 's six-month presidency of the union expires at the end of june . " we are united in our aim of placing the european union on a renewed common basis before the european parliament elections in 2009 , " was the compromise formula that appeared in the berlin declaration . while merkel would like to keep the " substance " of the moribund 485-page constitution , objections have come from britain , poland and the czech republic , among others . britain opposes surrendering control of its foreign policy to an eu foreign minister , while the czech republic believes the target date of 2009 , when it will hold the eu presidency , is too early . poland fears it is unfairly treated in the proposed voting system in the treaty , which gives votes according to population , thus making germany the major beneficiary in decision-making issues because it is europe 's biggest nation . critics say declaration ignores real problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is still a lot of work to be done " the real problem issues are just being postponed , " said daniela schwarzer , a senior fellow at the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- . if merkel insists on having the treaty ready by 2009 the differences will have to be sorted out by the end of this year , according to german television analyst udo van kampen . this is because the document will need to be ratified by all 27 national parliaments , a cumbersome process that could take as long as 18 months . failure to do this could revive the discussion of a two-speed europe , with one group pressing ahead with political and economic union ahead of the rest . however , the german presidency remains optimistic and insists " the goal remains a constitution , " effectively dismissing suggestions that some kind of watered-down document that addresses only the administrative difficulties would suffice . the berlin declaration did not please pope benedict xvi , who said that europe was facing an identity crisis because of policies which had also resulted in a low birthrate . the pontiff was especially critical of the fact that there was no reference to europe being a christian community , something which was left out of the berlin declaration despite objections from poland . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu leaders adopt 50th anniversary berlin declaration european union leaders adopted sunday a 50th anniversary declaration setting 2009 as the deadline for preparing a new treaty , following the failure of the bloc 's constitution .

however , porsche revealed it had no immediate plans to absorb vw . in a statement , porsche - volkswagen 's largest shareholder - said it had exercised an option on 3.5 percent of vw 's shares to increase its 27.3 percent stake in europe 's biggest carmaker to 30.8 percent .
it will cost porsche an estimated 1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.34 billion -rrb- under german law , a 30-percent stake in a company obliges the holder to make a full takeover bid .
the shares would be transferred on wednesday . the move by porsche , which has been rumored for some time , seems to be an effort to protect vw from a hostile raid from another source . porsche to keep vw in german hands bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wiedeking wants to protect vw from foreign takeover in an interview with the bild newspaper published on monday , porsche 's ceo wendelin wiedeking said : " if a hedge fund dismantled vw and sold that on the stock market , we would lose our most important partner .
we can not let that happen , that 's why we acted . " the timing is significant because a european court is expected to rule soon against a german law dating from 1960 which caps the voting rights of shareholders at 20 percent , even if they own a greater share . on feb .
13 , the advocate general of the european court of justice advised that the law was incompatible with eu treaties guaranteeing the free movement of capital , and the court itself is certain to follow his advice later this year . the move by porsche to raise its stake also confirms its desire to tighten its control of a company with which it has close historical and industrial links .
porsche and vw developed the cayenne and touareg four-wheel-drive models in a joint venture , and two senior porsche executives sit on the vw board .
porsche 's increased stake will also protect vw from any foreign takeover . increased stake but no immediate takeover plans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : porsche is the largest but not the majority shareholder however , while analysts believe that the move signals porsche 's intent to lay the groundwork for an eventual takeover or merger involving vw , the company itself made it clear that it had no intention of acquiring a majority stake in vw . " we do not expect many volkswagen shareholders to offer us their shares , which means simply that we intend to go to 31 percent , " a spokesman said in a statement .
" we do not by any means intend to take over . " porsche is offering other shareholders 100.92 euros -lrb- $ -rrb- per share , 14 percent less than the € 117.70 closing price on friday which values the vw group at 33 billion euros . wiedeking said that as the global car market gets increasingly and fiercely competitive , the move to bolster the ability of both groups to meet the challenges of the industry was " a logical step .

the european union celebrated its 50th birthday on sunday , but critics said a much publicized statement marking the occasion papers over the cracks and the divisive differences over how to meet new challenges . the blueprint for the future was contained in a berlin declaration signed by chancellor angela merkel during an informal gathering with the other 26 eu leaders in the german capital . while the two-page document proudly noted the progress made since the eu was founded , it avoided mentioning controversial issues like the bloc 's christian roots , enlargement and the eu constitution . instead there were general references to fighting " terrorism , organized crime and illegal immigration together , " as well as intentions to " jointly lead the way in energy policy and climate protection . " but it fell a long way short of " the creative madness " which italian premier romano prodi said was needed by the eu to show that the world can be changed . party snubs and enlargement fatigue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey was unhappy at not being invited to the party accession candidates like turkey had complained in advance about prospective newcomers not being invited to the birthday party , saying " it would have been meaningful , in terms of demonstrating once again the unity of the european family .

however , porsche revealed it had no immediate plans to absorb vw . in a statement , porsche - volkswagen 's largest shareholder - said it had exercised an option on 3.5 percent of vw 's shares to increase its 27.3 percent stake in europe 's biggest carmaker to 30.8 percent .
it will cost porsche an estimated 1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.34 billion -rrb- under german law , a 30-percent stake in a company obliges the holder to make a full takeover bid .
the shares would be transferred on wednesday . the move by porsche , which has been rumored for some time , seems to be an effort to protect vw from a hostile raid from another source . porsche to keep vw in german hands bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wiedeking wants to protect vw from foreign takeover in an interview with the bild newspaper published on monday , porsche 's ceo wendelin wiedeking said : " if a hedge fund dismantled vw and sold that on the stock market , we would lose our most important partner .
we can not let that happen , that 's why we acted . " the timing is significant because a european court is expected to rule soon against a german law dating from 1960 which caps the voting rights of shareholders at 20 percent , even if they own a greater share . on feb .
13 , the advocate general of the european court of justice advised that the law was incompatible with eu treaties guaranteeing the free movement of capital , and the court itself is certain to follow his advice later this year . the move by porsche to raise its stake also confirms its desire to tighten its control of a company with which it has close historical and industrial links .
porsche and vw developed the cayenne and touareg four-wheel-drive models in a joint venture , and two senior porsche executives sit on the vw board .
porsche 's increased stake will also protect vw from any foreign takeover . increased stake but no immediate takeover plans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : porsche is the largest but not the majority shareholder however , while analysts believe that the move signals porsche 's intent to lay the groundwork for an eventual takeover or merger involving vw , the company itself made it clear that it had no intention of acquiring a majority stake in vw . " we do not expect many volkswagen shareholders to offer us their shares , which means simply that we intend to go to 31 percent , " a spokesman said in a statement .
" we do not by any means intend to take over . " porsche is offering other shareholders 100.92 euros -lrb- $ -rrb- per share , 14 percent less than the € 117.70 closing price on friday which values the vw group at 33 billion euros . wiedeking said that as the global car market gets increasingly and fiercely competitive , the move to bolster the ability of both groups to meet the challenges of the industry was " a logical step .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 26.03.2007 opinion : a pointless resolution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un security council 's latest resolution that imposes sanctions on iran for refusing to halt its nuclear program can only make it more difficult to solve the problem , writes dw 's peter philipp . un security council sanctions used to carry ominous weight .
that no longer seems to be the case - at least in the case of iran .
for the second time in four months , tehran has been condemned because of its nuclear policy .
the country 's foreign minister , manouchehr mottaki , may condemn the latest resolution as much as he wants , but he 'll probably be right when he says that the resolution will have no effect . after long and bitter debate , the mountain has given birth to a mouse : arms trade with iran is supposed to be outlawed and the bank accounts of a few more iranians , who work in the arms and nuclear sectors , are to be frozen . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : again tehran is called on for the last time to stop enriching uranium in order to begin negotiations about a peaceful nuclear collaboration .
disregarding any visa difficulties he might have had , iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad really did n't need to bother appearing before the council : such a resolution is as toothless as it is without effect . what , for example , is meant to be achieved with an arms embargo ?
in times , when even civilian airplanes can no longer be delivered to iran , no one will openly broker arms deals with tehran .
and why should a resolution - any more than the unifil troops - be able to stop iranian arms exports to the lebanese hezbollah ? iran rejects the council 's actions as unacceptable .
as chief witnesses for their case , tehran officials could draw on some un ambassadors - such as the french one - who emphasized before the meeting that iran naturally has a right to peaceful use of nuclear power . it 's a right that includes enriching uranium as long as this only happens in low concentrations .
but that 's exactly the center of the conflict : the security council does not differentiate between enriching for energy generation and producing arms .
it simply assumed that iran is aiming for nuclear weapons without having the slightest proof for this .
it 's doubtful whether people are even convinced themselves : would they otherwise stop at freezing bank accounts and banning an arms trade that 's impossible to control ? had the case remained with the international atomic energy agency in vienna , chances for a solution would have been much better .
to make washington happy , however , it was brought before the council , which has problems to deal with it .
everyone seems to know that a solution can not be found this way and that things could get even more complicated - as the incident regarding british soldiers who were arrested after allegedly entering iranian territory shows . middle east ex per t peter philipp is deutsche welle 's chief correspondent -lrb- win -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran faces isolation as security council agrees further sanctions the un security council has slapped new sanctions on iran over its suspect nuclear program as western powers warned tehran it faced becoming even more internationally isolated .

data protection experts in the eu and the us are pushing for more security in the controversial gathering of key passenger data by us authorities from european airlines as part of measures to fight terrorism . the us and the european union are currently negotiating a permanent pact on the controversial sharing of key air passenger data which washington requires from airlines as part of heightened security measures after the september 11 terrorist attacks on new york and washington . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter schaar , germany 's top data protection official " there must be proof -lrb- that such data are useful in fighting terrorism -rrb- , there must be an independent audit or a joint review , including european data protection authorities , " german data protection commissioner peter schaar told reporters ahead of a hearing in the european parliament on monday . schaar warned that a new deal , which needs to be clinched by the end of july , might even result in a lower level of data protection than was guaranteed under previous agreements . us wants more data-sharing the us has called for more data-sharing , claiming that european privacy concerns had unreasonably hampered its counter-terrorism activities in the past few years . under the current interim pact , european air carriers are obliged to give us authorities up to 44 pieces of information on each passenger aboard america-bound flights .
the data includes credit card numbers , travel itineraries , addresses and telephone numbers . schaar said that personal data sent to us authorities should be made anonymous and the identity of their owner only be revealed if the data matched a profile in a terrorist database .
he also called for introducing a system under which data would be " pushed " to us authorities on specific request , rather than allowing the agency to " pull " the information from european airline computers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us has warned that airlines that fail to comply could face a fine a new data sharing deal has to be in place by the end of july to replace a current interim pact.however , schaar cautioned that " many , many questions remain and we are far from a solution .

however , the court 's objections related to the legal basis of the pact , not its actual contents . the eu and the us are increasingly at odds over how to reconcile civil liberties with the us-led fight against terrorism . european lawmakers have warned repeatedly that the privacy rights of eu citizens are currently unprotected against mistakes or abuse by us authorities . brussels and washington are also at loggerheads over a secret agreement between the us treasury and the belgium-based money transfer company swift , which has supplied us authorities with personal data for use in counter-terror inquiries . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu , us move closer to permanent deal of passenger data german interior minister wolfgang schäuble and us homeland security secretary michael chertoff met in berlin friday .

that no longer seems to be the case - at least in the case of iran .
for the second time in four months , tehran has been condemned because of its nuclear policy .
the country 's foreign minister , manouchehr mottaki , may condemn the latest resolution as much as he wants , but he 'll probably be right when he says that the resolution will have no effect . after long and bitter debate , the mountain has given birth to a mouse : arms trade with iran is supposed to be outlawed and the bank accounts of a few more iranians , who work in the arms and nuclear sectors , are to be frozen . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : again tehran is called on for the last time to stop enriching uranium in order to begin negotiations about a peaceful nuclear collaboration .
disregarding any visa difficulties he might have had , iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad really did n't need to bother appearing before the council : such a resolution is as toothless as it is without effect . what , for example , is meant to be achieved with an arms embargo ?
in times , when even civilian airplanes can no longer be delivered to iran , no one will openly broker arms deals with tehran .
and why should a resolution - any more than the unifil troops - be able to stop iranian arms exports to the lebanese hezbollah ? iran rejects the council 's actions as unacceptable .
as chief witnesses for their case , tehran officials could draw on some un ambassadors - such as the french one - who emphasized before the meeting that iran naturally has a right to peaceful use of nuclear power . it 's a right that includes enriching uranium as long as this only happens in low concentrations .
but that 's exactly the center of the conflict : the security council does not differentiate between enriching for energy generation and producing arms .
it simply assumed that iran is aiming for nuclear weapons without having the slightest proof for this .
it 's doubtful whether people are even convinced themselves : would they otherwise stop at freezing bank accounts and banning an arms trade that 's impossible to control ? had the case remained with the international atomic energy agency in vienna , chances for a solution would have been much better .
to make washington happy , however , it was brought before the council , which has problems to deal with it .

now , after the sniping between animal-lovers and irate farmers has died down , the struggle has become a political row between germany and italy over ownership . bruno began his fateful last journey from the adamello-brenta nature reserve in italy 's northern trentino region last spring , where italian authorities recently reintroduced his species .
ambling off as wild bears are wont to do , bruno unknowingly crossed the alpine border , first into austria and then germany where he was shot dead last summer . and this is where the problem lies .
the state of bavaria says that bruno should be laid to rest where he died , while the italian environment minister alfonso scanio wants the corpse back in trentino .
at the moment , bruno is on ice at an undisclosed secure location somewhere in bavaria - but for how long ? fur flies in carcass tug-of-war bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bear necessity : everyone wants a piece of bruno scanio appears to be a man who will not rest until he gets his bear .
he continues to lobby his german counterpart sigmar gabriel for his support in getting bruno repatriated , who in turn has " passed on " the italian 's wishes a number of times to werner schnappauf , bavaria 's minister of the environment . however , schnappauf is having none of it : the bear stays here , he says - and has told gabriel many times that the increasingly aggressive requests from the italians for the return of the corpse have " no judicial basis . "
schnappauf has said that it does n't matter how many times gabriel passes on scanio 's demands .
the legal situation is unquestionable .
" an animal born in the wilderness belongs to the land in which it dies , " he says . the italians strongly disagree .

while schnappauf has n't actually gone as far as saying those actual words , it is believed that the munich museum is already being lined up to take the corpse . the bavarians seem confident that bruno will stay with them while the italians will not take no for an answer .

the fair offers intimate book browsing and prides itself in connecting readers of all ages to their favorite authors . at the leipzig book fair , families strolled through the bright fairgrounds , checking out the 2,348 exhibitors from 36 countries .
the fair , held in modern buildings outside the eastern german city of leipzig , has emerged as europe 's largest literary festival for author readings and events . organizer wolfgang marzin could n't have been happier with the fair , which ended sunday . " we had the nicest book fair , " marzin said .
" it 's the most peaceful and reader-friendly book fair . " finding an audience bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children settle down to read germany hosts two large book fairs each year .
the trade fair in frankfurt is the undisputed king of the book fair scene .
leipzig does not even strive to compete with frankfurt , but instead has established its own identity , especially with its popular concept , " leipzig reads . "
unlike frankfurt , which is geared towards trade professionals , leipzig generates much of its business from the general public . in the evenings , readings are offered around town in bookshops , cafes or at city hall .
there are appearances by famous authors such as nobel-prize winning german author günter grass . the fair has focused on attracting readers of all ages and exposing them to many different genres of literature . a young girl showed her delight while browsing picture books about horses , farms and fire trucks .
her younger brother slept in his stroller and their mother laughed at the costumed manga comic fans behind her . " there are simply things going on here , " she said .
" that 's cool . " getting young people to attend the fair is a central goal of the organizers , marzin said .
exhausted kids can be found sprawled on the floor of the central glass hall . german books take center stage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's no shortage of books in leipzig leipzig has a long tradition of printing and book trade .
after world war ii and the division of germany , leipzig became a focal point for east-west publishers .
after german reunification in 1990 , many publishing houses in the former east germany shut down or integrated into west german ones .
a year later , the leipzig book fair started . the fair focuses on german language books , introducing up-and-coming authors from central and eastern europe to the german market . the relaxed atmosphere is the secret to what makes this fair popular .
the laid back pace makes it easy for fairgoers to stumble across literary jewels . " you discover all the types of books here , ones that you ca n't find in the little bookstore in our town and ones you ca n't track down on the internet .
here you have them all in front of you , " a woman said . the next leipzig book fair will take place from march 13 to march 16 2008 . silke bartlick -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a bridge between literature and cinema how do you turn a book into a movie ?

the african continent has been the object of numerous broken promises and has reason to be skeptical , according to reinhard hermle , former head of the association of german development non-governmental organizations . he said he remembers the 2001 meeting in gleneagles , where he and other participants agreed to invest $ 50 billion in development aid .
half of that aid was intended for africa , but hermle said that remains a goal from which " we are still very far . " " chancellor schröder had promised to spend 0.51 percent of the german gross social product on development aid by 2010 , " he said .
" now we are at 0.36 percent , but we are observing that much of what is being included in calculations does not result in money reaching africa . " one example of creative bookkeeping , according to hermle , was pointless debt relief for iraq from which the country did not benefit because it had already stopped servicing its debts . poverty decline spread unevenly bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few african nations are likely to halve poverty by 2015 similar statistical effects could also be employed with the un 's millennium development goals , to which 189 un member states agreed to cut in half the number of people living on less than $ 1 per day . it 's a goal hermle said would likely be achieved due to improving economic conditions in a few nations with large populations . " highly populated countries like india and china are making large economic progress , " he said , adding that when the countries ' total population of 2.5 billion is projected on the world 's population the goal of cutting poverty in half can be reached .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the european union turns 50 the day the eu was born eu leaders adopt 50th anniversary berlin declaration founding fathers : europeans behind the union text of the berlin declaration to mark 50 years of the eu europe -pipe- 26.03.2007 eu ponders more questions than answers amid celebrations großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the berlin declaration set out plans for the eu 's future but how much is it really worth ?
the european union celebrated its 50th birthday on sunday , but critics said a much publicized statement marking the occasion papers over the cracks and the divisive differences over how to meet new challenges . the blueprint for the future was contained in a berlin declaration signed by chancellor angela merkel during an informal gathering with the other 26 eu leaders in the german capital . while the two-page document proudly noted the progress made since the eu was founded , it avoided mentioning controversial issues like the bloc 's christian roots , enlargement and the eu constitution . instead there were general references to fighting " terrorism , organized crime and illegal immigration together , " as well as intentions to " jointly lead the way in energy policy and climate protection . " but it fell a long way short of " the creative madness " which italian premier romano prodi said was needed by the eu to show that the world can be changed . party snubs and enlargement fatigue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey was unhappy at not being invited to the party accession candidates like turkey had complained in advance about prospective newcomers not being invited to the birthday party , saying " it would have been meaningful , in terms of demonstrating once again the unity of the european family . " this unity has given way to " enlargement fatigue " in countries like germany where polls show there is little appetite to take on more members after the 12 mostly eastern european nations that have joined since 2004 . but other states like ireland and britain are in favor of newcomers joining the bloc , which has seen its population balloon to nearly 500 million since the founding treaty of rome was signed in 1957 . the german chancellor said the eu has become so big that it needs to take on a new role to become more effective .
a constitution is the best way to achieve this , she believes . resuscitating the treaty , which has been on ice since its rejection by french and dutch voters in 2005 , was so divisive that it was omitted from the berlin declaration altogether . merkel dedicated to eu constitution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is leading the championing of the constitution merkel hopes to present a road map on how to proceed with the treaty before germany 's six-month presidency of the union expires at the end of june . " we are united in our aim of placing the european union on a renewed common basis before the european parliament elections in 2009 , " was the compromise formula that appeared in the berlin declaration . while merkel would like to keep the " substance " of the moribund 485-page constitution , objections have come from britain , poland and the czech republic , among others . britain opposes surrendering control of its foreign policy to an eu foreign minister , while the czech republic believes the target date of 2009 , when it will hold the eu presidency , is too early . poland fears it is unfairly treated in the proposed voting system in the treaty , which gives votes according to population , thus making germany the major beneficiary in decision-making issues because it is europe 's biggest nation . critics say declaration ignores real problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is still a lot of work to be done " the real problem issues are just being postponed , " said daniela schwarzer , a senior fellow at the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- . if merkel insists on having the treaty ready by 2009 the differences will have to be sorted out by the end of this year , according to german television analyst udo van kampen . this is because the document will need to be ratified by all 27 national parliaments , a cumbersome process that could take as long as 18 months . failure to do this could revive the discussion of a two-speed europe , with one group pressing ahead with political and economic union ahead of the rest . however , the german presidency remains optimistic and insists " the goal remains a constitution , " effectively dismissing suggestions that some kind of watered-down document that addresses only the administrative difficulties would suffice . the berlin declaration did not please pope benedict xvi , who said that europe was facing an identity crisis because of policies which had also resulted in a low birthrate . the pontiff was especially critical of the fact that there was no reference to europe being a christian community , something which was left out of the berlin declaration despite objections from poland . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu leaders adopt 50th anniversary berlin declaration european union leaders adopted sunday a 50th anniversary declaration setting 2009 as the deadline for preparing a new treaty , following the failure of the bloc 's constitution .

" this forms the basis for enel 's development on the european electricity market , " said enel chief fulvio conti following the announcement of his company 's pact with acciona . while e.on 's latest bid values endesa at 42.4 billion euros , the enel-acciona offer would bring endesa 's value to 43.4 billion euros . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : e.on chief wulf bernotat is confident their offer will be accepted e.on chief wulf bernotat said his company was " convinced that our increased offer at 40 euros a share will be the only one for endesa in the foreseeable future . " a new force in the global energy market a tie-up between endesa and e.on would create a new force in the global energy market with more than 22 million customers and a business empire stretching from europe , through to the us and south america . e.on , however , needs at least 50 percent for its bid to succeed .
analysts believe that e.on faces an uphill battle to secure control of endesa as enel and acciona together already hold about a 46 per cent stake in endesa . under their takeover plan , acciona would raise its stake in endesa to 50.1 per cent , while enel would hold the rest . the cnmv ruled friday that enel and acciona could not launch a bid for six months after the e.on bid expires and gave e.on until monday to improve its offer . however , acciona told the cnmv that the joint bid with enel would be launched as soon as " legally possible . "
the cnmv is to due to issue a new ruling on the acciona-enel proposed bid before markets open in spain on tuesday . e.on takes legal action against rivals but with tensions surrounding the endesa battle rising , e.on hit back launching legal moves against enel and acciona monday and calling on the cnmv to mount action against the two companies for market disruption , breaching tender offer rules , and insider trading . at the same time , e.on said that acciona and enel should be forced to divest their shareholdings in endesa and be prohibited from buying up any endesa shares . the german company also commenced court action in new york against acciona and enel , claiming that two companies had breached us disclosure rules . in a strongly worded statement , e.on lashed out at acciona and enel accusing them of " unlawful actions " which it said " were an attempt to deceive endesa 's shareholders and to manipulate the market price of endesa stock .

analysts believe that e.on faces an uphill battle to secure control of endesa as enel and acciona together already hold about a 46 per cent stake in endesa . under their takeover plan , acciona would raise its stake in endesa to 50.1 per cent , while enel would hold the rest . the cnmv ruled friday that enel and acciona could not launch a bid for six months after the e.on bid expires and gave e.on until monday to improve its offer . however , acciona told the cnmv that the joint bid with enel would be launched as soon as " legally possible .

" this forms the basis for enel 's development on the european electricity market , " said enel chief fulvio conti following the announcement of his company 's pact with acciona . while e.on 's latest bid values endesa at 42.4 billion euros , the enel-acciona offer would bring endesa 's value to 43.4 billion euros . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : e.on chief wulf bernotat is confident their offer will be accepted e.on chief wulf bernotat said his company was " convinced that our increased offer at 40 euros a share will be the only one for endesa in the foreseeable future .

analysts believe that e.on faces an uphill battle to secure control of endesa as enel and acciona together already hold about a 46 per cent stake in endesa . under their takeover plan , acciona would raise its stake in endesa to 50.1 per cent , while enel would hold the rest . the cnmv ruled friday that enel and acciona could not launch a bid for six months after the e.on bid expires and gave e.on until monday to improve its offer . however , acciona told the cnmv that the joint bid with enel would be launched as soon as " legally possible .

that no longer seems to be the case - at least in the case of iran .
for the second time in four months , tehran has been condemned because of its nuclear policy .
the country 's foreign minister , manouchehr mottaki , may condemn the latest resolution as much as he wants , but he 'll probably be right when he says that the resolution will have no effect . after long and bitter debate , the mountain has given birth to a mouse : arms trade with iran is supposed to be outlawed and the bank accounts of a few more iranians , who work in the arms and nuclear sectors , are to be frozen . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : again tehran is called on for the last time to stop enriching uranium in order to begin negotiations about a peaceful nuclear collaboration .
disregarding any visa difficulties he might have had , iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad really did n't need to bother appearing before the council : such a resolution is as toothless as it is without effect . what , for example , is meant to be achieved with an arms embargo ?
in times , when even civilian airplanes can no longer be delivered to iran , no one will openly broker arms deals with tehran .
and why should a resolution - any more than the unifil troops - be able to stop iranian arms exports to the lebanese hezbollah ? iran rejects the council 's actions as unacceptable .
as chief witnesses for their case , tehran officials could draw on some un ambassadors - such as the french one - who emphasized before the meeting that iran naturally has a right to peaceful use of nuclear power . it 's a right that includes enriching uranium as long as this only happens in low concentrations .
but that 's exactly the center of the conflict : the security council does not differentiate between enriching for energy generation and producing arms .
it simply assumed that iran is aiming for nuclear weapons without having the slightest proof for this .
it 's doubtful whether people are even convinced themselves : would they otherwise stop at freezing bank accounts and banning an arms trade that 's impossible to control ? had the case remained with the international atomic energy agency in vienna , chances for a solution would have been much better .
to make washington happy , however , it was brought before the council , which has problems to deal with it .
everyone seems to know that a solution can not be found this way and that things could get even more complicated - as the incident regarding british soldiers who were arrested after allegedly entering iranian territory shows . middle east ex per t peter philipp is deutsche welle 's chief correspondent -lrb- win -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran faces isolation as security council agrees further sanctions the un security council has slapped new sanctions on iran over its suspect nuclear program as western powers warned tehran it faced becoming even more internationally isolated .

but that 's exactly the center of the conflict : the security council does not differentiate between enriching for energy generation and producing arms .
it simply assumed that iran is aiming for nuclear weapons without having the slightest proof for this .
it 's doubtful whether people are even convinced themselves : would they otherwise stop at freezing bank accounts and banning an arms trade that 's impossible to control ? had the case remained with the international atomic energy agency in vienna , chances for a solution would have been much better .
to make washington happy , however , it was brought before the council , which has problems to deal with it .
everyone seems to know that a solution can not be found this way and that things could get even more complicated - as the incident regarding british soldiers who were arrested after allegedly entering iranian territory shows . middle east ex per t peter philipp is deutsche welle 's chief correspondent -lrb- win -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran faces isolation as security council agrees further sanctions the un security council has slapped new sanctions on iran over its suspect nuclear program as western powers warned tehran it faced becoming even more internationally isolated .

data protection experts in the eu and the us are pushing for more security in the controversial gathering of key passenger data by us authorities from european airlines as part of measures to fight terrorism . the us and the european union are currently negotiating a permanent pact on the controversial sharing of key air passenger data which washington requires from airlines as part of heightened security measures after the september 11 terrorist attacks on new york and washington . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter schaar , germany 's top data protection official " there must be proof -lrb- that such data are useful in fighting terrorism -rrb- , there must be an independent audit or a joint review , including european data protection authorities , " german data protection commissioner peter schaar told reporters ahead of a hearing in the european parliament on monday . schaar warned that a new deal , which needs to be clinched by the end of july , might even result in a lower level of data protection than was guaranteed under previous agreements . us wants more data-sharing the us has called for more data-sharing , claiming that european privacy concerns had unreasonably hampered its counter-terrorism activities in the past few years . under the current interim pact , european air carriers are obliged to give us authorities up to 44 pieces of information on each passenger aboard america-bound flights .
the data includes credit card numbers , travel itineraries , addresses and telephone numbers . schaar said that personal data sent to us authorities should be made anonymous and the identity of their owner only be revealed if the data matched a profile in a terrorist database .
he also called for introducing a system under which data would be " pushed " to us authorities on specific request , rather than allowing the agency to " pull " the information from european airline computers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us has warned that airlines that fail to comply could face a fine a new data sharing deal has to be in place by the end of july to replace a current interim pact.however , schaar cautioned that " many , many questions remain and we are far from a solution .

however , the court 's objections related to the legal basis of the pact , not its actual contents . the eu and the us are increasingly at odds over how to reconcile civil liberties with the us-led fight against terrorism . european lawmakers have warned repeatedly that the privacy rights of eu citizens are currently unprotected against mistakes or abuse by us authorities . brussels and washington are also at loggerheads over a secret agreement between the us treasury and the belgium-based money transfer company swift , which has supplied us authorities with personal data for use in counter-terror inquiries . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu , us move closer to permanent deal of passenger data german interior minister wolfgang schäuble and us homeland security secretary michael chertoff met in berlin friday .

data protection experts in the eu and the us are pushing for more security in the controversial gathering of key passenger data by us authorities from european airlines as part of measures to fight terrorism . the us and the european union are currently negotiating a permanent pact on the controversial sharing of key air passenger data which washington requires from airlines as part of heightened security measures after the september 11 terrorist attacks on new york and washington . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter schaar , germany 's top data protection official " there must be proof -lrb- that such data are useful in fighting terrorism -rrb- , there must be an independent audit or a joint review , including european data protection authorities , " german data protection commissioner peter schaar told reporters ahead of a hearing in the european parliament on monday . schaar warned that a new deal , which needs to be clinched by the end of july , might even result in a lower level of data protection than was guaranteed under previous agreements . us wants more data-sharing the us has called for more data-sharing , claiming that european privacy concerns had unreasonably hampered its counter-terrorism activities in the past few years . under the current interim pact , european air carriers are obliged to give us authorities up to 44 pieces of information on each passenger aboard america-bound flights .
the data includes credit card numbers , travel itineraries , addresses and telephone numbers . schaar said that personal data sent to us authorities should be made anonymous and the identity of their owner only be revealed if the data matched a profile in a terrorist database .
he also called for introducing a system under which data would be " pushed " to us authorities on specific request , rather than allowing the agency to " pull " the information from european airline computers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us has warned that airlines that fail to comply could face a fine a new data sharing deal has to be in place by the end of july to replace a current interim pact.however , schaar cautioned that " many , many questions remain and we are far from a solution . " washington has warned that airlines which failed to share passenger data would face fines of up to $ 6,000 per passenger and a possible loss of landing rights . " philosophical confusion " greek socialist mep stavros lambrinidis , vice-chair of the eu parliament 's civil liberties committee , said that the transatlantic privacy quarrels were signs of a " philosophical confusion between the eu and the us concerning terrorism . " " we have to look for a general understanding with the us on what is necessary to catch terrorists , " lambrinidis said .
" we are worried about the kind and quantity of data that is collected and we are concerned about how this data is used . " lambrinidis added that the eu should not only be concerned about data protection , " but also see if the data are really necessary , appropriate and important " in fighting terrorism . schaar added that a new transatlantic air passenger data deal could be challenged by national courts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : passengers flying to the us have to undergo stringent security checks the concerns were echoed by american data protection experts .
marc rotenberg , executive director and president of the electronic privacy information center in washington said in the european parliament that his group had always insisted on data protection for travelers and visitors but said that to date , persons who are not us citizens or do not have a residence permit for the country , are not afforded any protection . reconciling civil liberties with war on terror agreement on a new deal on sharing passenger data was required after the eu 's top court annulled an earlier transatlantic accord on air passenger data exchange .
however , the court 's objections related to the legal basis of the pact , not its actual contents . the eu and the us are increasingly at odds over how to reconcile civil liberties with the us-led fight against terrorism . european lawmakers have warned repeatedly that the privacy rights of eu citizens are currently unprotected against mistakes or abuse by us authorities . brussels and washington are also at loggerheads over a secret agreement between the us treasury and the belgium-based money transfer company swift , which has supplied us authorities with personal data for use in counter-terror inquiries . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu , us move closer to permanent deal of passenger data german interior minister wolfgang schäuble and us homeland security secretary michael chertoff met in berlin friday .

that no longer seems to be the case - at least in the case of iran .
for the second time in four months , tehran has been condemned because of its nuclear policy .
the country 's foreign minister , manouchehr mottaki , may condemn the latest resolution as much as he wants , but he 'll probably be right when he says that the resolution will have no effect . after long and bitter debate , the mountain has given birth to a mouse : arms trade with iran is supposed to be outlawed and the bank accounts of a few more iranians , who work in the arms and nuclear sectors , are to be frozen . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : again tehran is called on for the last time to stop enriching uranium in order to begin negotiations about a peaceful nuclear collaboration .
disregarding any visa difficulties he might have had , iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad really did n't need to bother appearing before the council : such a resolution is as toothless as it is without effect . what , for example , is meant to be achieved with an arms embargo ?
in times , when even civilian airplanes can no longer be delivered to iran , no one will openly broker arms deals with tehran .
and why should a resolution - any more than the unifil troops - be able to stop iranian arms exports to the lebanese hezbollah ? iran rejects the council 's actions as unacceptable .
as chief witnesses for their case , tehran officials could draw on some un ambassadors - such as the french one - who emphasized before the meeting that iran naturally has a right to peaceful use of nuclear power . it 's a right that includes enriching uranium as long as this only happens in low concentrations .
but that 's exactly the center of the conflict : the security council does not differentiate between enriching for energy generation and producing arms .
it simply assumed that iran is aiming for nuclear weapons without having the slightest proof for this .
it 's doubtful whether people are even convinced themselves : would they otherwise stop at freezing bank accounts and banning an arms trade that 's impossible to control ? had the case remained with the international atomic energy agency in vienna , chances for a solution would have been much better .
to make washington happy , however , it was brought before the council , which has problems to deal with it .
everyone seems to know that a solution can not be found this way and that things could get even more complicated - as the incident regarding british soldiers who were arrested after allegedly entering iranian territory shows . middle east ex per t peter philipp is deutsche welle 's chief correspondent -lrb- win -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran faces isolation as security council agrees further sanctions the un security council has slapped new sanctions on iran over its suspect nuclear program as western powers warned tehran it faced becoming even more internationally isolated .

" we must look at stronger sanctions . " the sudanese government in khartoum has blocked plans to deploy un peacekeepers to replace african union troops struggling to contain the violence in the western region .
the eu imposed an arms embargo on khartoum in january 2004 .
but this weekend eu leaders and human rights activists said more needs to be done to end one of the world 's worst humanitarian disasters . situation " intolerable " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu leaders discussed darfur during the weekend 's eu celebrations britain 's prime minister tony blair said the situation in the western sudanese region was " intolerable . "
he said had been a major area of discussion as eu leaders met over the weekend . blair called for enforcing a no-fly zone over the vast darfur region of sudan to keep government planes from firing on fleeing refugees . " the issue is : we need to get a new resolution to extend the sanctions regime against key individuals , " blair said .
" the brutal action of the sudanese government is completely unacceptable . " blair was accompanied by ishag mekki , a representative of a london-based group , darfur union .
mekki 's elder sister , a mother of eight , was killed in her home in darfur .
mekki issued an emotional plea to world leaders to help stop .
the eu should not celebrate its achievements of the past century while people in darfur are being killed , mekki said . " every time genocide happens the leaders of the eu say ' never again , " ' mekki said .
" these are empty words because it is happening now . " eu urged to take action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : african union soldiers have struggled to control the violence in darfur the press conference was organized by live aid founder geldof , who called for an immediate travel ban and an asset-freeze against sudanese officials . " you should refuse to let them travel to europe for their dental and hair appointments , you should stop them buying our luxury goods and freeze all assets of the sudanese government , " geldolf said . those immediate steps should be " followed within weeks by tougher sanctions , a no-fly zone over darfur and the deployment of a un force to impose peace , " he said . on saturday , 10 leading european thinkers and writers , including nobel literature laureates harold pinter and günter grass , urged eu leaders in an open letter to interrupt the anniversary celebrations and act to stop the bloodshed in darfur . geldof called the conflict a genocide and said it was shameful that the eu was not doing more to stop it as the bloc was born in response to world war ii and the holocaust . " it is a spurious idea that we have lots to celebrate - the sense of betrayal is much greater , " he said .
" the eu arose out of genocide and we have failed to honor that shared value . " since fighting between rebels and government-supported militias started in 2003 , approximately 200,000 people have died and 2.5 million have fled their homes .
the conflict has caused one of the world 's worst humanitarian crises . peace deal near collapse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : humanitarian help in darfur remains fragile , the un says on sunday , a fragile peace deal signed between the government and the rebel sudan liberation movement -lrb- slm -rrb- seemed ready to collapse after slm members got into a shootout with police saturday .
the shooting left approximately a dozen people dead .
the slm has threatened to resume fighting and move the conflict to the capital city of khartoum , the afp reported . " what happened reveals a will to move from peace to a state of war , " slm leader minni minnawi said .
he accused the government of provoking the incident as " an attempt by the government to sabotage the peace process . " " we are prepared to resume the war and from khartoum , if the government wants to fight , " khamis tayeb , a spokesman for the slm , told afp . the united nations ' new humanitarian chief john holmes said the humanitarian effort in darfur remains fragile .
if fighting resumes , the humanitarian crisis could worsen , holmes warned , after touring a refugee camp in sudan on sunday . " people are n't starving and health conditions are decent , " he told reporters at the camp .
" this shows the enormous humanitarian effort that has been made here for three years , but this humanitarian effort is fragile . " if the situation deteriorates , it could collapse , " he added .
" the risk is high , it is not imminent but if things deteriorate , people -lrb- aid groups -rrb- may not want to maintain their efforts , which could lead to a humanitarian collapse .

the african continent has been the object of numerous broken promises and has reason to be skeptical , according to reinhard hermle , former head of the association of german development non-governmental organizations . he said he remembers the 2001 meeting in gleneagles , where he and other participants agreed to invest $ 50 billion in development aid .
half of that aid was intended for africa , but hermle said that remains a goal from which " we are still very far . " " chancellor schröder had promised to spend 0.51 percent of the german gross social product on development aid by 2010 , " he said .
" now we are at 0.36 percent , but we are observing that much of what is being included in calculations does not result in money reaching africa .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the european union turns 50 the day the eu was born eu leaders adopt 50th anniversary berlin declaration founding fathers : europeans behind the union text of the berlin declaration to mark 50 years of the eu europe -pipe- 26.03.2007 eu ponders more questions than answers amid celebrations großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the berlin declaration set out plans for the eu 's future but how much is it really worth ?
the european union celebrated its 50th birthday on sunday , but critics said a much publicized statement marking the occasion papers over the cracks and the divisive differences over how to meet new challenges . the blueprint for the future was contained in a berlin declaration signed by chancellor angela merkel during an informal gathering with the other 26 eu leaders in the german capital . while the two-page document proudly noted the progress made since the eu was founded , it avoided mentioning controversial issues like the bloc 's christian roots , enlargement and the eu constitution . instead there were general references to fighting " terrorism , organized crime and illegal immigration together , " as well as intentions to " jointly lead the way in energy policy and climate protection . " but it fell a long way short of " the creative madness " which italian premier romano prodi said was needed by the eu to show that the world can be changed . party snubs and enlargement fatigue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey was unhappy at not being invited to the party accession candidates like turkey had complained in advance about prospective newcomers not being invited to the birthday party , saying " it would have been meaningful , in terms of demonstrating once again the unity of the european family . " this unity has given way to " enlargement fatigue " in countries like germany where polls show there is little appetite to take on more members after the 12 mostly eastern european nations that have joined since 2004 . but other states like ireland and britain are in favor of newcomers joining the bloc , which has seen its population balloon to nearly 500 million since the founding treaty of rome was signed in 1957 . the german chancellor said the eu has become so big that it needs to take on a new role to become more effective .
a constitution is the best way to achieve this , she believes . resuscitating the treaty , which has been on ice since its rejection by french and dutch voters in 2005 , was so divisive that it was omitted from the berlin declaration altogether . merkel dedicated to eu constitution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is leading the championing of the constitution merkel hopes to present a road map on how to proceed with the treaty before germany 's six-month presidency of the union expires at the end of june . " we are united in our aim of placing the european union on a renewed common basis before the european parliament elections in 2009 , " was the compromise formula that appeared in the berlin declaration . while merkel would like to keep the " substance " of the moribund 485-page constitution , objections have come from britain , poland and the czech republic , among others . britain opposes surrendering control of its foreign policy to an eu foreign minister , while the czech republic believes the target date of 2009 , when it will hold the eu presidency , is too early . poland fears it is unfairly treated in the proposed voting system in the treaty , which gives votes according to population , thus making germany the major beneficiary in decision-making issues because it is europe 's biggest nation . critics say declaration ignores real problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is still a lot of work to be done " the real problem issues are just being postponed , " said daniela schwarzer , a senior fellow at the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- . if merkel insists on having the treaty ready by 2009 the differences will have to be sorted out by the end of this year , according to german television analyst udo van kampen . this is because the document will need to be ratified by all 27 national parliaments , a cumbersome process that could take as long as 18 months . failure to do this could revive the discussion of a two-speed europe , with one group pressing ahead with political and economic union ahead of the rest . however , the german presidency remains optimistic and insists " the goal remains a constitution , " effectively dismissing suggestions that some kind of watered-down document that addresses only the administrative difficulties would suffice . the berlin declaration did not please pope benedict xvi , who said that europe was facing an identity crisis because of policies which had also resulted in a low birthrate . the pontiff was especially critical of the fact that there was no reference to europe being a christian community , something which was left out of the berlin declaration despite objections from poland . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu leaders adopt 50th anniversary berlin declaration european union leaders adopted sunday a 50th anniversary declaration setting 2009 as the deadline for preparing a new treaty , following the failure of the bloc 's constitution .

the european union celebrated its 50th birthday on sunday , but critics said a much publicized statement marking the occasion papers over the cracks and the divisive differences over how to meet new challenges . the blueprint for the future was contained in a berlin declaration signed by chancellor angela merkel during an informal gathering with the other 26 eu leaders in the german capital . while the two-page document proudly noted the progress made since the eu was founded , it avoided mentioning controversial issues like the bloc 's christian roots , enlargement and the eu constitution . instead there were general references to fighting " terrorism , organized crime and illegal immigration together , " as well as intentions to " jointly lead the way in energy policy and climate protection . " but it fell a long way short of " the creative madness " which italian premier romano prodi said was needed by the eu to show that the world can be changed . party snubs and enlargement fatigue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey was unhappy at not being invited to the party accession candidates like turkey had complained in advance about prospective newcomers not being invited to the birthday party , saying " it would have been meaningful , in terms of demonstrating once again the unity of the european family . " this unity has given way to " enlargement fatigue " in countries like germany where polls show there is little appetite to take on more members after the 12 mostly eastern european nations that have joined since 2004 . but other states like ireland and britain are in favor of newcomers joining the bloc , which has seen its population balloon to nearly 500 million since the founding treaty of rome was signed in 1957 . the german chancellor said the eu has become so big that it needs to take on a new role to become more effective .
a constitution is the best way to achieve this , she believes . resuscitating the treaty , which has been on ice since its rejection by french and dutch voters in 2005 , was so divisive that it was omitted from the berlin declaration altogether . merkel dedicated to eu constitution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is leading the championing of the constitution merkel hopes to present a road map on how to proceed with the treaty before germany 's six-month presidency of the union expires at the end of june . " we are united in our aim of placing the european union on a renewed common basis before the european parliament elections in 2009 , " was the compromise formula that appeared in the berlin declaration . while merkel would like to keep the " substance " of the moribund 485-page constitution , objections have come from britain , poland and the czech republic , among others . britain opposes surrendering control of its foreign policy to an eu foreign minister , while the czech republic believes the target date of 2009 , when it will hold the eu presidency , is too early . poland fears it is unfairly treated in the proposed voting system in the treaty , which gives votes according to population , thus making germany the major beneficiary in decision-making issues because it is europe 's biggest nation . critics say declaration ignores real problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is still a lot of work to be done " the real problem issues are just being postponed , " said daniela schwarzer , a senior fellow at the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- . if merkel insists on having the treaty ready by 2009 the differences will have to be sorted out by the end of this year , according to german television analyst udo van kampen . this is because the document will need to be ratified by all 27 national parliaments , a cumbersome process that could take as long as 18 months . failure to do this could revive the discussion of a two-speed europe , with one group pressing ahead with political and economic union ahead of the rest . however , the german presidency remains optimistic and insists " the goal remains a constitution , " effectively dismissing suggestions that some kind of watered-down document that addresses only the administrative difficulties would suffice . the berlin declaration did not please pope benedict xvi , who said that europe was facing an identity crisis because of policies which had also resulted in a low birthrate . the pontiff was especially critical of the fact that there was no reference to europe being a christian community , something which was left out of the berlin declaration despite objections from poland . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu leaders adopt 50th anniversary berlin declaration european union leaders adopted sunday a 50th anniversary declaration setting 2009 as the deadline for preparing a new treaty , following the failure of the bloc 's constitution .

however , porsche revealed it had no immediate plans to absorb vw . in a statement , porsche - volkswagen 's largest shareholder - said it had exercised an option on 3.5 percent of vw 's shares to increase its 27.3 percent stake in europe 's biggest carmaker to 30.8 percent .
it will cost porsche an estimated 1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.34 billion -rrb- under german law , a 30-percent stake in a company obliges the holder to make a full takeover bid .
the shares would be transferred on wednesday . the move by porsche , which has been rumored for some time , seems to be an effort to protect vw from a hostile raid from another source . porsche to keep vw in german hands bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wiedeking wants to protect vw from foreign takeover in an interview with the bild newspaper published on monday , porsche 's ceo wendelin wiedeking said : " if a hedge fund dismantled vw and sold that on the stock market , we would lose our most important partner .
we can not let that happen , that 's why we acted . " the timing is significant because a european court is expected to rule soon against a german law dating from 1960 which caps the voting rights of shareholders at 20 percent , even if they own a greater share . on feb .
13 , the advocate general of the european court of justice advised that the law was incompatible with eu treaties guaranteeing the free movement of capital , and the court itself is certain to follow his advice later this year . the move by porsche to raise its stake also confirms its desire to tighten its control of a company with which it has close historical and industrial links .
porsche and vw developed the cayenne and touareg four-wheel-drive models in a joint venture , and two senior porsche executives sit on the vw board .
porsche 's increased stake will also protect vw from any foreign takeover . increased stake but no immediate takeover plans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : porsche is the largest but not the majority shareholder however , while analysts believe that the move signals porsche 's intent to lay the groundwork for an eventual takeover or merger involving vw , the company itself made it clear that it had no intention of acquiring a majority stake in vw . " we do not expect many volkswagen shareholders to offer us their shares , which means simply that we intend to go to 31 percent , " a spokesman said in a statement .
" we do not by any means intend to take over . " porsche is offering other shareholders 100.92 euros -lrb- $ -rrb- per share , 14 percent less than the € 117.70 closing price on friday which values the vw group at 33 billion euros . wiedeking said that as the global car market gets increasingly and fiercely competitive , the move to bolster the ability of both groups to meet the challenges of the industry was " a logical step .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the european union turns 50 the day the eu was born eu leaders adopt 50th anniversary berlin declaration founding fathers : europeans behind the union text of the berlin declaration to mark 50 years of the eu europe -pipe- 26.03.2007 eu ponders more questions than answers amid celebrations großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the berlin declaration set out plans for the eu 's future but how much is it really worth ?
the european union celebrated its 50th birthday on sunday , but critics said a much publicized statement marking the occasion papers over the cracks and the divisive differences over how to meet new challenges . the blueprint for the future was contained in a berlin declaration signed by chancellor angela merkel during an informal gathering with the other 26 eu leaders in the german capital . while the two-page document proudly noted the progress made since the eu was founded , it avoided mentioning controversial issues like the bloc 's christian roots , enlargement and the eu constitution . instead there were general references to fighting " terrorism , organized crime and illegal immigration together , " as well as intentions to " jointly lead the way in energy policy and climate protection . " but it fell a long way short of " the creative madness " which italian premier romano prodi said was needed by the eu to show that the world can be changed . party snubs and enlargement fatigue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey was unhappy at not being invited to the party accession candidates like turkey had complained in advance about prospective newcomers not being invited to the birthday party , saying " it would have been meaningful , in terms of demonstrating once again the unity of the european family . " this unity has given way to " enlargement fatigue " in countries like germany where polls show there is little appetite to take on more members after the 12 mostly eastern european nations that have joined since 2004 . but other states like ireland and britain are in favor of newcomers joining the bloc , which has seen its population balloon to nearly 500 million since the founding treaty of rome was signed in 1957 . the german chancellor said the eu has become so big that it needs to take on a new role to become more effective .
a constitution is the best way to achieve this , she believes . resuscitating the treaty , which has been on ice since its rejection by french and dutch voters in 2005 , was so divisive that it was omitted from the berlin declaration altogether . merkel dedicated to eu constitution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is leading the championing of the constitution merkel hopes to present a road map on how to proceed with the treaty before germany 's six-month presidency of the union expires at the end of june . " we are united in our aim of placing the european union on a renewed common basis before the european parliament elections in 2009 , " was the compromise formula that appeared in the berlin declaration . while merkel would like to keep the " substance " of the moribund 485-page constitution , objections have come from britain , poland and the czech republic , among others . britain opposes surrendering control of its foreign policy to an eu foreign minister , while the czech republic believes the target date of 2009 , when it will hold the eu presidency , is too early . poland fears it is unfairly treated in the proposed voting system in the treaty , which gives votes according to population , thus making germany the major beneficiary in decision-making issues because it is europe 's biggest nation . critics say declaration ignores real problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is still a lot of work to be done " the real problem issues are just being postponed , " said daniela schwarzer , a senior fellow at the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- . if merkel insists on having the treaty ready by 2009 the differences will have to be sorted out by the end of this year , according to german television analyst udo van kampen . this is because the document will need to be ratified by all 27 national parliaments , a cumbersome process that could take as long as 18 months . failure to do this could revive the discussion of a two-speed europe , with one group pressing ahead with political and economic union ahead of the rest . however , the german presidency remains optimistic and insists " the goal remains a constitution , " effectively dismissing suggestions that some kind of watered-down document that addresses only the administrative difficulties would suffice . the berlin declaration did not please pope benedict xvi , who said that europe was facing an identity crisis because of policies which had also resulted in a low birthrate . the pontiff was especially critical of the fact that there was no reference to europe being a christian community , something which was left out of the berlin declaration despite objections from poland . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu leaders adopt 50th anniversary berlin declaration european union leaders adopted sunday a 50th anniversary declaration setting 2009 as the deadline for preparing a new treaty , following the failure of the bloc 's constitution .

the european union celebrated its 50th birthday on sunday , but critics said a much publicized statement marking the occasion papers over the cracks and the divisive differences over how to meet new challenges . the blueprint for the future was contained in a berlin declaration signed by chancellor angela merkel during an informal gathering with the other 26 eu leaders in the german capital . while the two-page document proudly noted the progress made since the eu was founded , it avoided mentioning controversial issues like the bloc 's christian roots , enlargement and the eu constitution . instead there were general references to fighting " terrorism , organized crime and illegal immigration together , " as well as intentions to " jointly lead the way in energy policy and climate protection .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : development aid to africa tops g8 agenda " the lack of a global response to aids is a catastrophe " rock stars urge g8 industrialized nations to deliver on africa aid experts question g8 's emphasis on africa europe rushes to stem flood of cocaine coming through africa development aid -pipe- 26.03.2007 g8 development ministers seek ways to meet african aid goals großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts said better coordination among rich countries is needed when providing aid to africa there will be plenty of self-congratulatory talk as g8 development ministers meet in berlin for a two-day meeting , but some say the credit for cutting poverty should go to creative statistical tricks . there is a good chance that the meeting , which is intended to find ways of forming partnerships with africa and assessing progress towards cutting extreme poverty by 50 percent before 2015 , will end with a positive report for the un goals , according to german green party development policy expert uschi eid . she underlined the progress made in creating new instruments of political partnership with the financial and consulting help of the african union 's security commission as well as the kofi annan international peace keeping training center in ghana . by the end of the g8 meeting there should be a plan to help africa 's democratic nations push ahead with political and social reforms and open their countries to investors , said eid , who organized former german chancellor gerhard schröder 's g8 development policy for africa . continent of broken promises bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : african countries have heard numerous promises of additional help but that rosy prospect is not shared by everyone .
the african continent has been the object of numerous broken promises and has reason to be skeptical , according to reinhard hermle , former head of the association of german development non-governmental organizations . he said he remembers the 2001 meeting in gleneagles , where he and other participants agreed to invest $ 50 billion in development aid .
half of that aid was intended for africa , but hermle said that remains a goal from which " we are still very far . " " chancellor schröder had promised to spend 0.51 percent of the german gross social product on development aid by 2010 , " he said .
" now we are at 0.36 percent , but we are observing that much of what is being included in calculations does not result in money reaching africa . " one example of creative bookkeeping , according to hermle , was pointless debt relief for iraq from which the country did not benefit because it had already stopped servicing its debts . poverty decline spread unevenly bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few african nations are likely to halve poverty by 2015 similar statistical effects could also be employed with the un 's millennium development goals , to which 189 un member states agreed to cut in half the number of people living on less than $ 1 per day . it 's a goal hermle said would likely be achieved due to improving economic conditions in a few nations with large populations . " highly populated countries like india and china are making large economic progress , " he said , adding that when the countries ' total population of 2.5 billion is projected on the world 's population the goal of cutting poverty in half can be reached .
" but it is a statistical trick . " while the absolute number of people living in poverty will drop by 50 percent , few african nations will be able to claim poverty dropped in their country by the same rate , hermle said . working with emerging nations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : money helps but can not solve all africa 's problems , eid said representatives from brazil , india , mexico and south africa will be present at the meeting of g8 nations , made up of canada , france , germany , italy , japan , russia , the united kingdom and the united states , for the first time . the emerging countries ' presence is due to their increasing international political and economic influence that in turn has led to shift in international politics , according to german development minster heidemarie wieczorek-zeul , who is chairing the berlin summit . she said the countries ' increased influence could lead to triangle partnerships with a g8 member pairing with an emerging country to provide development aid for a third country . " one should shape the reformed partnerships with developing and emerging countries to answer the question of what changes to the partnership are necessary and what help we can provide , " eid said .
" we are focused on democratization , social reforms and economic growth . " more money needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wieczorek-zeul said new types of cooperation are required the tasks facing the industrialized world are clear , according to hermle . " more money has to be made available , " he said .
" the cooperation between north and south has to be improved .
the donor countries have to coordinate better , it should not be that every rich country runs its own bilateral development policy .
coordination reduces costs and makes the aid more efficient . " much , however , will also depend on african governments ' will to change and open to investment , eid added . " to say that development cooperation can fundamentally solve africa 's problems is wrong , " she said . ina rottscheidt -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel : eu needs to do more to combat aids against a backdrop 40 million hiv infections around the world , eu officials met in bremen to discuss measures to combat the pandemic .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : development aid to africa tops g8 agenda " the lack of a global response to aids is a catastrophe " rock stars urge g8 industrialized nations to deliver on africa aid experts question g8 's emphasis on africa europe rushes to stem flood of cocaine coming through africa europe -pipe- 26.03.2007 g8 development ministers seek ways to meet african aid goals großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts said better coordination among rich countries is needed when providing aid to africa there will be plenty of self-congratulatory talk as g8 development ministers meet in berlin for a two-day meeting , but some say the credit for cutting poverty should go to creative statistical tricks . there is a good chance that the meeting , which is intended to find ways of forming partnerships with africa and assessing progress towards cutting extreme poverty by 50 percent before 2015 , will end with a positive report for the un goals , according to german green party development policy expert uschi eid . she underlined the progress made in creating new instruments of political partnership with the financial and consulting help of the african union 's security commission as well as the kofi annan international peace keeping training center in ghana . by the end of the g8 meeting there should be a plan to help africa 's democratic nations push ahead with political and social reforms and open their countries to investors , said eid , who organized former german chancellor gerhard schröder 's g8 development policy for africa . continent of broken promises bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : african countries have heard numerous promises of additional help but that rosy prospect is not shared by everyone .
the african continent has been the object of numerous broken promises and has reason to be skeptical , according to reinhard hermle , former head of the association of german development non-governmental organizations . he said he remembers the 2001 meeting in gleneagles , where he and other participants agreed to invest $ 50 billion in development aid .
half of that aid was intended for africa , but hermle said that remains a goal from which " we are still very far . " " chancellor schröder had promised to spend 0.51 percent of the german gross social product on development aid by 2010 , " he said .
" now we are at 0.36 percent , but we are observing that much of what is being included in calculations does not result in money reaching africa . " one example of creative bookkeeping , according to hermle , was pointless debt relief for iraq from which the country did not benefit because it had already stopped servicing its debts . poverty decline spread unevenly bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few african nations are likely to halve poverty by 2015 similar statistical effects could also be employed with the un 's millennium development goals , to which 189 un member states agreed to cut in half the number of people living on less than $ 1 per day . it 's a goal hermle said would likely be achieved due to improving economic conditions in a few nations with large populations . " highly populated countries like india and china are making large economic progress , " he said , adding that when the countries ' total population of 2.5 billion is projected on the world 's population the goal of cutting poverty in half can be reached .
" but it is a statistical trick . " while the absolute number of people living in poverty will drop by 50 percent , few african nations will be able to claim poverty dropped in their country by the same rate , hermle said . working with emerging nations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : money helps but can not solve all africa 's problems , eid said representatives from brazil , india , mexico and south africa will be present at the meeting of g8 nations , made up of canada , france , germany , italy , japan , russia , the united kingdom and the united states , for the first time . the emerging countries ' presence is due to their increasing international political and economic influence that in turn has led to shift in international politics , according to german development minster heidemarie wieczorek-zeul , who is chairing the berlin summit . she said the countries ' increased influence could lead to triangle partnerships with a g8 member pairing with an emerging country to provide development aid for a third country . " one should shape the reformed partnerships with developing and emerging countries to answer the question of what changes to the partnership are necessary and what help we can provide , " eid said .
" we are focused on democratization , social reforms and economic growth . " more money needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wieczorek-zeul said new types of cooperation are required the tasks facing the industrialized world are clear , according to hermle . " more money has to be made available , " he said .
" the cooperation between north and south has to be improved .
the donor countries have to coordinate better , it should not be that every rich country runs its own bilateral development policy .
coordination reduces costs and makes the aid more efficient . " much , however , will also depend on african governments ' will to change and open to investment , eid added . " to say that development cooperation can fundamentally solve africa 's problems is wrong , " she said . ina rottscheidt -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel : eu needs to do more to combat aids against a backdrop 40 million hiv infections around the world , eu officials met in bremen to discuss measures to combat the pandemic .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 26.03.2007 opinion : a pointless resolution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un security council 's latest resolution that imposes sanctions on iran for refusing to halt its nuclear program can only make it more difficult to solve the problem , writes dw 's peter philipp . un security council sanctions used to carry ominous weight .
that no longer seems to be the case - at least in the case of iran .
for the second time in four months , tehran has been condemned because of its nuclear policy .
the country 's foreign minister , manouchehr mottaki , may condemn the latest resolution as much as he wants , but he 'll probably be right when he says that the resolution will have no effect . after long and bitter debate , the mountain has given birth to a mouse : arms trade with iran is supposed to be outlawed and the bank accounts of a few more iranians , who work in the arms and nuclear sectors , are to be frozen . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : again tehran is called on for the last time to stop enriching uranium in order to begin negotiations about a peaceful nuclear collaboration .
disregarding any visa difficulties he might have had , iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad really did n't need to bother appearing before the council : such a resolution is as toothless as it is without effect . what , for example , is meant to be achieved with an arms embargo ?
in times , when even civilian airplanes can no longer be delivered to iran , no one will openly broker arms deals with tehran .
and why should a resolution - any more than the unifil troops - be able to stop iranian arms exports to the lebanese hezbollah ? iran rejects the council 's actions as unacceptable .
as chief witnesses for their case , tehran officials could draw on some un ambassadors - such as the french one - who emphasized before the meeting that iran naturally has a right to peaceful use of nuclear power . it 's a right that includes enriching uranium as long as this only happens in low concentrations .
but that 's exactly the center of the conflict : the security council does not differentiate between enriching for energy generation and producing arms .
it simply assumed that iran is aiming for nuclear weapons without having the slightest proof for this .
it 's doubtful whether people are even convinced themselves : would they otherwise stop at freezing bank accounts and banning an arms trade that 's impossible to control ? had the case remained with the international atomic energy agency in vienna , chances for a solution would have been much better .
to make washington happy , however , it was brought before the council , which has problems to deal with it .
everyone seems to know that a solution can not be found this way and that things could get even more complicated - as the incident regarding british soldiers who were arrested after allegedly entering iranian territory shows . middle east ex per t peter philipp is deutsche welle 's chief correspondent -lrb- win -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran faces isolation as security council agrees further sanctions the un security council has slapped new sanctions on iran over its suspect nuclear program as western powers warned tehran it faced becoming even more internationally isolated .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de news -pipe- 26.03.2007 opinion : a pointless resolution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un security council 's latest resolution that imposes sanctions on iran for refusing to halt its nuclear program can only make it more difficult to solve the problem , writes dw 's peter philipp . un security council sanctions used to carry ominous weight .
that no longer seems to be the case - at least in the case of iran .
for the second time in four months , tehran has been condemned because of its nuclear policy .
the country 's foreign minister , manouchehr mottaki , may condemn the latest resolution as much as he wants , but he 'll probably be right when he says that the resolution will have no effect . after long and bitter debate , the mountain has given birth to a mouse : arms trade with iran is supposed to be outlawed and the bank accounts of a few more iranians , who work in the arms and nuclear sectors , are to be frozen . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : again tehran is called on for the last time to stop enriching uranium in order to begin negotiations about a peaceful nuclear collaboration .
disregarding any visa difficulties he might have had , iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad really did n't need to bother appearing before the council : such a resolution is as toothless as it is without effect . what , for example , is meant to be achieved with an arms embargo ?
in times , when even civilian airplanes can no longer be delivered to iran , no one will openly broker arms deals with tehran .
and why should a resolution - any more than the unifil troops - be able to stop iranian arms exports to the lebanese hezbollah ? iran rejects the council 's actions as unacceptable .
as chief witnesses for their case , tehran officials could draw on some un ambassadors - such as the french one - who emphasized before the meeting that iran naturally has a right to peaceful use of nuclear power . it 's a right that includes enriching uranium as long as this only happens in low concentrations .
but that 's exactly the center of the conflict : the security council does not differentiate between enriching for energy generation and producing arms .
it simply assumed that iran is aiming for nuclear weapons without having the slightest proof for this .
it 's doubtful whether people are even convinced themselves : would they otherwise stop at freezing bank accounts and banning an arms trade that 's impossible to control ? had the case remained with the international atomic energy agency in vienna , chances for a solution would have been much better .
to make washington happy , however , it was brought before the council , which has problems to deal with it .
everyone seems to know that a solution can not be found this way and that things could get even more complicated - as the incident regarding british soldiers who were arrested after allegedly entering iranian territory shows . middle east ex per t peter philipp is deutsche welle 's chief correspondent -lrb- win -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran faces isolation as security council agrees further sanctions the un security council has slapped new sanctions on iran over its suspect nuclear program as western powers warned tehran it faced becoming even more internationally isolated .
-lrb- 25.03.2007 -rrb- britain searching for answers as troops remain held in iran international pressure mounted on iran on sunday to free 15 british naval personnel but british authorities admitted they do not know where the group are being held .

" this forms the basis for enel 's development on the european electricity market , " said enel chief fulvio conti following the announcement of his company 's pact with acciona . while e.on 's latest bid values endesa at 42.4 billion euros , the enel-acciona offer would bring endesa 's value to 43.4 billion euros . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : e.on chief wulf bernotat is confident their offer will be accepted e.on chief wulf bernotat said his company was " convinced that our increased offer at 40 euros a share will be the only one for endesa in the foreseeable future . " a new force in the global energy market a tie-up between endesa and e.on would create a new force in the global energy market with more than 22 million customers and a business empire stretching from europe , through to the us and south america . e.on , however , needs at least 50 percent for its bid to succeed .
analysts believe that e.on faces an uphill battle to secure control of endesa as enel and acciona together already hold about a 46 per cent stake in endesa . under their takeover plan , acciona would raise its stake in endesa to 50.1 per cent , while enel would hold the rest . the cnmv ruled friday that enel and acciona could not launch a bid for six months after the e.on bid expires and gave e.on until monday to improve its offer . however , acciona told the cnmv that the joint bid with enel would be launched as soon as " legally possible . "
the cnmv is to due to issue a new ruling on the acciona-enel proposed bid before markets open in spain on tuesday . e.on takes legal action against rivals but with tensions surrounding the endesa battle rising , e.on hit back launching legal moves against enel and acciona monday and calling on the cnmv to mount action against the two companies for market disruption , breaching tender offer rules , and insider trading . at the same time , e.on said that acciona and enel should be forced to divest their shareholdings in endesa and be prohibited from buying up any endesa shares . the german company also commenced court action in new york against acciona and enel , claiming that two companies had breached us disclosure rules . in a strongly worded statement , e.on lashed out at acciona and enel accusing them of " unlawful actions " which it said " were an attempt to deceive endesa 's shareholders and to manipulate the market price of endesa stock .

now , after the sniping between animal-lovers and irate farmers has died down , the struggle has become a political row between germany and italy over ownership . bruno began his fateful last journey from the adamello-brenta nature reserve in italy 's northern trentino region last spring , where italian authorities recently reintroduced his species .
ambling off as wild bears are wont to do , bruno unknowingly crossed the alpine border , first into austria and then germany where he was shot dead last summer . and this is where the problem lies .
the state of bavaria says that bruno should be laid to rest where he died , while the italian environment minister alfonso scanio wants the corpse back in trentino .
at the moment , bruno is on ice at an undisclosed secure location somewhere in bavaria - but for how long ? fur flies in carcass tug-of-war bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bear necessity : everyone wants a piece of bruno scanio appears to be a man who will not rest until he gets his bear .
he continues to lobby his german counterpart sigmar gabriel for his support in getting bruno repatriated , who in turn has " passed on " the italian 's wishes a number of times to werner schnappauf , bavaria 's minister of the environment . however , schnappauf is having none of it : the bear stays here , he says - and has told gabriel many times that the increasingly aggressive requests from the italians for the return of the corpse have " no judicial basis . "
schnappauf has said that it does n't matter how many times gabriel passes on scanio 's demands .
the legal situation is unquestionable .
" an animal born in the wilderness belongs to the land in which it dies , " he says . the italians strongly disagree .
a recent fax from rome to the bavarian environment minister stated that bruno was part of the italian project for the reintroduction of the brown bear and therefore property of the italian state . who bears wins bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schnauppauf : " bruno stays where he died " schnappauf believes that bruno , the first brown bear to be spotted in germany for over 170 years , should be made " accessible to the general public , " which means he thinks the bear should be stuffed and housed in a museum .
while schnappauf has n't actually gone as far as saying those actual words , it is believed that the munich museum is already being lined up to take the corpse . the bavarians seem confident that bruno will stay with them while the italians will not take no for an answer .
neither side is ready to give ground or strike a deal ; no compromise over parts of fur , bones or innards .
whoever gets the bear gets the whole package .
winner takes all . bruno , it seems , in death as in life , continues to be a problem bear . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fringe opinion : the cult of knut knut the polar bear cub is the darling of the world 's media at the moment - and with his unbearable cuteness and heart-warming story of survival , rightly so .
but what does his elevation to superstardom say about us ? -lrb- 24.03.2007 -rrb- bruno the bear on the move once more dangerous killer , or folk hero ?
despite the fact that rigor mortis set in long ago , the saga of bruno the bear has taken yet another turn .

the european union celebrated its 50th birthday on sunday , but critics said a much publicized statement marking the occasion papers over the cracks and the divisive differences over how to meet new challenges . the blueprint for the future was contained in a berlin declaration signed by chancellor angela merkel during an informal gathering with the other 26 eu leaders in the german capital . while the two-page document proudly noted the progress made since the eu was founded , it avoided mentioning controversial issues like the bloc 's christian roots , enlargement and the eu constitution . instead there were general references to fighting " terrorism , organized crime and illegal immigration together , " as well as intentions to " jointly lead the way in energy policy and climate protection . " but it fell a long way short of " the creative madness " which italian premier romano prodi said was needed by the eu to show that the world can be changed . party snubs and enlargement fatigue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey was unhappy at not being invited to the party accession candidates like turkey had complained in advance about prospective newcomers not being invited to the birthday party , saying " it would have been meaningful , in terms of demonstrating once again the unity of the european family . " this unity has given way to " enlargement fatigue " in countries like germany where polls show there is little appetite to take on more members after the 12 mostly eastern european nations that have joined since 2004 . but other states like ireland and britain are in favor of newcomers joining the bloc , which has seen its population balloon to nearly 500 million since the founding treaty of rome was signed in 1957 . the german chancellor said the eu has become so big that it needs to take on a new role to become more effective .
a constitution is the best way to achieve this , she believes . resuscitating the treaty , which has been on ice since its rejection by french and dutch voters in 2005 , was so divisive that it was omitted from the berlin declaration altogether . merkel dedicated to eu constitution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is leading the championing of the constitution merkel hopes to present a road map on how to proceed with the treaty before germany 's six-month presidency of the union expires at the end of june . " we are united in our aim of placing the european union on a renewed common basis before the european parliament elections in 2009 , " was the compromise formula that appeared in the berlin declaration . while merkel would like to keep the " substance " of the moribund 485-page constitution , objections have come from britain , poland and the czech republic , among others . britain opposes surrendering control of its foreign policy to an eu foreign minister , while the czech republic believes the target date of 2009 , when it will hold the eu presidency , is too early . poland fears it is unfairly treated in the proposed voting system in the treaty , which gives votes according to population , thus making germany the major beneficiary in decision-making issues because it is europe 's biggest nation . critics say declaration ignores real problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is still a lot of work to be done " the real problem issues are just being postponed , " said daniela schwarzer , a senior fellow at the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- . if merkel insists on having the treaty ready by 2009 the differences will have to be sorted out by the end of this year , according to german television analyst udo van kampen . this is because the document will need to be ratified by all 27 national parliaments , a cumbersome process that could take as long as 18 months . failure to do this could revive the discussion of a two-speed europe , with one group pressing ahead with political and economic union ahead of the rest . however , the german presidency remains optimistic and insists " the goal remains a constitution , " effectively dismissing suggestions that some kind of watered-down document that addresses only the administrative difficulties would suffice . the berlin declaration did not please pope benedict xvi , who said that europe was facing an identity crisis because of policies which had also resulted in a low birthrate . the pontiff was especially critical of the fact that there was no reference to europe being a christian community , something which was left out of the berlin declaration despite objections from poland . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu leaders adopt 50th anniversary berlin declaration european union leaders adopted sunday a 50th anniversary declaration setting 2009 as the deadline for preparing a new treaty , following the failure of the bloc 's constitution .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : development aid to africa tops g8 agenda " the lack of a global response to aids is a catastrophe " rock stars urge g8 industrialized nations to deliver on africa aid experts question g8 's emphasis on africa europe rushes to stem flood of cocaine coming through africa europe -pipe- 26.03.2007 g8 development ministers seek ways to meet african aid goals großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts said better coordination among rich countries is needed when providing aid to africa there will be plenty of self-congratulatory talk as g8 development ministers meet in berlin for a two-day meeting , but some say the credit for cutting poverty should go to creative statistical tricks . there is a good chance that the meeting , which is intended to find ways of forming partnerships with africa and assessing progress towards cutting extreme poverty by 50 percent before 2015 , will end with a positive report for the un goals , according to german green party development policy expert uschi eid . she underlined the progress made in creating new instruments of political partnership with the financial and consulting help of the african union 's security commission as well as the kofi annan international peace keeping training center in ghana . by the end of the g8 meeting there should be a plan to help africa 's democratic nations push ahead with political and social reforms and open their countries to investors , said eid , who organized former german chancellor gerhard schröder 's g8 development policy for africa . continent of broken promises bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : african countries have heard numerous promises of additional help but that rosy prospect is not shared by everyone .
the african continent has been the object of numerous broken promises and has reason to be skeptical , according to reinhard hermle , former head of the association of german development non-governmental organizations . he said he remembers the 2001 meeting in gleneagles , where he and other participants agreed to invest $ 50 billion in development aid .
half of that aid was intended for africa , but hermle said that remains a goal from which " we are still very far . " " chancellor schröder had promised to spend 0.51 percent of the german gross social product on development aid by 2010 , " he said .
" now we are at 0.36 percent , but we are observing that much of what is being included in calculations does not result in money reaching africa . " one example of creative bookkeeping , according to hermle , was pointless debt relief for iraq from which the country did not benefit because it had already stopped servicing its debts . poverty decline spread unevenly bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few african nations are likely to halve poverty by 2015 similar statistical effects could also be employed with the un 's millennium development goals , to which 189 un member states agreed to cut in half the number of people living on less than $ 1 per day . it 's a goal hermle said would likely be achieved due to improving economic conditions in a few nations with large populations . " highly populated countries like india and china are making large economic progress , " he said , adding that when the countries ' total population of 2.5 billion is projected on the world 's population the goal of cutting poverty in half can be reached .
" but it is a statistical trick . " while the absolute number of people living in poverty will drop by 50 percent , few african nations will be able to claim poverty dropped in their country by the same rate , hermle said . working with emerging nations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : money helps but can not solve all africa 's problems , eid said representatives from brazil , india , mexico and south africa will be present at the meeting of g8 nations , made up of canada , france , germany , italy , japan , russia , the united kingdom and the united states , for the first time . the emerging countries ' presence is due to their increasing international political and economic influence that in turn has led to shift in international politics , according to german development minster heidemarie wieczorek-zeul , who is chairing the berlin summit . she said the countries ' increased influence could lead to triangle partnerships with a g8 member pairing with an emerging country to provide development aid for a third country . " one should shape the reformed partnerships with developing and emerging countries to answer the question of what changes to the partnership are necessary and what help we can provide , " eid said .
" we are focused on democratization , social reforms and economic growth . " more money needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wieczorek-zeul said new types of cooperation are required the tasks facing the industrialized world are clear , according to hermle . " more money has to be made available , " he said .
" the cooperation between north and south has to be improved .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 26.03.2007 experts call for more security in sharing airline passenger data großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how much of your data is gathered by us authorities when flying to the country ?
data protection experts in the eu and the us are pushing for more security in the controversial gathering of key passenger data by us authorities from european airlines as part of measures to fight terrorism . the us and the european union are currently negotiating a permanent pact on the controversial sharing of key air passenger data which washington requires from airlines as part of heightened security measures after the september 11 terrorist attacks on new york and washington . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter schaar , germany 's top data protection official " there must be proof -lrb- that such data are useful in fighting terrorism -rrb- , there must be an independent audit or a joint review , including european data protection authorities , " german data protection commissioner peter schaar told reporters ahead of a hearing in the european parliament on monday . schaar warned that a new deal , which needs to be clinched by the end of july , might even result in a lower level of data protection than was guaranteed under previous agreements . us wants more data-sharing the us has called for more data-sharing , claiming that european privacy concerns had unreasonably hampered its counter-terrorism activities in the past few years . under the current interim pact , european air carriers are obliged to give us authorities up to 44 pieces of information on each passenger aboard america-bound flights .
the data includes credit card numbers , travel itineraries , addresses and telephone numbers . schaar said that personal data sent to us authorities should be made anonymous and the identity of their owner only be revealed if the data matched a profile in a terrorist database .
he also called for introducing a system under which data would be " pushed " to us authorities on specific request , rather than allowing the agency to " pull " the information from european airline computers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us has warned that airlines that fail to comply could face a fine a new data sharing deal has to be in place by the end of july to replace a current interim pact.however , schaar cautioned that " many , many questions remain and we are far from a solution . " washington has warned that airlines which failed to share passenger data would face fines of up to $ 6,000 per passenger and a possible loss of landing rights . " philosophical confusion " greek socialist mep stavros lambrinidis , vice-chair of the eu parliament 's civil liberties committee , said that the transatlantic privacy quarrels were signs of a " philosophical confusion between the eu and the us concerning terrorism . " " we have to look for a general understanding with the us on what is necessary to catch terrorists , " lambrinidis said .
" we are worried about the kind and quantity of data that is collected and we are concerned about how this data is used . " lambrinidis added that the eu should not only be concerned about data protection , " but also see if the data are really necessary , appropriate and important " in fighting terrorism . schaar added that a new transatlantic air passenger data deal could be challenged by national courts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : passengers flying to the us have to undergo stringent security checks the concerns were echoed by american data protection experts .
marc rotenberg , executive director and president of the electronic privacy information center in washington said in the european parliament that his group had always insisted on data protection for travelers and visitors but said that to date , persons who are not us citizens or do not have a residence permit for the country , are not afforded any protection . reconciling civil liberties with war on terror agreement on a new deal on sharing passenger data was required after the eu 's top court annulled an earlier transatlantic accord on air passenger data exchange .
however , the court 's objections related to the legal basis of the pact , not its actual contents . the eu and the us are increasingly at odds over how to reconcile civil liberties with the us-led fight against terrorism . european lawmakers have warned repeatedly that the privacy rights of eu citizens are currently unprotected against mistakes or abuse by us authorities . brussels and washington are also at loggerheads over a secret agreement between the us treasury and the belgium-based money transfer company swift , which has supplied us authorities with personal data for use in counter-terror inquiries . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu , us move closer to permanent deal of passenger data german interior minister wolfgang schäuble and us homeland security secretary michael chertoff met in berlin friday .
an extension of the passenger data exchange deal between the eu and the us seems likely .

data protection experts in the eu and the us are pushing for more security in the controversial gathering of key passenger data by us authorities from european airlines as part of measures to fight terrorism . the us and the european union are currently negotiating a permanent pact on the controversial sharing of key air passenger data which washington requires from airlines as part of heightened security measures after the september 11 terrorist attacks on new york and washington . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter schaar , germany 's top data protection official " there must be proof -lrb- that such data are useful in fighting terrorism -rrb- , there must be an independent audit or a joint review , including european data protection authorities , " german data protection commissioner peter schaar told reporters ahead of a hearing in the european parliament on monday . schaar warned that a new deal , which needs to be clinched by the end of july , might even result in a lower level of data protection than was guaranteed under previous agreements . us wants more data-sharing the us has called for more data-sharing , claiming that european privacy concerns had unreasonably hampered its counter-terrorism activities in the past few years . under the current interim pact , european air carriers are obliged to give us authorities up to 44 pieces of information on each passenger aboard america-bound flights .
the data includes credit card numbers , travel itineraries , addresses and telephone numbers . schaar said that personal data sent to us authorities should be made anonymous and the identity of their owner only be revealed if the data matched a profile in a terrorist database .
he also called for introducing a system under which data would be " pushed " to us authorities on specific request , rather than allowing the agency to " pull " the information from european airline computers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us has warned that airlines that fail to comply could face a fine a new data sharing deal has to be in place by the end of july to replace a current interim pact.however , schaar cautioned that " many , many questions remain and we are far from a solution . " washington has warned that airlines which failed to share passenger data would face fines of up to $ 6,000 per passenger and a possible loss of landing rights . " philosophical confusion " greek socialist mep stavros lambrinidis , vice-chair of the eu parliament 's civil liberties committee , said that the transatlantic privacy quarrels were signs of a " philosophical confusion between the eu and the us concerning terrorism . " " we have to look for a general understanding with the us on what is necessary to catch terrorists , " lambrinidis said .
" we are worried about the kind and quantity of data that is collected and we are concerned about how this data is used . " lambrinidis added that the eu should not only be concerned about data protection , " but also see if the data are really necessary , appropriate and important " in fighting terrorism . schaar added that a new transatlantic air passenger data deal could be challenged by national courts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : passengers flying to the us have to undergo stringent security checks the concerns were echoed by american data protection experts .
marc rotenberg , executive director and president of the electronic privacy information center in washington said in the european parliament that his group had always insisted on data protection for travelers and visitors but said that to date , persons who are not us citizens or do not have a residence permit for the country , are not afforded any protection . reconciling civil liberties with war on terror agreement on a new deal on sharing passenger data was required after the eu 's top court annulled an earlier transatlantic accord on air passenger data exchange .
however , the court 's objections related to the legal basis of the pact , not its actual contents . the eu and the us are increasingly at odds over how to reconcile civil liberties with the us-led fight against terrorism . european lawmakers have warned repeatedly that the privacy rights of eu citizens are currently unprotected against mistakes or abuse by us authorities . brussels and washington are also at loggerheads over a secret agreement between the us treasury and the belgium-based money transfer company swift , which has supplied us authorities with personal data for use in counter-terror inquiries . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu , us move closer to permanent deal of passenger data german interior minister wolfgang schäuble and us homeland security secretary michael chertoff met in berlin friday .

the european union celebrated its 50th birthday on sunday , but critics said a much publicized statement marking the occasion papers over the cracks and the divisive differences over how to meet new challenges . the blueprint for the future was contained in a berlin declaration signed by chancellor angela merkel during an informal gathering with the other 26 eu leaders in the german capital . while the two-page document proudly noted the progress made since the eu was founded , it avoided mentioning controversial issues like the bloc 's christian roots , enlargement and the eu constitution . instead there were general references to fighting " terrorism , organized crime and illegal immigration together , " as well as intentions to " jointly lead the way in energy policy and climate protection . " but it fell a long way short of " the creative madness " which italian premier romano prodi said was needed by the eu to show that the world can be changed . party snubs and enlargement fatigue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey was unhappy at not being invited to the party accession candidates like turkey had complained in advance about prospective newcomers not being invited to the birthday party , saying " it would have been meaningful , in terms of demonstrating once again the unity of the european family . " this unity has given way to " enlargement fatigue " in countries like germany where polls show there is little appetite to take on more members after the 12 mostly eastern european nations that have joined since 2004 . but other states like ireland and britain are in favor of newcomers joining the bloc , which has seen its population balloon to nearly 500 million since the founding treaty of rome was signed in 1957 . the german chancellor said the eu has become so big that it needs to take on a new role to become more effective .
a constitution is the best way to achieve this , she believes . resuscitating the treaty , which has been on ice since its rejection by french and dutch voters in 2005 , was so divisive that it was omitted from the berlin declaration altogether . merkel dedicated to eu constitution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is leading the championing of the constitution merkel hopes to present a road map on how to proceed with the treaty before germany 's six-month presidency of the union expires at the end of june . " we are united in our aim of placing the european union on a renewed common basis before the european parliament elections in 2009 , " was the compromise formula that appeared in the berlin declaration . while merkel would like to keep the " substance " of the moribund 485-page constitution , objections have come from britain , poland and the czech republic , among others . britain opposes surrendering control of its foreign policy to an eu foreign minister , while the czech republic believes the target date of 2009 , when it will hold the eu presidency , is too early . poland fears it is unfairly treated in the proposed voting system in the treaty , which gives votes according to population , thus making germany the major beneficiary in decision-making issues because it is europe 's biggest nation . critics say declaration ignores real problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is still a lot of work to be done " the real problem issues are just being postponed , " said daniela schwarzer , a senior fellow at the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- . if merkel insists on having the treaty ready by 2009 the differences will have to be sorted out by the end of this year , according to german television analyst udo van kampen . this is because the document will need to be ratified by all 27 national parliaments , a cumbersome process that could take as long as 18 months . failure to do this could revive the discussion of a two-speed europe , with one group pressing ahead with political and economic union ahead of the rest . however , the german presidency remains optimistic and insists " the goal remains a constitution , " effectively dismissing suggestions that some kind of watered-down document that addresses only the administrative difficulties would suffice . the berlin declaration did not please pope benedict xvi , who said that europe was facing an identity crisis because of policies which had also resulted in a low birthrate . the pontiff was especially critical of the fact that there was no reference to europe being a christian community , something which was left out of the berlin declaration despite objections from poland . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu leaders adopt 50th anniversary berlin declaration european union leaders adopted sunday a 50th anniversary declaration setting 2009 as the deadline for preparing a new treaty , following the failure of the bloc 's constitution .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de news -pipe- 26.03.2007 opinion : a pointless resolution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un security council 's latest resolution that imposes sanctions on iran for refusing to halt its nuclear program can only make it more difficult to solve the problem , writes dw 's peter philipp . un security council sanctions used to carry ominous weight .
that no longer seems to be the case - at least in the case of iran .
for the second time in four months , tehran has been condemned because of its nuclear policy .
the country 's foreign minister , manouchehr mottaki , may condemn the latest resolution as much as he wants , but he 'll probably be right when he says that the resolution will have no effect . after long and bitter debate , the mountain has given birth to a mouse : arms trade with iran is supposed to be outlawed and the bank accounts of a few more iranians , who work in the arms and nuclear sectors , are to be frozen . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : again tehran is called on for the last time to stop enriching uranium in order to begin negotiations about a peaceful nuclear collaboration .
disregarding any visa difficulties he might have had , iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad really did n't need to bother appearing before the council : such a resolution is as toothless as it is without effect . what , for example , is meant to be achieved with an arms embargo ?
in times , when even civilian airplanes can no longer be delivered to iran , no one will openly broker arms deals with tehran .
and why should a resolution - any more than the unifil troops - be able to stop iranian arms exports to the lebanese hezbollah ? iran rejects the council 's actions as unacceptable .
as chief witnesses for their case , tehran officials could draw on some un ambassadors - such as the french one - who emphasized before the meeting that iran naturally has a right to peaceful use of nuclear power . it 's a right that includes enriching uranium as long as this only happens in low concentrations .
but that 's exactly the center of the conflict : the security council does not differentiate between enriching for energy generation and producing arms .
it simply assumed that iran is aiming for nuclear weapons without having the slightest proof for this .
it 's doubtful whether people are even convinced themselves : would they otherwise stop at freezing bank accounts and banning an arms trade that 's impossible to control ? had the case remained with the international atomic energy agency in vienna , chances for a solution would have been much better .
to make washington happy , however , it was brought before the council , which has problems to deal with it .
everyone seems to know that a solution can not be found this way and that things could get even more complicated - as the incident regarding british soldiers who were arrested after allegedly entering iranian territory shows . middle east ex per t peter philipp is deutsche welle 's chief correspondent -lrb- win -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran faces isolation as security council agrees further sanctions the un security council has slapped new sanctions on iran over its suspect nuclear program as western powers warned tehran it faced becoming even more internationally isolated .

" this forms the basis for enel 's development on the european electricity market , " said enel chief fulvio conti following the announcement of his company 's pact with acciona . while e.on 's latest bid values endesa at 42.4 billion euros , the enel-acciona offer would bring endesa 's value to 43.4 billion euros . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : e.on chief wulf bernotat is confident their offer will be accepted e.on chief wulf bernotat said his company was " convinced that our increased offer at 40 euros a share will be the only one for endesa in the foreseeable future . " a new force in the global energy market a tie-up between endesa and e.on would create a new force in the global energy market with more than 22 million customers and a business empire stretching from europe , through to the us and south america . e.on , however , needs at least 50 percent for its bid to succeed .
analysts believe that e.on faces an uphill battle to secure control of endesa as enel and acciona together already hold about a 46 per cent stake in endesa . under their takeover plan , acciona would raise its stake in endesa to 50.1 per cent , while enel would hold the rest . the cnmv ruled friday that enel and acciona could not launch a bid for six months after the e.on bid expires and gave e.on until monday to improve its offer . however , acciona told the cnmv that the joint bid with enel would be launched as soon as " legally possible . "
the cnmv is to due to issue a new ruling on the acciona-enel proposed bid before markets open in spain on tuesday . e.on takes legal action against rivals but with tensions surrounding the endesa battle rising , e.on hit back launching legal moves against enel and acciona monday and calling on the cnmv to mount action against the two companies for market disruption , breaching tender offer rules , and insider trading . at the same time , e.on said that acciona and enel should be forced to divest their shareholdings in endesa and be prohibited from buying up any endesa shares . the german company also commenced court action in new york against acciona and enel , claiming that two companies had breached us disclosure rules . in a strongly worded statement , e.on lashed out at acciona and enel accusing them of " unlawful actions " which it said " were an attempt to deceive endesa 's shareholders and to manipulate the market price of endesa stock . " this is the third time that e.on has been forced to raise it bid since launching its takeover push in february 2006 . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de e.on calls for european energy market , lowers endesa bid the head of germany 's largest energy concern , e.on , has called for a european energy market , grouping germany and six of its neighbors .

" this forms the basis for enel 's development on the european electricity market , " said enel chief fulvio conti following the announcement of his company 's pact with acciona . while e.on 's latest bid values endesa at 42.4 billion euros , the enel-acciona offer would bring endesa 's value to 43.4 billion euros . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : e.on chief wulf bernotat is confident their offer will be accepted e.on chief wulf bernotat said his company was " convinced that our increased offer at 40 euros a share will be the only one for endesa in the foreseeable future . " a new force in the global energy market a tie-up between endesa and e.on would create a new force in the global energy market with more than 22 million customers and a business empire stretching from europe , through to the us and south america . e.on , however , needs at least 50 percent for its bid to succeed .
analysts believe that e.on faces an uphill battle to secure control of endesa as enel and acciona together already hold about a 46 per cent stake in endesa . under their takeover plan , acciona would raise its stake in endesa to 50.1 per cent , while enel would hold the rest . the cnmv ruled friday that enel and acciona could not launch a bid for six months after the e.on bid expires and gave e.on until monday to improve its offer . however , acciona told the cnmv that the joint bid with enel would be launched as soon as " legally possible . "
the cnmv is to due to issue a new ruling on the acciona-enel proposed bid before markets open in spain on tuesday . e.on takes legal action against rivals but with tensions surrounding the endesa battle rising , e.on hit back launching legal moves against enel and acciona monday and calling on the cnmv to mount action against the two companies for market disruption , breaching tender offer rules , and insider trading . at the same time , e.on said that acciona and enel should be forced to divest their shareholdings in endesa and be prohibited from buying up any endesa shares . the german company also commenced court action in new york against acciona and enel , claiming that two companies had breached us disclosure rules . in a strongly worded statement , e.on lashed out at acciona and enel accusing them of " unlawful actions " which it said " were an attempt to deceive endesa 's shareholders and to manipulate the market price of endesa stock . " this is the third time that e.on has been forced to raise it bid since launching its takeover push in february 2006 . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de e.on calls for european energy market , lowers endesa bid the head of germany 's largest energy concern , e.on , has called for a european energy market , grouping germany and six of its neighbors .

data protection experts in the eu and the us are pushing for more security in the controversial gathering of key passenger data by us authorities from european airlines as part of measures to fight terrorism . the us and the european union are currently negotiating a permanent pact on the controversial sharing of key air passenger data which washington requires from airlines as part of heightened security measures after the september 11 terrorist attacks on new york and washington . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter schaar , germany 's top data protection official " there must be proof -lrb- that such data are useful in fighting terrorism -rrb- , there must be an independent audit or a joint review , including european data protection authorities , " german data protection commissioner peter schaar told reporters ahead of a hearing in the european parliament on monday . schaar warned that a new deal , which needs to be clinched by the end of july , might even result in a lower level of data protection than was guaranteed under previous agreements . us wants more data-sharing the us has called for more data-sharing , claiming that european privacy concerns had unreasonably hampered its counter-terrorism activities in the past few years . under the current interim pact , european air carriers are obliged to give us authorities up to 44 pieces of information on each passenger aboard america-bound flights .
the data includes credit card numbers , travel itineraries , addresses and telephone numbers . schaar said that personal data sent to us authorities should be made anonymous and the identity of their owner only be revealed if the data matched a profile in a terrorist database .
he also called for introducing a system under which data would be " pushed " to us authorities on specific request , rather than allowing the agency to " pull " the information from european airline computers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us has warned that airlines that fail to comply could face a fine a new data sharing deal has to be in place by the end of july to replace a current interim pact.however , schaar cautioned that " many , many questions remain and we are far from a solution . " washington has warned that airlines which failed to share passenger data would face fines of up to $ 6,000 per passenger and a possible loss of landing rights . " philosophical confusion " greek socialist mep stavros lambrinidis , vice-chair of the eu parliament 's civil liberties committee , said that the transatlantic privacy quarrels were signs of a " philosophical confusion between the eu and the us concerning terrorism . " " we have to look for a general understanding with the us on what is necessary to catch terrorists , " lambrinidis said .
" we are worried about the kind and quantity of data that is collected and we are concerned about how this data is used . " lambrinidis added that the eu should not only be concerned about data protection , " but also see if the data are really necessary , appropriate and important " in fighting terrorism . schaar added that a new transatlantic air passenger data deal could be challenged by national courts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : passengers flying to the us have to undergo stringent security checks the concerns were echoed by american data protection experts .
marc rotenberg , executive director and president of the electronic privacy information center in washington said in the european parliament that his group had always insisted on data protection for travelers and visitors but said that to date , persons who are not us citizens or do not have a residence permit for the country , are not afforded any protection . reconciling civil liberties with war on terror agreement on a new deal on sharing passenger data was required after the eu 's top court annulled an earlier transatlantic accord on air passenger data exchange .
however , the court 's objections related to the legal basis of the pact , not its actual contents . the eu and the us are increasingly at odds over how to reconcile civil liberties with the us-led fight against terrorism . european lawmakers have warned repeatedly that the privacy rights of eu citizens are currently unprotected against mistakes or abuse by us authorities . brussels and washington are also at loggerheads over a secret agreement between the us treasury and the belgium-based money transfer company swift , which has supplied us authorities with personal data for use in counter-terror inquiries . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu , us move closer to permanent deal of passenger data german interior minister wolfgang schäuble and us homeland security secretary michael chertoff met in berlin friday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 26.03.2007 experts call for more security in sharing airline passenger data großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how much of your data is gathered by us authorities when flying to the country ?
data protection experts in the eu and the us are pushing for more security in the controversial gathering of key passenger data by us authorities from european airlines as part of measures to fight terrorism . the us and the european union are currently negotiating a permanent pact on the controversial sharing of key air passenger data which washington requires from airlines as part of heightened security measures after the september 11 terrorist attacks on new york and washington . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter schaar , germany 's top data protection official " there must be proof -lrb- that such data are useful in fighting terrorism -rrb- , there must be an independent audit or a joint review , including european data protection authorities , " german data protection commissioner peter schaar told reporters ahead of a hearing in the european parliament on monday . schaar warned that a new deal , which needs to be clinched by the end of july , might even result in a lower level of data protection than was guaranteed under previous agreements . us wants more data-sharing the us has called for more data-sharing , claiming that european privacy concerns had unreasonably hampered its counter-terrorism activities in the past few years . under the current interim pact , european air carriers are obliged to give us authorities up to 44 pieces of information on each passenger aboard america-bound flights .
the data includes credit card numbers , travel itineraries , addresses and telephone numbers . schaar said that personal data sent to us authorities should be made anonymous and the identity of their owner only be revealed if the data matched a profile in a terrorist database .
he also called for introducing a system under which data would be " pushed " to us authorities on specific request , rather than allowing the agency to " pull " the information from european airline computers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us has warned that airlines that fail to comply could face a fine a new data sharing deal has to be in place by the end of july to replace a current interim pact.however , schaar cautioned that " many , many questions remain and we are far from a solution . " washington has warned that airlines which failed to share passenger data would face fines of up to $ 6,000 per passenger and a possible loss of landing rights . " philosophical confusion " greek socialist mep stavros lambrinidis , vice-chair of the eu parliament 's civil liberties committee , said that the transatlantic privacy quarrels were signs of a " philosophical confusion between the eu and the us concerning terrorism . " " we have to look for a general understanding with the us on what is necessary to catch terrorists , " lambrinidis said .
" we are worried about the kind and quantity of data that is collected and we are concerned about how this data is used . " lambrinidis added that the eu should not only be concerned about data protection , " but also see if the data are really necessary , appropriate and important " in fighting terrorism . schaar added that a new transatlantic air passenger data deal could be challenged by national courts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : passengers flying to the us have to undergo stringent security checks the concerns were echoed by american data protection experts .
marc rotenberg , executive director and president of the electronic privacy information center in washington said in the european parliament that his group had always insisted on data protection for travelers and visitors but said that to date , persons who are not us citizens or do not have a residence permit for the country , are not afforded any protection . reconciling civil liberties with war on terror agreement on a new deal on sharing passenger data was required after the eu 's top court annulled an earlier transatlantic accord on air passenger data exchange .
however , the court 's objections related to the legal basis of the pact , not its actual contents . the eu and the us are increasingly at odds over how to reconcile civil liberties with the us-led fight against terrorism . european lawmakers have warned repeatedly that the privacy rights of eu citizens are currently unprotected against mistakes or abuse by us authorities . brussels and washington are also at loggerheads over a secret agreement between the us treasury and the belgium-based money transfer company swift , which has supplied us authorities with personal data for use in counter-terror inquiries . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu , us move closer to permanent deal of passenger data german interior minister wolfgang schäuble and us homeland security secretary michael chertoff met in berlin friday .

the african continent has been the object of numerous broken promises and has reason to be skeptical , according to reinhard hermle , former head of the association of german development non-governmental organizations . he said he remembers the 2001 meeting in gleneagles , where he and other participants agreed to invest $ 50 billion in development aid .
half of that aid was intended for africa , but hermle said that remains a goal from which " we are still very far . " " chancellor schröder had promised to spend 0.51 percent of the german gross social product on development aid by 2010 , " he said .
" now we are at 0.36 percent , but we are observing that much of what is being included in calculations does not result in money reaching africa . " one example of creative bookkeeping , according to hermle , was pointless debt relief for iraq from which the country did not benefit because it had already stopped servicing its debts . poverty decline spread unevenly bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few african nations are likely to halve poverty by 2015 similar statistical effects could also be employed with the un 's millennium development goals , to which 189 un member states agreed to cut in half the number of people living on less than $ 1 per day . it 's a goal hermle said would likely be achieved due to improving economic conditions in a few nations with large populations . " highly populated countries like india and china are making large economic progress , " he said , adding that when the countries ' total population of 2.5 billion is projected on the world 's population the goal of cutting poverty in half can be reached .
" but it is a statistical trick . " while the absolute number of people living in poverty will drop by 50 percent , few african nations will be able to claim poverty dropped in their country by the same rate , hermle said . working with emerging nations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : money helps but can not solve all africa 's problems , eid said representatives from brazil , india , mexico and south africa will be present at the meeting of g8 nations , made up of canada , france , germany , italy , japan , russia , the united kingdom and the united states , for the first time . the emerging countries ' presence is due to their increasing international political and economic influence that in turn has led to shift in international politics , according to german development minster heidemarie wieczorek-zeul , who is chairing the berlin summit . she said the countries ' increased influence could lead to triangle partnerships with a g8 member pairing with an emerging country to provide development aid for a third country . " one should shape the reformed partnerships with developing and emerging countries to answer the question of what changes to the partnership are necessary and what help we can provide , " eid said .

" the cooperation between north and south has to be improved .
the donor countries have to coordinate better , it should not be that every rich country runs its own bilateral development policy .
coordination reduces costs and makes the aid more efficient . " much , however , will also depend on african governments ' will to change and open to investment , eid added .

" this forms the basis for enel 's development on the european electricity market , " said enel chief fulvio conti following the announcement of his company 's pact with acciona . while e.on 's latest bid values endesa at 42.4 billion euros , the enel-acciona offer would bring endesa 's value to 43.4 billion euros . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : e.on chief wulf bernotat is confident their offer will be accepted e.on chief wulf bernotat said his company was " convinced that our increased offer at 40 euros a share will be the only one for endesa in the foreseeable future . " a new force in the global energy market a tie-up between endesa and e.on would create a new force in the global energy market with more than 22 million customers and a business empire stretching from europe , through to the us and south america . e.on , however , needs at least 50 percent for its bid to succeed .
analysts believe that e.on faces an uphill battle to secure control of endesa as enel and acciona together already hold about a 46 per cent stake in endesa . under their takeover plan , acciona would raise its stake in endesa to 50.1 per cent , while enel would hold the rest . the cnmv ruled friday that enel and acciona could not launch a bid for six months after the e.on bid expires and gave e.on until monday to improve its offer . however , acciona told the cnmv that the joint bid with enel would be launched as soon as " legally possible . "
the cnmv is to due to issue a new ruling on the acciona-enel proposed bid before markets open in spain on tuesday . e.on takes legal action against rivals but with tensions surrounding the endesa battle rising , e.on hit back launching legal moves against enel and acciona monday and calling on the cnmv to mount action against the two companies for market disruption , breaching tender offer rules , and insider trading . at the same time , e.on said that acciona and enel should be forced to divest their shareholdings in endesa and be prohibited from buying up any endesa shares . the german company also commenced court action in new york against acciona and enel , claiming that two companies had breached us disclosure rules . in a strongly worded statement , e.on lashed out at acciona and enel accusing them of " unlawful actions " which it said " were an attempt to deceive endesa 's shareholders and to manipulate the market price of endesa stock .

the african continent has been the object of numerous broken promises and has reason to be skeptical , according to reinhard hermle , former head of the association of german development non-governmental organizations . he said he remembers the 2001 meeting in gleneagles , where he and other participants agreed to invest $ 50 billion in development aid .
half of that aid was intended for africa , but hermle said that remains a goal from which " we are still very far . " " chancellor schröder had promised to spend 0.51 percent of the german gross social product on development aid by 2010 , " he said .
" now we are at 0.36 percent , but we are observing that much of what is being included in calculations does not result in money reaching africa . " one example of creative bookkeeping , according to hermle , was pointless debt relief for iraq from which the country did not benefit because it had already stopped servicing its debts . poverty decline spread unevenly bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few african nations are likely to halve poverty by 2015 similar statistical effects could also be employed with the un 's millennium development goals , to which 189 un member states agreed to cut in half the number of people living on less than $ 1 per day . it 's a goal hermle said would likely be achieved due to improving economic conditions in a few nations with large populations . " highly populated countries like india and china are making large economic progress , " he said , adding that when the countries ' total population of 2.5 billion is projected on the world 's population the goal of cutting poverty in half can be reached .
" but it is a statistical trick . " while the absolute number of people living in poverty will drop by 50 percent , few african nations will be able to claim poverty dropped in their country by the same rate , hermle said . working with emerging nations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : money helps but can not solve all africa 's problems , eid said representatives from brazil , india , mexico and south africa will be present at the meeting of g8 nations , made up of canada , france , germany , italy , japan , russia , the united kingdom and the united states , for the first time . the emerging countries ' presence is due to their increasing international political and economic influence that in turn has led to shift in international politics , according to german development minster heidemarie wieczorek-zeul , who is chairing the berlin summit . she said the countries ' increased influence could lead to triangle partnerships with a g8 member pairing with an emerging country to provide development aid for a third country . " one should shape the reformed partnerships with developing and emerging countries to answer the question of what changes to the partnership are necessary and what help we can provide , " eid said .
" we are focused on democratization , social reforms and economic growth . " more money needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wieczorek-zeul said new types of cooperation are required the tasks facing the industrialized world are clear , according to hermle . " more money has to be made available , " he said .
" the cooperation between north and south has to be improved .
the donor countries have to coordinate better , it should not be that every rich country runs its own bilateral development policy .
coordination reduces costs and makes the aid more efficient . " much , however , will also depend on african governments ' will to change and open to investment , eid added .

that no longer seems to be the case - at least in the case of iran .
for the second time in four months , tehran has been condemned because of its nuclear policy .
the country 's foreign minister , manouchehr mottaki , may condemn the latest resolution as much as he wants , but he 'll probably be right when he says that the resolution will have no effect . after long and bitter debate , the mountain has given birth to a mouse : arms trade with iran is supposed to be outlawed and the bank accounts of a few more iranians , who work in the arms and nuclear sectors , are to be frozen . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : again tehran is called on for the last time to stop enriching uranium in order to begin negotiations about a peaceful nuclear collaboration .
disregarding any visa difficulties he might have had , iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad really did n't need to bother appearing before the council : such a resolution is as toothless as it is without effect . what , for example , is meant to be achieved with an arms embargo ?
in times , when even civilian airplanes can no longer be delivered to iran , no one will openly broker arms deals with tehran .
and why should a resolution - any more than the unifil troops - be able to stop iranian arms exports to the lebanese hezbollah ? iran rejects the council 's actions as unacceptable .
as chief witnesses for their case , tehran officials could draw on some un ambassadors - such as the french one - who emphasized before the meeting that iran naturally has a right to peaceful use of nuclear power . it 's a right that includes enriching uranium as long as this only happens in low concentrations .
but that 's exactly the center of the conflict : the security council does not differentiate between enriching for energy generation and producing arms .
it simply assumed that iran is aiming for nuclear weapons without having the slightest proof for this .
it 's doubtful whether people are even convinced themselves : would they otherwise stop at freezing bank accounts and banning an arms trade that 's impossible to control ? had the case remained with the international atomic energy agency in vienna , chances for a solution would have been much better .
to make washington happy , however , it was brought before the council , which has problems to deal with it .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de news -pipe- 26.03.2007 opinion : a pointless resolution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un security council 's latest resolution that imposes sanctions on iran for refusing to halt its nuclear program can only make it more difficult to solve the problem , writes dw 's peter philipp . un security council sanctions used to carry ominous weight .
that no longer seems to be the case - at least in the case of iran .
for the second time in four months , tehran has been condemned because of its nuclear policy .
the country 's foreign minister , manouchehr mottaki , may condemn the latest resolution as much as he wants , but he 'll probably be right when he says that the resolution will have no effect . after long and bitter debate , the mountain has given birth to a mouse : arms trade with iran is supposed to be outlawed and the bank accounts of a few more iranians , who work in the arms and nuclear sectors , are to be frozen . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : again tehran is called on for the last time to stop enriching uranium in order to begin negotiations about a peaceful nuclear collaboration .
disregarding any visa difficulties he might have had , iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad really did n't need to bother appearing before the council : such a resolution is as toothless as it is without effect . what , for example , is meant to be achieved with an arms embargo ?
in times , when even civilian airplanes can no longer be delivered to iran , no one will openly broker arms deals with tehran .
and why should a resolution - any more than the unifil troops - be able to stop iranian arms exports to the lebanese hezbollah ? iran rejects the council 's actions as unacceptable .
as chief witnesses for their case , tehran officials could draw on some un ambassadors - such as the french one - who emphasized before the meeting that iran naturally has a right to peaceful use of nuclear power . it 's a right that includes enriching uranium as long as this only happens in low concentrations .
but that 's exactly the center of the conflict : the security council does not differentiate between enriching for energy generation and producing arms .
it simply assumed that iran is aiming for nuclear weapons without having the slightest proof for this .
it 's doubtful whether people are even convinced themselves : would they otherwise stop at freezing bank accounts and banning an arms trade that 's impossible to control ? had the case remained with the international atomic energy agency in vienna , chances for a solution would have been much better .
to make washington happy , however , it was brought before the council , which has problems to deal with it .
everyone seems to know that a solution can not be found this way and that things could get even more complicated - as the incident regarding british soldiers who were arrested after allegedly entering iranian territory shows . middle east ex per t peter philipp is deutsche welle 's chief correspondent -lrb- win -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran faces isolation as security council agrees further sanctions the un security council has slapped new sanctions on iran over its suspect nuclear program as western powers warned tehran it faced becoming even more internationally isolated .
-lrb- 25.03.2007 -rrb- britain searching for answers as troops remain held in iran international pressure mounted on iran on sunday to free 15 british naval personnel but british authorities admitted they do not know where the group are being held .

the fair offers intimate book browsing and prides itself in connecting readers of all ages to their favorite authors . at the leipzig book fair , families strolled through the bright fairgrounds , checking out the 2,348 exhibitors from 36 countries .
the fair , held in modern buildings outside the eastern german city of leipzig , has emerged as europe 's largest literary festival for author readings and events . organizer wolfgang marzin could n't have been happier with the fair , which ended sunday . " we had the nicest book fair , " marzin said .
" it 's the most peaceful and reader-friendly book fair . " finding an audience bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children settle down to read germany hosts two large book fairs each year .
the trade fair in frankfurt is the undisputed king of the book fair scene .
leipzig does not even strive to compete with frankfurt , but instead has established its own identity , especially with its popular concept , " leipzig reads . "
unlike frankfurt , which is geared towards trade professionals , leipzig generates much of its business from the general public . in the evenings , readings are offered around town in bookshops , cafes or at city hall .
there are appearances by famous authors such as nobel-prize winning german author günter grass . the fair has focused on attracting readers of all ages and exposing them to many different genres of literature . a young girl showed her delight while browsing picture books about horses , farms and fire trucks .
her younger brother slept in his stroller and their mother laughed at the costumed manga comic fans behind her . " there are simply things going on here , " she said .
" that 's cool . " getting young people to attend the fair is a central goal of the organizers , marzin said .
exhausted kids can be found sprawled on the floor of the central glass hall . german books take center stage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's no shortage of books in leipzig leipzig has a long tradition of printing and book trade .
after world war ii and the division of germany , leipzig became a focal point for east-west publishers .
after german reunification in 1990 , many publishing houses in the former east germany shut down or integrated into west german ones .
a year later , the leipzig book fair started . the fair focuses on german language books , introducing up-and-coming authors from central and eastern europe to the german market . the relaxed atmosphere is the secret to what makes this fair popular .
the laid back pace makes it easy for fairgoers to stumble across literary jewels . " you discover all the types of books here , ones that you ca n't find in the little bookstore in our town and ones you ca n't track down on the internet .
here you have them all in front of you , " a woman said . the next leipzig book fair will take place from march 13 to march 16 2008 . silke bartlick -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : a bridge between literature and cinema how do you turn a book into a movie ?

amid the debate about how meaningful an apology is - when it 's made by people several generations distant from the suffering and trauma inflicted - another question has loomed .
should there be some form of physical reparation for the terrible trade in people in which britain had a disproportionate share ?
it comes as a bit of a surprise to some that an organisation as benign as the church of england might have to consider such a question .
but its leader , the archbishop of canterbury rowan williams , thinks it must .
the church owned slaves on plantations in the west indies .
properties such as the coddrington estate in barbados provided the church 's missionary wing - the society for the propagation of the gospel - with about a third of its income .
moral problems it seems that contemporary anglicans were aware of the moral problems posed by owning slaves .
they took comfort in using the income to spread the christian message .
the slaves were eventually freed in 1834 - 27 years after the abolition of the slave trade in the british empire that 's being marked this week .
government compensation for the loss of slave labour included almost £ 9,000 for the church , a huge sum in those days . "
we are here , where we are and who we are partly because of terrible things that our forbears did " dr rowan williams now , almost two centuries later , dr williams accepts that the church needs to consider whether it should make reparation .
he told bbc radio 4 's trade roots that anglicans needed to acknowledge that they belonged to an institution in part shaped by this history .
" we are here , where we are and who we are partly because of terrible things that our forbears did , " he said .
" face it .
get used to it , and , you know , make that history your history . "
but , dr williams was asked , does that mean paying reparations ?
' question asked ' " while it sounds simple to say all right so we should pass on the reparation that was received -lsb- when the slaves were freed -rsb- , exactly to whom ? " he asked .
" exactly where does it go ?
and exactly how does it differ from the various ways in which we try to interact now with the effects of that in terms of aid and development and so forth ?
" so i have n't got a quick solution to that .
i think we need to be asking the question and working at it .
that , i think we 're beginning to do . "
the church apologised for its part in the cruelty and hardship of the slave trade last year , and marked the bicentenary of the act of abolition this weekend with a walk through london led by dr williams and the archbishop of york , john sentamu .
dr sentamu came out against the payment of reparations , but he did call on the government to go further in making its own apology for slavery .
he pointed out that the country had enriched itself by trading in people as it did in onions and maize .
so far , tony blair has restricted himself to expressing britain 's " deep sorrow and regret " for its role in the slave trade .
but the church is evidently now considering a more significant act of restoration .
" if you are living off that kind of historic legacy then , i think , you have a responsibility , " dr williams said .
trade roots will be broadcast on bbc radio 4 at 1100 bst on mon 26 , tue 27 and wed 28 march .

amid the debate about how meaningful an apology is - when it 's made by people several generations distant from the suffering and trauma inflicted - another question has loomed .
dr williams said the question of reparation must be considered should there be some form of physical reparation for the terrible trade in people in which britain had a disproportionate share ?
it comes as a bit of a surprise to some that an organisation as benign as the church of england might have to consider such a question .
but its leader , the archbishop of canterbury rowan williams , thinks it must .
the church owned slaves on plantations in the west indies .
properties such as the coddrington estate in barbados provided the church 's missionary wing - the society for the propagation of the gospel - with about a third of its income .
moral problems it seems that contemporary anglicans were aware of the moral problems posed by owning slaves .
they took comfort in using the income to spread the christian message .
the slaves were eventually freed in 1834 - 27 years after the abolition of the slave trade in the british empire that 's being marked this week .
government compensation for the loss of slave labour included almost £ 9,000 for the church , a huge sum in those days .
we are here , where we are and who we are partly because of terrible things that our forbears did dr rowan williams now , almost two centuries later , dr williams accepts that the church needs to consider whether it should make reparation .
he told bbc radio 4 's trade roots that anglicans needed to acknowledge that they belonged to an institution in part shaped by this history .
" we are here , where we are and who we are partly because of terrible things that our forbears did , " he said .
" face it .
get used to it , and , you know , make that history your history . "
but , dr williams was asked , does that mean paying reparations ?
' question asked ' " while it sounds simple to say all right so we should pass on the reparation that was received -lsb- when the slaves were freed -rsb- , exactly to whom ? " he asked .
" exactly where does it go ?
and exactly how does it differ from the various ways in which we try to interact now with the effects of that in terms of aid and development and so forth ?
" so i have n't got a quick solution to that .
i think we need to be asking the question and working at it .
that , i think we 're beginning to do . "
campaigners who walked from hull joined london 's walk of witness the church apologised for its part in the cruelty and hardship of the slave trade last year , and marked the bicentenary of the act of abolition this weekend with a walk through london led by dr williams and the archbishop of york , john sentamu .
dr sentamu came out against the payment of reparations , but he did call on the government to go further in making its own apology for slavery .
he pointed out that the country had enriched itself by trading in people as it did in onions and maize .
so far , tony blair has restricted himself to expressing britain 's " deep sorrow and regret " for its role in the slave trade .
but the church is evidently now considering a more significant act of restoration .
" if you are living off that kind of historic legacy then , i think , you have a responsibility , " dr williams said .

people accepted it quite quickly , even with a few moans and groans .
the main difference is that people 's perceptions have changed about smokers - before the ban everyone just put up with others smoking around them in restaurants , clubs and pubs .
now they actually tell them to move away with their cigarettes , go outside or put them out , they are not so tolerant any more .
smokers have also become more aware of smoking and the effects it has on them - they have noticed a difference in when and where they smoke , they do n't smoke as many cigarettes as they used to and they can smell it more on their clothing .
the differences when going out are quite amazing , the pubs , clubs and restaurants are so much cleaner and fresher , although the smoking did hide other smells which are much more noticeable now , it does have it 's down side too ! !
the hardest part of the ban is trying to keep an eye on people so they do not smoke in the toilets from a personal point of view , i enjoy working in the pub now as there is no smoke in your face , no ashtrays to empty and clean at the end of the night and i do n't go home smelling like an ashtray .
i also feel a lot better with less chest infections due to no smoke in the pubs .
another downside is if the pubs , clubs or restaurants do not have a smoking area outside , smokers tend to congregate around the doors and then you have to walk through the middle of them to get in .
i find this in offices and shops and it looks bad from a public point of view .
we are trying to discourage people from standing directly at the doors of our offices as it can be off-putting for a client or visitor trying to access the building .
the hardest part of the ban is trying to keep an eye on people so they do not smoke in the toilets .
at the moment in the pub i work in , we are reliant on other customers telling us if this is going on - and believe me they are letting us know .
on the whole , i think it is the best thing that has happened and it has been relatively painless enforcing it and monitoring it .
it has made everyone much more aware of health issues and the damage that is caused by smoking as well as the damage caused by passive smoking .

a little while ago , my friends and i visited a comedy club that we used to go to quite regularly in our first year of university .
one of our biggest complaints about the venue was because it was very small and self-contained , the cigarette smoke had nowhere to go except into your clothes .
every time we went to the club we always came out smelling like an ashtray and without fail the next morning you woke up with a stuffed up nose and an aching throat .
the last time i went was so different , i came out with my clothes and hair smelling as they had when i went in , my eyes did n't sting and i did n't wake up feeling ill the next morning .
additionally , even though i 've had the flu for the last couple of days i was still able to go to a pub to have lunch , something that i could n't have done before the smoking ban because there was a good chance i would suffer from an asthma attack .
i find it interesting that places like paris are following suit the smoking ban really means that i can get on with my life without having to worry about where i want to go and what i want to do .
while i do feel sorry for smokers who have to stand outside in the rain to have a cigarette , i 'm also annoyed with myself for giving them my sympathy when they never had any for me when the shoe was on the other foot .
furthermore , i find it interesting that places like paris are following suit enforcing a ban on smoking in some public places .
when i visited paris a couple of years ago it was very obvious that smoking was an important part of parisian life , perhaps the fact that they are now banning smoking should warn other countries that these kinds of bans do have to be considered in order to protect the health of our populations .
the fact remains that smoking is not like drugs or alcohol , in that smoking directly harms , not only those who smoke , but those who are exposed to second-hand smoke .
so , really , i stand with my original opinion that people have a right to smoke , but they do not have a right to endanger my health .
my advice for those in england , northern ireland and wales , is if you do smoke and want to quit , start early .
not only is there a big emphasis right now in the nhs to help people quit , which means you 'll get plenty of support , but also if you quit early it means that you wo n't be standing outside having a cigarette in the middle of winter .
if you do smoke and have no intention of quitting , really i think the only thing to do is invest in a good umbrella , you will need it .

this is backed up by official figures from the scottish executive who have indicated that the percentage of people obeying the legislation nationally is in excess of 95 % , with only a tiny minority openly flouting the law .
i personally have witnessed only three people lighting up illegally in the past year , two of whom immediately apologised , saying that they had simply " forgotten " .
the third person was keith richards , lead guitarist with the rolling stones , when he lit up on stage in hampden park back in august 2006 .
glasgow city council , probably realising the futility of fining such an icon , apparently said " the stage for the concert was not of the dimensions to be covered by the smoking ban legislation in scotland " .
aye , right !
people have literally been driven onto the streets which has created a litter problem as cigarette butts are discarded there was much spoken in the lead up to the ban and the subject matter was top of the agenda for bar room philosophy sessions in pubs around the country for many months , however all the passion and indeed the interest has faded as the assembled seers await their next big topic , whatever that might be .
smokers themselves appear to have adapted well to the changes and i am aware of very few who have simply stopped going to the pub or club .
bar owners lucky enough to have the space to do so have created smoking areas which are popular with all their customers , smokers and non-smokers alike , although i am sure that some businesses have been affected in the depths of winter in scotland when a warm cigarette and a space heater are no match for the elements .
unfortunately , many establishments do not have room for a smoking area , meaning people have literally been driven onto the streets which has created a litter problem as cigarette butts are discarded onto the pavements , creating an unsightly mess in our towns and cities .
one of the most widely publicised benefits of the ban has been the reduction in exposure to second hand tobacco smoke for bar and restaurant staff .
these workers are now being afforded protection previously denied to them and for me this fact alone justifies the legislation .
pubs have been the main focus of my articles but other premises , such as small cafes , have also benefited and it is now such a pleasure to enjoy a full scottish breakfast in a smoke-free environment .
my only fear is that the traditional cooked breakfast may be the next thing to be banned on public health grounds - now that would be some debate - we the people demand the right to eat fried haggis and tattie scones .

and i 'm sure most people would agree that it 's made a big difference .
i can only comment on my experience of living and working in glasgow , at work it made no difference , the office has been a non-smoking building for years .
all i did notice was a large increase in people coming out of other offices for a smoke - previously they had had smoking rooms inside .
both myself and my girlfriend still smoke , and i only know of one person who has given up .
he never had his own cigarettes anyway so that was a bonus .
the biggest change has been going out .
i was never in favour of smoking in restaurants anyway so the main change has been in pubs .
at first i was a bit annoyed and wondered if jack mcconnell would have implemented the ban if he was still a smoker and his dad still owned the pub in arran .
it has actually been strange going to other cities like manchester , cardiff and las vegas recently and still being able to light up after a couple of months i sussed out which pubs had gone to the extra effort and expensive to hold onto their smoking clientele and started to frequent them without being bothered about not smoking indoors .
bars like booly mardy 's on vinicombe street , oran mor on byers road , bar 500 at the bottom of byers road and most of the pubs in ashton lane had made an effort .
some going further than simply putting out seats , awnings and heaters but placing plasma tv 's at the windows so you do n't miss the football .
a special mention has to go to the ubiquitous chip in ashton lane for building a roof terrace as a result of the ban , cheers !
in the centre of town other bars like one-up in royal exchange square with their smoking balconies and roderick dhu on waterloo street are also smoker friendly without bothering non-smokers .
although you ca n't please everybody , last summer a woman in the beer garden at oran mor complained to staff about the amount of smokers .
it has actually been strange going to other cities like manchester , cardiff and las vegas recently and still being able to light up in a pub , for the first five minutes i thought somebody was going to appear and say " put that out " .

to the smoking lobby i am one of the dreaded ex-smokers who flaps their hands at any smoke coming in my direction .
as an ex-smoker i can appreciate how hard it is to break the habit but i did n't go through ' cold turkey ' to improve my health to have somebody else 's smoke kill me .
i am also so glad i do n't have to stand outside in rain , hail or shine for a ' quick puff ' .
on a personal level , my husband and myself have a high street deli takeaway , which means we meet a wide cross-section of the public .
dealing with food we had no smoking anyway pre-ban , so no change there , however , the nuisance of cigarette litter is a constant gripe and i have had to put out a fire in one of the wall ashtrays .
i have talked to local shopkeepers and their cigarette sales do n't seem to have been affected , which points to smokers not actually cutting down .
pubs and bingo halls report being quieter - but on the upside non-smokers have stated it is far more enjoyable to go into a pub or restaurant now because they do n't end up with their hair and clothing ' reeking of smoke ' .
the over-riding factor to be considered is the risk of passive smoking to both adults and children alike i was even told by some bar workers that it is easier to deal with ' drinking up time ' smokers , they drink up quicker because they want to get outside for a cigarette .
the over-riding factor to be considered is the risk of passive smoking to both adults and children alike , they have a right to have their health protected .
a research study at the university of dundee tested a group of bar staff for lung function and blood stream inflammation before the ban and then again just two months later .
results showed a rapid change with a dramatic fall in staff showing smoke-related symptoms , reduction of nicotine in the bloodstream and improved lung function .
if this is apparent after just two months it would appear to be compelling evidence that ' others people 's smoke does get up your nose ' .
i welcomed the ban and a year on it seems to now be accepted as a fact of life with a few grumbles but you ca n't please all of the people all of the time .
hopefully this legislation will help a good majority of the people live in a smoke-free environment .

in a series of articles from interested parties supporting and opposed to the ban , tobacco control group action on smoking and health -lrb- ash -rrb- scotland gives its view one year on .
chief executive maureen moore says the ban has already shown tangible health benefits .
scotland 's smoke-free legislation was introduced on 26 march last year , making scotland the first part of the uk to end smoking in most enclosed public places .
cutting out passive smoking has changed social occassions wales , northern ireland and england will introduce similar legislation this year .
while we will have to wait for the full assessment of the impacts - nhs health scotland together with information services division scotland and the scottish executive are co-ordinating a comprehensive research programme into a wide range of outcomes of the legislation - there is already no doubt that it has been tremendously successful .
this legislation was introduced to remove a preventable harmful substance , second-hand smoke .
early research demonstrates an 86 % reduction in exposure to second-hand smoke -lrb- shs -rrb- for bar workers across scotland .
the air quality in most scottish bars is now comparable with average outdoor air quality .
a study published in jama found a significant improvement in respiratory symptoms and lung function amongst 77 bar workers in tayside between february and june 2006 , and a cancer research uk survey published in august found that 92 % of scottish bar staff said their workplaces were healthier post legislation and 78 % believed they would experience long-term health benefits .
ash scotland is looking to the future and to further reducing the harm caused by tobacco ban means ' freedoms lost ' ban ' a reason for pride ' the experience of smoke-free public places has motivated a number of smokers to come forward and seek help and advice to quit smoking .
demand for nhs smoking cessation services rose significantly in the three months leading up to implementation , with some services reporting a doubling in client numbers .
overall , compliance has been excellent - never less than 95 % in the first nine months , despite enforcement officers targeting reported breaches .
most people have welcomed and willingly complied with legislation and the enforcement officers worked hard to educate and support people in complying .
only a few dissonant notes have been raised .
some narrow sectors of the business community have raised concerns about economic impacts on their businesses .
wales is the nest part of the uk to bring in a ban concerns have been raised that people may smoke more at home , increasing the exposure of children to second-hand smoke .
this last point has not been borne out in countries that have introduced smoke-free legislation ahead of us such as ireland and new zealand , where smokers say they have introduced more restrictions on smoking at home after legislation .
by september , we should have robust findings from scotland 's research programme that will give us a full picture of the actual impacts of implementing legislation here .
meantime , ash scotland is looking to the future and to further reducing the harm caused by tobacco in scotland .
amongst other measures , we are calling for the purchase age of tobacco to be raised from 16 to 18 , backed by effective enforcement measures , and for an end to the visibility of tobacco at retail outlets , replacing the power gantries with a simple brand and price list .
ash scotland will continue to campaign to prevent future generations from addiction to tobacco .

this legislation was introduced to remove a preventable harmful substance , second-hand smoke .
early research demonstrates an 86 % reduction in exposure to second-hand smoke -lrb- shs -rrb- for bar workers across scotland .
the air quality in most scottish bars is now comparable with average outdoor air quality .
a study published in jama found a significant improvement in respiratory symptoms and lung function amongst 77 bar workers in tayside between february and june 2006 , and a cancer research uk survey published in august found that 92 % of scottish bar staff said their workplaces were healthier post legislation and 78 % believed they would experience long-term health benefits .

by september , we should have robust findings from scotland 's research programme that will give us a full picture of the actual impacts of implementing legislation here .

in a series of articles from interested parties supporting and opposed to the ban , neil rafferty , from the freedom organisation for the right to enjoy smoking tobacco -lrb- forest -rrb- , looks at its impact one year on .
mr rafferty claims the legislation has been an attack on freedom of choice . "
one year on and the scottish executive is telling us that scotland is a better place .
well , i suppose it 's slightly better if you 're a non-smoker whose only concern in life was whether or not your local pub was smoky .
but for those of us who care about freedom of choice and want our country to be a place where the people , not the politicians , are in charge , then scotland is far , far worse .
we have had a year of bingo halls closing down , local pubs and clubs facing real financial difficulty and decent , law abiding people being forced into the street because they like to smoke .
and all of this against a backdrop of smug , arrogant politicians like jack mcconnell and andy kerr and shrill public health campaigners like maureen moore of ash telling us that we should all just do as we are told .
-lrb- meanwhile the political establishment in edinburgh will no doubt be happy to see bingo halls and clubs going to the wall as a consequence of the ban .
" this means we can force the working classes to stop drinking and gambling as well , " you can hear them saying . -rrb-
" it 's been a year of freedoms lost , of businesses damaged and communities undermined " ban ' a reason for pride ' atmosphere ' proves success ' the executive will boast that the compliance rate has been high and therefore scots have " embraced " the comprehensive ban .
but when the government threatens you with a sizeable fine - and ultimately prison - then people tend to do as they are told .
so it is perhaps more accurate to say that we have been forced to accept the ban rather than embracing it .
the ban was justified by a very deliberate , calculated strategy of deception about the effects of passive smoking .
the politicians and the anti-smoking fanatics invented figures to scare people into believing that a comprehensive ban was necessary .
one year on our position is exactly the same : if there is any risk at all from passive smoking it is so small as to be statistically insignificant and there are many independent experts around the world who agree .
but the executive , addicted as it is to propaganda , will continue to peddle this fraud and might even bring out some bar staff whose lives have been " saved by the ban " .
odd that before the ban came in they claimed that dozens of bar staff were dying every year because of passive smoking and yet were unable to name any of them .
so it 's been a year of freedoms lost , of businesses damaged and communities undermined all for the sake of some highly dubious claims about passive smoking and a strange , totalitarian obsession with the ' good of the nation ' .
and it was all so unnecessary .
of course many people do not like to be bothered by tobacco smoke and there is absolutely no reason why they should be .
we advocated a mixture of smoking and non-smoking venues so that everyone could have a choice - including bar workers .
and we know the majority of scots agree with us because we asked them .
last month forest commissioned populus , one of the country 's most respected polling organisations , to ask scots whether private clubs should be allowed to have separate smoking rooms - 74 % said yes . "
the anti-smoking fanatics will say that forest only cares about cigarette sales " we asked if smokers should be allowed to set-up and run their own private clubs - again , 74 % said yes .
we asked if bingo halls should be allowed to have separate smoking rooms - 66 % said yes .
we 're not saying that we want to turn the clock back to the era when smokers had it all their own way .
but we do believe that everyone should have some measure of choice .
that 's what living in a free country is all about .
the anti-smoking fanatics will say that forest only cares about cigarette sales .
no doubt there will be comments on this article to that effect .
so what ?
that 's what they always say when they 've lost the argument .
but what we really care about is freedom .
smoking carries some big health risks but as an adult in a free society , it 's your life and your choice .
and if a group of adults want to get together and start a club where they can socialise , drink and smoke without bothering anyone else then they should be able to - and no smug , arrogant politician should have the right to stop them . "

in a series of articles from interested parties supporting and opposed to the ban , neil rafferty , from the freedom organisation for the right to enjoy smoking tobacco -lrb- forest -rrb- , looks at its impact one year on .
mr rafferty claims the legislation has been an attack on freedom of choice .
one year on and the scottish executive is telling us that scotland is a better place .
bingo operators say the smoking ban has affected their trade well , i suppose it 's slightly better if you 're a non-smoker whose only concern in life was whether or not your local pub was smoky .
but for those of us who care about freedom of choice and want our country to be a place where the people , not the politicians , are in charge , then scotland is far , far worse .
we have had a year of bingo halls closing down , local pubs and clubs facing real financial difficulty and decent , law abiding people being forced into the street because they like to smoke .
and all of this against a backdrop of smug , arrogant politicians like jack mcconnell and andy kerr and shrill public health campaigners like maureen moore of ash telling us that we should all just do as we are told .
-lrb- meanwhile the political establishment in edinburgh will no doubt be happy to see bingo halls and clubs going to the wall as a consequence of the ban .
" this means we can force the working classes to stop drinking and gambling as well , " you can hear them saying . -rrb-
it 's been a year of freedoms lost , of businesses damaged and communities undermined ban ' a reason for pride ' atmosphere ' proves success ' the executive will boast that the compliance rate has been high and therefore scots have " embraced " the comprehensive ban .
but when the government threatens you with a sizeable fine - and ultimately prison - then people tend to do as they are told .
so it is perhaps more accurate to say that we have been forced to accept the ban rather than embracing it .
the ban was justified by a very deliberate , calculated strategy of deception about the effects of passive smoking .
the politicians and the anti-smoking fanatics invented figures to scare people into believing that a comprehensive ban was necessary .
one year on our position is exactly the same : if there is any risk at all from passive smoking it is so small as to be statistically insignificant and there are many independent experts around the world who agree .
smokers have now been forced to light up on the street but the executive , addicted as it is to propaganda , will continue to peddle this fraud and might even bring out some bar staff whose lives have been " saved by the ban " .
odd that before the ban came in they claimed that dozens of bar staff were dying every year because of passive smoking and yet were unable to name any of them .
so it 's been a year of freedoms lost , of businesses damaged and communities undermined all for the sake of some highly dubious claims about passive smoking and a strange , totalitarian obsession with the ' good of the nation ' .
and it was all so unnecessary .
of course many people do not like to be bothered by tobacco smoke and there is absolutely no reason why they should be .
we advocated a mixture of smoking and non-smoking venues so that everyone could have a choice - including bar workers .
and we know the majority of scots agree with us because we asked them .
last month forest commissioned populus , one of the country 's most respected polling organisations , to ask scots whether private clubs should be allowed to have separate smoking rooms - 74 % said yes .
the anti-smoking fanatics will say that forest only cares about cigarette sales we asked if smokers should be allowed to set-up and run their own private clubs - again , 74 % said yes .
we asked if bingo halls should be allowed to have separate smoking rooms - 66 % said yes .
we 're not saying that we want to turn the clock back to the era when smokers had it all their own way .
but we do believe that everyone should have some measure of choice .
that 's what living in a free country is all about .
the anti-smoking fanatics will say that forest only cares about cigarette sales .
no doubt there will be comments on this article to that effect .
so what ?
that 's what they always say when they 've lost the argument .
but what we really care about is freedom .
smoking carries some big health risks but as an adult in a free society , it 's your life and your choice .
and if a group of adults want to get together and start a club where they can socialise , drink and smoke without bothering anyone else then they should be able to - and no smug , arrogant politician should have the right to stop them .

" this means we can force the working classes to stop drinking and gambling as well , " you can hear them saying . -rrb-
it 's been a year of freedoms lost , of businesses damaged and communities undermined ban ' a reason for pride ' atmosphere ' proves success ' the executive will boast that the compliance rate has been high and therefore scots have " embraced " the comprehensive ban .
but when the government threatens you with a sizeable fine - and ultimately prison - then people tend to do as they are told .
so it is perhaps more accurate to say that we have been forced to accept the ban rather than embracing it .
the ban was justified by a very deliberate , calculated strategy of deception about the effects of passive smoking .
the politicians and the anti-smoking fanatics invented figures to scare people into believing that a comprehensive ban was necessary .
one year on our position is exactly the same : if there is any risk at all from passive smoking it is so small as to be statistically insignificant and there are many independent experts around the world who agree .
smokers have now been forced to light up on the street but the executive , addicted as it is to propaganda , will continue to peddle this fraud and might even bring out some bar staff whose lives have been " saved by the ban " .
odd that before the ban came in they claimed that dozens of bar staff were dying every year because of passive smoking and yet were unable to name any of them .
so it 's been a year of freedoms lost , of businesses damaged and communities undermined all for the sake of some highly dubious claims about passive smoking and a strange , totalitarian obsession with the ' good of the nation ' .
and it was all so unnecessary .
of course many people do not like to be bothered by tobacco smoke and there is absolutely no reason why they should be .
we advocated a mixture of smoking and non-smoking venues so that everyone could have a choice - including bar workers .
and we know the majority of scots agree with us because we asked them .
last month forest commissioned populus , one of the country 's most respected polling organisations , to ask scots whether private clubs should be allowed to have separate smoking rooms - 74 % said yes .
the anti-smoking fanatics will say that forest only cares about cigarette sales we asked if smokers should be allowed to set-up and run their own private clubs - again , 74 % said yes .
we asked if bingo halls should be allowed to have separate smoking rooms - 66 % said yes .
we 're not saying that we want to turn the clock back to the era when smokers had it all their own way .
but we do believe that everyone should have some measure of choice .
that 's what living in a free country is all about .
the anti-smoking fanatics will say that forest only cares about cigarette sales .
no doubt there will be comments on this article to that effect .
so what ?
that 's what they always say when they 've lost the argument .
but what we really care about is freedom .
smoking carries some big health risks but as an adult in a free society , it 's your life and your choice .
and if a group of adults want to get together and start a club where they can socialise , drink and smoke without bothering anyone else then they should be able to - and no smug , arrogant politician should have the right to stop them .

gone are the old men nursing a half pint , a whisky and a woodbine .
clubbers and pub goers now get a much clearer night out gone is the smoky haze at gigs as lasers sweep above the heads of clubbers and concert-goers .
gone is the need to wash your hair and clothes , simply after popping out for a post-work pint or cocktail .
just over a year ago , the debate over the prohibition of smoking in regulated areas -lrb- scotland -rrb- bill centred on the question of personal choice versus personal responsibility .
this was coupled with concern from the entertainment industry over the impact of the ban on business .
but strangely there also seemed to be a general acceptance among even smokers , myself included , that there were few arguments against the logic of the ban .
whatever your view , the ban is not now just a reality , it is normality and it works the unhealthy effects of smoking are hard to ignore .
equally drink is pretty unhealthy , but it does not so immediately assault the surrounding atmosphere .
but there is no getting away from the fact that the atmosphere and customs have changed in our pubs , clubs and eateries .
pubs are now cleaner , shinier and more pleasant places to be , to drink and increasingly to eat .
and the first time you see a pregnant woman sitting happily in a bar you will do a double take .
there are no overflowing ashtrays , no chance of being burned or getting your clothes singed , no stinging eyes .
a culture shift has opened up bars for mums and dads going out and staying out is now more democratic .
but this is only part of the story .
although shop-fitters and interior designers have done well obliterating decades of nicotine staining and refurbishing corner cafes , there are plenty of establishments which simply removed the ashtrays and opened the next day , business as usual .

there is the social camaraderie , the smirting - smoking / flirting - which takes place outside bars , nightclubs and gigs .
this may make a busy , thronging sauchiehall street seem safer as there are likely to be a lot more people around at night .
mel smith and keith richards have come into conflict with the ban but this also translates into the menacing experience of walking alone past the less salubrious drinking dens , with shadowy groups of punters huddled round doorways , puffing away , dropping more litter .
manufacturers of umbrellas and heaters have done well in the winter months and every bar with a bit of pavement or beer garden has done its bit to support the outdoor furniture trade .
wristbands are also a more common sight as gigs , clubs and venues wrestle with the logistics of pass-outs - some using bands to let people come and go as they please , some finding roped off alleyways or balconies to cater for smokers and others simply just banning smokers and carrying on .
the actual long-term impact on the licensed trade , social clubs and bingo halls is still up for debate and concerns have been raised that smoking may have been shifted more into the home , where children face greater exposure .
but health professionals are bullish , with scotland 's chief medical officer speculating that lung cancer could be virtually wiped out in the decades ahead , as disease rates fall .
sitting in a pub with a cigarette and a pint is a thing of the past the air quality inside most scottish bars has been found to be comparable with the outdoors and the success of self-policing has been almost universal .
psychologically , introducing the ban in the week the clocks went forward was a smart move and emboldened with success , the scottish executive is now moving to increase the age for purchasing tobacco to 18 .
there has been little evidence of flouting of the ban in its day-to-day operation - i 've certainly never seen it .

it has even helped me cut down drastically the amount i smoke .
i do n't claim to have stopped yet , but i am now down to a few a day , no longer smoking at work and no longer joining the huddled masses in shelters or under umbrellas .

the bird charity 's big garden birdwatch results have shown smaller numbers of birds visiting backyards in wales .
bird numbers are usually swollen by seasonal migrants but rspb cymru said above average temperatures across europe have kept them on the continent .
blackbirds and robins were recorded at lower levels than in previous years .
more than 21,000 people in wales took part in the rspb 's uk-wide big garden birdwatch over the last weekend in january , and participants counted the birds in their gardens .
one of their findings was an overall decrease in the number of resident birds .
top species in wales average per garden sparrow : 5.77 starling : 4.51 blue tit : 4.02 chaffinch : 3.37 blackbird : 2.12 great tit : 1.61 robin : 1.49 jackdaw : 1.41 collared dove : 1.34 magpie : 1.25 greenfinches dropped out of big garden birdwatch top ten in wales , with a decline of more than a quarter since 2006 .
although the house sparrow retained its top spot with an average of 5.77 per garden , its numbers were significantly down from the first birdwatch in 1979 .
the starling moved back into second place and the blue tit completed the welsh top three , with average numbers of 4.51 and 4.02 per garden respectively .
peter jones , rspb cymru 's environmental policy officer , said the varying bird numbers visiting welsh gardens was one example of the impact climate change was having on the natural world .
" as our climate changes the distribution of birds will change and they will adapt their behaviour , " he said .
" although the mild winter seems to have provided more food for songbirds in the countryside this year , as changes to our climate become more extreme , many birds will struggle to cope with the altered weather patterns .
" we can all help to minimise the impact of climate change by the action we take in our everyday lives . "

the bird charity 's big garden birdwatch results have shown smaller numbers of birds visiting backyards in wales .
bird numbers are usually swollen by seasonal migrants but rspb cymru said above average temperatures across europe have kept them on the continent .
blackbirds and robins were recorded at lower levels than in previous years .
more than 21,000 people in wales took part in the rspb 's uk-wide big garden birdwatch over the last weekend in january , and participants counted the birds in their gardens .
one of their findings was an overall decrease in the number of resident birds .
top species in wales average per garden sparrow : 5.77 starling : 4.51 blue tit : 4.02 chaffinch : 3.37 blackbird : 2.12 great tit : 1.61 robin : 1.49 jackdaw : 1.41 collared dove : 1.34 magpie : 1.25 greenfinches dropped out of big garden birdwatch top ten in wales , with a decline of more than a quarter since 2006 .
although the house sparrow retained its top spot with an average of 5.77 per garden , its numbers were significantly down from the first birdwatch in 1979 .
the starling moved back into second place and the blue tit completed the welsh top three , with average numbers of 4.51 and 4.02 per garden respectively .
peter jones , rspb cymru 's environmental policy officer , said the varying bird numbers visiting welsh gardens was one example of the impact climate change was having on the natural world .
" as our climate changes the distribution of birds will change and they will adapt their behaviour , " he said .
" although the mild winter seems to have provided more food for songbirds in the countryside this year , as changes to our climate become more extreme , many birds will struggle to cope with the altered weather patterns .
" we can all help to minimise the impact of climate change by the action we take in our everyday lives . "

once a champion of progressive rock , she later turned her attention to dance music and has been a stalwart of the station 's late night schedules for more than a decade .
over the years her career has taken her into journalism and television , as well as presenting radio 4 's woman 's hour .
she was made an mbe in 2002 .
now she is celebrating her show 's second success in the breakspoll awards for breakbeat music - and has just released a new compilation album .
tell us about the breakspoll award .
it 's the oscars of the breakbeat world .
last year i won best radio show and i managed to win it again .
i present the awards as well , and i was standing up there in front of all these people , thinking ' i 'm not going to win ' because i do n't want to end up disappointed .
you know what happens at all the larger awards ceremonies , where they cut to the person who has n't won to look at their face ?
that was all going on in the back of my mind .
it was very nice , and very good of them .
being part of the bbc , we have such a wonderful website - that 's the way we reach people .
the music is very much internet-driven .
which internet radio stations would you recommend ?
there are people devoted to internet radio , like nu skool breaks - purely pirate radio , devoted to breakbeat .
then there 's ibreaks , then there 's bijou breaks based in los angeles , so it 's a huge , growing , and very worldwide thing .
i 've just had a message on my myspace site from a girl in vladivostok who 's a breaks dj .
i get really excited about that .
and i think , " oooh , can i come over , i 've always wanted to go there ? "
because of the internet , you can reach all around the world .
it was always my dream on radio 1 - " this is fantastic music , i wish we could reach out to everyone in the world " .
and now , we can .
i 've always liked that interactive aspect .
i had a guy write to me from jordan recently , that 's not a place you 'd imagine is really getting into beats , so i feel quite evangelical about it .
how did the y4k album come about ?
it 's in a series , and the label 's called distinctive .
i went to them last year when i won the award , and said , " hey , how about doing a compilation ? "
i did one about 12 years ago -lsb- annie on one -rsb- and that did really well .
it 's taken me exactly a year to get this one right .
i 've loved it .
it 's like doing a radio show but even more refined .
it 's been a journey of discovery .
is it still more difficult for female djs ?
it 's a lot easier now in radio - look at radio 1 .
i 'm very proud of the fact you 've got edith bowman , jo whiley , annie mac , fearne cotton - who i think is fantastic - and mary anne hobbs .
there 's probably as many women now on radio 1 as blokes .
it 's not an issue any more .
in the beginning : annie nightingale joined radio 1 in 1970 but it 's a lot tougher club-wise , and breaks is very ' blokey ' .
in breakspoll , in all the nominations there was only one woman besides me , janette slack , and that 's the first time another female has been mentioned .
they 're not horrid or anti-women , there are just too many blokes !
i do n't think it 's necessarily blokes ' music .
that 's another thing i want to get across with this album .

once a champion of progressive rock , she later turned her attention to dance music and has been a stalwart of the station 's late night schedules for more than a decade .
over the years her career has taken her into journalism and television , as well as presenting radio 4 's woman 's hour .
she was made an mbe in 2002 .
now she is celebrating her show 's second success in the breakspoll awards for breakbeat music - and has just released a new compilation album .
tell us about the breakspoll award .
it 's the oscars of the breakbeat world .
last year i won best radio show and i managed to win it again .
i present the awards as well , and i was standing up there in front of all these people , thinking ' i 'm not going to win ' because i do n't want to end up disappointed .
you know what happens at all the larger awards ceremonies , where they cut to the person who has n't won to look at their face ?
that was all going on in the back of my mind .
it was very nice , and very good of them .
being part of the bbc , we have such a wonderful website - that 's the way we reach people .
the music is very much internet-driven .
which internet radio stations would you recommend ?
there are people devoted to internet radio , like nu skool breaks - purely pirate radio , devoted to breakbeat .
then there 's ibreaks , then there 's bijou breaks based in los angeles , so it 's a huge , growing , and very worldwide thing .
i 've just had a message on my myspace site from a girl in vladivostok who 's a breaks dj .
i get really excited about that .
and i think , " oooh , can i come over , i 've always wanted to go there ? "
because of the internet , you can reach all around the world .
it was always my dream on radio 1 - " this is fantastic music , i wish we could reach out to everyone in the world " .
and now , we can .
i 've always liked that interactive aspect .
i had a guy write to me from jordan recently , that 's not a place you 'd imagine is really getting into beats , so i feel quite evangelical about it .
how did the y4k album come about ?
it 's in a series , and the label 's called distinctive .
i went to them last year when i won the award , and said , " hey , how about doing a compilation ? "
i did one about 12 years ago -lsb- annie on one -rsb- and that did really well .
it 's taken me exactly a year to get this one right .
i 've loved it .
it 's like doing a radio show but even more refined .
it 's been a journey of discovery .
is it still more difficult for female djs ?
it 's a lot easier now in radio - look at radio 1 .
i 'm very proud of the fact you 've got edith bowman , jo whiley , annie mac , fearne cotton - who i think is fantastic - and mary anne hobbs .
there 's probably as many women now on radio 1 as blokes .
it 's not an issue any more .
in the beginning : annie nightingale joined radio 1 in 1970 but it 's a lot tougher club-wise , and breaks is very ' blokey ' .
in breakspoll , in all the nominations there was only one woman besides me , janette slack , and that 's the first time another female has been mentioned .
they 're not horrid or anti-women , there are just too many blokes !
i do n't think it 's necessarily blokes ' music .
that 's another thing i want to get across with this album .
but i wo n't make any girlie concessions - i do n't believe in that .
the first couple of tracks are slightly funkier and it gets the girls onto the dancefloor while the guys stand there with their woolly hats on nodding .
