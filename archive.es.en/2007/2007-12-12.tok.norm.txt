he warned of the high price of inaction against climate change as delegates faced hurdles in outlining a plan by the end of the week . representatives from some 190 countries on the indonesian island of bali aim by the close of the un climate conference on friday , dec .
14 , to lay the foundation for a successor to the kyoto protocol , which expires in 2012 . " we gather because the time for equivocation is over , " said ban on tuesday from bali , where security had been tightened after a car bomb attack at un offices in algeria killed dozens of people , including at least 11 un staff members . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the time is now , said ban " you need to set an agenda - a road map to a more secure climate future , coupled with a tight timeline that produces a deal by 2009 . " the details of the " road map " to be set at the conference would be hammered out over the next two years , giving ratifying nations time to ink the deal before kyoto expires . " we must ensure an incentive structure for countries , businesses and individuals , " said the un chief .
" there is no trade-off between fighting climate change and pursuing development .
in the long run , we can prosper only by doing both . " he added that , by being creative , it would be possible to reduce harmful greenhouse-gas emissions while promoting economic growth at the same time : " in this sense , climate change is a much an opportunity as it is a threat .
it is our chance to usher in a new age of green economics and truly sustainable development . " eu goal rebutted by us , others bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu supports a 25 to 40 percent emissions reduction germany and the european union want the world 's industrialized countries to commit to a 25 to 40 percent reduction in carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- emissions by 2020 , compared to 1990 levels . however , the us , japan and canada have resisted this plan .
since australian prime minister kevin rudd submitted his country 's ratification of the kyoto protocol earlier this week , the united states is the only remaining industrialized nation not to sign the document . the us has traditionally advocated voluntary commitments instead of an international binding agreement . " we want to be sure that the text -lsb- of a new climate agreement -rsb- that we have before us is going to be neutral - it will leave all options on the table and , again , will not prejudge outcomes , which should be something that comes at the end of the two-year process , " said us negotiator harlan watson . such high figures for emission reduction are essential for wealthier countries to show emerging nations they are serious about tackling climate change , countered germany 's environment minister sigmar gabriel , who arrived in bali on tuesday and is scheduled to hold a speech on wednesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : australia 's new prime minister kevin rudd handed in his country 's kyoto ratification how to involve developing and emerging countries in climate change improvements and equip them with the necessary earth-friendly technology have been unresolved issues in the discussion . ban warns against failure of talks ban reminded delegates that world leaders in september had called for a breakthrough at the conference . " if we leave bali without such a breakthrough , we will not only have failed our leaders , but also those who look to us to find solutions , namely , the peoples of this world , " he said . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

opponents said the law , which would have lowered the age limit for prosecuting sex offenses , went overboard . the german government was considering a plan to lower the age at which a person can be charged for perceived sexual crimes from 18 to 14 years of age , but the bill was halted on wednesday , dec .
12 , a day before it was expected to be approved by parliament . a decision on the draft , which was intended to protect youths from sexual exploitation and pornographic representation , has been postponed until early next year , a spokesman from the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- told the dpa news agency . " the valid warnings from the opposition and assessors have apparently had an effect , " said jörg van essen , parliamentary leader of the free democratic party . critics warned that the proposal would lead to a criminalization of normal sexual activity among teens and could disturb their natural sexual development . examples of punishable situations caused concern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i want to assure you there is no obligation to have sex " while the proposal spoke of punishment for minors who engage in sexual activity with an under-16-year-old that is " exploitative " or results in " reimbursement " in some form , heavy critique came when specific scenarios were brought up . for example , if a 17-year-old invites a person of the opposite sex who is 16 or younger to the movies with the perceived intention of " making out " at some point during the evening , then the 17-year-old could be in deep trouble . this situation could be construed as the older person initiating a financial exchange by picking up the tab while planning a sexual encounter with a minor as a consequence , even if there is no sexual contact between the couple . however , justice minister brigitte zypries rebutted criticism from the opposition , saying that the sidelined bill would not criminalize consensual sexual contact between teens . " no young person has to fear being punished when he invites a date to the movie theater and petting occurs , " said zypries . those opposing the bill have said there is no clarification in the actual text to clearly draw the line between what would and would not be punishable by law . pornography regulations central to proposal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : that 's far enough the new law also foresaw an expansion of the definition of child pornography to include text and images that portrayed sexual actions between teenagers .
this could even include photos of teenage girls in bikinis if the pose they strike is deemed " provocative " or the covered genital area is " prominent . " the criticism from sexologists and other experts was echoed by a number of german politicians .
jerzy montag of the opposition green party told germany 's der spiegel magazine that the law would send the " wrong signal " and that " changing the law to make it possible for the victim to be older than the culprit ignores the structure of power and experience . " germany 's current laws differentiate between child and youth pornography . a law born from eu and us justice systems germany finds itself , like all eu member states , under pressure from the european union , which requires new legislative action in the area of sexual criminal law in line with the united nations ' convention for children 's rights . but the proposed law appeared to go further than even the eu had demanded by making youths as young as 14 punishable as adults and by simultaneously raising the protected age from 16 to 18 . the eu law is primarily intended to protect minors from being forced into prostitution by illegalizing paid sex with a 16- or 17-year-old .
prostitution is currently legal in germany at 16 years or older . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shopping for fruit in view of witnesses would be allowed european experts had called the german proposal the action of a government " hostile to sex and hostile to teenagers , " while the german society for sexual research called the plan " sexual colonization , " referring to the roots of the law in the us legal system . in the united states , teenagers have already been punished under similar laws .
a 15-year-old girl who sent naked pictures of herself to a friend over the internet was recently charged with the spreading and ownership of child pornography .
this would also become an issue in under the german proposal . at the moment , the ownership and spreading of sexual material involving youngsters is only prohibited when the material involves " sodomy or sadistic pornography . "
the spd spokesman said that the question of whether it should be legal for third parties to possess sexual pictures of youths , if the youths willingly produced them , would need to be clarified before the draft could be resubmitted . dw staff -lrb- nda , kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

russia says nato left it with no choice but to abandon the agreement . officials in moscow said on wednesday , dec .
12 , that there are no plans to build up their military forces after they suspended participation in the conventional forces in europe treaty but added the move was necessary to protect russia 's national security . " such a step has been caused by the exceptional circumstances connected to the content of the treaty , which concern the security of russia and demand that we take immediate measures , " the russian foreign ministry said in a statement . the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- appealed for moscow to reconsider its decision , calling the treaty a " cornerstone for european security for 15 years . " " the suspension that takes effect today is not good news , " spanish foreign minister miguel angel moratinos , the group 's chairman-in-office , said in a statement .
" the loss of the cfe system of limitations , information and verification would be detrimental to all and could have security implications for all of europe . " military free to move bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the treaty limits troops numbers between the atlantic and the urals suspension means russia can move troops around the country without notifying nato , allowing russia to lift the " limitations placed on arms deployments , " the russian foreign ministry statement said . signed in 1990 and modified after the fall of the iron curtain in 1999 , the treaty places exact caps on the numbers of troops and heavy weapons stationed west of the ural mountains .
the cfe deal was seen as an important step in resolving the cold war . russian president vladimir putin signed a decree ordering moscow 's suspension of the treaty last month .
the decree met with wide acceptance in the russian parliament . " we wo n't observe any obligations unilaterally , " putin said in a speech last month .
" our partners did not ratify the treaty and some did not even sign it . " tit-for-tat decisions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato expanded to russia 's borders in 2004 at the heart of russia 's complaints on the cfe is nato 's failure to ratify the amended 1999 version of the treaty , which takes into account the huge changes wrought by the 1991 collapse of the soviet union .
nato 's expansion after the fall of the soviet union would potentially allow for the alliance 's troops within striking distance of st. petersburg . " the hypothetical transfer of nato forces into the baltics is a real military threat , " alexei arbatov , an arms control expert at the carnegie moscow center independent think-tank told reuters news agency . nato countries say they can not ratify the 1999 version because russian troop presence in ex-soviet georgia and moldova violates the treaty , a charge moscow rejects .
the kremlin has said soldiers stationed in the two countries represent a peacekeeping force . in a statement , nato expressed " deep regret " that russia had suspended the arms pact .
but it underlined that the military alliance would not take any retaliatory action .
the demise of the cfe comes on top of moscow 's threat to leave the intermediate range nuclear forces treaty , as well as tensions around us plans to install a missile-defense shield in nato members poland and the czech republic . reply to us missile shield bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia is opposed to the us plans for missile defense bases in the czech republic and poland while the russian foreign ministry statement wednesday made clear the military did not intend to make any major moves , deputy foreign minister alexander grushko last week gave a mixed message about possible changes in troop levels . " russia has no plans to raise its military presence in europe , obviously , that is , if there is not an attempt to raise the military presence by nato countries , " he told reporters . washington has said its missile shield initiative is designed to guard against attacks from " rogue states , " but moscow views it as an attempt by the us to expand its military influence into russia 's backyard . though russia could theoretically return to the treaty at anytime , observers said international disagreement between russia and the west makes such a move unlikely . " the treaty is dead , " military analyst pavel felgenhauer told the afp news agency .
" it makes a lot of economic sense to move forces from siberia to leningrad district , because it 's two or three times more expensive to keep them in siberia .
it will also send a powerful signal to the west .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de children and families -pipe- 12.12.2007 germany 's egg donation prohibition is outdated , experts say großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when fertilization does n't happen naturally , german couples face tough hurdles the recent birth of a baby by a 64-year-old woman in germany has sparked debate about the embryo protection law , which prohibits egg donation .
but with rising infertility rates , germany may need to rethink its policies . the 64-year-old german woman who recently gave birth to a healthy baby girl made headlines around the world .
but her age did not set a precedent .
last year , a 67-year-old spanish woman became the world 's oldest mother when she gave birth to twins , topping the record from the previous year of a 66-year-old romanian who also had twins . the unnamed german became pregnant with the help of in-vitro fertilization -lrb- ivf -rrb- , using an egg donated by a 25-year-old and the sperm of the german woman 's husband .
the treatment was conducted abroad , as donating eggs cells for pregnancies is illegal in germany . the prohibition of egg cell donation is part of germany 's " embryo protection law , " which was passed in 1990 .
sperm donation , however , is permitted . mothers more important than fathers ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fertility rates after 35 drop dramatically the reasoning behind the ban on egg donation was that both the genetic mother and the woman bearing the baby were presumed to be responsible for the child 's existence , said ulrich hilland of the berlin-based federal association of german centers for reproductive medicine . " the law could be interpreted in such a way that it is assumed that mothers have a stronger emotional connection to their children , due to pregnancy , than fathers , " hilland said . the law aimed to prevent the separation between the genetic and the " social " mother - the woman who would later raise the child .
surrogacy is therefore also prohibited in germany . quality risks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : several implanted embryos can result in twins or triplets christina de wit of the german national ethics council , in berlin , pointed to another reason for banning the donation of egg cells . " harvesting eggs from a donor is an invasive operation requiring extensive hormonal stimulation beforehand , so that many eggs mature , " she said .
" that means that the whole process involves medical risks ; that 's not the case with sperm donors . " some german politicians say the recent case demonstrates that egg donation prohibition in germany should be lifted .
others point out that the prohibition prompts " reproduction tourism " by forcing women to go abroad to fulfill their wish for children . " we see risks in quality-control here , " hilland said .
" women who go abroad can not be assured that the testing and therefore the selection process among egg donor candidates have been sufficient . " outdated law ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immobile sperm is often the cause of male infertility the current german law is one of the most restrictive in the world .
it stipulates that only as many embryos may be cultivated as may actually be implanted -lrb- up to three per ivf cycle -rrb- . embryos may also not be examined to determine sex before implantation , nor is pre-implantation genetic diagnosis -lrb- pgd -rrb- , otherwise known as " embryo screening , " allowed - the latter ban a likely result of germany trying to come to terms with its nazi past . furthermore , the freezing -lrb- cryopreservation -rrb- of embryos for later implantation is restricted .
only eggs in the very early stages of fertilization - the pre-nucleus stage - may be frozen in certain cases . the embryo protection law itself was smart , because it defined the legal parameters of in-vitro fertilization and aimed to prevent the manipulation of human life very early , hilland said . de wit agreed . " the law was originally intended to protect life at its initial stages , but unfortunately , it is rather outdated , " she said .
" a nearly 20-year-old law no longer corresponds with the huge advancements made in science and reproductive medicine . " financial problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sperm and egg are united outside of the body in ivf however , it 's not just the embryo protection law that is restrictive . " even if the law were changed to allow egg donation , only a fraction of women would take advantage of it , " de wit said . an issue affecting many more women and couples wanting children is the drastic cutback in insurance companies paying for assisted reproduction technology -lrb- art -rrb- treatments . formerly , germany 's public insurance companies - or compulsory health insurance funds - covered the entire costs of up to four ivf and isci treatments and six intrauterine inseminations -lrb- iui -rrb- .
in the wake of sweeping reforms , however , as of 2004 the funds only pay 50 percent of up to three ivf , icsi or iui cycles , and only for married couples when the woman is 40 or younger .
other age restrictions also apply .
-lrb- icsi , or " intracytoplasmic sperm injection , " is a method involving the injection of sperm into an egg via an ultra-fine needle . -rrb- unmarried couples must cover all costs themselves .
and they are heady . a married couple 's average share per cycle currently runs around 1,300 euros -lrb- $ 1,900 -rrb- .
thus , less affluent couples have been essentially barred from trying to get pregnant through art . looking ahead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : assisted reproduction is often ridden with physical and psychological stress " we have a birth rate of 1.3 children per woman in germany , " hilland said .
" children are desperately needed in this country , so any measure to improve the birth rate would be desirable . " german doctors say they now perform around 40 percent fewer art treatments than before the reform , even though the success rate by ivf is around 25-35 percent for each try , meaning that several treatment cycles would likely see a couple 's wish for children fulfilled . the reforms were supposed to save the public health insurance funds up to 100 million euros yearly through sharing art costs with couples .
but according to hilland , some 10,000 fewer " art " children have been born each year since the reforms . considering that one in seven couples suffer from infertility and that germany 's population is aging dramatically , that number is nothing to sneeze at . louisa schaefer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

last year , a 67-year-old spanish woman became the world 's oldest mother when she gave birth to twins , topping the record from the previous year of a 66-year-old romanian who also had twins . the unnamed german became pregnant with the help of in-vitro fertilization -lrb- ivf -rrb- , using an egg donated by a 25-year-old and the sperm of the german woman 's husband .
the treatment was conducted abroad , as donating eggs cells for pregnancies is illegal in germany . the prohibition of egg cell donation is part of germany 's " embryo protection law , " which was passed in 1990 .
sperm donation , however , is permitted . mothers more important than fathers ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fertility rates after 35 drop dramatically the reasoning behind the ban on egg donation was that both the genetic mother and the woman bearing the baby were presumed to be responsible for the child 's existence , said ulrich hilland of the berlin-based federal association of german centers for reproductive medicine . " the law could be interpreted in such a way that it is assumed that mothers have a stronger emotional connection to their children , due to pregnancy , than fathers , " hilland said . the law aimed to prevent the separation between the genetic and the " social " mother - the woman who would later raise the child .
surrogacy is therefore also prohibited in germany . quality risks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : several implanted embryos can result in twins or triplets christina de wit of the german national ethics council , in berlin , pointed to another reason for banning the donation of egg cells . " harvesting eggs from a donor is an invasive operation requiring extensive hormonal stimulation beforehand , so that many eggs mature , " she said .
" that means that the whole process involves medical risks ; that 's not the case with sperm donors . " some german politicians say the recent case demonstrates that egg donation prohibition in germany should be lifted .
others point out that the prohibition prompts " reproduction tourism " by forcing women to go abroad to fulfill their wish for children . " we see risks in quality-control here , " hilland said .
" women who go abroad can not be assured that the testing and therefore the selection process among egg donor candidates have been sufficient . " outdated law ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immobile sperm is often the cause of male infertility the current german law is one of the most restrictive in the world .
it stipulates that only as many embryos may be cultivated as may actually be implanted -lrb- up to three per ivf cycle -rrb- . embryos may also not be examined to determine sex before implantation , nor is pre-implantation genetic diagnosis -lrb- pgd -rrb- , otherwise known as " embryo screening , " allowed - the latter ban a likely result of germany trying to come to terms with its nazi past . furthermore , the freezing -lrb- cryopreservation -rrb- of embryos for later implantation is restricted .
only eggs in the very early stages of fertilization - the pre-nucleus stage - may be frozen in certain cases . the embryo protection law itself was smart , because it defined the legal parameters of in-vitro fertilization and aimed to prevent the manipulation of human life very early , hilland said . de wit agreed . " the law was originally intended to protect life at its initial stages , but unfortunately , it is rather outdated , " she said .
" a nearly 20-year-old law no longer corresponds with the huge advancements made in science and reproductive medicine . " financial problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sperm and egg are united outside of the body in ivf however , it 's not just the embryo protection law that is restrictive . " even if the law were changed to allow egg donation , only a fraction of women would take advantage of it , " de wit said . an issue affecting many more women and couples wanting children is the drastic cutback in insurance companies paying for assisted reproduction technology -lrb- art -rrb- treatments . formerly , germany 's public insurance companies - or compulsory health insurance funds - covered the entire costs of up to four ivf and isci treatments and six intrauterine inseminations -lrb- iui -rrb- .
in the wake of sweeping reforms , however , as of 2004 the funds only pay 50 percent of up to three ivf , icsi or iui cycles , and only for married couples when the woman is 40 or younger .
other age restrictions also apply .
-lrb- icsi , or " intracytoplasmic sperm injection , " is a method involving the injection of sperm into an egg via an ultra-fine needle . -rrb- unmarried couples must cover all costs themselves .
and they are heady . a married couple 's average share per cycle currently runs around 1,300 euros -lrb- $ 1,900 -rrb- .
thus , less affluent couples have been essentially barred from trying to get pregnant through art . looking ahead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : assisted reproduction is often ridden with physical and psychological stress " we have a birth rate of 1.3 children per woman in germany , " hilland said .
" children are desperately needed in this country , so any measure to improve the birth rate would be desirable . " german doctors say they now perform around 40 percent fewer art treatments than before the reform , even though the success rate by ivf is around 25-35 percent for each try , meaning that several treatment cycles would likely see a couple 's wish for children fulfilled . the reforms were supposed to save the public health insurance funds up to 100 million euros yearly through sharing art costs with couples .
but according to hilland , some 10,000 fewer " art " children have been born each year since the reforms . considering that one in seven couples suffer from infertility and that germany 's population is aging dramatically , that number is nothing to sneeze at . louisa schaefer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

european politicians are pushing for the text , which requires unanimous approval before going into effect , to be in place before european parliament elections in 2009 . referendum riddles bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pair of constitutional no votes threw the eu into year-long period of near inaction british prime minister gordon brown will be a notable absentee at the signing ceremony in lisbon .
he 's said that a scheduling conflict will keep him from attending the morning ceremony , but he added he would sign the document later in the day .
the nonattendance has led to domestic accusations of a " semi-detached " attitude to europe . the reform treaty is the successor to the union 's proposed constitution , which was rejected by voters in france and the netherlands in 2005 .
many governments , including the french and dutch , have said there will be no need for national referendums to ratify the reform treaty . the treaty " does not transfer sovereignty to the eu ... and there is no judicial reason to resort to a referendum , " danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen said tuesday . in order to avoid a british referendum , london was granted key policy opt-outs , thereby securing its cherished " red lines " on foreign policy , labor rights , the common law and the tax and social security systems . only ireland is constitutionally bound to put the issue to a vote , something which prime minister bertie ahern said he would like to see take place next may or june . constitutional similarities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former british prime minister tony blair has been floated as a potential eu foreign policy leader the new reform text will implement many of the changes suggested by the failed constitution , including the creation of a foreign policy chief and more permanent presidency to replace the current six-month rotating presidency system . the treaty also calls for cuts to the size of the european parliament , freezes the number of seats on the eu commission and institutes a double majority voting system that reduces the types of decision single nations can veto . attached to the new treaty is an eu charter of fundamental rights which enshrines the rights of dignity , freedoms , equality , solidarity , citizens ' rights and justice , although britain and poland are opting out of making that binding . at the charter 's signing wednesday at the european parliament , portuguese prime minister jose socrates signed the document amid noisy protests from right and left-wing parliamentarians calling for national referenda on the reform treaty . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de children and families -pipe- 12.12.2007 germany 's egg donation prohibition is outdated , experts say großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when fertilization does n't happen naturally , german couples face tough hurdles the recent birth of a baby by a 64-year-old woman in germany has sparked debate about the embryo protection law , which prohibits egg donation .
but with rising infertility rates , germany may need to rethink its policies . the 64-year-old german woman who recently gave birth to a healthy baby girl made headlines around the world .
but her age did not set a precedent .
last year , a 67-year-old spanish woman became the world 's oldest mother when she gave birth to twins , topping the record from the previous year of a 66-year-old romanian who also had twins . the unnamed german became pregnant with the help of in-vitro fertilization -lrb- ivf -rrb- , using an egg donated by a 25-year-old and the sperm of the german woman 's husband .
the treatment was conducted abroad , as donating eggs cells for pregnancies is illegal in germany . the prohibition of egg cell donation is part of germany 's " embryo protection law , " which was passed in 1990 .
sperm donation , however , is permitted . mothers more important than fathers ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fertility rates after 35 drop dramatically the reasoning behind the ban on egg donation was that both the genetic mother and the woman bearing the baby were presumed to be responsible for the child 's existence , said ulrich hilland of the berlin-based federal association of german centers for reproductive medicine . " the law could be interpreted in such a way that it is assumed that mothers have a stronger emotional connection to their children , due to pregnancy , than fathers , " hilland said . the law aimed to prevent the separation between the genetic and the " social " mother - the woman who would later raise the child .
surrogacy is therefore also prohibited in germany . quality risks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : several implanted embryos can result in twins or triplets christina de wit of the german national ethics council , in berlin , pointed to another reason for banning the donation of egg cells . " harvesting eggs from a donor is an invasive operation requiring extensive hormonal stimulation beforehand , so that many eggs mature , " she said .
" that means that the whole process involves medical risks ; that 's not the case with sperm donors . " some german politicians say the recent case demonstrates that egg donation prohibition in germany should be lifted .
others point out that the prohibition prompts " reproduction tourism " by forcing women to go abroad to fulfill their wish for children . " we see risks in quality-control here , " hilland said .
" women who go abroad can not be assured that the testing and therefore the selection process among egg donor candidates have been sufficient . " outdated law ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immobile sperm is often the cause of male infertility the current german law is one of the most restrictive in the world .
it stipulates that only as many embryos may be cultivated as may actually be implanted -lrb- up to three per ivf cycle -rrb- . embryos may also not be examined to determine sex before implantation , nor is pre-implantation genetic diagnosis -lrb- pgd -rrb- , otherwise known as " embryo screening , " allowed - the latter ban a likely result of germany trying to come to terms with its nazi past . furthermore , the freezing -lrb- cryopreservation -rrb- of embryos for later implantation is restricted .
only eggs in the very early stages of fertilization - the pre-nucleus stage - may be frozen in certain cases . the embryo protection law itself was smart , because it defined the legal parameters of in-vitro fertilization and aimed to prevent the manipulation of human life very early , hilland said . de wit agreed . " the law was originally intended to protect life at its initial stages , but unfortunately , it is rather outdated , " she said .
" a nearly 20-year-old law no longer corresponds with the huge advancements made in science and reproductive medicine . " financial problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sperm and egg are united outside of the body in ivf however , it 's not just the embryo protection law that is restrictive . " even if the law were changed to allow egg donation , only a fraction of women would take advantage of it , " de wit said . an issue affecting many more women and couples wanting children is the drastic cutback in insurance companies paying for assisted reproduction technology -lrb- art -rrb- treatments . formerly , germany 's public insurance companies - or compulsory health insurance funds - covered the entire costs of up to four ivf and isci treatments and six intrauterine inseminations -lrb- iui -rrb- .
in the wake of sweeping reforms , however , as of 2004 the funds only pay 50 percent of up to three ivf , icsi or iui cycles , and only for married couples when the woman is 40 or younger .
other age restrictions also apply .
-lrb- icsi , or " intracytoplasmic sperm injection , " is a method involving the injection of sperm into an egg via an ultra-fine needle . -rrb- unmarried couples must cover all costs themselves .
and they are heady . a married couple 's average share per cycle currently runs around 1,300 euros -lrb- $ 1,900 -rrb- .
thus , less affluent couples have been essentially barred from trying to get pregnant through art . looking ahead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : assisted reproduction is often ridden with physical and psychological stress " we have a birth rate of 1.3 children per woman in germany , " hilland said .
" children are desperately needed in this country , so any measure to improve the birth rate would be desirable . " german doctors say they now perform around 40 percent fewer art treatments than before the reform , even though the success rate by ivf is around 25-35 percent for each try , meaning that several treatment cycles would likely see a couple 's wish for children fulfilled . the reforms were supposed to save the public health insurance funds up to 100 million euros yearly through sharing art costs with couples .
but according to hilland , some 10,000 fewer " art " children have been born each year since the reforms . considering that one in seven couples suffer from infertility and that germany 's population is aging dramatically , that number is nothing to sneeze at . louisa schaefer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he warned of the high price of inaction against climate change as delegates faced hurdles in outlining a plan by the end of the week . representatives from some 190 countries on the indonesian island of bali aim by the close of the un climate conference on friday , dec .
14 , to lay the foundation for a successor to the kyoto protocol , which expires in 2012 . " we gather because the time for equivocation is over , " said ban on tuesday from bali , where security had been tightened after a car bomb attack at un offices in algeria killed dozens of people , including at least 11 un staff members . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the time is now , said ban " you need to set an agenda - a road map to a more secure climate future , coupled with a tight timeline that produces a deal by 2009 . " the details of the " road map " to be set at the conference would be hammered out over the next two years , giving ratifying nations time to ink the deal before kyoto expires . " we must ensure an incentive structure for countries , businesses and individuals , " said the un chief .
" there is no trade-off between fighting climate change and pursuing development .

since australian prime minister kevin rudd submitted his country 's ratification of the kyoto protocol earlier this week , the united states is the only remaining industrialized nation not to sign the document . the us has traditionally advocated voluntary commitments instead of an international binding agreement . " we want to be sure that the text -lsb- of a new climate agreement -rsb- that we have before us is going to be neutral - it will leave all options on the table and , again , will not prejudge outcomes , which should be something that comes at the end of the two-year process , " said us negotiator harlan watson . such high figures for emission reduction are essential for wealthier countries to show emerging nations they are serious about tackling climate change , countered germany 's environment minister sigmar gabriel , who arrived in bali on tuesday and is scheduled to hold a speech on wednesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : australia 's new prime minister kevin rudd handed in his country 's kyoto ratification how to involve developing and emerging countries in climate change improvements and equip them with the necessary earth-friendly technology have been unresolved issues in the discussion . ban warns against failure of talks ban reminded delegates that world leaders in september had called for a breakthrough at the conference .

but with rising infertility rates , germany may need to rethink its policies . the 64-year-old german woman who recently gave birth to a healthy baby girl made headlines around the world .
but her age did not set a precedent .
last year , a 67-year-old spanish woman became the world 's oldest mother when she gave birth to twins , topping the record from the previous year of a 66-year-old romanian who also had twins . the unnamed german became pregnant with the help of in-vitro fertilization -lrb- ivf -rrb- , using an egg donated by a 25-year-old and the sperm of the german woman 's husband .
the treatment was conducted abroad , as donating eggs cells for pregnancies is illegal in germany . the prohibition of egg cell donation is part of germany 's " embryo protection law , " which was passed in 1990 .
sperm donation , however , is permitted . mothers more important than fathers ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fertility rates after 35 drop dramatically the reasoning behind the ban on egg donation was that both the genetic mother and the woman bearing the baby were presumed to be responsible for the child 's existence , said ulrich hilland of the berlin-based federal association of german centers for reproductive medicine . " the law could be interpreted in such a way that it is assumed that mothers have a stronger emotional connection to their children , due to pregnancy , than fathers , " hilland said . the law aimed to prevent the separation between the genetic and the " social " mother - the woman who would later raise the child .
surrogacy is therefore also prohibited in germany . quality risks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : several implanted embryos can result in twins or triplets christina de wit of the german national ethics council , in berlin , pointed to another reason for banning the donation of egg cells . " harvesting eggs from a donor is an invasive operation requiring extensive hormonal stimulation beforehand , so that many eggs mature , " she said .
" that means that the whole process involves medical risks ; that 's not the case with sperm donors . " some german politicians say the recent case demonstrates that egg donation prohibition in germany should be lifted .
others point out that the prohibition prompts " reproduction tourism " by forcing women to go abroad to fulfill their wish for children . " we see risks in quality-control here , " hilland said .
" women who go abroad can not be assured that the testing and therefore the selection process among egg donor candidates have been sufficient . " outdated law ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immobile sperm is often the cause of male infertility the current german law is one of the most restrictive in the world .
it stipulates that only as many embryos may be cultivated as may actually be implanted -lrb- up to three per ivf cycle -rrb- . embryos may also not be examined to determine sex before implantation , nor is pre-implantation genetic diagnosis -lrb- pgd -rrb- , otherwise known as " embryo screening , " allowed - the latter ban a likely result of germany trying to come to terms with its nazi past . furthermore , the freezing -lrb- cryopreservation -rrb- of embryos for later implantation is restricted .
only eggs in the very early stages of fertilization - the pre-nucleus stage - may be frozen in certain cases . the embryo protection law itself was smart , because it defined the legal parameters of in-vitro fertilization and aimed to prevent the manipulation of human life very early , hilland said . de wit agreed . " the law was originally intended to protect life at its initial stages , but unfortunately , it is rather outdated , " she said .
" a nearly 20-year-old law no longer corresponds with the huge advancements made in science and reproductive medicine . " financial problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sperm and egg are united outside of the body in ivf however , it 's not just the embryo protection law that is restrictive . " even if the law were changed to allow egg donation , only a fraction of women would take advantage of it , " de wit said . an issue affecting many more women and couples wanting children is the drastic cutback in insurance companies paying for assisted reproduction technology -lrb- art -rrb- treatments . formerly , germany 's public insurance companies - or compulsory health insurance funds - covered the entire costs of up to four ivf and isci treatments and six intrauterine inseminations -lrb- iui -rrb- .
in the wake of sweeping reforms , however , as of 2004 the funds only pay 50 percent of up to three ivf , icsi or iui cycles , and only for married couples when the woman is 40 or younger .
other age restrictions also apply .
-lrb- icsi , or " intracytoplasmic sperm injection , " is a method involving the injection of sperm into an egg via an ultra-fine needle . -rrb- unmarried couples must cover all costs themselves .
and they are heady . a married couple 's average share per cycle currently runs around 1,300 euros -lrb- $ 1,900 -rrb- .
thus , less affluent couples have been essentially barred from trying to get pregnant through art . looking ahead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : assisted reproduction is often ridden with physical and psychological stress " we have a birth rate of 1.3 children per woman in germany , " hilland said .
" children are desperately needed in this country , so any measure to improve the birth rate would be desirable . " german doctors say they now perform around 40 percent fewer art treatments than before the reform , even though the success rate by ivf is around 25-35 percent for each try , meaning that several treatment cycles would likely see a couple 's wish for children fulfilled . the reforms were supposed to save the public health insurance funds up to 100 million euros yearly through sharing art costs with couples .
but according to hilland , some 10,000 fewer " art " children have been born each year since the reforms . considering that one in seven couples suffer from infertility and that germany 's population is aging dramatically , that number is nothing to sneeze at . louisa schaefer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he warned of the high price of inaction against climate change as delegates faced hurdles in outlining a plan by the end of the week . representatives from some 190 countries on the indonesian island of bali aim by the close of the un climate conference on friday , dec .
14 , to lay the foundation for a successor to the kyoto protocol , which expires in 2012 . " we gather because the time for equivocation is over , " said ban on tuesday from bali , where security had been tightened after a car bomb attack at un offices in algeria killed dozens of people , including at least 11 un staff members . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the time is now , said ban " you need to set an agenda - a road map to a more secure climate future , coupled with a tight timeline that produces a deal by 2009 . " the details of the " road map " to be set at the conference would be hammered out over the next two years , giving ratifying nations time to ink the deal before kyoto expires . " we must ensure an incentive structure for countries , businesses and individuals , " said the un chief .
" there is no trade-off between fighting climate change and pursuing development .
in the long run , we can prosper only by doing both . " he added that , by being creative , it would be possible to reduce harmful greenhouse-gas emissions while promoting economic growth at the same time : " in this sense , climate change is a much an opportunity as it is a threat .
it is our chance to usher in a new age of green economics and truly sustainable development . " eu goal rebutted by us , others bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu supports a 25 to 40 percent emissions reduction germany and the european union want the world 's industrialized countries to commit to a 25 to 40 percent reduction in carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- emissions by 2020 , compared to 1990 levels . however , the us , japan and canada have resisted this plan .
since australian prime minister kevin rudd submitted his country 's ratification of the kyoto protocol earlier this week , the united states is the only remaining industrialized nation not to sign the document . the us has traditionally advocated voluntary commitments instead of an international binding agreement . " we want to be sure that the text -lsb- of a new climate agreement -rsb- that we have before us is going to be neutral - it will leave all options on the table and , again , will not prejudge outcomes , which should be something that comes at the end of the two-year process , " said us negotiator harlan watson . such high figures for emission reduction are essential for wealthier countries to show emerging nations they are serious about tackling climate change , countered germany 's environment minister sigmar gabriel , who arrived in bali on tuesday and is scheduled to hold a speech on wednesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : australia 's new prime minister kevin rudd handed in his country 's kyoto ratification how to involve developing and emerging countries in climate change improvements and equip them with the necessary earth-friendly technology have been unresolved issues in the discussion . ban warns against failure of talks ban reminded delegates that world leaders in september had called for a breakthrough at the conference . " if we leave bali without such a breakthrough , we will not only have failed our leaders , but also those who look to us to find solutions , namely , the peoples of this world , " he said . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de children and families -pipe- 12.12.2007 germany 's egg donation prohibition is outdated , experts say großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when fertilization does n't happen naturally , german couples face tough hurdles the recent birth of a baby by a 64-year-old woman in germany has sparked debate about the embryo protection law , which prohibits egg donation .
but with rising infertility rates , germany may need to rethink its policies . the 64-year-old german woman who recently gave birth to a healthy baby girl made headlines around the world .
but her age did not set a precedent .
last year , a 67-year-old spanish woman became the world 's oldest mother when she gave birth to twins , topping the record from the previous year of a 66-year-old romanian who also had twins . the unnamed german became pregnant with the help of in-vitro fertilization -lrb- ivf -rrb- , using an egg donated by a 25-year-old and the sperm of the german woman 's husband .
the treatment was conducted abroad , as donating eggs cells for pregnancies is illegal in germany . the prohibition of egg cell donation is part of germany 's " embryo protection law , " which was passed in 1990 .
sperm donation , however , is permitted . mothers more important than fathers ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fertility rates after 35 drop dramatically the reasoning behind the ban on egg donation was that both the genetic mother and the woman bearing the baby were presumed to be responsible for the child 's existence , said ulrich hilland of the berlin-based federal association of german centers for reproductive medicine . " the law could be interpreted in such a way that it is assumed that mothers have a stronger emotional connection to their children , due to pregnancy , than fathers , " hilland said . the law aimed to prevent the separation between the genetic and the " social " mother - the woman who would later raise the child .
surrogacy is therefore also prohibited in germany . quality risks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : several implanted embryos can result in twins or triplets christina de wit of the german national ethics council , in berlin , pointed to another reason for banning the donation of egg cells . " harvesting eggs from a donor is an invasive operation requiring extensive hormonal stimulation beforehand , so that many eggs mature , " she said .
" that means that the whole process involves medical risks ; that 's not the case with sperm donors . " some german politicians say the recent case demonstrates that egg donation prohibition in germany should be lifted .
others point out that the prohibition prompts " reproduction tourism " by forcing women to go abroad to fulfill their wish for children . " we see risks in quality-control here , " hilland said .
" women who go abroad can not be assured that the testing and therefore the selection process among egg donor candidates have been sufficient . " outdated law ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immobile sperm is often the cause of male infertility the current german law is one of the most restrictive in the world .
it stipulates that only as many embryos may be cultivated as may actually be implanted -lrb- up to three per ivf cycle -rrb- . embryos may also not be examined to determine sex before implantation , nor is pre-implantation genetic diagnosis -lrb- pgd -rrb- , otherwise known as " embryo screening , " allowed - the latter ban a likely result of germany trying to come to terms with its nazi past . furthermore , the freezing -lrb- cryopreservation -rrb- of embryos for later implantation is restricted .
only eggs in the very early stages of fertilization - the pre-nucleus stage - may be frozen in certain cases . the embryo protection law itself was smart , because it defined the legal parameters of in-vitro fertilization and aimed to prevent the manipulation of human life very early , hilland said . de wit agreed . " the law was originally intended to protect life at its initial stages , but unfortunately , it is rather outdated , " she said .
" a nearly 20-year-old law no longer corresponds with the huge advancements made in science and reproductive medicine . " financial problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sperm and egg are united outside of the body in ivf however , it 's not just the embryo protection law that is restrictive . " even if the law were changed to allow egg donation , only a fraction of women would take advantage of it , " de wit said . an issue affecting many more women and couples wanting children is the drastic cutback in insurance companies paying for assisted reproduction technology -lrb- art -rrb- treatments . formerly , germany 's public insurance companies - or compulsory health insurance funds - covered the entire costs of up to four ivf and isci treatments and six intrauterine inseminations -lrb- iui -rrb- .
in the wake of sweeping reforms , however , as of 2004 the funds only pay 50 percent of up to three ivf , icsi or iui cycles , and only for married couples when the woman is 40 or younger .
other age restrictions also apply .
-lrb- icsi , or " intracytoplasmic sperm injection , " is a method involving the injection of sperm into an egg via an ultra-fine needle . -rrb- unmarried couples must cover all costs themselves .
and they are heady . a married couple 's average share per cycle currently runs around 1,300 euros -lrb- $ 1,900 -rrb- .
thus , less affluent couples have been essentially barred from trying to get pregnant through art . looking ahead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : assisted reproduction is often ridden with physical and psychological stress " we have a birth rate of 1.3 children per woman in germany , " hilland said .
" children are desperately needed in this country , so any measure to improve the birth rate would be desirable . " german doctors say they now perform around 40 percent fewer art treatments than before the reform , even though the success rate by ivf is around 25-35 percent for each try , meaning that several treatment cycles would likely see a couple 's wish for children fulfilled . the reforms were supposed to save the public health insurance funds up to 100 million euros yearly through sharing art costs with couples .
but according to hilland , some 10,000 fewer " art " children have been born each year since the reforms . considering that one in seven couples suffer from infertility and that germany 's population is aging dramatically , that number is nothing to sneeze at . louisa schaefer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de children and families -pipe- 12.12.2007 germany 's egg donation prohibition is outdated , experts say großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when fertilization does n't happen naturally , german couples face tough hurdles the recent birth of a baby by a 64-year-old woman in germany has sparked debate about the embryo protection law , which prohibits egg donation .
but with rising infertility rates , germany may need to rethink its policies . the 64-year-old german woman who recently gave birth to a healthy baby girl made headlines around the world .
but her age did not set a precedent .
last year , a 67-year-old spanish woman became the world 's oldest mother when she gave birth to twins , topping the record from the previous year of a 66-year-old romanian who also had twins . the unnamed german became pregnant with the help of in-vitro fertilization -lrb- ivf -rrb- , using an egg donated by a 25-year-old and the sperm of the german woman 's husband .
the treatment was conducted abroad , as donating eggs cells for pregnancies is illegal in germany . the prohibition of egg cell donation is part of germany 's " embryo protection law , " which was passed in 1990 .
sperm donation , however , is permitted . mothers more important than fathers ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fertility rates after 35 drop dramatically the reasoning behind the ban on egg donation was that both the genetic mother and the woman bearing the baby were presumed to be responsible for the child 's existence , said ulrich hilland of the berlin-based federal association of german centers for reproductive medicine . " the law could be interpreted in such a way that it is assumed that mothers have a stronger emotional connection to their children , due to pregnancy , than fathers , " hilland said . the law aimed to prevent the separation between the genetic and the " social " mother - the woman who would later raise the child .
surrogacy is therefore also prohibited in germany . quality risks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : several implanted embryos can result in twins or triplets christina de wit of the german national ethics council , in berlin , pointed to another reason for banning the donation of egg cells . " harvesting eggs from a donor is an invasive operation requiring extensive hormonal stimulation beforehand , so that many eggs mature , " she said .
" that means that the whole process involves medical risks ; that 's not the case with sperm donors . " some german politicians say the recent case demonstrates that egg donation prohibition in germany should be lifted .
others point out that the prohibition prompts " reproduction tourism " by forcing women to go abroad to fulfill their wish for children . " we see risks in quality-control here , " hilland said .
" women who go abroad can not be assured that the testing and therefore the selection process among egg donor candidates have been sufficient . " outdated law ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immobile sperm is often the cause of male infertility the current german law is one of the most restrictive in the world .
it stipulates that only as many embryos may be cultivated as may actually be implanted -lrb- up to three per ivf cycle -rrb- . embryos may also not be examined to determine sex before implantation , nor is pre-implantation genetic diagnosis -lrb- pgd -rrb- , otherwise known as " embryo screening , " allowed - the latter ban a likely result of germany trying to come to terms with its nazi past . furthermore , the freezing -lrb- cryopreservation -rrb- of embryos for later implantation is restricted .
only eggs in the very early stages of fertilization - the pre-nucleus stage - may be frozen in certain cases . the embryo protection law itself was smart , because it defined the legal parameters of in-vitro fertilization and aimed to prevent the manipulation of human life very early , hilland said . de wit agreed . " the law was originally intended to protect life at its initial stages , but unfortunately , it is rather outdated , " she said .
" a nearly 20-year-old law no longer corresponds with the huge advancements made in science and reproductive medicine . " financial problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sperm and egg are united outside of the body in ivf however , it 's not just the embryo protection law that is restrictive . " even if the law were changed to allow egg donation , only a fraction of women would take advantage of it , " de wit said . an issue affecting many more women and couples wanting children is the drastic cutback in insurance companies paying for assisted reproduction technology -lrb- art -rrb- treatments . formerly , germany 's public insurance companies - or compulsory health insurance funds - covered the entire costs of up to four ivf and isci treatments and six intrauterine inseminations -lrb- iui -rrb- .
in the wake of sweeping reforms , however , as of 2004 the funds only pay 50 percent of up to three ivf , icsi or iui cycles , and only for married couples when the woman is 40 or younger .
other age restrictions also apply .
-lrb- icsi , or " intracytoplasmic sperm injection , " is a method involving the injection of sperm into an egg via an ultra-fine needle . -rrb- unmarried couples must cover all costs themselves .
and they are heady . a married couple 's average share per cycle currently runs around 1,300 euros -lrb- $ 1,900 -rrb- .
thus , less affluent couples have been essentially barred from trying to get pregnant through art . looking ahead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : assisted reproduction is often ridden with physical and psychological stress " we have a birth rate of 1.3 children per woman in germany , " hilland said .
" children are desperately needed in this country , so any measure to improve the birth rate would be desirable . " german doctors say they now perform around 40 percent fewer art treatments than before the reform , even though the success rate by ivf is around 25-35 percent for each try , meaning that several treatment cycles would likely see a couple 's wish for children fulfilled . the reforms were supposed to save the public health insurance funds up to 100 million euros yearly through sharing art costs with couples .
but according to hilland , some 10,000 fewer " art " children have been born each year since the reforms . considering that one in seven couples suffer from infertility and that germany 's population is aging dramatically , that number is nothing to sneeze at . louisa schaefer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

russia says nato left it with no choice but to abandon the agreement . officials in moscow said on wednesday , dec .
12 , that there are no plans to build up their military forces after they suspended participation in the conventional forces in europe treaty but added the move was necessary to protect russia 's national security . " such a step has been caused by the exceptional circumstances connected to the content of the treaty , which concern the security of russia and demand that we take immediate measures , " the russian foreign ministry said in a statement . the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- appealed for moscow to reconsider its decision , calling the treaty a " cornerstone for european security for 15 years . " " the suspension that takes effect today is not good news , " spanish foreign minister miguel angel moratinos , the group 's chairman-in-office , said in a statement .
" the loss of the cfe system of limitations , information and verification would be detrimental to all and could have security implications for all of europe . " military free to move bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the treaty limits troops numbers between the atlantic and the urals suspension means russia can move troops around the country without notifying nato , allowing russia to lift the " limitations placed on arms deployments , " the russian foreign ministry statement said . signed in 1990 and modified after the fall of the iron curtain in 1999 , the treaty places exact caps on the numbers of troops and heavy weapons stationed west of the ural mountains .
the cfe deal was seen as an important step in resolving the cold war . russian president vladimir putin signed a decree ordering moscow 's suspension of the treaty last month .
the decree met with wide acceptance in the russian parliament . " we wo n't observe any obligations unilaterally , " putin said in a speech last month .
" our partners did not ratify the treaty and some did not even sign it . " tit-for-tat decisions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato expanded to russia 's borders in 2004 at the heart of russia 's complaints on the cfe is nato 's failure to ratify the amended 1999 version of the treaty , which takes into account the huge changes wrought by the 1991 collapse of the soviet union .
nato 's expansion after the fall of the soviet union would potentially allow for the alliance 's troops within striking distance of st. petersburg . " the hypothetical transfer of nato forces into the baltics is a real military threat , " alexei arbatov , an arms control expert at the carnegie moscow center independent think-tank told reuters news agency . nato countries say they can not ratify the 1999 version because russian troop presence in ex-soviet georgia and moldova violates the treaty , a charge moscow rejects .
the kremlin has said soldiers stationed in the two countries represent a peacekeeping force . in a statement , nato expressed " deep regret " that russia had suspended the arms pact .
but it underlined that the military alliance would not take any retaliatory action .
the demise of the cfe comes on top of moscow 's threat to leave the intermediate range nuclear forces treaty , as well as tensions around us plans to install a missile-defense shield in nato members poland and the czech republic . reply to us missile shield bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia is opposed to the us plans for missile defense bases in the czech republic and poland while the russian foreign ministry statement wednesday made clear the military did not intend to make any major moves , deputy foreign minister alexander grushko last week gave a mixed message about possible changes in troop levels . " russia has no plans to raise its military presence in europe , obviously , that is , if there is not an attempt to raise the military presence by nato countries , " he told reporters . washington has said its missile shield initiative is designed to guard against attacks from " rogue states , " but moscow views it as an attempt by the us to expand its military influence into russia 's backyard . though russia could theoretically return to the treaty at anytime , observers said international disagreement between russia and the west makes such a move unlikely . " the treaty is dead , " military analyst pavel felgenhauer told the afp news agency .
" it makes a lot of economic sense to move forces from siberia to leningrad district , because it 's two or three times more expensive to keep them in siberia .
it will also send a powerful signal to the west .
it 's a win-win situation for russia . " dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he warned of the high price of inaction against climate change as delegates faced hurdles in outlining a plan by the end of the week . representatives from some 190 countries on the indonesian island of bali aim by the close of the un climate conference on friday , dec .
14 , to lay the foundation for a successor to the kyoto protocol , which expires in 2012 . " we gather because the time for equivocation is over , " said ban on tuesday from bali , where security had been tightened after a car bomb attack at un offices in algeria killed dozens of people , including at least 11 un staff members . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the time is now , said ban " you need to set an agenda - a road map to a more secure climate future , coupled with a tight timeline that produces a deal by 2009 . " the details of the " road map " to be set at the conference would be hammered out over the next two years , giving ratifying nations time to ink the deal before kyoto expires . " we must ensure an incentive structure for countries , businesses and individuals , " said the un chief .
" there is no trade-off between fighting climate change and pursuing development .
in the long run , we can prosper only by doing both . " he added that , by being creative , it would be possible to reduce harmful greenhouse-gas emissions while promoting economic growth at the same time : " in this sense , climate change is a much an opportunity as it is a threat .
it is our chance to usher in a new age of green economics and truly sustainable development . " eu goal rebutted by us , others bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu supports a 25 to 40 percent emissions reduction germany and the european union want the world 's industrialized countries to commit to a 25 to 40 percent reduction in carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- emissions by 2020 , compared to 1990 levels . however , the us , japan and canada have resisted this plan .
since australian prime minister kevin rudd submitted his country 's ratification of the kyoto protocol earlier this week , the united states is the only remaining industrialized nation not to sign the document . the us has traditionally advocated voluntary commitments instead of an international binding agreement . " we want to be sure that the text -lsb- of a new climate agreement -rsb- that we have before us is going to be neutral - it will leave all options on the table and , again , will not prejudge outcomes , which should be something that comes at the end of the two-year process , " said us negotiator harlan watson . such high figures for emission reduction are essential for wealthier countries to show emerging nations they are serious about tackling climate change , countered germany 's environment minister sigmar gabriel , who arrived in bali on tuesday and is scheduled to hold a speech on wednesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : australia 's new prime minister kevin rudd handed in his country 's kyoto ratification how to involve developing and emerging countries in climate change improvements and equip them with the necessary earth-friendly technology have been unresolved issues in the discussion . ban warns against failure of talks ban reminded delegates that world leaders in september had called for a breakthrough at the conference .

she will attend the document 's signing .
but amid calls for a referendum , another eu leader 's absence will be conspicuous . set to be signed by the leaders of the bloc 's 27 member states on thursday , dec .
13 , merkel said on wednesday that the eu 's reform treaty would bring about " breakthrough for europe . " " i really am not inclined to exaggerated euphoria - but i think we can declare that this day marks a historic success , a success for europe , " she said in an address to the bundestag , germany 's lower house of parliament .
" it will perhaps be seen later as a decisive milestone for a greater ability to act in europe . " she added that the agreement , to be called the lisbon treaty , " lays the groundwork for a new european union in the 21st century . " merkel said she hoped the treaty would be ratified by may 2008 .
european politicians are pushing for the text , which requires unanimous approval before going into effect , to be in place before european parliament elections in 2009 . referendum riddles bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pair of constitutional no votes threw the eu into year-long period of near inaction british prime minister gordon brown will be a notable absentee at the signing ceremony in lisbon .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de children and families -pipe- 12.12.2007 germany 's egg donation prohibition is outdated , experts say großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when fertilization does n't happen naturally , german couples face tough hurdles the recent birth of a baby by a 64-year-old woman in germany has sparked debate about the embryo protection law , which prohibits egg donation .
but with rising infertility rates , germany may need to rethink its policies . the 64-year-old german woman who recently gave birth to a healthy baby girl made headlines around the world .
but her age did not set a precedent .
last year , a 67-year-old spanish woman became the world 's oldest mother when she gave birth to twins , topping the record from the previous year of a 66-year-old romanian who also had twins . the unnamed german became pregnant with the help of in-vitro fertilization -lrb- ivf -rrb- , using an egg donated by a 25-year-old and the sperm of the german woman 's husband .
the treatment was conducted abroad , as donating eggs cells for pregnancies is illegal in germany . the prohibition of egg cell donation is part of germany 's " embryo protection law , " which was passed in 1990 .
sperm donation , however , is permitted . mothers more important than fathers ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fertility rates after 35 drop dramatically the reasoning behind the ban on egg donation was that both the genetic mother and the woman bearing the baby were presumed to be responsible for the child 's existence , said ulrich hilland of the berlin-based federal association of german centers for reproductive medicine . " the law could be interpreted in such a way that it is assumed that mothers have a stronger emotional connection to their children , due to pregnancy , than fathers , " hilland said . the law aimed to prevent the separation between the genetic and the " social " mother - the woman who would later raise the child .
surrogacy is therefore also prohibited in germany . quality risks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : several implanted embryos can result in twins or triplets christina de wit of the german national ethics council , in berlin , pointed to another reason for banning the donation of egg cells . " harvesting eggs from a donor is an invasive operation requiring extensive hormonal stimulation beforehand , so that many eggs mature , " she said .
" that means that the whole process involves medical risks ; that 's not the case with sperm donors . " some german politicians say the recent case demonstrates that egg donation prohibition in germany should be lifted .
others point out that the prohibition prompts " reproduction tourism " by forcing women to go abroad to fulfill their wish for children . " we see risks in quality-control here , " hilland said .
" women who go abroad can not be assured that the testing and therefore the selection process among egg donor candidates have been sufficient . " outdated law ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immobile sperm is often the cause of male infertility the current german law is one of the most restrictive in the world .
it stipulates that only as many embryos may be cultivated as may actually be implanted -lrb- up to three per ivf cycle -rrb- . embryos may also not be examined to determine sex before implantation , nor is pre-implantation genetic diagnosis -lrb- pgd -rrb- , otherwise known as " embryo screening , " allowed - the latter ban a likely result of germany trying to come to terms with its nazi past . furthermore , the freezing -lrb- cryopreservation -rrb- of embryos for later implantation is restricted .
only eggs in the very early stages of fertilization - the pre-nucleus stage - may be frozen in certain cases . the embryo protection law itself was smart , because it defined the legal parameters of in-vitro fertilization and aimed to prevent the manipulation of human life very early , hilland said . de wit agreed . " the law was originally intended to protect life at its initial stages , but unfortunately , it is rather outdated , " she said .
" a nearly 20-year-old law no longer corresponds with the huge advancements made in science and reproductive medicine . " financial problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sperm and egg are united outside of the body in ivf however , it 's not just the embryo protection law that is restrictive . " even if the law were changed to allow egg donation , only a fraction of women would take advantage of it , " de wit said . an issue affecting many more women and couples wanting children is the drastic cutback in insurance companies paying for assisted reproduction technology -lrb- art -rrb- treatments . formerly , germany 's public insurance companies - or compulsory health insurance funds - covered the entire costs of up to four ivf and isci treatments and six intrauterine inseminations -lrb- iui -rrb- .
in the wake of sweeping reforms , however , as of 2004 the funds only pay 50 percent of up to three ivf , icsi or iui cycles , and only for married couples when the woman is 40 or younger .
other age restrictions also apply .
-lrb- icsi , or " intracytoplasmic sperm injection , " is a method involving the injection of sperm into an egg via an ultra-fine needle . -rrb- unmarried couples must cover all costs themselves .
and they are heady . a married couple 's average share per cycle currently runs around 1,300 euros -lrb- $ 1,900 -rrb- .
thus , less affluent couples have been essentially barred from trying to get pregnant through art . looking ahead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : assisted reproduction is often ridden with physical and psychological stress " we have a birth rate of 1.3 children per woman in germany , " hilland said .
" children are desperately needed in this country , so any measure to improve the birth rate would be desirable . " german doctors say they now perform around 40 percent fewer art treatments than before the reform , even though the success rate by ivf is around 25-35 percent for each try , meaning that several treatment cycles would likely see a couple 's wish for children fulfilled . the reforms were supposed to save the public health insurance funds up to 100 million euros yearly through sharing art costs with couples .
but according to hilland , some 10,000 fewer " art " children have been born each year since the reforms . considering that one in seven couples suffer from infertility and that germany 's population is aging dramatically , that number is nothing to sneeze at . louisa schaefer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de children and families -pipe- 12.12.2007 germany 's egg donation prohibition is outdated , experts say großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when fertilization does n't happen naturally , german couples face tough hurdles the recent birth of a baby by a 64-year-old woman in germany has sparked debate about the embryo protection law , which prohibits egg donation .
but with rising infertility rates , germany may need to rethink its policies . the 64-year-old german woman who recently gave birth to a healthy baby girl made headlines around the world .
but her age did not set a precedent .
last year , a 67-year-old spanish woman became the world 's oldest mother when she gave birth to twins , topping the record from the previous year of a 66-year-old romanian who also had twins . the unnamed german became pregnant with the help of in-vitro fertilization -lrb- ivf -rrb- , using an egg donated by a 25-year-old and the sperm of the german woman 's husband .
the treatment was conducted abroad , as donating eggs cells for pregnancies is illegal in germany . the prohibition of egg cell donation is part of germany 's " embryo protection law , " which was passed in 1990 .
sperm donation , however , is permitted . mothers more important than fathers ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fertility rates after 35 drop dramatically the reasoning behind the ban on egg donation was that both the genetic mother and the woman bearing the baby were presumed to be responsible for the child 's existence , said ulrich hilland of the berlin-based federal association of german centers for reproductive medicine . " the law could be interpreted in such a way that it is assumed that mothers have a stronger emotional connection to their children , due to pregnancy , than fathers , " hilland said . the law aimed to prevent the separation between the genetic and the " social " mother - the woman who would later raise the child .
surrogacy is therefore also prohibited in germany . quality risks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : several implanted embryos can result in twins or triplets christina de wit of the german national ethics council , in berlin , pointed to another reason for banning the donation of egg cells .

opponents said the law , which would have lowered the age limit for prosecuting sex offenses , went overboard . the german government was considering a plan to lower the age at which a person can be charged for perceived sexual crimes from 18 to 14 years of age , but the bill was halted on wednesday , dec .
12 , a day before it was expected to be approved by parliament . a decision on the draft , which was intended to protect youths from sexual exploitation and pornographic representation , has been postponed until early next year , a spokesman from the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- told the dpa news agency . " the valid warnings from the opposition and assessors have apparently had an effect , " said jörg van essen , parliamentary leader of the free democratic party . critics warned that the proposal would lead to a criminalization of normal sexual activity among teens and could disturb their natural sexual development . examples of punishable situations caused concern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i want to assure you there is no obligation to have sex " while the proposal spoke of punishment for minors who engage in sexual activity with an under-16-year-old that is " exploitative " or results in " reimbursement " in some form , heavy critique came when specific scenarios were brought up . for example , if a 17-year-old invites a person of the opposite sex who is 16 or younger to the movies with the perceived intention of " making out " at some point during the evening , then the 17-year-old could be in deep trouble . this situation could be construed as the older person initiating a financial exchange by picking up the tab while planning a sexual encounter with a minor as a consequence , even if there is no sexual contact between the couple . however , justice minister brigitte zypries rebutted criticism from the opposition , saying that the sidelined bill would not criminalize consensual sexual contact between teens . " no young person has to fear being punished when he invites a date to the movie theater and petting occurs , " said zypries . those opposing the bill have said there is no clarification in the actual text to clearly draw the line between what would and would not be punishable by law . pornography regulations central to proposal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : that 's far enough the new law also foresaw an expansion of the definition of child pornography to include text and images that portrayed sexual actions between teenagers .
this could even include photos of teenage girls in bikinis if the pose they strike is deemed " provocative " or the covered genital area is " prominent . " the criticism from sexologists and other experts was echoed by a number of german politicians .
jerzy montag of the opposition green party told germany 's der spiegel magazine that the law would send the " wrong signal " and that " changing the law to make it possible for the victim to be older than the culprit ignores the structure of power and experience . " germany 's current laws differentiate between child and youth pornography . a law born from eu and us justice systems germany finds itself , like all eu member states , under pressure from the european union , which requires new legislative action in the area of sexual criminal law in line with the united nations ' convention for children 's rights . but the proposed law appeared to go further than even the eu had demanded by making youths as young as 14 punishable as adults and by simultaneously raising the protected age from 16 to 18 . the eu law is primarily intended to protect minors from being forced into prostitution by illegalizing paid sex with a 16- or 17-year-old .
prostitution is currently legal in germany at 16 years or older . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shopping for fruit in view of witnesses would be allowed european experts had called the german proposal the action of a government " hostile to sex and hostile to teenagers , " while the german society for sexual research called the plan " sexual colonization , " referring to the roots of the law in the us legal system . in the united states , teenagers have already been punished under similar laws .
a 15-year-old girl who sent naked pictures of herself to a friend over the internet was recently charged with the spreading and ownership of child pornography .
this would also become an issue in under the german proposal . at the moment , the ownership and spreading of sexual material involving youngsters is only prohibited when the material involves " sodomy or sadistic pornography . "
the spd spokesman said that the question of whether it should be legal for third parties to possess sexual pictures of youths , if the youths willingly produced them , would need to be clarified before the draft could be resubmitted . dw staff -lrb- nda , kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

she will attend the document 's signing .
but amid calls for a referendum , another eu leader 's absence will be conspicuous . set to be signed by the leaders of the bloc 's 27 member states on thursday , dec .
13 , merkel said on wednesday that the eu 's reform treaty would bring about " breakthrough for europe . " " i really am not inclined to exaggerated euphoria - but i think we can declare that this day marks a historic success , a success for europe , " she said in an address to the bundestag , germany 's lower house of parliament .
" it will perhaps be seen later as a decisive milestone for a greater ability to act in europe . " she added that the agreement , to be called the lisbon treaty , " lays the groundwork for a new european union in the 21st century . " merkel said she hoped the treaty would be ratified by may 2008 .
european politicians are pushing for the text , which requires unanimous approval before going into effect , to be in place before european parliament elections in 2009 . referendum riddles bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pair of constitutional no votes threw the eu into year-long period of near inaction british prime minister gordon brown will be a notable absentee at the signing ceremony in lisbon .
he 's said that a scheduling conflict will keep him from attending the morning ceremony , but he added he would sign the document later in the day .
the nonattendance has led to domestic accusations of a " semi-detached " attitude to europe . the reform treaty is the successor to the union 's proposed constitution , which was rejected by voters in france and the netherlands in 2005 .
many governments , including the french and dutch , have said there will be no need for national referendums to ratify the reform treaty . the treaty " does not transfer sovereignty to the eu ... and there is no judicial reason to resort to a referendum , " danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen said tuesday . in order to avoid a british referendum , london was granted key policy opt-outs , thereby securing its cherished " red lines " on foreign policy , labor rights , the common law and the tax and social security systems . only ireland is constitutionally bound to put the issue to a vote , something which prime minister bertie ahern said he would like to see take place next may or june . constitutional similarities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former british prime minister tony blair has been floated as a potential eu foreign policy leader the new reform text will implement many of the changes suggested by the failed constitution , including the creation of a foreign policy chief and more permanent presidency to replace the current six-month rotating presidency system . the treaty also calls for cuts to the size of the european parliament , freezes the number of seats on the eu commission and institutes a double majority voting system that reduces the types of decision single nations can veto . attached to the new treaty is an eu charter of fundamental rights which enshrines the rights of dignity , freedoms , equality , solidarity , citizens ' rights and justice , although britain and poland are opting out of making that binding . at the charter 's signing wednesday at the european parliament , portuguese prime minister jose socrates signed the document amid noisy protests from right and left-wing parliamentarians calling for national referenda on the reform treaty . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

russia says nato left it with no choice but to abandon the agreement . officials in moscow said on wednesday , dec .
12 , that there are no plans to build up their military forces after they suspended participation in the conventional forces in europe treaty but added the move was necessary to protect russia 's national security . " such a step has been caused by the exceptional circumstances connected to the content of the treaty , which concern the security of russia and demand that we take immediate measures , " the russian foreign ministry said in a statement . the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- appealed for moscow to reconsider its decision , calling the treaty a " cornerstone for european security for 15 years . " " the suspension that takes effect today is not good news , " spanish foreign minister miguel angel moratinos , the group 's chairman-in-office , said in a statement .
" the loss of the cfe system of limitations , information and verification would be detrimental to all and could have security implications for all of europe . " military free to move bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the treaty limits troops numbers between the atlantic and the urals suspension means russia can move troops around the country without notifying nato , allowing russia to lift the " limitations placed on arms deployments , " the russian foreign ministry statement said . signed in 1990 and modified after the fall of the iron curtain in 1999 , the treaty places exact caps on the numbers of troops and heavy weapons stationed west of the ural mountains .
the cfe deal was seen as an important step in resolving the cold war . russian president vladimir putin signed a decree ordering moscow 's suspension of the treaty last month .
the decree met with wide acceptance in the russian parliament . " we wo n't observe any obligations unilaterally , " putin said in a speech last month .
" our partners did not ratify the treaty and some did not even sign it . " tit-for-tat decisions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato expanded to russia 's borders in 2004 at the heart of russia 's complaints on the cfe is nato 's failure to ratify the amended 1999 version of the treaty , which takes into account the huge changes wrought by the 1991 collapse of the soviet union .
nato 's expansion after the fall of the soviet union would potentially allow for the alliance 's troops within striking distance of st. petersburg . " the hypothetical transfer of nato forces into the baltics is a real military threat , " alexei arbatov , an arms control expert at the carnegie moscow center independent think-tank told reuters news agency . nato countries say they can not ratify the 1999 version because russian troop presence in ex-soviet georgia and moldova violates the treaty , a charge moscow rejects .
the kremlin has said soldiers stationed in the two countries represent a peacekeeping force . in a statement , nato expressed " deep regret " that russia had suspended the arms pact .
but it underlined that the military alliance would not take any retaliatory action .
the demise of the cfe comes on top of moscow 's threat to leave the intermediate range nuclear forces treaty , as well as tensions around us plans to install a missile-defense shield in nato members poland and the czech republic . reply to us missile shield bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia is opposed to the us plans for missile defense bases in the czech republic and poland while the russian foreign ministry statement wednesday made clear the military did not intend to make any major moves , deputy foreign minister alexander grushko last week gave a mixed message about possible changes in troop levels . " russia has no plans to raise its military presence in europe , obviously , that is , if there is not an attempt to raise the military presence by nato countries , " he told reporters . washington has said its missile shield initiative is designed to guard against attacks from " rogue states , " but moscow views it as an attempt by the us to expand its military influence into russia 's backyard . though russia could theoretically return to the treaty at anytime , observers said international disagreement between russia and the west makes such a move unlikely . " the treaty is dead , " military analyst pavel felgenhauer told the afp news agency .
" it makes a lot of economic sense to move forces from siberia to leningrad district , because it 's two or three times more expensive to keep them in siberia .
it will also send a powerful signal to the west .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de children and families -pipe- 12.12.2007 germany 's egg donation prohibition is outdated , experts say großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when fertilization does n't happen naturally , german couples face tough hurdles the recent birth of a baby by a 64-year-old woman in germany has sparked debate about the embryo protection law , which prohibits egg donation .
but with rising infertility rates , germany may need to rethink its policies . the 64-year-old german woman who recently gave birth to a healthy baby girl made headlines around the world .
but her age did not set a precedent .
last year , a 67-year-old spanish woman became the world 's oldest mother when she gave birth to twins , topping the record from the previous year of a 66-year-old romanian who also had twins . the unnamed german became pregnant with the help of in-vitro fertilization -lrb- ivf -rrb- , using an egg donated by a 25-year-old and the sperm of the german woman 's husband .
the treatment was conducted abroad , as donating eggs cells for pregnancies is illegal in germany . the prohibition of egg cell donation is part of germany 's " embryo protection law , " which was passed in 1990 .
sperm donation , however , is permitted . mothers more important than fathers ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fertility rates after 35 drop dramatically the reasoning behind the ban on egg donation was that both the genetic mother and the woman bearing the baby were presumed to be responsible for the child 's existence , said ulrich hilland of the berlin-based federal association of german centers for reproductive medicine . " the law could be interpreted in such a way that it is assumed that mothers have a stronger emotional connection to their children , due to pregnancy , than fathers , " hilland said . the law aimed to prevent the separation between the genetic and the " social " mother - the woman who would later raise the child .
surrogacy is therefore also prohibited in germany . quality risks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : several implanted embryos can result in twins or triplets christina de wit of the german national ethics council , in berlin , pointed to another reason for banning the donation of egg cells . " harvesting eggs from a donor is an invasive operation requiring extensive hormonal stimulation beforehand , so that many eggs mature , " she said .
" that means that the whole process involves medical risks ; that 's not the case with sperm donors . " some german politicians say the recent case demonstrates that egg donation prohibition in germany should be lifted .
others point out that the prohibition prompts " reproduction tourism " by forcing women to go abroad to fulfill their wish for children . " we see risks in quality-control here , " hilland said .
" women who go abroad can not be assured that the testing and therefore the selection process among egg donor candidates have been sufficient . " outdated law ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immobile sperm is often the cause of male infertility the current german law is one of the most restrictive in the world .
it stipulates that only as many embryos may be cultivated as may actually be implanted -lrb- up to three per ivf cycle -rrb- . embryos may also not be examined to determine sex before implantation , nor is pre-implantation genetic diagnosis -lrb- pgd -rrb- , otherwise known as " embryo screening , " allowed - the latter ban a likely result of germany trying to come to terms with its nazi past . furthermore , the freezing -lrb- cryopreservation -rrb- of embryos for later implantation is restricted .
only eggs in the very early stages of fertilization - the pre-nucleus stage - may be frozen in certain cases . the embryo protection law itself was smart , because it defined the legal parameters of in-vitro fertilization and aimed to prevent the manipulation of human life very early , hilland said . de wit agreed . " the law was originally intended to protect life at its initial stages , but unfortunately , it is rather outdated , " she said .
" a nearly 20-year-old law no longer corresponds with the huge advancements made in science and reproductive medicine . " financial problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sperm and egg are united outside of the body in ivf however , it 's not just the embryo protection law that is restrictive . " even if the law were changed to allow egg donation , only a fraction of women would take advantage of it , " de wit said . an issue affecting many more women and couples wanting children is the drastic cutback in insurance companies paying for assisted reproduction technology -lrb- art -rrb- treatments . formerly , germany 's public insurance companies - or compulsory health insurance funds - covered the entire costs of up to four ivf and isci treatments and six intrauterine inseminations -lrb- iui -rrb- .
in the wake of sweeping reforms , however , as of 2004 the funds only pay 50 percent of up to three ivf , icsi or iui cycles , and only for married couples when the woman is 40 or younger .
other age restrictions also apply .
-lrb- icsi , or " intracytoplasmic sperm injection , " is a method involving the injection of sperm into an egg via an ultra-fine needle . -rrb- unmarried couples must cover all costs themselves .
and they are heady . a married couple 's average share per cycle currently runs around 1,300 euros -lrb- $ 1,900 -rrb- .
thus , less affluent couples have been essentially barred from trying to get pregnant through art . looking ahead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : assisted reproduction is often ridden with physical and psychological stress " we have a birth rate of 1.3 children per woman in germany , " hilland said .
" children are desperately needed in this country , so any measure to improve the birth rate would be desirable . " german doctors say they now perform around 40 percent fewer art treatments than before the reform , even though the success rate by ivf is around 25-35 percent for each try , meaning that several treatment cycles would likely see a couple 's wish for children fulfilled . the reforms were supposed to save the public health insurance funds up to 100 million euros yearly through sharing art costs with couples .
but according to hilland , some 10,000 fewer " art " children have been born each year since the reforms . considering that one in seven couples suffer from infertility and that germany 's population is aging dramatically , that number is nothing to sneeze at . louisa schaefer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he warned of the high price of inaction against climate change as delegates faced hurdles in outlining a plan by the end of the week . representatives from some 190 countries on the indonesian island of bali aim by the close of the un climate conference on friday , dec .
14 , to lay the foundation for a successor to the kyoto protocol , which expires in 2012 . " we gather because the time for equivocation is over , " said ban on tuesday from bali , where security had been tightened after a car bomb attack at un offices in algeria killed dozens of people , including at least 11 un staff members . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the time is now , said ban " you need to set an agenda - a road map to a more secure climate future , coupled with a tight timeline that produces a deal by 2009 . " the details of the " road map " to be set at the conference would be hammered out over the next two years , giving ratifying nations time to ink the deal before kyoto expires . " we must ensure an incentive structure for countries , businesses and individuals , " said the un chief .
" there is no trade-off between fighting climate change and pursuing development .
in the long run , we can prosper only by doing both . " he added that , by being creative , it would be possible to reduce harmful greenhouse-gas emissions while promoting economic growth at the same time : " in this sense , climate change is a much an opportunity as it is a threat .
it is our chance to usher in a new age of green economics and truly sustainable development . " eu goal rebutted by us , others bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu supports a 25 to 40 percent emissions reduction germany and the european union want the world 's industrialized countries to commit to a 25 to 40 percent reduction in carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- emissions by 2020 , compared to 1990 levels . however , the us , japan and canada have resisted this plan .
since australian prime minister kevin rudd submitted his country 's ratification of the kyoto protocol earlier this week , the united states is the only remaining industrialized nation not to sign the document . the us has traditionally advocated voluntary commitments instead of an international binding agreement . " we want to be sure that the text -lsb- of a new climate agreement -rsb- that we have before us is going to be neutral - it will leave all options on the table and , again , will not prejudge outcomes , which should be something that comes at the end of the two-year process , " said us negotiator harlan watson . such high figures for emission reduction are essential for wealthier countries to show emerging nations they are serious about tackling climate change , countered germany 's environment minister sigmar gabriel , who arrived in bali on tuesday and is scheduled to hold a speech on wednesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : australia 's new prime minister kevin rudd handed in his country 's kyoto ratification how to involve developing and emerging countries in climate change improvements and equip them with the necessary earth-friendly technology have been unresolved issues in the discussion . ban warns against failure of talks ban reminded delegates that world leaders in september had called for a breakthrough at the conference .

opponents said the law , which would have lowered the age limit for prosecuting sex offenses , went overboard . the german government was considering a plan to lower the age at which a person can be charged for perceived sexual crimes from 18 to 14 years of age , but the bill was halted on wednesday , dec .
12 , a day before it was expected to be approved by parliament . a decision on the draft , which was intended to protect youths from sexual exploitation and pornographic representation , has been postponed until early next year , a spokesman from the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- told the dpa news agency . " the valid warnings from the opposition and assessors have apparently had an effect , " said jörg van essen , parliamentary leader of the free democratic party . critics warned that the proposal would lead to a criminalization of normal sexual activity among teens and could disturb their natural sexual development . examples of punishable situations caused concern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i want to assure you there is no obligation to have sex " while the proposal spoke of punishment for minors who engage in sexual activity with an under-16-year-old that is " exploitative " or results in " reimbursement " in some form , heavy critique came when specific scenarios were brought up . for example , if a 17-year-old invites a person of the opposite sex who is 16 or younger to the movies with the perceived intention of " making out " at some point during the evening , then the 17-year-old could be in deep trouble . this situation could be construed as the older person initiating a financial exchange by picking up the tab while planning a sexual encounter with a minor as a consequence , even if there is no sexual contact between the couple . however , justice minister brigitte zypries rebutted criticism from the opposition , saying that the sidelined bill would not criminalize consensual sexual contact between teens . " no young person has to fear being punished when he invites a date to the movie theater and petting occurs , " said zypries . those opposing the bill have said there is no clarification in the actual text to clearly draw the line between what would and would not be punishable by law . pornography regulations central to proposal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : that 's far enough the new law also foresaw an expansion of the definition of child pornography to include text and images that portrayed sexual actions between teenagers .

prostitution is currently legal in germany at 16 years or older . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shopping for fruit in view of witnesses would be allowed european experts had called the german proposal the action of a government " hostile to sex and hostile to teenagers , " while the german society for sexual research called the plan " sexual colonization , " referring to the roots of the law in the us legal system . in the united states , teenagers have already been punished under similar laws .
a 15-year-old girl who sent naked pictures of herself to a friend over the internet was recently charged with the spreading and ownership of child pornography .
this would also become an issue in under the german proposal . at the moment , the ownership and spreading of sexual material involving youngsters is only prohibited when the material involves " sodomy or sadistic pornography . "
the spd spokesman said that the question of whether it should be legal for third parties to possess sexual pictures of youths , if the youths willingly produced them , would need to be clarified before the draft could be resubmitted . dw staff -lrb- nda , kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he warned of the high price of inaction against climate change as delegates faced hurdles in outlining a plan by the end of the week . representatives from some 190 countries on the indonesian island of bali aim by the close of the un climate conference on friday , dec .
14 , to lay the foundation for a successor to the kyoto protocol , which expires in 2012 . " we gather because the time for equivocation is over , " said ban on tuesday from bali , where security had been tightened after a car bomb attack at un offices in algeria killed dozens of people , including at least 11 un staff members . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the time is now , said ban " you need to set an agenda - a road map to a more secure climate future , coupled with a tight timeline that produces a deal by 2009 . " the details of the " road map " to be set at the conference would be hammered out over the next two years , giving ratifying nations time to ink the deal before kyoto expires . " we must ensure an incentive structure for countries , businesses and individuals , " said the un chief .
" there is no trade-off between fighting climate change and pursuing development .
in the long run , we can prosper only by doing both . " he added that , by being creative , it would be possible to reduce harmful greenhouse-gas emissions while promoting economic growth at the same time : " in this sense , climate change is a much an opportunity as it is a threat .
it is our chance to usher in a new age of green economics and truly sustainable development . " eu goal rebutted by us , others bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu supports a 25 to 40 percent emissions reduction germany and the european union want the world 's industrialized countries to commit to a 25 to 40 percent reduction in carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- emissions by 2020 , compared to 1990 levels . however , the us , japan and canada have resisted this plan .
since australian prime minister kevin rudd submitted his country 's ratification of the kyoto protocol earlier this week , the united states is the only remaining industrialized nation not to sign the document . the us has traditionally advocated voluntary commitments instead of an international binding agreement . " we want to be sure that the text -lsb- of a new climate agreement -rsb- that we have before us is going to be neutral - it will leave all options on the table and , again , will not prejudge outcomes , which should be something that comes at the end of the two-year process , " said us negotiator harlan watson . such high figures for emission reduction are essential for wealthier countries to show emerging nations they are serious about tackling climate change , countered germany 's environment minister sigmar gabriel , who arrived in bali on tuesday and is scheduled to hold a speech on wednesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : australia 's new prime minister kevin rudd handed in his country 's kyoto ratification how to involve developing and emerging countries in climate change improvements and equip them with the necessary earth-friendly technology have been unresolved issues in the discussion . ban warns against failure of talks ban reminded delegates that world leaders in september had called for a breakthrough at the conference . " if we leave bali without such a breakthrough , we will not only have failed our leaders , but also those who look to us to find solutions , namely , the peoples of this world , " he said . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

she will attend the document 's signing .
but amid calls for a referendum , another eu leader 's absence will be conspicuous . set to be signed by the leaders of the bloc 's 27 member states on thursday , dec .
13 , merkel said on wednesday that the eu 's reform treaty would bring about " breakthrough for europe . " " i really am not inclined to exaggerated euphoria - but i think we can declare that this day marks a historic success , a success for europe , " she said in an address to the bundestag , germany 's lower house of parliament .
" it will perhaps be seen later as a decisive milestone for a greater ability to act in europe . " she added that the agreement , to be called the lisbon treaty , " lays the groundwork for a new european union in the 21st century . " merkel said she hoped the treaty would be ratified by may 2008 .
european politicians are pushing for the text , which requires unanimous approval before going into effect , to be in place before european parliament elections in 2009 . referendum riddles bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pair of constitutional no votes threw the eu into year-long period of near inaction british prime minister gordon brown will be a notable absentee at the signing ceremony in lisbon .
he 's said that a scheduling conflict will keep him from attending the morning ceremony , but he added he would sign the document later in the day .
the nonattendance has led to domestic accusations of a " semi-detached " attitude to europe . the reform treaty is the successor to the union 's proposed constitution , which was rejected by voters in france and the netherlands in 2005 .
many governments , including the french and dutch , have said there will be no need for national referendums to ratify the reform treaty . the treaty " does not transfer sovereignty to the eu ... and there is no judicial reason to resort to a referendum , " danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen said tuesday . in order to avoid a british referendum , london was granted key policy opt-outs , thereby securing its cherished " red lines " on foreign policy , labor rights , the common law and the tax and social security systems . only ireland is constitutionally bound to put the issue to a vote , something which prime minister bertie ahern said he would like to see take place next may or june . constitutional similarities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former british prime minister tony blair has been floated as a potential eu foreign policy leader the new reform text will implement many of the changes suggested by the failed constitution , including the creation of a foreign policy chief and more permanent presidency to replace the current six-month rotating presidency system . the treaty also calls for cuts to the size of the european parliament , freezes the number of seats on the eu commission and institutes a double majority voting system that reduces the types of decision single nations can veto . attached to the new treaty is an eu charter of fundamental rights which enshrines the rights of dignity , freedoms , equality , solidarity , citizens ' rights and justice , although britain and poland are opting out of making that binding . at the charter 's signing wednesday at the european parliament , portuguese prime minister jose socrates signed the document amid noisy protests from right and left-wing parliamentarians calling for national referenda on the reform treaty . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he warned of the high price of inaction against climate change as delegates faced hurdles in outlining a plan by the end of the week . representatives from some 190 countries on the indonesian island of bali aim by the close of the un climate conference on friday , dec .
14 , to lay the foundation for a successor to the kyoto protocol , which expires in 2012 . " we gather because the time for equivocation is over , " said ban on tuesday from bali , where security had been tightened after a car bomb attack at un offices in algeria killed dozens of people , including at least 11 un staff members . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the time is now , said ban " you need to set an agenda - a road map to a more secure climate future , coupled with a tight timeline that produces a deal by 2009 . " the details of the " road map " to be set at the conference would be hammered out over the next two years , giving ratifying nations time to ink the deal before kyoto expires . " we must ensure an incentive structure for countries , businesses and individuals , " said the un chief .
" there is no trade-off between fighting climate change and pursuing development .
in the long run , we can prosper only by doing both . " he added that , by being creative , it would be possible to reduce harmful greenhouse-gas emissions while promoting economic growth at the same time : " in this sense , climate change is a much an opportunity as it is a threat .

she will attend the document 's signing .
but amid calls for a referendum , another eu leader 's absence will be conspicuous . set to be signed by the leaders of the bloc 's 27 member states on thursday , dec .
13 , merkel said on wednesday that the eu 's reform treaty would bring about " breakthrough for europe . " " i really am not inclined to exaggerated euphoria - but i think we can declare that this day marks a historic success , a success for europe , " she said in an address to the bundestag , germany 's lower house of parliament .
" it will perhaps be seen later as a decisive milestone for a greater ability to act in europe . " she added that the agreement , to be called the lisbon treaty , " lays the groundwork for a new european union in the 21st century . " merkel said she hoped the treaty would be ratified by may 2008 .
european politicians are pushing for the text , which requires unanimous approval before going into effect , to be in place before european parliament elections in 2009 . referendum riddles bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pair of constitutional no votes threw the eu into year-long period of near inaction british prime minister gordon brown will be a notable absentee at the signing ceremony in lisbon .
he 's said that a scheduling conflict will keep him from attending the morning ceremony , but he added he would sign the document later in the day .
the nonattendance has led to domestic accusations of a " semi-detached " attitude to europe . the reform treaty is the successor to the union 's proposed constitution , which was rejected by voters in france and the netherlands in 2005 .
many governments , including the french and dutch , have said there will be no need for national referendums to ratify the reform treaty . the treaty " does not transfer sovereignty to the eu ... and there is no judicial reason to resort to a referendum , " danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen said tuesday . in order to avoid a british referendum , london was granted key policy opt-outs , thereby securing its cherished " red lines " on foreign policy , labor rights , the common law and the tax and social security systems . only ireland is constitutionally bound to put the issue to a vote , something which prime minister bertie ahern said he would like to see take place next may or june . constitutional similarities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former british prime minister tony blair has been floated as a potential eu foreign policy leader the new reform text will implement many of the changes suggested by the failed constitution , including the creation of a foreign policy chief and more permanent presidency to replace the current six-month rotating presidency system . the treaty also calls for cuts to the size of the european parliament , freezes the number of seats on the eu commission and institutes a double majority voting system that reduces the types of decision single nations can veto . attached to the new treaty is an eu charter of fundamental rights which enshrines the rights of dignity , freedoms , equality , solidarity , citizens ' rights and justice , although britain and poland are opting out of making that binding . at the charter 's signing wednesday at the european parliament , portuguese prime minister jose socrates signed the document amid noisy protests from right and left-wing parliamentarians calling for national referenda on the reform treaty . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de children and families -pipe- 12.12.2007 germany 's egg donation prohibition is outdated , experts say großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when fertilization does n't happen naturally , german couples face tough hurdles the recent birth of a baby by a 64-year-old woman in germany has sparked debate about the embryo protection law , which prohibits egg donation .
but with rising infertility rates , germany may need to rethink its policies . the 64-year-old german woman who recently gave birth to a healthy baby girl made headlines around the world .
but her age did not set a precedent .
last year , a 67-year-old spanish woman became the world 's oldest mother when she gave birth to twins , topping the record from the previous year of a 66-year-old romanian who also had twins . the unnamed german became pregnant with the help of in-vitro fertilization -lrb- ivf -rrb- , using an egg donated by a 25-year-old and the sperm of the german woman 's husband .
the treatment was conducted abroad , as donating eggs cells for pregnancies is illegal in germany . the prohibition of egg cell donation is part of germany 's " embryo protection law , " which was passed in 1990 .
sperm donation , however , is permitted . mothers more important than fathers ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fertility rates after 35 drop dramatically the reasoning behind the ban on egg donation was that both the genetic mother and the woman bearing the baby were presumed to be responsible for the child 's existence , said ulrich hilland of the berlin-based federal association of german centers for reproductive medicine . " the law could be interpreted in such a way that it is assumed that mothers have a stronger emotional connection to their children , due to pregnancy , than fathers , " hilland said . the law aimed to prevent the separation between the genetic and the " social " mother - the woman who would later raise the child .
surrogacy is therefore also prohibited in germany . quality risks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : several implanted embryos can result in twins or triplets christina de wit of the german national ethics council , in berlin , pointed to another reason for banning the donation of egg cells . " harvesting eggs from a donor is an invasive operation requiring extensive hormonal stimulation beforehand , so that many eggs mature , " she said .

but with rising infertility rates , germany may need to rethink its policies . the 64-year-old german woman who recently gave birth to a healthy baby girl made headlines around the world .
but her age did not set a precedent .
last year , a 67-year-old spanish woman became the world 's oldest mother when she gave birth to twins , topping the record from the previous year of a 66-year-old romanian who also had twins . the unnamed german became pregnant with the help of in-vitro fertilization -lrb- ivf -rrb- , using an egg donated by a 25-year-old and the sperm of the german woman 's husband .
the treatment was conducted abroad , as donating eggs cells for pregnancies is illegal in germany . the prohibition of egg cell donation is part of germany 's " embryo protection law , " which was passed in 1990 .
sperm donation , however , is permitted . mothers more important than fathers ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fertility rates after 35 drop dramatically the reasoning behind the ban on egg donation was that both the genetic mother and the woman bearing the baby were presumed to be responsible for the child 's existence , said ulrich hilland of the berlin-based federal association of german centers for reproductive medicine . " the law could be interpreted in such a way that it is assumed that mothers have a stronger emotional connection to their children , due to pregnancy , than fathers , " hilland said . the law aimed to prevent the separation between the genetic and the " social " mother - the woman who would later raise the child .
surrogacy is therefore also prohibited in germany . quality risks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : several implanted embryos can result in twins or triplets christina de wit of the german national ethics council , in berlin , pointed to another reason for banning the donation of egg cells . " harvesting eggs from a donor is an invasive operation requiring extensive hormonal stimulation beforehand , so that many eggs mature , " she said .
" that means that the whole process involves medical risks ; that 's not the case with sperm donors . " some german politicians say the recent case demonstrates that egg donation prohibition in germany should be lifted .
others point out that the prohibition prompts " reproduction tourism " by forcing women to go abroad to fulfill their wish for children . " we see risks in quality-control here , " hilland said .
" women who go abroad can not be assured that the testing and therefore the selection process among egg donor candidates have been sufficient .

he warned of the high price of inaction against climate change as delegates faced hurdles in outlining a plan by the end of the week . representatives from some 190 countries on the indonesian island of bali aim by the close of the un climate conference on friday , dec .
14 , to lay the foundation for a successor to the kyoto protocol , which expires in 2012 . " we gather because the time for equivocation is over , " said ban on tuesday from bali , where security had been tightened after a car bomb attack at un offices in algeria killed dozens of people , including at least 11 un staff members . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the time is now , said ban " you need to set an agenda - a road map to a more secure climate future , coupled with a tight timeline that produces a deal by 2009 . " the details of the " road map " to be set at the conference would be hammered out over the next two years , giving ratifying nations time to ink the deal before kyoto expires . " we must ensure an incentive structure for countries , businesses and individuals , " said the un chief .
" there is no trade-off between fighting climate change and pursuing development .
in the long run , we can prosper only by doing both . " he added that , by being creative , it would be possible to reduce harmful greenhouse-gas emissions while promoting economic growth at the same time : " in this sense , climate change is a much an opportunity as it is a threat .
it is our chance to usher in a new age of green economics and truly sustainable development . " eu goal rebutted by us , others bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu supports a 25 to 40 percent emissions reduction germany and the european union want the world 's industrialized countries to commit to a 25 to 40 percent reduction in carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- emissions by 2020 , compared to 1990 levels . however , the us , japan and canada have resisted this plan .
since australian prime minister kevin rudd submitted his country 's ratification of the kyoto protocol earlier this week , the united states is the only remaining industrialized nation not to sign the document . the us has traditionally advocated voluntary commitments instead of an international binding agreement . " we want to be sure that the text -lsb- of a new climate agreement -rsb- that we have before us is going to be neutral - it will leave all options on the table and , again , will not prejudge outcomes , which should be something that comes at the end of the two-year process , " said us negotiator harlan watson . such high figures for emission reduction are essential for wealthier countries to show emerging nations they are serious about tackling climate change , countered germany 's environment minister sigmar gabriel , who arrived in bali on tuesday and is scheduled to hold a speech on wednesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : australia 's new prime minister kevin rudd handed in his country 's kyoto ratification how to involve developing and emerging countries in climate change improvements and equip them with the necessary earth-friendly technology have been unresolved issues in the discussion . ban warns against failure of talks ban reminded delegates that world leaders in september had called for a breakthrough at the conference . " if we leave bali without such a breakthrough , we will not only have failed our leaders , but also those who look to us to find solutions , namely , the peoples of this world , " he said . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but with rising infertility rates , germany may need to rethink its policies . the 64-year-old german woman who recently gave birth to a healthy baby girl made headlines around the world .
but her age did not set a precedent .
last year , a 67-year-old spanish woman became the world 's oldest mother when she gave birth to twins , topping the record from the previous year of a 66-year-old romanian who also had twins . the unnamed german became pregnant with the help of in-vitro fertilization -lrb- ivf -rrb- , using an egg donated by a 25-year-old and the sperm of the german woman 's husband .
the treatment was conducted abroad , as donating eggs cells for pregnancies is illegal in germany . the prohibition of egg cell donation is part of germany 's " embryo protection law , " which was passed in 1990 .
sperm donation , however , is permitted . mothers more important than fathers ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fertility rates after 35 drop dramatically the reasoning behind the ban on egg donation was that both the genetic mother and the woman bearing the baby were presumed to be responsible for the child 's existence , said ulrich hilland of the berlin-based federal association of german centers for reproductive medicine . " the law could be interpreted in such a way that it is assumed that mothers have a stronger emotional connection to their children , due to pregnancy , than fathers , " hilland said . the law aimed to prevent the separation between the genetic and the " social " mother - the woman who would later raise the child .
surrogacy is therefore also prohibited in germany . quality risks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : several implanted embryos can result in twins or triplets christina de wit of the german national ethics council , in berlin , pointed to another reason for banning the donation of egg cells . " harvesting eggs from a donor is an invasive operation requiring extensive hormonal stimulation beforehand , so that many eggs mature , " she said .
" that means that the whole process involves medical risks ; that 's not the case with sperm donors . " some german politicians say the recent case demonstrates that egg donation prohibition in germany should be lifted .
others point out that the prohibition prompts " reproduction tourism " by forcing women to go abroad to fulfill their wish for children . " we see risks in quality-control here , " hilland said .
" women who go abroad can not be assured that the testing and therefore the selection process among egg donor candidates have been sufficient . " outdated law ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immobile sperm is often the cause of male infertility the current german law is one of the most restrictive in the world .
it stipulates that only as many embryos may be cultivated as may actually be implanted -lrb- up to three per ivf cycle -rrb- . embryos may also not be examined to determine sex before implantation , nor is pre-implantation genetic diagnosis -lrb- pgd -rrb- , otherwise known as " embryo screening , " allowed - the latter ban a likely result of germany trying to come to terms with its nazi past . furthermore , the freezing -lrb- cryopreservation -rrb- of embryos for later implantation is restricted .
only eggs in the very early stages of fertilization - the pre-nucleus stage - may be frozen in certain cases . the embryo protection law itself was smart , because it defined the legal parameters of in-vitro fertilization and aimed to prevent the manipulation of human life very early , hilland said . de wit agreed . " the law was originally intended to protect life at its initial stages , but unfortunately , it is rather outdated , " she said .
" a nearly 20-year-old law no longer corresponds with the huge advancements made in science and reproductive medicine . " financial problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sperm and egg are united outside of the body in ivf however , it 's not just the embryo protection law that is restrictive . " even if the law were changed to allow egg donation , only a fraction of women would take advantage of it , " de wit said . an issue affecting many more women and couples wanting children is the drastic cutback in insurance companies paying for assisted reproduction technology -lrb- art -rrb- treatments . formerly , germany 's public insurance companies - or compulsory health insurance funds - covered the entire costs of up to four ivf and isci treatments and six intrauterine inseminations -lrb- iui -rrb- .
in the wake of sweeping reforms , however , as of 2004 the funds only pay 50 percent of up to three ivf , icsi or iui cycles , and only for married couples when the woman is 40 or younger .
other age restrictions also apply .
-lrb- icsi , or " intracytoplasmic sperm injection , " is a method involving the injection of sperm into an egg via an ultra-fine needle . -rrb- unmarried couples must cover all costs themselves .
and they are heady . a married couple 's average share per cycle currently runs around 1,300 euros -lrb- $ 1,900 -rrb- .
thus , less affluent couples have been essentially barred from trying to get pregnant through art . looking ahead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : assisted reproduction is often ridden with physical and psychological stress " we have a birth rate of 1.3 children per woman in germany , " hilland said .
" children are desperately needed in this country , so any measure to improve the birth rate would be desirable . " german doctors say they now perform around 40 percent fewer art treatments than before the reform , even though the success rate by ivf is around 25-35 percent for each try , meaning that several treatment cycles would likely see a couple 's wish for children fulfilled . the reforms were supposed to save the public health insurance funds up to 100 million euros yearly through sharing art costs with couples .
but according to hilland , some 10,000 fewer " art " children have been born each year since the reforms . considering that one in seven couples suffer from infertility and that germany 's population is aging dramatically , that number is nothing to sneeze at . louisa schaefer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but with rising infertility rates , germany may need to rethink its policies . the 64-year-old german woman who recently gave birth to a healthy baby girl made headlines around the world .
but her age did not set a precedent .
last year , a 67-year-old spanish woman became the world 's oldest mother when she gave birth to twins , topping the record from the previous year of a 66-year-old romanian who also had twins . the unnamed german became pregnant with the help of in-vitro fertilization -lrb- ivf -rrb- , using an egg donated by a 25-year-old and the sperm of the german woman 's husband .
the treatment was conducted abroad , as donating eggs cells for pregnancies is illegal in germany . the prohibition of egg cell donation is part of germany 's " embryo protection law , " which was passed in 1990 .
sperm donation , however , is permitted . mothers more important than fathers ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fertility rates after 35 drop dramatically the reasoning behind the ban on egg donation was that both the genetic mother and the woman bearing the baby were presumed to be responsible for the child 's existence , said ulrich hilland of the berlin-based federal association of german centers for reproductive medicine . " the law could be interpreted in such a way that it is assumed that mothers have a stronger emotional connection to their children , due to pregnancy , than fathers , " hilland said . the law aimed to prevent the separation between the genetic and the " social " mother - the woman who would later raise the child .
surrogacy is therefore also prohibited in germany . quality risks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : several implanted embryos can result in twins or triplets christina de wit of the german national ethics council , in berlin , pointed to another reason for banning the donation of egg cells . " harvesting eggs from a donor is an invasive operation requiring extensive hormonal stimulation beforehand , so that many eggs mature , " she said .
" that means that the whole process involves medical risks ; that 's not the case with sperm donors . " some german politicians say the recent case demonstrates that egg donation prohibition in germany should be lifted .
others point out that the prohibition prompts " reproduction tourism " by forcing women to go abroad to fulfill their wish for children . " we see risks in quality-control here , " hilland said .
" women who go abroad can not be assured that the testing and therefore the selection process among egg donor candidates have been sufficient . " outdated law ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immobile sperm is often the cause of male infertility the current german law is one of the most restrictive in the world .
it stipulates that only as many embryos may be cultivated as may actually be implanted -lrb- up to three per ivf cycle -rrb- . embryos may also not be examined to determine sex before implantation , nor is pre-implantation genetic diagnosis -lrb- pgd -rrb- , otherwise known as " embryo screening , " allowed - the latter ban a likely result of germany trying to come to terms with its nazi past . furthermore , the freezing -lrb- cryopreservation -rrb- of embryos for later implantation is restricted .
only eggs in the very early stages of fertilization - the pre-nucleus stage - may be frozen in certain cases . the embryo protection law itself was smart , because it defined the legal parameters of in-vitro fertilization and aimed to prevent the manipulation of human life very early , hilland said . de wit agreed . " the law was originally intended to protect life at its initial stages , but unfortunately , it is rather outdated , " she said .
" a nearly 20-year-old law no longer corresponds with the huge advancements made in science and reproductive medicine . " financial problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sperm and egg are united outside of the body in ivf however , it 's not just the embryo protection law that is restrictive . " even if the law were changed to allow egg donation , only a fraction of women would take advantage of it , " de wit said . an issue affecting many more women and couples wanting children is the drastic cutback in insurance companies paying for assisted reproduction technology -lrb- art -rrb- treatments . formerly , germany 's public insurance companies - or compulsory health insurance funds - covered the entire costs of up to four ivf and isci treatments and six intrauterine inseminations -lrb- iui -rrb- .
in the wake of sweeping reforms , however , as of 2004 the funds only pay 50 percent of up to three ivf , icsi or iui cycles , and only for married couples when the woman is 40 or younger .

she will attend the document 's signing .
but amid calls for a referendum , another eu leader 's absence will be conspicuous . set to be signed by the leaders of the bloc 's 27 member states on thursday , dec .
13 , merkel said on wednesday that the eu 's reform treaty would bring about " breakthrough for europe . " " i really am not inclined to exaggerated euphoria - but i think we can declare that this day marks a historic success , a success for europe , " she said in an address to the bundestag , germany 's lower house of parliament .
" it will perhaps be seen later as a decisive milestone for a greater ability to act in europe . " she added that the agreement , to be called the lisbon treaty , " lays the groundwork for a new european union in the 21st century . " merkel said she hoped the treaty would be ratified by may 2008 .
european politicians are pushing for the text , which requires unanimous approval before going into effect , to be in place before european parliament elections in 2009 . referendum riddles bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pair of constitutional no votes threw the eu into year-long period of near inaction british prime minister gordon brown will be a notable absentee at the signing ceremony in lisbon .
he 's said that a scheduling conflict will keep him from attending the morning ceremony , but he added he would sign the document later in the day .
the nonattendance has led to domestic accusations of a " semi-detached " attitude to europe . the reform treaty is the successor to the union 's proposed constitution , which was rejected by voters in france and the netherlands in 2005 .
many governments , including the french and dutch , have said there will be no need for national referendums to ratify the reform treaty . the treaty " does not transfer sovereignty to the eu ... and there is no judicial reason to resort to a referendum , " danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen said tuesday . in order to avoid a british referendum , london was granted key policy opt-outs , thereby securing its cherished " red lines " on foreign policy , labor rights , the common law and the tax and social security systems . only ireland is constitutionally bound to put the issue to a vote , something which prime minister bertie ahern said he would like to see take place next may or june . constitutional similarities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former british prime minister tony blair has been floated as a potential eu foreign policy leader the new reform text will implement many of the changes suggested by the failed constitution , including the creation of a foreign policy chief and more permanent presidency to replace the current six-month rotating presidency system . the treaty also calls for cuts to the size of the european parliament , freezes the number of seats on the eu commission and institutes a double majority voting system that reduces the types of decision single nations can veto . attached to the new treaty is an eu charter of fundamental rights which enshrines the rights of dignity , freedoms , equality , solidarity , citizens ' rights and justice , although britain and poland are opting out of making that binding . at the charter 's signing wednesday at the european parliament , portuguese prime minister jose socrates signed the document amid noisy protests from right and left-wing parliamentarians calling for national referenda on the reform treaty . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 12.12.2007 moscow suspends cold war weapons treaty großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moscow can now legally move troops and weapons without notifying nato moscow officially ended its adherence to a key cold war treaty that sets limits on the number of soldiers and weapons stationed in europe .
russia says nato left it with no choice but to abandon the agreement . officials in moscow said on wednesday , dec .
12 , that there are no plans to build up their military forces after they suspended participation in the conventional forces in europe treaty but added the move was necessary to protect russia 's national security . " such a step has been caused by the exceptional circumstances connected to the content of the treaty , which concern the security of russia and demand that we take immediate measures , " the russian foreign ministry said in a statement . the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- appealed for moscow to reconsider its decision , calling the treaty a " cornerstone for european security for 15 years . " " the suspension that takes effect today is not good news , " spanish foreign minister miguel angel moratinos , the group 's chairman-in-office , said in a statement .
" the loss of the cfe system of limitations , information and verification would be detrimental to all and could have security implications for all of europe . " military free to move bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the treaty limits troops numbers between the atlantic and the urals suspension means russia can move troops around the country without notifying nato , allowing russia to lift the " limitations placed on arms deployments , " the russian foreign ministry statement said . signed in 1990 and modified after the fall of the iron curtain in 1999 , the treaty places exact caps on the numbers of troops and heavy weapons stationed west of the ural mountains .
the cfe deal was seen as an important step in resolving the cold war . russian president vladimir putin signed a decree ordering moscow 's suspension of the treaty last month .
the decree met with wide acceptance in the russian parliament . " we wo n't observe any obligations unilaterally , " putin said in a speech last month .
" our partners did not ratify the treaty and some did not even sign it . " tit-for-tat decisions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato expanded to russia 's borders in 2004 at the heart of russia 's complaints on the cfe is nato 's failure to ratify the amended 1999 version of the treaty , which takes into account the huge changes wrought by the 1991 collapse of the soviet union .
nato 's expansion after the fall of the soviet union would potentially allow for the alliance 's troops within striking distance of st. petersburg . " the hypothetical transfer of nato forces into the baltics is a real military threat , " alexei arbatov , an arms control expert at the carnegie moscow center independent think-tank told reuters news agency . nato countries say they can not ratify the 1999 version because russian troop presence in ex-soviet georgia and moldova violates the treaty , a charge moscow rejects .
the kremlin has said soldiers stationed in the two countries represent a peacekeeping force . in a statement , nato expressed " deep regret " that russia had suspended the arms pact .
but it underlined that the military alliance would not take any retaliatory action .
the demise of the cfe comes on top of moscow 's threat to leave the intermediate range nuclear forces treaty , as well as tensions around us plans to install a missile-defense shield in nato members poland and the czech republic . reply to us missile shield bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia is opposed to the us plans for missile defense bases in the czech republic and poland while the russian foreign ministry statement wednesday made clear the military did not intend to make any major moves , deputy foreign minister alexander grushko last week gave a mixed message about possible changes in troop levels . " russia has no plans to raise its military presence in europe , obviously , that is , if there is not an attempt to raise the military presence by nato countries , " he told reporters . washington has said its missile shield initiative is designed to guard against attacks from " rogue states , " but moscow views it as an attempt by the us to expand its military influence into russia 's backyard . though russia could theoretically return to the treaty at anytime , observers said international disagreement between russia and the west makes such a move unlikely . " the treaty is dead , " military analyst pavel felgenhauer told the afp news agency .
" it makes a lot of economic sense to move forces from siberia to leningrad district , because it 's two or three times more expensive to keep them in siberia .
it will also send a powerful signal to the west .
it 's a win-win situation for russia . " dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

russia says nato left it with no choice but to abandon the agreement . officials in moscow said on wednesday , dec .
12 , that there are no plans to build up their military forces after they suspended participation in the conventional forces in europe treaty but added the move was necessary to protect russia 's national security . " such a step has been caused by the exceptional circumstances connected to the content of the treaty , which concern the security of russia and demand that we take immediate measures , " the russian foreign ministry said in a statement . the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- appealed for moscow to reconsider its decision , calling the treaty a " cornerstone for european security for 15 years . " " the suspension that takes effect today is not good news , " spanish foreign minister miguel angel moratinos , the group 's chairman-in-office , said in a statement .
" the loss of the cfe system of limitations , information and verification would be detrimental to all and could have security implications for all of europe . " military free to move bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the treaty limits troops numbers between the atlantic and the urals suspension means russia can move troops around the country without notifying nato , allowing russia to lift the " limitations placed on arms deployments , " the russian foreign ministry statement said . signed in 1990 and modified after the fall of the iron curtain in 1999 , the treaty places exact caps on the numbers of troops and heavy weapons stationed west of the ural mountains .
the cfe deal was seen as an important step in resolving the cold war . russian president vladimir putin signed a decree ordering moscow 's suspension of the treaty last month .
the decree met with wide acceptance in the russian parliament . " we wo n't observe any obligations unilaterally , " putin said in a speech last month .
" our partners did not ratify the treaty and some did not even sign it . " tit-for-tat decisions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato expanded to russia 's borders in 2004 at the heart of russia 's complaints on the cfe is nato 's failure to ratify the amended 1999 version of the treaty , which takes into account the huge changes wrought by the 1991 collapse of the soviet union .
nato 's expansion after the fall of the soviet union would potentially allow for the alliance 's troops within striking distance of st. petersburg . " the hypothetical transfer of nato forces into the baltics is a real military threat , " alexei arbatov , an arms control expert at the carnegie moscow center independent think-tank told reuters news agency . nato countries say they can not ratify the 1999 version because russian troop presence in ex-soviet georgia and moldova violates the treaty , a charge moscow rejects .
the kremlin has said soldiers stationed in the two countries represent a peacekeeping force . in a statement , nato expressed " deep regret " that russia had suspended the arms pact .
but it underlined that the military alliance would not take any retaliatory action .
the demise of the cfe comes on top of moscow 's threat to leave the intermediate range nuclear forces treaty , as well as tensions around us plans to install a missile-defense shield in nato members poland and the czech republic . reply to us missile shield bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia is opposed to the us plans for missile defense bases in the czech republic and poland while the russian foreign ministry statement wednesday made clear the military did not intend to make any major moves , deputy foreign minister alexander grushko last week gave a mixed message about possible changes in troop levels . " russia has no plans to raise its military presence in europe , obviously , that is , if there is not an attempt to raise the military presence by nato countries , " he told reporters . washington has said its missile shield initiative is designed to guard against attacks from " rogue states , " but moscow views it as an attempt by the us to expand its military influence into russia 's backyard . though russia could theoretically return to the treaty at anytime , observers said international disagreement between russia and the west makes such a move unlikely . " the treaty is dead , " military analyst pavel felgenhauer told the afp news agency .
" it makes a lot of economic sense to move forces from siberia to leningrad district , because it 's two or three times more expensive to keep them in siberia .
it will also send a powerful signal to the west .
it 's a win-win situation for russia . " dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he warned of the high price of inaction against climate change as delegates faced hurdles in outlining a plan by the end of the week . representatives from some 190 countries on the indonesian island of bali aim by the close of the un climate conference on friday , dec .
14 , to lay the foundation for a successor to the kyoto protocol , which expires in 2012 . " we gather because the time for equivocation is over , " said ban on tuesday from bali , where security had been tightened after a car bomb attack at un offices in algeria killed dozens of people , including at least 11 un staff members . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the time is now , said ban " you need to set an agenda - a road map to a more secure climate future , coupled with a tight timeline that produces a deal by 2009 . " the details of the " road map " to be set at the conference would be hammered out over the next two years , giving ratifying nations time to ink the deal before kyoto expires . " we must ensure an incentive structure for countries , businesses and individuals , " said the un chief .
" there is no trade-off between fighting climate change and pursuing development .

she will attend the document 's signing .
but amid calls for a referendum , another eu leader 's absence will be conspicuous . set to be signed by the leaders of the bloc 's 27 member states on thursday , dec .
13 , merkel said on wednesday that the eu 's reform treaty would bring about " breakthrough for europe . " " i really am not inclined to exaggerated euphoria - but i think we can declare that this day marks a historic success , a success for europe , " she said in an address to the bundestag , germany 's lower house of parliament .
" it will perhaps be seen later as a decisive milestone for a greater ability to act in europe . " she added that the agreement , to be called the lisbon treaty , " lays the groundwork for a new european union in the 21st century . " merkel said she hoped the treaty would be ratified by may 2008 .
european politicians are pushing for the text , which requires unanimous approval before going into effect , to be in place before european parliament elections in 2009 . referendum riddles bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pair of constitutional no votes threw the eu into year-long period of near inaction british prime minister gordon brown will be a notable absentee at the signing ceremony in lisbon .
he 's said that a scheduling conflict will keep him from attending the morning ceremony , but he added he would sign the document later in the day .
the nonattendance has led to domestic accusations of a " semi-detached " attitude to europe . the reform treaty is the successor to the union 's proposed constitution , which was rejected by voters in france and the netherlands in 2005 .
many governments , including the french and dutch , have said there will be no need for national referendums to ratify the reform treaty . the treaty " does not transfer sovereignty to the eu ... and there is no judicial reason to resort to a referendum , " danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen said tuesday . in order to avoid a british referendum , london was granted key policy opt-outs , thereby securing its cherished " red lines " on foreign policy , labor rights , the common law and the tax and social security systems . only ireland is constitutionally bound to put the issue to a vote , something which prime minister bertie ahern said he would like to see take place next may or june . constitutional similarities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former british prime minister tony blair has been floated as a potential eu foreign policy leader the new reform text will implement many of the changes suggested by the failed constitution , including the creation of a foreign policy chief and more permanent presidency to replace the current six-month rotating presidency system . the treaty also calls for cuts to the size of the european parliament , freezes the number of seats on the eu commission and institutes a double majority voting system that reduces the types of decision single nations can veto . attached to the new treaty is an eu charter of fundamental rights which enshrines the rights of dignity , freedoms , equality , solidarity , citizens ' rights and justice , although britain and poland are opting out of making that binding . at the charter 's signing wednesday at the european parliament , portuguese prime minister jose socrates signed the document amid noisy protests from right and left-wing parliamentarians calling for national referenda on the reform treaty . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he warned of the high price of inaction against climate change as delegates faced hurdles in outlining a plan by the end of the week . representatives from some 190 countries on the indonesian island of bali aim by the close of the un climate conference on friday , dec .
14 , to lay the foundation for a successor to the kyoto protocol , which expires in 2012 .

" we must ensure an incentive structure for countries , businesses and individuals , " said the un chief .
" there is no trade-off between fighting climate change and pursuing development .

opponents said the law , which would have lowered the age limit for prosecuting sex offenses , went overboard . the german government was considering a plan to lower the age at which a person can be charged for perceived sexual crimes from 18 to 14 years of age , but the bill was halted on wednesday , dec .
12 , a day before it was expected to be approved by parliament . a decision on the draft , which was intended to protect youths from sexual exploitation and pornographic representation , has been postponed until early next year , a spokesman from the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- told the dpa news agency . " the valid warnings from the opposition and assessors have apparently had an effect , " said jörg van essen , parliamentary leader of the free democratic party . critics warned that the proposal would lead to a criminalization of normal sexual activity among teens and could disturb their natural sexual development . examples of punishable situations caused concern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i want to assure you there is no obligation to have sex " while the proposal spoke of punishment for minors who engage in sexual activity with an under-16-year-old that is " exploitative " or results in " reimbursement " in some form , heavy critique came when specific scenarios were brought up . for example , if a 17-year-old invites a person of the opposite sex who is 16 or younger to the movies with the perceived intention of " making out " at some point during the evening , then the 17-year-old could be in deep trouble . this situation could be construed as the older person initiating a financial exchange by picking up the tab while planning a sexual encounter with a minor as a consequence , even if there is no sexual contact between the couple . however , justice minister brigitte zypries rebutted criticism from the opposition , saying that the sidelined bill would not criminalize consensual sexual contact between teens . " no young person has to fear being punished when he invites a date to the movie theater and petting occurs , " said zypries . those opposing the bill have said there is no clarification in the actual text to clearly draw the line between what would and would not be punishable by law . pornography regulations central to proposal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : that 's far enough the new law also foresaw an expansion of the definition of child pornography to include text and images that portrayed sexual actions between teenagers .
this could even include photos of teenage girls in bikinis if the pose they strike is deemed " provocative " or the covered genital area is " prominent . " the criticism from sexologists and other experts was echoed by a number of german politicians .
jerzy montag of the opposition green party told germany 's der spiegel magazine that the law would send the " wrong signal " and that " changing the law to make it possible for the victim to be older than the culprit ignores the structure of power and experience . " germany 's current laws differentiate between child and youth pornography . a law born from eu and us justice systems germany finds itself , like all eu member states , under pressure from the european union , which requires new legislative action in the area of sexual criminal law in line with the united nations ' convention for children 's rights . but the proposed law appeared to go further than even the eu had demanded by making youths as young as 14 punishable as adults and by simultaneously raising the protected age from 16 to 18 . the eu law is primarily intended to protect minors from being forced into prostitution by illegalizing paid sex with a 16- or 17-year-old .
prostitution is currently legal in germany at 16 years or older . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shopping for fruit in view of witnesses would be allowed european experts had called the german proposal the action of a government " hostile to sex and hostile to teenagers , " while the german society for sexual research called the plan " sexual colonization , " referring to the roots of the law in the us legal system . in the united states , teenagers have already been punished under similar laws .
a 15-year-old girl who sent naked pictures of herself to a friend over the internet was recently charged with the spreading and ownership of child pornography .
this would also become an issue in under the german proposal . at the moment , the ownership and spreading of sexual material involving youngsters is only prohibited when the material involves " sodomy or sadistic pornography . "
the spd spokesman said that the question of whether it should be legal for third parties to possess sexual pictures of youths , if the youths willingly produced them , would need to be clarified before the draft could be resubmitted . dw staff -lrb- nda , kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he warned of the high price of inaction against climate change as delegates faced hurdles in outlining a plan by the end of the week . representatives from some 190 countries on the indonesian island of bali aim by the close of the un climate conference on friday , dec .
14 , to lay the foundation for a successor to the kyoto protocol , which expires in 2012 .

" the details of the " road map " to be set at the conference would be hammered out over the next two years , giving ratifying nations time to ink the deal before kyoto expires . " we must ensure an incentive structure for countries , businesses and individuals , " said the un chief .
" there is no trade-off between fighting climate change and pursuing development .
in the long run , we can prosper only by doing both . " he added that , by being creative , it would be possible to reduce harmful greenhouse-gas emissions while promoting economic growth at the same time : " in this sense , climate change is a much an opportunity as it is a threat .

she will attend the document 's signing .
but amid calls for a referendum , another eu leader 's absence will be conspicuous . set to be signed by the leaders of the bloc 's 27 member states on thursday , dec .
13 , merkel said on wednesday that the eu 's reform treaty would bring about " breakthrough for europe . " " i really am not inclined to exaggerated euphoria - but i think we can declare that this day marks a historic success , a success for europe , " she said in an address to the bundestag , germany 's lower house of parliament .
" it will perhaps be seen later as a decisive milestone for a greater ability to act in europe . " she added that the agreement , to be called the lisbon treaty , " lays the groundwork for a new european union in the 21st century . " merkel said she hoped the treaty would be ratified by may 2008 .
european politicians are pushing for the text , which requires unanimous approval before going into effect , to be in place before european parliament elections in 2009 . referendum riddles bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pair of constitutional no votes threw the eu into year-long period of near inaction british prime minister gordon brown will be a notable absentee at the signing ceremony in lisbon .
he 's said that a scheduling conflict will keep him from attending the morning ceremony , but he added he would sign the document later in the day .
the nonattendance has led to domestic accusations of a " semi-detached " attitude to europe . the reform treaty is the successor to the union 's proposed constitution , which was rejected by voters in france and the netherlands in 2005 .
many governments , including the french and dutch , have said there will be no need for national referendums to ratify the reform treaty . the treaty " does not transfer sovereignty to the eu ... and there is no judicial reason to resort to a referendum , " danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen said tuesday . in order to avoid a british referendum , london was granted key policy opt-outs , thereby securing its cherished " red lines " on foreign policy , labor rights , the common law and the tax and social security systems . only ireland is constitutionally bound to put the issue to a vote , something which prime minister bertie ahern said he would like to see take place next may or june . constitutional similarities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former british prime minister tony blair has been floated as a potential eu foreign policy leader the new reform text will implement many of the changes suggested by the failed constitution , including the creation of a foreign policy chief and more permanent presidency to replace the current six-month rotating presidency system . the treaty also calls for cuts to the size of the european parliament , freezes the number of seats on the eu commission and institutes a double majority voting system that reduces the types of decision single nations can veto . attached to the new treaty is an eu charter of fundamental rights which enshrines the rights of dignity , freedoms , equality , solidarity , citizens ' rights and justice , although britain and poland are opting out of making that binding . at the charter 's signing wednesday at the european parliament , portuguese prime minister jose socrates signed the document amid noisy protests from right and left-wing parliamentarians calling for national referenda on the reform treaty . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de children and families -pipe- 12.12.2007 germany 's egg donation prohibition is outdated , experts say großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when fertilization does n't happen naturally , german couples face tough hurdles the recent birth of a baby by a 64-year-old woman in germany has sparked debate about the embryo protection law , which prohibits egg donation .
but with rising infertility rates , germany may need to rethink its policies . the 64-year-old german woman who recently gave birth to a healthy baby girl made headlines around the world .
but her age did not set a precedent .
last year , a 67-year-old spanish woman became the world 's oldest mother when she gave birth to twins , topping the record from the previous year of a 66-year-old romanian who also had twins . the unnamed german became pregnant with the help of in-vitro fertilization -lrb- ivf -rrb- , using an egg donated by a 25-year-old and the sperm of the german woman 's husband .
the treatment was conducted abroad , as donating eggs cells for pregnancies is illegal in germany . the prohibition of egg cell donation is part of germany 's " embryo protection law , " which was passed in 1990 .
sperm donation , however , is permitted . mothers more important than fathers ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fertility rates after 35 drop dramatically the reasoning behind the ban on egg donation was that both the genetic mother and the woman bearing the baby were presumed to be responsible for the child 's existence , said ulrich hilland of the berlin-based federal association of german centers for reproductive medicine . " the law could be interpreted in such a way that it is assumed that mothers have a stronger emotional connection to their children , due to pregnancy , than fathers , " hilland said . the law aimed to prevent the separation between the genetic and the " social " mother - the woman who would later raise the child .
surrogacy is therefore also prohibited in germany . quality risks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : several implanted embryos can result in twins or triplets christina de wit of the german national ethics council , in berlin , pointed to another reason for banning the donation of egg cells . " harvesting eggs from a donor is an invasive operation requiring extensive hormonal stimulation beforehand , so that many eggs mature , " she said .
" that means that the whole process involves medical risks ; that 's not the case with sperm donors . " some german politicians say the recent case demonstrates that egg donation prohibition in germany should be lifted .
others point out that the prohibition prompts " reproduction tourism " by forcing women to go abroad to fulfill their wish for children . " we see risks in quality-control here , " hilland said .
" women who go abroad can not be assured that the testing and therefore the selection process among egg donor candidates have been sufficient . " outdated law ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immobile sperm is often the cause of male infertility the current german law is one of the most restrictive in the world .
it stipulates that only as many embryos may be cultivated as may actually be implanted -lrb- up to three per ivf cycle -rrb- . embryos may also not be examined to determine sex before implantation , nor is pre-implantation genetic diagnosis -lrb- pgd -rrb- , otherwise known as " embryo screening , " allowed - the latter ban a likely result of germany trying to come to terms with its nazi past . furthermore , the freezing -lrb- cryopreservation -rrb- of embryos for later implantation is restricted .
only eggs in the very early stages of fertilization - the pre-nucleus stage - may be frozen in certain cases . the embryo protection law itself was smart , because it defined the legal parameters of in-vitro fertilization and aimed to prevent the manipulation of human life very early , hilland said . de wit agreed . " the law was originally intended to protect life at its initial stages , but unfortunately , it is rather outdated , " she said .
" a nearly 20-year-old law no longer corresponds with the huge advancements made in science and reproductive medicine . " financial problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sperm and egg are united outside of the body in ivf however , it 's not just the embryo protection law that is restrictive . " even if the law were changed to allow egg donation , only a fraction of women would take advantage of it , " de wit said . an issue affecting many more women and couples wanting children is the drastic cutback in insurance companies paying for assisted reproduction technology -lrb- art -rrb- treatments . formerly , germany 's public insurance companies - or compulsory health insurance funds - covered the entire costs of up to four ivf and isci treatments and six intrauterine inseminations -lrb- iui -rrb- .
in the wake of sweeping reforms , however , as of 2004 the funds only pay 50 percent of up to three ivf , icsi or iui cycles , and only for married couples when the woman is 40 or younger .
other age restrictions also apply .
-lrb- icsi , or " intracytoplasmic sperm injection , " is a method involving the injection of sperm into an egg via an ultra-fine needle . -rrb- unmarried couples must cover all costs themselves .
and they are heady . a married couple 's average share per cycle currently runs around 1,300 euros -lrb- $ 1,900 -rrb- .
thus , less affluent couples have been essentially barred from trying to get pregnant through art . looking ahead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : assisted reproduction is often ridden with physical and psychological stress " we have a birth rate of 1.3 children per woman in germany , " hilland said .
" children are desperately needed in this country , so any measure to improve the birth rate would be desirable . " german doctors say they now perform around 40 percent fewer art treatments than before the reform , even though the success rate by ivf is around 25-35 percent for each try , meaning that several treatment cycles would likely see a couple 's wish for children fulfilled . the reforms were supposed to save the public health insurance funds up to 100 million euros yearly through sharing art costs with couples .
but according to hilland , some 10,000 fewer " art " children have been born each year since the reforms . considering that one in seven couples suffer from infertility and that germany 's population is aging dramatically , that number is nothing to sneeze at . louisa schaefer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but with rising infertility rates , germany may need to rethink its policies . the 64-year-old german woman who recently gave birth to a healthy baby girl made headlines around the world .
but her age did not set a precedent .
last year , a 67-year-old spanish woman became the world 's oldest mother when she gave birth to twins , topping the record from the previous year of a 66-year-old romanian who also had twins . the unnamed german became pregnant with the help of in-vitro fertilization -lrb- ivf -rrb- , using an egg donated by a 25-year-old and the sperm of the german woman 's husband .
the treatment was conducted abroad , as donating eggs cells for pregnancies is illegal in germany . the prohibition of egg cell donation is part of germany 's " embryo protection law , " which was passed in 1990 .
sperm donation , however , is permitted . mothers more important than fathers ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fertility rates after 35 drop dramatically the reasoning behind the ban on egg donation was that both the genetic mother and the woman bearing the baby were presumed to be responsible for the child 's existence , said ulrich hilland of the berlin-based federal association of german centers for reproductive medicine . " the law could be interpreted in such a way that it is assumed that mothers have a stronger emotional connection to their children , due to pregnancy , than fathers , " hilland said . the law aimed to prevent the separation between the genetic and the " social " mother - the woman who would later raise the child .
surrogacy is therefore also prohibited in germany . quality risks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : several implanted embryos can result in twins or triplets christina de wit of the german national ethics council , in berlin , pointed to another reason for banning the donation of egg cells . " harvesting eggs from a donor is an invasive operation requiring extensive hormonal stimulation beforehand , so that many eggs mature , " she said .
" that means that the whole process involves medical risks ; that 's not the case with sperm donors . " some german politicians say the recent case demonstrates that egg donation prohibition in germany should be lifted .
others point out that the prohibition prompts " reproduction tourism " by forcing women to go abroad to fulfill their wish for children . " we see risks in quality-control here , " hilland said .
" women who go abroad can not be assured that the testing and therefore the selection process among egg donor candidates have been sufficient . " outdated law ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immobile sperm is often the cause of male infertility the current german law is one of the most restrictive in the world .
it stipulates that only as many embryos may be cultivated as may actually be implanted -lrb- up to three per ivf cycle -rrb- . embryos may also not be examined to determine sex before implantation , nor is pre-implantation genetic diagnosis -lrb- pgd -rrb- , otherwise known as " embryo screening , " allowed - the latter ban a likely result of germany trying to come to terms with its nazi past . furthermore , the freezing -lrb- cryopreservation -rrb- of embryos for later implantation is restricted .
only eggs in the very early stages of fertilization - the pre-nucleus stage - may be frozen in certain cases . the embryo protection law itself was smart , because it defined the legal parameters of in-vitro fertilization and aimed to prevent the manipulation of human life very early , hilland said . de wit agreed . " the law was originally intended to protect life at its initial stages , but unfortunately , it is rather outdated , " she said .
" a nearly 20-year-old law no longer corresponds with the huge advancements made in science and reproductive medicine . " financial problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sperm and egg are united outside of the body in ivf however , it 's not just the embryo protection law that is restrictive . " even if the law were changed to allow egg donation , only a fraction of women would take advantage of it , " de wit said . an issue affecting many more women and couples wanting children is the drastic cutback in insurance companies paying for assisted reproduction technology -lrb- art -rrb- treatments . formerly , germany 's public insurance companies - or compulsory health insurance funds - covered the entire costs of up to four ivf and isci treatments and six intrauterine inseminations -lrb- iui -rrb- .
in the wake of sweeping reforms , however , as of 2004 the funds only pay 50 percent of up to three ivf , icsi or iui cycles , and only for married couples when the woman is 40 or younger .
other age restrictions also apply .
-lrb- icsi , or " intracytoplasmic sperm injection , " is a method involving the injection of sperm into an egg via an ultra-fine needle . -rrb- unmarried couples must cover all costs themselves .
and they are heady . a married couple 's average share per cycle currently runs around 1,300 euros -lrb- $ 1,900 -rrb- .
thus , less affluent couples have been essentially barred from trying to get pregnant through art . looking ahead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : assisted reproduction is often ridden with physical and psychological stress " we have a birth rate of 1.3 children per woman in germany , " hilland said .
" children are desperately needed in this country , so any measure to improve the birth rate would be desirable . " german doctors say they now perform around 40 percent fewer art treatments than before the reform , even though the success rate by ivf is around 25-35 percent for each try , meaning that several treatment cycles would likely see a couple 's wish for children fulfilled . the reforms were supposed to save the public health insurance funds up to 100 million euros yearly through sharing art costs with couples .
but according to hilland , some 10,000 fewer " art " children have been born each year since the reforms . considering that one in seven couples suffer from infertility and that germany 's population is aging dramatically , that number is nothing to sneeze at . louisa schaefer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : tackling youth crime squeezed in state poll , german politician pulls out old tricks conservative cdu turns youth crime debate into election issue german conservatives want crackdown on youth crime politicians call for tougher laws against young offenders society -pipe- 12.12.2007 german plan to criminalize teen sex put on back burner großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government wants to rethink stiffening teen sex laws after facing fierce criticism , a proposal in germany to criminalize teenage sexual activity was deferred .
opponents said the law , which would have lowered the age limit for prosecuting sex offenses , went overboard . the german government was considering a plan to lower the age at which a person can be charged for perceived sexual crimes from 18 to 14 years of age , but the bill was halted on wednesday , dec .
12 , a day before it was expected to be approved by parliament . a decision on the draft , which was intended to protect youths from sexual exploitation and pornographic representation , has been postponed until early next year , a spokesman from the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- told the dpa news agency . " the valid warnings from the opposition and assessors have apparently had an effect , " said jörg van essen , parliamentary leader of the free democratic party . critics warned that the proposal would lead to a criminalization of normal sexual activity among teens and could disturb their natural sexual development . examples of punishable situations caused concern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i want to assure you there is no obligation to have sex " while the proposal spoke of punishment for minors who engage in sexual activity with an under-16-year-old that is " exploitative " or results in " reimbursement " in some form , heavy critique came when specific scenarios were brought up . for example , if a 17-year-old invites a person of the opposite sex who is 16 or younger to the movies with the perceived intention of " making out " at some point during the evening , then the 17-year-old could be in deep trouble . this situation could be construed as the older person initiating a financial exchange by picking up the tab while planning a sexual encounter with a minor as a consequence , even if there is no sexual contact between the couple . however , justice minister brigitte zypries rebutted criticism from the opposition , saying that the sidelined bill would not criminalize consensual sexual contact between teens . " no young person has to fear being punished when he invites a date to the movie theater and petting occurs , " said zypries . those opposing the bill have said there is no clarification in the actual text to clearly draw the line between what would and would not be punishable by law . pornography regulations central to proposal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : that 's far enough the new law also foresaw an expansion of the definition of child pornography to include text and images that portrayed sexual actions between teenagers .
this could even include photos of teenage girls in bikinis if the pose they strike is deemed " provocative " or the covered genital area is " prominent . " the criticism from sexologists and other experts was echoed by a number of german politicians .
jerzy montag of the opposition green party told germany 's der spiegel magazine that the law would send the " wrong signal " and that " changing the law to make it possible for the victim to be older than the culprit ignores the structure of power and experience . " germany 's current laws differentiate between child and youth pornography . a law born from eu and us justice systems germany finds itself , like all eu member states , under pressure from the european union , which requires new legislative action in the area of sexual criminal law in line with the united nations ' convention for children 's rights . but the proposed law appeared to go further than even the eu had demanded by making youths as young as 14 punishable as adults and by simultaneously raising the protected age from 16 to 18 . the eu law is primarily intended to protect minors from being forced into prostitution by illegalizing paid sex with a 16- or 17-year-old .
prostitution is currently legal in germany at 16 years or older . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shopping for fruit in view of witnesses would be allowed european experts had called the german proposal the action of a government " hostile to sex and hostile to teenagers , " while the german society for sexual research called the plan " sexual colonization , " referring to the roots of the law in the us legal system . in the united states , teenagers have already been punished under similar laws .
a 15-year-old girl who sent naked pictures of herself to a friend over the internet was recently charged with the spreading and ownership of child pornography .
this would also become an issue in under the german proposal . at the moment , the ownership and spreading of sexual material involving youngsters is only prohibited when the material involves " sodomy or sadistic pornography . "

but with rising infertility rates , germany may need to rethink its policies . the 64-year-old german woman who recently gave birth to a healthy baby girl made headlines around the world .
but her age did not set a precedent .
last year , a 67-year-old spanish woman became the world 's oldest mother when she gave birth to twins , topping the record from the previous year of a 66-year-old romanian who also had twins . the unnamed german became pregnant with the help of in-vitro fertilization -lrb- ivf -rrb- , using an egg donated by a 25-year-old and the sperm of the german woman 's husband .
the treatment was conducted abroad , as donating eggs cells for pregnancies is illegal in germany . the prohibition of egg cell donation is part of germany 's " embryo protection law , " which was passed in 1990 .
sperm donation , however , is permitted . mothers more important than fathers ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fertility rates after 35 drop dramatically the reasoning behind the ban on egg donation was that both the genetic mother and the woman bearing the baby were presumed to be responsible for the child 's existence , said ulrich hilland of the berlin-based federal association of german centers for reproductive medicine . " the law could be interpreted in such a way that it is assumed that mothers have a stronger emotional connection to their children , due to pregnancy , than fathers , " hilland said . the law aimed to prevent the separation between the genetic and the " social " mother - the woman who would later raise the child .
surrogacy is therefore also prohibited in germany . quality risks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : several implanted embryos can result in twins or triplets christina de wit of the german national ethics council , in berlin , pointed to another reason for banning the donation of egg cells . " harvesting eggs from a donor is an invasive operation requiring extensive hormonal stimulation beforehand , so that many eggs mature , " she said .
" that means that the whole process involves medical risks ; that 's not the case with sperm donors . " some german politicians say the recent case demonstrates that egg donation prohibition in germany should be lifted .
others point out that the prohibition prompts " reproduction tourism " by forcing women to go abroad to fulfill their wish for children . " we see risks in quality-control here , " hilland said .
" women who go abroad can not be assured that the testing and therefore the selection process among egg donor candidates have been sufficient . " outdated law ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immobile sperm is often the cause of male infertility the current german law is one of the most restrictive in the world .
it stipulates that only as many embryos may be cultivated as may actually be implanted -lrb- up to three per ivf cycle -rrb- . embryos may also not be examined to determine sex before implantation , nor is pre-implantation genetic diagnosis -lrb- pgd -rrb- , otherwise known as " embryo screening , " allowed - the latter ban a likely result of germany trying to come to terms with its nazi past . furthermore , the freezing -lrb- cryopreservation -rrb- of embryos for later implantation is restricted .
only eggs in the very early stages of fertilization - the pre-nucleus stage - may be frozen in certain cases . the embryo protection law itself was smart , because it defined the legal parameters of in-vitro fertilization and aimed to prevent the manipulation of human life very early , hilland said . de wit agreed . " the law was originally intended to protect life at its initial stages , but unfortunately , it is rather outdated , " she said .
" a nearly 20-year-old law no longer corresponds with the huge advancements made in science and reproductive medicine . " financial problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sperm and egg are united outside of the body in ivf however , it 's not just the embryo protection law that is restrictive . " even if the law were changed to allow egg donation , only a fraction of women would take advantage of it , " de wit said . an issue affecting many more women and couples wanting children is the drastic cutback in insurance companies paying for assisted reproduction technology -lrb- art -rrb- treatments . formerly , germany 's public insurance companies - or compulsory health insurance funds - covered the entire costs of up to four ivf and isci treatments and six intrauterine inseminations -lrb- iui -rrb- .
in the wake of sweeping reforms , however , as of 2004 the funds only pay 50 percent of up to three ivf , icsi or iui cycles , and only for married couples when the woman is 40 or younger .
other age restrictions also apply .
-lrb- icsi , or " intracytoplasmic sperm injection , " is a method involving the injection of sperm into an egg via an ultra-fine needle . -rrb- unmarried couples must cover all costs themselves .
and they are heady . a married couple 's average share per cycle currently runs around 1,300 euros -lrb- $ 1,900 -rrb- .
thus , less affluent couples have been essentially barred from trying to get pregnant through art . looking ahead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : assisted reproduction is often ridden with physical and psychological stress " we have a birth rate of 1.3 children per woman in germany , " hilland said .
" children are desperately needed in this country , so any measure to improve the birth rate would be desirable . " german doctors say they now perform around 40 percent fewer art treatments than before the reform , even though the success rate by ivf is around 25-35 percent for each try , meaning that several treatment cycles would likely see a couple 's wish for children fulfilled . the reforms were supposed to save the public health insurance funds up to 100 million euros yearly through sharing art costs with couples .
but according to hilland , some 10,000 fewer " art " children have been born each year since the reforms . considering that one in seven couples suffer from infertility and that germany 's population is aging dramatically , that number is nothing to sneeze at . louisa schaefer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

russia says nato left it with no choice but to abandon the agreement . officials in moscow said on wednesday , dec .
12 , that there are no plans to build up their military forces after they suspended participation in the conventional forces in europe treaty but added the move was necessary to protect russia 's national security . " such a step has been caused by the exceptional circumstances connected to the content of the treaty , which concern the security of russia and demand that we take immediate measures , " the russian foreign ministry said in a statement . the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- appealed for moscow to reconsider its decision , calling the treaty a " cornerstone for european security for 15 years . " " the suspension that takes effect today is not good news , " spanish foreign minister miguel angel moratinos , the group 's chairman-in-office , said in a statement .
" the loss of the cfe system of limitations , information and verification would be detrimental to all and could have security implications for all of europe . " military free to move bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the treaty limits troops numbers between the atlantic and the urals suspension means russia can move troops around the country without notifying nato , allowing russia to lift the " limitations placed on arms deployments , " the russian foreign ministry statement said . signed in 1990 and modified after the fall of the iron curtain in 1999 , the treaty places exact caps on the numbers of troops and heavy weapons stationed west of the ural mountains .
the cfe deal was seen as an important step in resolving the cold war . russian president vladimir putin signed a decree ordering moscow 's suspension of the treaty last month .
the decree met with wide acceptance in the russian parliament . " we wo n't observe any obligations unilaterally , " putin said in a speech last month .
" our partners did not ratify the treaty and some did not even sign it . " tit-for-tat decisions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato expanded to russia 's borders in 2004 at the heart of russia 's complaints on the cfe is nato 's failure to ratify the amended 1999 version of the treaty , which takes into account the huge changes wrought by the 1991 collapse of the soviet union .
nato 's expansion after the fall of the soviet union would potentially allow for the alliance 's troops within striking distance of st. petersburg . " the hypothetical transfer of nato forces into the baltics is a real military threat , " alexei arbatov , an arms control expert at the carnegie moscow center independent think-tank told reuters news agency . nato countries say they can not ratify the 1999 version because russian troop presence in ex-soviet georgia and moldova violates the treaty , a charge moscow rejects .
the kremlin has said soldiers stationed in the two countries represent a peacekeeping force . in a statement , nato expressed " deep regret " that russia had suspended the arms pact .
but it underlined that the military alliance would not take any retaliatory action .
the demise of the cfe comes on top of moscow 's threat to leave the intermediate range nuclear forces treaty , as well as tensions around us plans to install a missile-defense shield in nato members poland and the czech republic . reply to us missile shield bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia is opposed to the us plans for missile defense bases in the czech republic and poland while the russian foreign ministry statement wednesday made clear the military did not intend to make any major moves , deputy foreign minister alexander grushko last week gave a mixed message about possible changes in troop levels . " russia has no plans to raise its military presence in europe , obviously , that is , if there is not an attempt to raise the military presence by nato countries , " he told reporters . washington has said its missile shield initiative is designed to guard against attacks from " rogue states , " but moscow views it as an attempt by the us to expand its military influence into russia 's backyard . though russia could theoretically return to the treaty at anytime , observers said international disagreement between russia and the west makes such a move unlikely . " the treaty is dead , " military analyst pavel felgenhauer told the afp news agency .
" it makes a lot of economic sense to move forces from siberia to leningrad district , because it 's two or three times more expensive to keep them in siberia .
it will also send a powerful signal to the west .

she will attend the document 's signing .
but amid calls for a referendum , another eu leader 's absence will be conspicuous . set to be signed by the leaders of the bloc 's 27 member states on thursday , dec .
13 , merkel said on wednesday that the eu 's reform treaty would bring about " breakthrough for europe . " " i really am not inclined to exaggerated euphoria - but i think we can declare that this day marks a historic success , a success for europe , " she said in an address to the bundestag , germany 's lower house of parliament .
" it will perhaps be seen later as a decisive milestone for a greater ability to act in europe . " she added that the agreement , to be called the lisbon treaty , " lays the groundwork for a new european union in the 21st century . " merkel said she hoped the treaty would be ratified by may 2008 .
european politicians are pushing for the text , which requires unanimous approval before going into effect , to be in place before european parliament elections in 2009 . referendum riddles bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pair of constitutional no votes threw the eu into year-long period of near inaction british prime minister gordon brown will be a notable absentee at the signing ceremony in lisbon .
he 's said that a scheduling conflict will keep him from attending the morning ceremony , but he added he would sign the document later in the day .
the nonattendance has led to domestic accusations of a " semi-detached " attitude to europe . the reform treaty is the successor to the union 's proposed constitution , which was rejected by voters in france and the netherlands in 2005 .
many governments , including the french and dutch , have said there will be no need for national referendums to ratify the reform treaty . the treaty " does not transfer sovereignty to the eu ... and there is no judicial reason to resort to a referendum , " danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen said tuesday . in order to avoid a british referendum , london was granted key policy opt-outs , thereby securing its cherished " red lines " on foreign policy , labor rights , the common law and the tax and social security systems . only ireland is constitutionally bound to put the issue to a vote , something which prime minister bertie ahern said he would like to see take place next may or june . constitutional similarities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former british prime minister tony blair has been floated as a potential eu foreign policy leader the new reform text will implement many of the changes suggested by the failed constitution , including the creation of a foreign policy chief and more permanent presidency to replace the current six-month rotating presidency system . the treaty also calls for cuts to the size of the european parliament , freezes the number of seats on the eu commission and institutes a double majority voting system that reduces the types of decision single nations can veto . attached to the new treaty is an eu charter of fundamental rights which enshrines the rights of dignity , freedoms , equality , solidarity , citizens ' rights and justice , although britain and poland are opting out of making that binding . at the charter 's signing wednesday at the european parliament , portuguese prime minister jose socrates signed the document amid noisy protests from right and left-wing parliamentarians calling for national referenda on the reform treaty . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

opponents said the law , which would have lowered the age limit for prosecuting sex offenses , went overboard . the german government was considering a plan to lower the age at which a person can be charged for perceived sexual crimes from 18 to 14 years of age , but the bill was halted on wednesday , dec .
12 , a day before it was expected to be approved by parliament . a decision on the draft , which was intended to protect youths from sexual exploitation and pornographic representation , has been postponed until early next year , a spokesman from the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- told the dpa news agency . " the valid warnings from the opposition and assessors have apparently had an effect , " said jörg van essen , parliamentary leader of the free democratic party . critics warned that the proposal would lead to a criminalization of normal sexual activity among teens and could disturb their natural sexual development . examples of punishable situations caused concern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i want to assure you there is no obligation to have sex " while the proposal spoke of punishment for minors who engage in sexual activity with an under-16-year-old that is " exploitative " or results in " reimbursement " in some form , heavy critique came when specific scenarios were brought up . for example , if a 17-year-old invites a person of the opposite sex who is 16 or younger to the movies with the perceived intention of " making out " at some point during the evening , then the 17-year-old could be in deep trouble . this situation could be construed as the older person initiating a financial exchange by picking up the tab while planning a sexual encounter with a minor as a consequence , even if there is no sexual contact between the couple . however , justice minister brigitte zypries rebutted criticism from the opposition , saying that the sidelined bill would not criminalize consensual sexual contact between teens . " no young person has to fear being punished when he invites a date to the movie theater and petting occurs , " said zypries . those opposing the bill have said there is no clarification in the actual text to clearly draw the line between what would and would not be punishable by law . pornography regulations central to proposal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : that 's far enough the new law also foresaw an expansion of the definition of child pornography to include text and images that portrayed sexual actions between teenagers .
this could even include photos of teenage girls in bikinis if the pose they strike is deemed " provocative " or the covered genital area is " prominent . " the criticism from sexologists and other experts was echoed by a number of german politicians .
jerzy montag of the opposition green party told germany 's der spiegel magazine that the law would send the " wrong signal " and that " changing the law to make it possible for the victim to be older than the culprit ignores the structure of power and experience . " germany 's current laws differentiate between child and youth pornography . a law born from eu and us justice systems germany finds itself , like all eu member states , under pressure from the european union , which requires new legislative action in the area of sexual criminal law in line with the united nations ' convention for children 's rights . but the proposed law appeared to go further than even the eu had demanded by making youths as young as 14 punishable as adults and by simultaneously raising the protected age from 16 to 18 . the eu law is primarily intended to protect minors from being forced into prostitution by illegalizing paid sex with a 16- or 17-year-old .
prostitution is currently legal in germany at 16 years or older . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shopping for fruit in view of witnesses would be allowed european experts had called the german proposal the action of a government " hostile to sex and hostile to teenagers , " while the german society for sexual research called the plan " sexual colonization , " referring to the roots of the law in the us legal system . in the united states , teenagers have already been punished under similar laws .
a 15-year-old girl who sent naked pictures of herself to a friend over the internet was recently charged with the spreading and ownership of child pornography .
this would also become an issue in under the german proposal . at the moment , the ownership and spreading of sexual material involving youngsters is only prohibited when the material involves " sodomy or sadistic pornography . "

she will attend the document 's signing .
but amid calls for a referendum , another eu leader 's absence will be conspicuous . set to be signed by the leaders of the bloc 's 27 member states on thursday , dec .
13 , merkel said on wednesday that the eu 's reform treaty would bring about " breakthrough for europe . " " i really am not inclined to exaggerated euphoria - but i think we can declare that this day marks a historic success , a success for europe , " she said in an address to the bundestag , germany 's lower house of parliament .
" it will perhaps be seen later as a decisive milestone for a greater ability to act in europe . " she added that the agreement , to be called the lisbon treaty , " lays the groundwork for a new european union in the 21st century . " merkel said she hoped the treaty would be ratified by may 2008 .
european politicians are pushing for the text , which requires unanimous approval before going into effect , to be in place before european parliament elections in 2009 . referendum riddles bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pair of constitutional no votes threw the eu into year-long period of near inaction british prime minister gordon brown will be a notable absentee at the signing ceremony in lisbon .
he 's said that a scheduling conflict will keep him from attending the morning ceremony , but he added he would sign the document later in the day .
the nonattendance has led to domestic accusations of a " semi-detached " attitude to europe . the reform treaty is the successor to the union 's proposed constitution , which was rejected by voters in france and the netherlands in 2005 .
many governments , including the french and dutch , have said there will be no need for national referendums to ratify the reform treaty . the treaty " does not transfer sovereignty to the eu ... and there is no judicial reason to resort to a referendum , " danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen said tuesday . in order to avoid a british referendum , london was granted key policy opt-outs , thereby securing its cherished " red lines " on foreign policy , labor rights , the common law and the tax and social security systems . only ireland is constitutionally bound to put the issue to a vote , something which prime minister bertie ahern said he would like to see take place next may or june . constitutional similarities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former british prime minister tony blair has been floated as a potential eu foreign policy leader the new reform text will implement many of the changes suggested by the failed constitution , including the creation of a foreign policy chief and more permanent presidency to replace the current six-month rotating presidency system . the treaty also calls for cuts to the size of the european parliament , freezes the number of seats on the eu commission and institutes a double majority voting system that reduces the types of decision single nations can veto . attached to the new treaty is an eu charter of fundamental rights which enshrines the rights of dignity , freedoms , equality , solidarity , citizens ' rights and justice , although britain and poland are opting out of making that binding . at the charter 's signing wednesday at the european parliament , portuguese prime minister jose socrates signed the document amid noisy protests from right and left-wing parliamentarians calling for national referenda on the reform treaty . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 12.12.2007 moscow suspends cold war weapons treaty großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moscow can now legally move troops and weapons without notifying nato moscow officially ended its adherence to a key cold war treaty that sets limits on the number of soldiers and weapons stationed in europe .
russia says nato left it with no choice but to abandon the agreement . officials in moscow said on wednesday , dec .
12 , that there are no plans to build up their military forces after they suspended participation in the conventional forces in europe treaty but added the move was necessary to protect russia 's national security . " such a step has been caused by the exceptional circumstances connected to the content of the treaty , which concern the security of russia and demand that we take immediate measures , " the russian foreign ministry said in a statement . the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- appealed for moscow to reconsider its decision , calling the treaty a " cornerstone for european security for 15 years . " " the suspension that takes effect today is not good news , " spanish foreign minister miguel angel moratinos , the group 's chairman-in-office , said in a statement .
" the loss of the cfe system of limitations , information and verification would be detrimental to all and could have security implications for all of europe . " military free to move bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the treaty limits troops numbers between the atlantic and the urals suspension means russia can move troops around the country without notifying nato , allowing russia to lift the " limitations placed on arms deployments , " the russian foreign ministry statement said . signed in 1990 and modified after the fall of the iron curtain in 1999 , the treaty places exact caps on the numbers of troops and heavy weapons stationed west of the ural mountains .
the cfe deal was seen as an important step in resolving the cold war . russian president vladimir putin signed a decree ordering moscow 's suspension of the treaty last month .
the decree met with wide acceptance in the russian parliament . " we wo n't observe any obligations unilaterally , " putin said in a speech last month .
" our partners did not ratify the treaty and some did not even sign it . " tit-for-tat decisions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato expanded to russia 's borders in 2004 at the heart of russia 's complaints on the cfe is nato 's failure to ratify the amended 1999 version of the treaty , which takes into account the huge changes wrought by the 1991 collapse of the soviet union .
nato 's expansion after the fall of the soviet union would potentially allow for the alliance 's troops within striking distance of st. petersburg . " the hypothetical transfer of nato forces into the baltics is a real military threat , " alexei arbatov , an arms control expert at the carnegie moscow center independent think-tank told reuters news agency . nato countries say they can not ratify the 1999 version because russian troop presence in ex-soviet georgia and moldova violates the treaty , a charge moscow rejects .
the kremlin has said soldiers stationed in the two countries represent a peacekeeping force . in a statement , nato expressed " deep regret " that russia had suspended the arms pact .
but it underlined that the military alliance would not take any retaliatory action .
the demise of the cfe comes on top of moscow 's threat to leave the intermediate range nuclear forces treaty , as well as tensions around us plans to install a missile-defense shield in nato members poland and the czech republic . reply to us missile shield bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia is opposed to the us plans for missile defense bases in the czech republic and poland while the russian foreign ministry statement wednesday made clear the military did not intend to make any major moves , deputy foreign minister alexander grushko last week gave a mixed message about possible changes in troop levels . " russia has no plans to raise its military presence in europe , obviously , that is , if there is not an attempt to raise the military presence by nato countries , " he told reporters . washington has said its missile shield initiative is designed to guard against attacks from " rogue states , " but moscow views it as an attempt by the us to expand its military influence into russia 's backyard . though russia could theoretically return to the treaty at anytime , observers said international disagreement between russia and the west makes such a move unlikely . " the treaty is dead , " military analyst pavel felgenhauer told the afp news agency .

she will attend the document 's signing .
but amid calls for a referendum , another eu leader 's absence will be conspicuous . set to be signed by the leaders of the bloc 's 27 member states on thursday , dec .
13 , merkel said on wednesday that the eu 's reform treaty would bring about " breakthrough for europe . " " i really am not inclined to exaggerated euphoria - but i think we can declare that this day marks a historic success , a success for europe , " she said in an address to the bundestag , germany 's lower house of parliament .
" it will perhaps be seen later as a decisive milestone for a greater ability to act in europe . " she added that the agreement , to be called the lisbon treaty , " lays the groundwork for a new european union in the 21st century . " merkel said she hoped the treaty would be ratified by may 2008 .
european politicians are pushing for the text , which requires unanimous approval before going into effect , to be in place before european parliament elections in 2009 . referendum riddles bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pair of constitutional no votes threw the eu into year-long period of near inaction british prime minister gordon brown will be a notable absentee at the signing ceremony in lisbon .
he 's said that a scheduling conflict will keep him from attending the morning ceremony , but he added he would sign the document later in the day .
the nonattendance has led to domestic accusations of a " semi-detached " attitude to europe . the reform treaty is the successor to the union 's proposed constitution , which was rejected by voters in france and the netherlands in 2005 .
many governments , including the french and dutch , have said there will be no need for national referendums to ratify the reform treaty . the treaty " does not transfer sovereignty to the eu ... and there is no judicial reason to resort to a referendum , " danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen said tuesday . in order to avoid a british referendum , london was granted key policy opt-outs , thereby securing its cherished " red lines " on foreign policy , labor rights , the common law and the tax and social security systems . only ireland is constitutionally bound to put the issue to a vote , something which prime minister bertie ahern said he would like to see take place next may or june . constitutional similarities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former british prime minister tony blair has been floated as a potential eu foreign policy leader the new reform text will implement many of the changes suggested by the failed constitution , including the creation of a foreign policy chief and more permanent presidency to replace the current six-month rotating presidency system . the treaty also calls for cuts to the size of the european parliament , freezes the number of seats on the eu commission and institutes a double majority voting system that reduces the types of decision single nations can veto . attached to the new treaty is an eu charter of fundamental rights which enshrines the rights of dignity , freedoms , equality , solidarity , citizens ' rights and justice , although britain and poland are opting out of making that binding . at the charter 's signing wednesday at the european parliament , portuguese prime minister jose socrates signed the document amid noisy protests from right and left-wing parliamentarians calling for national referenda on the reform treaty . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

russia says nato left it with no choice but to abandon the agreement . officials in moscow said on wednesday , dec .
12 , that there are no plans to build up their military forces after they suspended participation in the conventional forces in europe treaty but added the move was necessary to protect russia 's national security . " such a step has been caused by the exceptional circumstances connected to the content of the treaty , which concern the security of russia and demand that we take immediate measures , " the russian foreign ministry said in a statement . the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- appealed for moscow to reconsider its decision , calling the treaty a " cornerstone for european security for 15 years . " " the suspension that takes effect today is not good news , " spanish foreign minister miguel angel moratinos , the group 's chairman-in-office , said in a statement .
" the loss of the cfe system of limitations , information and verification would be detrimental to all and could have security implications for all of europe . " military free to move bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the treaty limits troops numbers between the atlantic and the urals suspension means russia can move troops around the country without notifying nato , allowing russia to lift the " limitations placed on arms deployments , " the russian foreign ministry statement said . signed in 1990 and modified after the fall of the iron curtain in 1999 , the treaty places exact caps on the numbers of troops and heavy weapons stationed west of the ural mountains .
the cfe deal was seen as an important step in resolving the cold war . russian president vladimir putin signed a decree ordering moscow 's suspension of the treaty last month .
the decree met with wide acceptance in the russian parliament . " we wo n't observe any obligations unilaterally , " putin said in a speech last month .
" our partners did not ratify the treaty and some did not even sign it . " tit-for-tat decisions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato expanded to russia 's borders in 2004 at the heart of russia 's complaints on the cfe is nato 's failure to ratify the amended 1999 version of the treaty , which takes into account the huge changes wrought by the 1991 collapse of the soviet union .
nato 's expansion after the fall of the soviet union would potentially allow for the alliance 's troops within striking distance of st. petersburg . " the hypothetical transfer of nato forces into the baltics is a real military threat , " alexei arbatov , an arms control expert at the carnegie moscow center independent think-tank told reuters news agency . nato countries say they can not ratify the 1999 version because russian troop presence in ex-soviet georgia and moldova violates the treaty , a charge moscow rejects .
the kremlin has said soldiers stationed in the two countries represent a peacekeeping force . in a statement , nato expressed " deep regret " that russia had suspended the arms pact .
but it underlined that the military alliance would not take any retaliatory action .
the demise of the cfe comes on top of moscow 's threat to leave the intermediate range nuclear forces treaty , as well as tensions around us plans to install a missile-defense shield in nato members poland and the czech republic . reply to us missile shield bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia is opposed to the us plans for missile defense bases in the czech republic and poland while the russian foreign ministry statement wednesday made clear the military did not intend to make any major moves , deputy foreign minister alexander grushko last week gave a mixed message about possible changes in troop levels .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de children and families -pipe- 12.12.2007 germany 's egg donation prohibition is outdated , experts say großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when fertilization does n't happen naturally , german couples face tough hurdles the recent birth of a baby by a 64-year-old woman in germany has sparked debate about the embryo protection law , which prohibits egg donation .
but with rising infertility rates , germany may need to rethink its policies . the 64-year-old german woman who recently gave birth to a healthy baby girl made headlines around the world .
but her age did not set a precedent .
last year , a 67-year-old spanish woman became the world 's oldest mother when she gave birth to twins , topping the record from the previous year of a 66-year-old romanian who also had twins . the unnamed german became pregnant with the help of in-vitro fertilization -lrb- ivf -rrb- , using an egg donated by a 25-year-old and the sperm of the german woman 's husband .
the treatment was conducted abroad , as donating eggs cells for pregnancies is illegal in germany . the prohibition of egg cell donation is part of germany 's " embryo protection law , " which was passed in 1990 .
sperm donation , however , is permitted . mothers more important than fathers ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fertility rates after 35 drop dramatically the reasoning behind the ban on egg donation was that both the genetic mother and the woman bearing the baby were presumed to be responsible for the child 's existence , said ulrich hilland of the berlin-based federal association of german centers for reproductive medicine . " the law could be interpreted in such a way that it is assumed that mothers have a stronger emotional connection to their children , due to pregnancy , than fathers , " hilland said . the law aimed to prevent the separation between the genetic and the " social " mother - the woman who would later raise the child .
surrogacy is therefore also prohibited in germany . quality risks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : several implanted embryos can result in twins or triplets christina de wit of the german national ethics council , in berlin , pointed to another reason for banning the donation of egg cells . " harvesting eggs from a donor is an invasive operation requiring extensive hormonal stimulation beforehand , so that many eggs mature , " she said .
" that means that the whole process involves medical risks ; that 's not the case with sperm donors . " some german politicians say the recent case demonstrates that egg donation prohibition in germany should be lifted .
others point out that the prohibition prompts " reproduction tourism " by forcing women to go abroad to fulfill their wish for children . " we see risks in quality-control here , " hilland said .
" women who go abroad can not be assured that the testing and therefore the selection process among egg donor candidates have been sufficient . " outdated law ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immobile sperm is often the cause of male infertility the current german law is one of the most restrictive in the world .
it stipulates that only as many embryos may be cultivated as may actually be implanted -lrb- up to three per ivf cycle -rrb- . embryos may also not be examined to determine sex before implantation , nor is pre-implantation genetic diagnosis -lrb- pgd -rrb- , otherwise known as " embryo screening , " allowed - the latter ban a likely result of germany trying to come to terms with its nazi past . furthermore , the freezing -lrb- cryopreservation -rrb- of embryos for later implantation is restricted .
only eggs in the very early stages of fertilization - the pre-nucleus stage - may be frozen in certain cases . the embryo protection law itself was smart , because it defined the legal parameters of in-vitro fertilization and aimed to prevent the manipulation of human life very early , hilland said . de wit agreed . " the law was originally intended to protect life at its initial stages , but unfortunately , it is rather outdated , " she said .
" a nearly 20-year-old law no longer corresponds with the huge advancements made in science and reproductive medicine . " financial problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sperm and egg are united outside of the body in ivf however , it 's not just the embryo protection law that is restrictive . " even if the law were changed to allow egg donation , only a fraction of women would take advantage of it , " de wit said . an issue affecting many more women and couples wanting children is the drastic cutback in insurance companies paying for assisted reproduction technology -lrb- art -rrb- treatments . formerly , germany 's public insurance companies - or compulsory health insurance funds - covered the entire costs of up to four ivf and isci treatments and six intrauterine inseminations -lrb- iui -rrb- .
in the wake of sweeping reforms , however , as of 2004 the funds only pay 50 percent of up to three ivf , icsi or iui cycles , and only for married couples when the woman is 40 or younger .
other age restrictions also apply .
-lrb- icsi , or " intracytoplasmic sperm injection , " is a method involving the injection of sperm into an egg via an ultra-fine needle . -rrb- unmarried couples must cover all costs themselves .
and they are heady . a married couple 's average share per cycle currently runs around 1,300 euros -lrb- $ 1,900 -rrb- .
thus , less affluent couples have been essentially barred from trying to get pregnant through art . looking ahead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : assisted reproduction is often ridden with physical and psychological stress " we have a birth rate of 1.3 children per woman in germany , " hilland said .
" children are desperately needed in this country , so any measure to improve the birth rate would be desirable . " german doctors say they now perform around 40 percent fewer art treatments than before the reform , even though the success rate by ivf is around 25-35 percent for each try , meaning that several treatment cycles would likely see a couple 's wish for children fulfilled . the reforms were supposed to save the public health insurance funds up to 100 million euros yearly through sharing art costs with couples .
but according to hilland , some 10,000 fewer " art " children have been born each year since the reforms . considering that one in seven couples suffer from infertility and that germany 's population is aging dramatically , that number is nothing to sneeze at . louisa schaefer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de children and families -pipe- 12.12.2007 germany 's egg donation prohibition is outdated , experts say großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when fertilization does n't happen naturally , german couples face tough hurdles the recent birth of a baby by a 64-year-old woman in germany has sparked debate about the embryo protection law , which prohibits egg donation .
but with rising infertility rates , germany may need to rethink its policies . the 64-year-old german woman who recently gave birth to a healthy baby girl made headlines around the world .
but her age did not set a precedent .
last year , a 67-year-old spanish woman became the world 's oldest mother when she gave birth to twins , topping the record from the previous year of a 66-year-old romanian who also had twins . the unnamed german became pregnant with the help of in-vitro fertilization -lrb- ivf -rrb- , using an egg donated by a 25-year-old and the sperm of the german woman 's husband .
the treatment was conducted abroad , as donating eggs cells for pregnancies is illegal in germany . the prohibition of egg cell donation is part of germany 's " embryo protection law , " which was passed in 1990 .
sperm donation , however , is permitted . mothers more important than fathers ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fertility rates after 35 drop dramatically the reasoning behind the ban on egg donation was that both the genetic mother and the woman bearing the baby were presumed to be responsible for the child 's existence , said ulrich hilland of the berlin-based federal association of german centers for reproductive medicine . " the law could be interpreted in such a way that it is assumed that mothers have a stronger emotional connection to their children , due to pregnancy , than fathers , " hilland said . the law aimed to prevent the separation between the genetic and the " social " mother - the woman who would later raise the child .
surrogacy is therefore also prohibited in germany . quality risks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : several implanted embryos can result in twins or triplets christina de wit of the german national ethics council , in berlin , pointed to another reason for banning the donation of egg cells . " harvesting eggs from a donor is an invasive operation requiring extensive hormonal stimulation beforehand , so that many eggs mature , " she said .
" that means that the whole process involves medical risks ; that 's not the case with sperm donors . " some german politicians say the recent case demonstrates that egg donation prohibition in germany should be lifted .
others point out that the prohibition prompts " reproduction tourism " by forcing women to go abroad to fulfill their wish for children . " we see risks in quality-control here , " hilland said .
" women who go abroad can not be assured that the testing and therefore the selection process among egg donor candidates have been sufficient . " outdated law ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immobile sperm is often the cause of male infertility the current german law is one of the most restrictive in the world .
it stipulates that only as many embryos may be cultivated as may actually be implanted -lrb- up to three per ivf cycle -rrb- . embryos may also not be examined to determine sex before implantation , nor is pre-implantation genetic diagnosis -lrb- pgd -rrb- , otherwise known as " embryo screening , " allowed - the latter ban a likely result of germany trying to come to terms with its nazi past . furthermore , the freezing -lrb- cryopreservation -rrb- of embryos for later implantation is restricted .
only eggs in the very early stages of fertilization - the pre-nucleus stage - may be frozen in certain cases . the embryo protection law itself was smart , because it defined the legal parameters of in-vitro fertilization and aimed to prevent the manipulation of human life very early , hilland said . de wit agreed . " the law was originally intended to protect life at its initial stages , but unfortunately , it is rather outdated , " she said .
" a nearly 20-year-old law no longer corresponds with the huge advancements made in science and reproductive medicine . " financial problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sperm and egg are united outside of the body in ivf however , it 's not just the embryo protection law that is restrictive . " even if the law were changed to allow egg donation , only a fraction of women would take advantage of it , " de wit said . an issue affecting many more women and couples wanting children is the drastic cutback in insurance companies paying for assisted reproduction technology -lrb- art -rrb- treatments . formerly , germany 's public insurance companies - or compulsory health insurance funds - covered the entire costs of up to four ivf and isci treatments and six intrauterine inseminations -lrb- iui -rrb- .
in the wake of sweeping reforms , however , as of 2004 the funds only pay 50 percent of up to three ivf , icsi or iui cycles , and only for married couples when the woman is 40 or younger .
other age restrictions also apply .
-lrb- icsi , or " intracytoplasmic sperm injection , " is a method involving the injection of sperm into an egg via an ultra-fine needle . -rrb- unmarried couples must cover all costs themselves .
and they are heady . a married couple 's average share per cycle currently runs around 1,300 euros -lrb- $ 1,900 -rrb- .
thus , less affluent couples have been essentially barred from trying to get pregnant through art . looking ahead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : assisted reproduction is often ridden with physical and psychological stress " we have a birth rate of 1.3 children per woman in germany , " hilland said .
" children are desperately needed in this country , so any measure to improve the birth rate would be desirable . " german doctors say they now perform around 40 percent fewer art treatments than before the reform , even though the success rate by ivf is around 25-35 percent for each try , meaning that several treatment cycles would likely see a couple 's wish for children fulfilled . the reforms were supposed to save the public health insurance funds up to 100 million euros yearly through sharing art costs with couples .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 12.12.2007 moscow suspends cold war weapons treaty großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moscow can now legally move troops and weapons without notifying nato moscow officially ended its adherence to a key cold war treaty that sets limits on the number of soldiers and weapons stationed in europe .
russia says nato left it with no choice but to abandon the agreement . officials in moscow said on wednesday , dec .
12 , that there are no plans to build up their military forces after they suspended participation in the conventional forces in europe treaty but added the move was necessary to protect russia 's national security . " such a step has been caused by the exceptional circumstances connected to the content of the treaty , which concern the security of russia and demand that we take immediate measures , " the russian foreign ministry said in a statement . the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- appealed for moscow to reconsider its decision , calling the treaty a " cornerstone for european security for 15 years . " " the suspension that takes effect today is not good news , " spanish foreign minister miguel angel moratinos , the group 's chairman-in-office , said in a statement .
" the loss of the cfe system of limitations , information and verification would be detrimental to all and could have security implications for all of europe . " military free to move bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the treaty limits troops numbers between the atlantic and the urals suspension means russia can move troops around the country without notifying nato , allowing russia to lift the " limitations placed on arms deployments , " the russian foreign ministry statement said . signed in 1990 and modified after the fall of the iron curtain in 1999 , the treaty places exact caps on the numbers of troops and heavy weapons stationed west of the ural mountains .
the cfe deal was seen as an important step in resolving the cold war . russian president vladimir putin signed a decree ordering moscow 's suspension of the treaty last month .
the decree met with wide acceptance in the russian parliament . " we wo n't observe any obligations unilaterally , " putin said in a speech last month .
" our partners did not ratify the treaty and some did not even sign it . " tit-for-tat decisions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato expanded to russia 's borders in 2004 at the heart of russia 's complaints on the cfe is nato 's failure to ratify the amended 1999 version of the treaty , which takes into account the huge changes wrought by the 1991 collapse of the soviet union .
nato 's expansion after the fall of the soviet union would potentially allow for the alliance 's troops within striking distance of st. petersburg . " the hypothetical transfer of nato forces into the baltics is a real military threat , " alexei arbatov , an arms control expert at the carnegie moscow center independent think-tank told reuters news agency . nato countries say they can not ratify the 1999 version because russian troop presence in ex-soviet georgia and moldova violates the treaty , a charge moscow rejects .
the kremlin has said soldiers stationed in the two countries represent a peacekeeping force . in a statement , nato expressed " deep regret " that russia had suspended the arms pact .
but it underlined that the military alliance would not take any retaliatory action .

it says the lenders are " aggressive " with such borrowers when they fall behind with their repayments .
however , the council of mortgage lenders -lrb- cml -rrb- said the report was " skewed " and " disproportionate " .
it said the charity 's attack on the sub-prime mortgage industry was " simplistic " and " sensationalist " .
" the vast majority of mortgage customers receive a high level of help and care from lenders of all kinds if they fall into difficulties , in accordance with the rules set out by the financial services authority , " said the cml .
" the allegation that they -lsb- lenders -rsb- default too quickly to court action is an assertion that is not borne out by the typical practices and processes of specialist lenders , " it said .
more repossessions the report from citizens advice , entitled set up to fail , denounced the methods of sub-prime lenders .
" dubious advice from brokers , irresponsible lending decisions and aggressive arrears management by sub-prime lenders are driving the current increase in mortgage arrears , court action and repossessions , " it said .
the report looked at case studies from 1,200 people who had asked for advice at citizens advice bureaux in england , wales and northern ireland , as well as surveying its clients who had arrears on their mortgages and other secured loans .
" our research suggests that many aspiring home owners have been mis-sold unsuitable and costly home loans that are doomed to fail from the start , " said citizens advice chief executive david harker .
" many sub-prime lenders are flouting the rules on responsible lending by granting loans when it 's clear the borrower will not be able to afford to repay it from the very outset , then getting tough immediately things go wrong , " he claimed .
no surprise the cml argued that people seeking help from citizens advice were likely to have the worst problems and therefore were not typical of sub-prime borrowers in general .
the lenders also said it was " no surprise " that such borrowers might have a higher default rate than mortgage borrowers generally .
however the imla , a trade body which represents the interests of lenders who market their products through mortgage brokers , welcomed some of the charity 's proposals .
" we do agree with citizens advice that the different regulatory regimes for first and second charge loans -lrb- and indeed the current regulatory ' gap ' for secured loans over £ 25,000 -rrb- has created complications , " said imla executive director peter williams .
" similarly , while judges can and do take account of individual people 's circumstances , there is evidence that borrowers are not always treated consistently by the courts , and we would favour further consideration being given to this point , he added .
the claims by citizens advice chime with other critical reports this year .
the financial services authority -lrb- fsa -rrb- has increasingly been taking action against dishonest mortgage brokers who sell unsuitable loans .
in october , a bbc investigation , reported by the panorama programme and five live report , found that sub-prime mortgage lenders who gave loans to people with bad credit records accounted for more than 70 % of repossession hearings .

the pirates issued their ransom demand earlier this week , threatening to kill the 23-man crew if their request was not met .
but the us navy confirmed that the pirates had left the ship overnight .
" all the pirates are off the ship , and the first indication is that all crew members are unharmed , " us navy spokesman lt john gay said .
the crew was made up of sailors from burma , philippines and south korea - and officials from those countries and japan expressed relief that the crisis had come to an end .
correspondents say somali coastal waters are now considered to be among the most hazardous in the world .

the pirates ended their occupation of the vessel just days after demanding a $ 1m -lrb- £ 500,000 -rrb- ransom .
it is not known why the gang gave up the tanker , or whether the ransom demand was met .
the golden nori , which was carrying the highly flammable substance benzene , was hijacked in late october .
it had been sailing from singapore to israel when it was attacked .
her distress calls were picked up by us warships patrolling off the coast of somalia who fired on the pirates ' speedboats , sinking two .
the warships followed the kidnapped chemical tanker into somali coastal waters and trapped the golden nori close to the port of bossaso , preventing supplies from getting to the ship .
the pirates issued their ransom demand earlier this week , threatening to kill the 23-man crew if their request was not met .
but the us navy confirmed that the pirates had left the ship overnight .
" all the pirates are off the ship , and the first indication is that all crew members are unharmed , " us navy spokesman lt john gay said .
the crew was made up of sailors from burma , philippines and south korea - and officials from those countries and japan expressed relief that the crisis had come to an end .
correspondents say somali coastal waters are now considered to be among the most hazardous in the world .
with no effective government , pirates are able to operate largely unchecked .
the us and french navies have been trying to tackle the problem by carrying out patrols .
reports say this is the first time in nearly a year that no hijacked ships are being held by somali pirates .

dr jan willem van der steeg , who led the study , said : " given the increased prevalence of obesity , this is a worrying finding .
" we think that women should be informed about their lower pregnancy chances due to their overweight .

mr tony rutherford , who helped draw up the guidance , said : " over the last few years there has been evidence that obesity can harm the fertility of women .
" it decreases the chances of getting pregnant , and increases the risks of pregnancy - to both mother and child .
" sometimes there are difficult balances to be made , and obviously we do feel for couples who are trying to have a baby . "
