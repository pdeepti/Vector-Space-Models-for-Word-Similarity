they are germany 's first confirmed cases this year . at least three water birds found dead in the bavarian city of nuremberg were infected with a strain of bird flu that can be lethal to humans , health officials said sunday .
local authorities established a four-kilometer exclusion zone around two lakes where eight wild swans , geese and ducks died in the past six days .
veterinary experts at the friedrich löffler institute , the government 's top veterinary laboratory , on the island of riems in the north of germany determined that two swans and a wild duck had contracted the h5n1 bird flu strain .
they were the first bird flu cases discovered in germany this year , and the first report of wild birds infected this year within the european union .
tests on the other five animals were continuing .
" i expect that these are infected , as well , " said karin koester , spokeswoman for the office of veterinary medicine in bavaria .
in the meantime , officials ordered that all poultry farmers in the exclusion zone keep their animals indoors .
pet owners were warned not to let their dogs or cats roam free in the affected area .

the newspaper report was later confirmed by defense ministry spokesman thomas raabe . he told reporters jung 's delegation was warned of a possible attack just after the minister had paid a visit to afghan president hamid karzai in kabul on june 6 . " when the minister was due to travel from the president 's palace to the airport , we received a tip-off that an attack could take place on the road , " he said . he said the german army then changed the minister 's travel route . tanks and armored vehicles journalists travelling with the minister reported at the time that tanks protected jung 's motorcade on its journey through the afghan capital and that on the way back to the airport some members of the delegation were ordered to travel in armored vehicles . jung met afghan president hamid karzai in kabul and also inspected german troops serving with the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in afghanistan . isaf force germany has around 2,900 troops in afghanistan serving in isaf , most of them in the relatively calm north .

a few days after jung 's visit , a newspaper said a foreign office report had warned that more attacks on german troops were to be expected . chancellor angela merkel and her co-ruling christian democrats have promised to keep the troops in afghanistan , despite recent polls which show 61 percent of germans believe the soldiers should leave .
in a speech last week , jung said if the troops were pulled out afghanistan could " revert to being a training center for terrorism from which the attacks on september 11 were carried out .

"
" it would have been better if this summit had failed , " the newspaper said in an editorial , adding that the bitter dispute over poland 's voting rights has shown that there is little hope for unity in the eu .
" that would have prevented the creation of a europe of two speeds and two classes .
the sickening double game played by the polish brothers kaczynski should make it clear to any fan of europe that this is now inevitable . "
continuing rancor relations between poland and germany have never been warm since world war ii and took another beating when warsaw threatened to veto a deal on a new treaty over the voting rights issue .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german papers are not amused with britain and poland before the summit began , the deeply conservative polish president lech kaczynski and his twin prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski evoked poland 's destruction at the hands of nazi germany as a reason why its population , and therefore its voting power , was so low .
in the end , poland won a considerable concession on the voting issue in brussels , persuading the bloc 's other 26 members to delay the full introduction of the new system until 2017 .
" warsaw is on board .
but the treaty should not yet be considered saved , " der tagesspiegel newspaper said .
it warned that the upcoming intergovernmental conference to finalize drafting the treaty and the ratification process present " the next obstacles . "
the berliner morgenpost agreed , saying that " disaster has been averted , for now . "
" it is annoying to see to what extent the nationalistic , egotistical blocking tactics of poland and britain paid off , " it added .
dangerous precedent the newspaper said it feared that a dangerous precedent has been set whereby nations who threaten to block progress within the european union will be given concessions in return for their cooperation .

german is quite european .
you can see that in our history and in looking at german today .
the idea that german is separate from other european languages only started in the 19th century , following the unification of the german states as one nation .
over the last two years the goethe institute has promoted the “ power of language . ”
what “ power ” does german have today , and what does european integration mean for the german language ?
english has won out as the major international language , that ’ s well established now .
the issue is what worth and power a single language has at this point in time .
german is clearly important and powerful within europe , however german is not used as internationally as english or french .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ludwig m. eichinger in what areas does german play an international role ?
the field of natural sciences has been almost entirely given over to english .
there are a number of traditional fields of study where german has always been strong , and where it still plays a large role , including philosophy and music .
and there are some fields , such as art history , where german has , in recent decades , actually been the primary language .
is the use of german growing ?
german could become a european regional language in the east ; that is a reasonable possibility .
the linguistic connection between germany and its eastern neighbors dates back centuries , and those countries have a strong tradition of learning german .
however we also need to promote the german language , in europe especially , as a useful second foreign language .
in many countries english will be the first foreign language people choose to learn , but there are also good economic and practical reasons for learning german which we should promote . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : learning german helps social integration and prosperity of immigrants , says eichinger there are plans to enshrine german as the national language in germany ’ s constitution .
what do you think of this plan ?
the intentions behind the plan are good .
it ’ s about making the point that our language is not just a symbol , but saying that it should be maintained on a practical level as well .
on the other hand , i don ’ t think we have reached a point where we need to decree that it is critical that in germany we should speak german . in that sense it is not necessary to specify the german language in the constitution , which is a fairly general text .
that would imply that german is somehow endangered and that we need to do it to protect the language .
our problem is rather that of integration , given we have so many immigrants for whom german is not their first language . how multilingual is germany ?
germany is comparatively multilingual – but on another level quite monolingual .
the establishment is very much based on the german language .
the educational system is also quite rightly based on the german language .
however there is a large multilingual population in germany , and we have to be practical about this .
the danger is not that , if for example turkish were to become stronger in germany , we would all end up speaking turkish . the issue is really that we need to see this multilingualism as a part of the cultural identity of immigrants , while at the same time to ensure - and this may sound harsh - that they can function effectively in our society .
objectively , we can see with recent generations of immigrants that retreating into their own communities brings social disadvantage .
so we shouldn ’ t stress the importance of integration because otherwise the german language would be endangered , but because we need to give all communities the opportunity to participate fully in society .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spelling reform has made german a bit easier .
do we need a german equivalent to the “ academie francaise ” devoted to regulating , preserving and standardizing our language ?
that would probably be a bit difficult , because german is such a diverse language group .
traditionally , what is correct german has not been centrally determined .
for example , there has just been a dictionary published which describes the differences in the variants of german – what is spoken in austria , switzerland and then high german .
of course we could look at creating an institution concerned with the introduction of foreign words into the language .
but a comprehensive language academy , given the ways in which german changes , would be difficult .

german is quite european .
you can see that in our history and in looking at german today .
the idea that german is separate from other european languages only started in the 19th century , following the unification of the german states as one nation .
over the last two years the goethe institute has promoted the “ power of language . ”
what “ power ” does german have today , and what does european integration mean for the german language ?
english has won out as the major international language , that ’ s well established now .
the issue is what worth and power a single language has at this point in time .
german is clearly important and powerful within europe , however german is not used as internationally as english or french .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ludwig m. eichinger in what areas does german play an international role ?
the field of natural sciences has been almost entirely given over to english .
there are a number of traditional fields of study where german has always been strong , and where it still plays a large role , including philosophy and music .
and there are some fields , such as art history , where german has , in recent decades , actually been the primary language .
is the use of german growing ?
german could become a european regional language in the east ; that is a reasonable possibility .
the linguistic connection between germany and its eastern neighbors dates back centuries , and those countries have a strong tradition of learning german .
however we also need to promote the german language , in europe especially , as a useful second foreign language .
in many countries english will be the first foreign language people choose to learn , but there are also good economic and practical reasons for learning german which we should promote . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : learning german helps social integration and prosperity of immigrants , says eichinger there are plans to enshrine german as the national language in germany ’ s constitution .
what do you think of this plan ?
the intentions behind the plan are good .
it ’ s about making the point that our language is not just a symbol , but saying that it should be maintained on a practical level as well .
on the other hand , i don ’ t think we have reached a point where we need to decree that it is critical that in germany we should speak german . in that sense it is not necessary to specify the german language in the constitution , which is a fairly general text .
that would imply that german is somehow endangered and that we need to do it to protect the language .
our problem is rather that of integration , given we have so many immigrants for whom german is not their first language . how multilingual is germany ?
germany is comparatively multilingual – but on another level quite monolingual .
the establishment is very much based on the german language .
the educational system is also quite rightly based on the german language .
however there is a large multilingual population in germany , and we have to be practical about this .
the danger is not that , if for example turkish were to become stronger in germany , we would all end up speaking turkish . the issue is really that we need to see this multilingualism as a part of the cultural identity of immigrants , while at the same time to ensure - and this may sound harsh - that they can function effectively in our society .
objectively , we can see with recent generations of immigrants that retreating into their own communities brings social disadvantage .
so we shouldn ’ t stress the importance of integration because otherwise the german language would be endangered , but because we need to give all communities the opportunity to participate fully in society .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spelling reform has made german a bit easier .
do we need a german equivalent to the “ academie francaise ” devoted to regulating , preserving and standardizing our language ?
that would probably be a bit difficult , because german is such a diverse language group .
traditionally , what is correct german has not been centrally determined .
for example , there has just been a dictionary published which describes the differences in the variants of german – what is spoken in austria , switzerland and then high german .
of course we could look at creating an institution concerned with the introduction of foreign words into the language .
but a comprehensive language academy , given the ways in which german changes , would be difficult .

the danger is not that , if for example turkish were to become stronger in germany , we would all end up speaking turkish . the issue is really that we need to see this multilingualism as a part of the cultural identity of immigrants , while at the same time to ensure - and this may sound harsh - that they can function effectively in our society .
objectively , we can see with recent generations of immigrants that retreating into their own communities brings social disadvantage .
so we shouldn ’ t stress the importance of integration because otherwise the german language would be endangered , but because we need to give all communities the opportunity to participate fully in society .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spelling reform has made german a bit easier .
do we need a german equivalent to the “ academie francaise ” devoted to regulating , preserving and standardizing our language ?
that would probably be a bit difficult , because german is such a diverse language group .
traditionally , what is correct german has not been centrally determined .
for example , there has just been a dictionary published which describes the differences in the variants of german – what is spoken in austria , switzerland and then high german .
of course we could look at creating an institution concerned with the introduction of foreign words into the language .
but a comprehensive language academy , given the ways in which german changes , would be difficult .

german morticians plan a tv channel whose focus is on dying . reports on centuries-old rituals around death , obituaries made by surviving friends and family members or information on german funeral bureaucracy are what viewers can expect who tune in to the television station planned by the country 's association of funeral directors . " we want the channel to help remove the taboos around the subject of death , " said kerstin gernig , a spokesperson for the association . the channel , which is scheduled to begin broadcasting on satellite and on the internet in november , is aimed at germany 's expanding elderly population .
demographic changes in the country mean that the number of people over 60 is growing much more quickly than younger groups . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : information about funerals will be on offer but among this senior group , death is still a subject largely suppressed or ignored until it happens .
then , survivors are often at a loss over what to do with their feelings , or how to navigate the practical matters around funerals and estates . " we do n't want to proselytize , " said gernig .
" we want to provide information so people know everything that is involved . " the channel will be funded partly by obituaries that can be commissioned or produced by loved ones for the deceased , partly by partnerships the station hopes to establish with companies which produce products and services for older people , or facilities like nursing homes .
the station does not plan on featuring conventional advertisements . to be produced in cooperation with brandenburg-based eostv , planners are striving to avoid any kind of sensationalism .
an ethics advisory body will supervise the programming , which is to always be " serious and respectful , " according to gernig .
representatives from germany 's two main christian churches will sit on the ethics council , she said , although there are no plans as of yet to have a muslim member on board . kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de language -pipe- 24.06.2007 the german language 's role in a changing world großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flying the flag - german is still vital and relevant , says eichinger dw-world spoke with ludwig m. eichinger , director of the institute for the german language , about the place of german in the world today . how european is german ?
german is quite european .
you can see that in our history and in looking at german today .
the idea that german is separate from other european languages only started in the 19th century , following the unification of the german states as one nation .
over the last two years the goethe institute has promoted the “ power of language . ”
what “ power ” does german have today , and what does european integration mean for the german language ?
english has won out as the major international language , that ’ s well established now .
the issue is what worth and power a single language has at this point in time .
german is clearly important and powerful within europe , however german is not used as internationally as english or french .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ludwig m. eichinger in what areas does german play an international role ?
the field of natural sciences has been almost entirely given over to english .
there are a number of traditional fields of study where german has always been strong , and where it still plays a large role , including philosophy and music .
and there are some fields , such as art history , where german has , in recent decades , actually been the primary language .
is the use of german growing ?
german could become a european regional language in the east ; that is a reasonable possibility .
the linguistic connection between germany and its eastern neighbors dates back centuries , and those countries have a strong tradition of learning german .
however we also need to promote the german language , in europe especially , as a useful second foreign language .
in many countries english will be the first foreign language people choose to learn , but there are also good economic and practical reasons for learning german which we should promote . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : learning german helps social integration and prosperity of immigrants , says eichinger there are plans to enshrine german as the national language in germany ’ s constitution .
what do you think of this plan ?
the intentions behind the plan are good .
it ’ s about making the point that our language is not just a symbol , but saying that it should be maintained on a practical level as well .
on the other hand , i don ’ t think we have reached a point where we need to decree that it is critical that in germany we should speak german . in that sense it is not necessary to specify the german language in the constitution , which is a fairly general text .
that would imply that german is somehow endangered and that we need to do it to protect the language .
our problem is rather that of integration , given we have so many immigrants for whom german is not their first language . how multilingual is germany ?
germany is comparatively multilingual – but on another level quite monolingual .
the establishment is very much based on the german language .
the educational system is also quite rightly based on the german language .
however there is a large multilingual population in germany , and we have to be practical about this .
the danger is not that , if for example turkish were to become stronger in germany , we would all end up speaking turkish . the issue is really that we need to see this multilingualism as a part of the cultural identity of immigrants , while at the same time to ensure - and this may sound harsh - that they can function effectively in our society .
objectively , we can see with recent generations of immigrants that retreating into their own communities brings social disadvantage .
so we shouldn ’ t stress the importance of integration because otherwise the german language would be endangered , but because we need to give all communities the opportunity to participate fully in society .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spelling reform has made german a bit easier .
do we need a german equivalent to the “ academie francaise ” devoted to regulating , preserving and standardizing our language ?
that would probably be a bit difficult , because german is such a diverse language group .
traditionally , what is correct german has not been centrally determined .
for example , there has just been a dictionary published which describes the differences in the variants of german – what is spoken in austria , switzerland and then high german .
of course we could look at creating an institution concerned with the introduction of foreign words into the language .
but a comprehensive language academy , given the ways in which german changes , would be difficult .

german is quite european .
you can see that in our history and in looking at german today .
the idea that german is separate from other european languages only started in the 19th century , following the unification of the german states as one nation .
over the last two years the goethe institute has promoted the “ power of language . ”
what “ power ” does german have today , and what does european integration mean for the german language ?
english has won out as the major international language , that ’ s well established now .
the issue is what worth and power a single language has at this point in time .
german is clearly important and powerful within europe , however german is not used as internationally as english or french .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ludwig m. eichinger in what areas does german play an international role ?
the field of natural sciences has been almost entirely given over to english .
there are a number of traditional fields of study where german has always been strong , and where it still plays a large role , including philosophy and music .
and there are some fields , such as art history , where german has , in recent decades , actually been the primary language .
is the use of german growing ?
german could become a european regional language in the east ; that is a reasonable possibility .
the linguistic connection between germany and its eastern neighbors dates back centuries , and those countries have a strong tradition of learning german .
however we also need to promote the german language , in europe especially , as a useful second foreign language .
in many countries english will be the first foreign language people choose to learn , but there are also good economic and practical reasons for learning german which we should promote . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : learning german helps social integration and prosperity of immigrants , says eichinger there are plans to enshrine german as the national language in germany ’ s constitution .
what do you think of this plan ?
the intentions behind the plan are good .
it ’ s about making the point that our language is not just a symbol , but saying that it should be maintained on a practical level as well .
on the other hand , i don ’ t think we have reached a point where we need to decree that it is critical that in germany we should speak german . in that sense it is not necessary to specify the german language in the constitution , which is a fairly general text .
that would imply that german is somehow endangered and that we need to do it to protect the language .
our problem is rather that of integration , given we have so many immigrants for whom german is not their first language . how multilingual is germany ?
germany is comparatively multilingual – but on another level quite monolingual .
the establishment is very much based on the german language .
the educational system is also quite rightly based on the german language .
however there is a large multilingual population in germany , and we have to be practical about this .
the danger is not that , if for example turkish were to become stronger in germany , we would all end up speaking turkish . the issue is really that we need to see this multilingualism as a part of the cultural identity of immigrants , while at the same time to ensure - and this may sound harsh - that they can function effectively in our society .
objectively , we can see with recent generations of immigrants that retreating into their own communities brings social disadvantage .
so we shouldn ’ t stress the importance of integration because otherwise the german language would be endangered , but because we need to give all communities the opportunity to participate fully in society .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spelling reform has made german a bit easier .
do we need a german equivalent to the “ academie francaise ” devoted to regulating , preserving and standardizing our language ?
that would probably be a bit difficult , because german is such a diverse language group .
traditionally , what is correct german has not been centrally determined .
for example , there has just been a dictionary published which describes the differences in the variants of german – what is spoken in austria , switzerland and then high german .
of course we could look at creating an institution concerned with the introduction of foreign words into the language .
but a comprehensive language academy , given the ways in which german changes , would be difficult .

"
" it would have been better if this summit had failed , " the newspaper said in an editorial , adding that the bitter dispute over poland 's voting rights has shown that there is little hope for unity in the eu .
" that would have prevented the creation of a europe of two speeds and two classes .
the sickening double game played by the polish brothers kaczynski should make it clear to any fan of europe that this is now inevitable . "
continuing rancor relations between poland and germany have never been warm since world war ii and took another beating when warsaw threatened to veto a deal on a new treaty over the voting rights issue .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german papers are not amused with britain and poland before the summit began , the deeply conservative polish president lech kaczynski and his twin prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski evoked poland 's destruction at the hands of nazi germany as a reason why its population , and therefore its voting power , was so low .
in the end , poland won a considerable concession on the voting issue in brussels , persuading the bloc 's other 26 members to delay the full introduction of the new system until 2017 .
" warsaw is on board .
but the treaty should not yet be considered saved , " der tagesspiegel newspaper said .
it warned that the upcoming intergovernmental conference to finalize drafting the treaty and the ratification process present " the next obstacles . "
the berliner morgenpost agreed , saying that " disaster has been averted , for now . "
" it is annoying to see to what extent the nationalistic , egotistical blocking tactics of poland and britain paid off , " it added .
dangerous precedent the newspaper said it feared that a dangerous precedent has been set whereby nations who threaten to block progress within the european union will be given concessions in return for their cooperation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a journalist got a snooze in while waiting for politicians negotiating into the early hours last saturday morning " after a success like the one claimed by poland , there is a danger that this tactic will become common currency . "
welt am sonntag described the haggling that preceded the deal as " torture " and said despite its eventual success the summit will be remembered mostly for britain and poland 's " egotistical " behavior .
it predicted that relations between berlin and warsaw were heading for an " icy spell . "
" poland has failed to understand that the point of the european union is to bury the hatred we inherited , " the newspaper commented . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german morticians plan a tv channel whose focus is on dying . reports on centuries-old rituals around death , obituaries made by surviving friends and family members or information on german funeral bureaucracy are what viewers can expect who tune in to the television station planned by the country 's association of funeral directors .

the report was later confirmed by the defense ministry . german authorities learned of a plot to attack defense minister franz josef jung when he visited afghanistan earlier this month , the bild am sonntag newspaper reported .
jung visited german troops in northern afghanistan on june 6 but the trip was not officially announced for security reasons .
the german intelligence services warned of the plot just before the minister landed near kabul , bild said , citing the defense ministry and sources close to the intelligence community .
" the tip-off about a planned attack was very clear , " the defense ministry is quoted as telling the newspaper .
the newspaper report was later confirmed by defense ministry spokesman thomas raabe . he told reporters jung 's delegation was warned of a possible attack just after the minister had paid a visit to afghan president hamid karzai in kabul on june 6 . " when the minister was due to travel from the president 's palace to the airport , we received a tip-off that an attack could take place on the road , " he said . he said the german army then changed the minister 's travel route . tanks and armored vehicles journalists travelling with the minister reported at the time that tanks protected jung 's motorcade on its journey through the afghan capital and that on the way back to the airport some members of the delegation were ordered to travel in armored vehicles . jung met afghan president hamid karzai in kabul and also inspected german troops serving with the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in afghanistan . isaf force germany has around 2,900 troops in afghanistan serving in isaf , most of them in the relatively calm north .

a few days after jung 's visit , a newspaper said a foreign office report had warned that more attacks on german troops were to be expected . chancellor angela merkel and her co-ruling christian democrats have promised to keep the troops in afghanistan , despite recent polls which show 61 percent of germans believe the soldiers should leave .
in a speech last week , jung said if the troops were pulled out afghanistan could " revert to being a training center for terrorism from which the attacks on september 11 were carried out .

german is quite european .
you can see that in our history and in looking at german today .
the idea that german is separate from other european languages only started in the 19th century , following the unification of the german states as one nation .
over the last two years the goethe institute has promoted the “ power of language . ”
what “ power ” does german have today , and what does european integration mean for the german language ?
english has won out as the major international language , that ’ s well established now .
the issue is what worth and power a single language has at this point in time .
german is clearly important and powerful within europe , however german is not used as internationally as english or french .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ludwig m. eichinger in what areas does german play an international role ?
the field of natural sciences has been almost entirely given over to english .
there are a number of traditional fields of study where german has always been strong , and where it still plays a large role , including philosophy and music .
and there are some fields , such as art history , where german has , in recent decades , actually been the primary language .
is the use of german growing ?
german could become a european regional language in the east ; that is a reasonable possibility .
the linguistic connection between germany and its eastern neighbors dates back centuries , and those countries have a strong tradition of learning german .
however we also need to promote the german language , in europe especially , as a useful second foreign language .
in many countries english will be the first foreign language people choose to learn , but there are also good economic and practical reasons for learning german which we should promote . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : learning german helps social integration and prosperity of immigrants , says eichinger there are plans to enshrine german as the national language in germany ’ s constitution .
what do you think of this plan ?
the intentions behind the plan are good .
it ’ s about making the point that our language is not just a symbol , but saying that it should be maintained on a practical level as well .
on the other hand , i don ’ t think we have reached a point where we need to decree that it is critical that in germany we should speak german . in that sense it is not necessary to specify the german language in the constitution , which is a fairly general text .
that would imply that german is somehow endangered and that we need to do it to protect the language .
our problem is rather that of integration , given we have so many immigrants for whom german is not their first language . how multilingual is germany ?
germany is comparatively multilingual – but on another level quite monolingual .
the establishment is very much based on the german language .
the educational system is also quite rightly based on the german language .
however there is a large multilingual population in germany , and we have to be practical about this .
the danger is not that , if for example turkish were to become stronger in germany , we would all end up speaking turkish . the issue is really that we need to see this multilingualism as a part of the cultural identity of immigrants , while at the same time to ensure - and this may sound harsh - that they can function effectively in our society .
objectively , we can see with recent generations of immigrants that retreating into their own communities brings social disadvantage .
so we shouldn ’ t stress the importance of integration because otherwise the german language would be endangered , but because we need to give all communities the opportunity to participate fully in society .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spelling reform has made german a bit easier .
do we need a german equivalent to the “ academie francaise ” devoted to regulating , preserving and standardizing our language ?
that would probably be a bit difficult , because german is such a diverse language group .
traditionally , what is correct german has not been centrally determined .
for example , there has just been a dictionary published which describes the differences in the variants of german – what is spoken in austria , switzerland and then high german .
of course we could look at creating an institution concerned with the introduction of foreign words into the language .
but a comprehensive language academy , given the ways in which german changes , would be difficult .

"
" it would have been better if this summit had failed , " the newspaper said in an editorial , adding that the bitter dispute over poland 's voting rights has shown that there is little hope for unity in the eu .
" that would have prevented the creation of a europe of two speeds and two classes .
the sickening double game played by the polish brothers kaczynski should make it clear to any fan of europe that this is now inevitable . "
continuing rancor relations between poland and germany have never been warm since world war ii and took another beating when warsaw threatened to veto a deal on a new treaty over the voting rights issue .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german papers are not amused with britain and poland before the summit began , the deeply conservative polish president lech kaczynski and his twin prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski evoked poland 's destruction at the hands of nazi germany as a reason why its population , and therefore its voting power , was so low .
in the end , poland won a considerable concession on the voting issue in brussels , persuading the bloc 's other 26 members to delay the full introduction of the new system until 2017 .
" warsaw is on board .
but the treaty should not yet be considered saved , " der tagesspiegel newspaper said .
it warned that the upcoming intergovernmental conference to finalize drafting the treaty and the ratification process present " the next obstacles . "
the berliner morgenpost agreed , saying that " disaster has been averted , for now . "
" it is annoying to see to what extent the nationalistic , egotistical blocking tactics of poland and britain paid off , " it added .
dangerous precedent the newspaper said it feared that a dangerous precedent has been set whereby nations who threaten to block progress within the european union will be given concessions in return for their cooperation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a journalist got a snooze in while waiting for politicians negotiating into the early hours last saturday morning " after a success like the one claimed by poland , there is a danger that this tactic will become common currency . "
welt am sonntag described the haggling that preceded the deal as " torture " and said despite its eventual success the summit will be remembered mostly for britain and poland 's " egotistical " behavior .

german morticians plan a tv channel whose focus is on dying . reports on centuries-old rituals around death , obituaries made by surviving friends and family members or information on german funeral bureaucracy are what viewers can expect who tune in to the television station planned by the country 's association of funeral directors . " we want the channel to help remove the taboos around the subject of death , " said kerstin gernig , a spokesperson for the association . the channel , which is scheduled to begin broadcasting on satellite and on the internet in november , is aimed at germany 's expanding elderly population .
demographic changes in the country mean that the number of people over 60 is growing much more quickly than younger groups . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : information about funerals will be on offer but among this senior group , death is still a subject largely suppressed or ignored until it happens .
then , survivors are often at a loss over what to do with their feelings , or how to navigate the practical matters around funerals and estates . " we do n't want to proselytize , " said gernig .
" we want to provide information so people know everything that is involved . " the channel will be funded partly by obituaries that can be commissioned or produced by loved ones for the deceased , partly by partnerships the station hopes to establish with companies which produce products and services for older people , or facilities like nursing homes .
the station does not plan on featuring conventional advertisements . to be produced in cooperation with brandenburg-based eostv , planners are striving to avoid any kind of sensationalism .
an ethics advisory body will supervise the programming , which is to always be " serious and respectful , " according to gernig .
representatives from germany 's two main christian churches will sit on the ethics council , she said , although there are no plans as of yet to have a muslim member on board . kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the report was later confirmed by the defense ministry . german authorities learned of a plot to attack defense minister franz josef jung when he visited afghanistan earlier this month , the bild am sonntag newspaper reported .
jung visited german troops in northern afghanistan on june 6 but the trip was not officially announced for security reasons .
the german intelligence services warned of the plot just before the minister landed near kabul , bild said , citing the defense ministry and sources close to the intelligence community .
" the tip-off about a planned attack was very clear , " the defense ministry is quoted as telling the newspaper .
the newspaper report was later confirmed by defense ministry spokesman thomas raabe . he told reporters jung 's delegation was warned of a possible attack just after the minister had paid a visit to afghan president hamid karzai in kabul on june 6 . " when the minister was due to travel from the president 's palace to the airport , we received a tip-off that an attack could take place on the road , " he said . he said the german army then changed the minister 's travel route . tanks and armored vehicles journalists travelling with the minister reported at the time that tanks protected jung 's motorcade on its journey through the afghan capital and that on the way back to the airport some members of the delegation were ordered to travel in armored vehicles . jung met afghan president hamid karzai in kabul and also inspected german troops serving with the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in afghanistan . isaf force germany has around 2,900 troops in afghanistan serving in isaf , most of them in the relatively calm north .

a few days after jung 's visit , a newspaper said a foreign office report had warned that more attacks on german troops were to be expected . chancellor angela merkel and her co-ruling christian democrats have promised to keep the troops in afghanistan , despite recent polls which show 61 percent of germans believe the soldiers should leave .
in a speech last week , jung said if the troops were pulled out afghanistan could " revert to being a training center for terrorism from which the attacks on september 11 were carried out .

german is quite european .
you can see that in our history and in looking at german today .
the idea that german is separate from other european languages only started in the 19th century , following the unification of the german states as one nation .
over the last two years the goethe institute has promoted the “ power of language . ”
what “ power ” does german have today , and what does european integration mean for the german language ?
english has won out as the major international language , that ’ s well established now .
the issue is what worth and power a single language has at this point in time .
german is clearly important and powerful within europe , however german is not used as internationally as english or french .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ludwig m. eichinger in what areas does german play an international role ?
the field of natural sciences has been almost entirely given over to english .
there are a number of traditional fields of study where german has always been strong , and where it still plays a large role , including philosophy and music .
and there are some fields , such as art history , where german has , in recent decades , actually been the primary language .
is the use of german growing ?
german could become a european regional language in the east ; that is a reasonable possibility .
the linguistic connection between germany and its eastern neighbors dates back centuries , and those countries have a strong tradition of learning german .
however we also need to promote the german language , in europe especially , as a useful second foreign language .
in many countries english will be the first foreign language people choose to learn , but there are also good economic and practical reasons for learning german which we should promote . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : learning german helps social integration and prosperity of immigrants , says eichinger there are plans to enshrine german as the national language in germany ’ s constitution .
what do you think of this plan ?
the intentions behind the plan are good .
it ’ s about making the point that our language is not just a symbol , but saying that it should be maintained on a practical level as well .
on the other hand , i don ’ t think we have reached a point where we need to decree that it is critical that in germany we should speak german . in that sense it is not necessary to specify the german language in the constitution , which is a fairly general text .
that would imply that german is somehow endangered and that we need to do it to protect the language .
our problem is rather that of integration , given we have so many immigrants for whom german is not their first language . how multilingual is germany ?
germany is comparatively multilingual – but on another level quite monolingual .
the establishment is very much based on the german language .
the educational system is also quite rightly based on the german language .
however there is a large multilingual population in germany , and we have to be practical about this .
the danger is not that , if for example turkish were to become stronger in germany , we would all end up speaking turkish . the issue is really that we need to see this multilingualism as a part of the cultural identity of immigrants , while at the same time to ensure - and this may sound harsh - that they can function effectively in our society .
objectively , we can see with recent generations of immigrants that retreating into their own communities brings social disadvantage .
so we shouldn ’ t stress the importance of integration because otherwise the german language would be endangered , but because we need to give all communities the opportunity to participate fully in society .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spelling reform has made german a bit easier .
do we need a german equivalent to the “ academie francaise ” devoted to regulating , preserving and standardizing our language ?
that would probably be a bit difficult , because german is such a diverse language group .
traditionally , what is correct german has not been centrally determined .
for example , there has just been a dictionary published which describes the differences in the variants of german – what is spoken in austria , switzerland and then high german .
of course we could look at creating an institution concerned with the introduction of foreign words into the language .
but a comprehensive language academy , given the ways in which german changes , would be difficult .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de language -pipe- 24.06.2007 the german language 's role in a changing world großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flying the flag - german is still vital and relevant , says eichinger dw-world spoke with ludwig m. eichinger , director of the institute for the german language , about the place of german in the world today . how european is german ?
german is quite european .
you can see that in our history and in looking at german today .
the idea that german is separate from other european languages only started in the 19th century , following the unification of the german states as one nation .
over the last two years the goethe institute has promoted the “ power of language . ”
what “ power ” does german have today , and what does european integration mean for the german language ?
english has won out as the major international language , that ’ s well established now .
the issue is what worth and power a single language has at this point in time .
german is clearly important and powerful within europe , however german is not used as internationally as english or french .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ludwig m. eichinger in what areas does german play an international role ?
the field of natural sciences has been almost entirely given over to english .
there are a number of traditional fields of study where german has always been strong , and where it still plays a large role , including philosophy and music .
and there are some fields , such as art history , where german has , in recent decades , actually been the primary language .
is the use of german growing ?
german could become a european regional language in the east ; that is a reasonable possibility .
the linguistic connection between germany and its eastern neighbors dates back centuries , and those countries have a strong tradition of learning german .
however we also need to promote the german language , in europe especially , as a useful second foreign language .
in many countries english will be the first foreign language people choose to learn , but there are also good economic and practical reasons for learning german which we should promote . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : learning german helps social integration and prosperity of immigrants , says eichinger there are plans to enshrine german as the national language in germany ’ s constitution .
what do you think of this plan ?
the intentions behind the plan are good .
it ’ s about making the point that our language is not just a symbol , but saying that it should be maintained on a practical level as well .
on the other hand , i don ’ t think we have reached a point where we need to decree that it is critical that in germany we should speak german . in that sense it is not necessary to specify the german language in the constitution , which is a fairly general text .
that would imply that german is somehow endangered and that we need to do it to protect the language .
our problem is rather that of integration , given we have so many immigrants for whom german is not their first language . how multilingual is germany ?
germany is comparatively multilingual – but on another level quite monolingual .
the establishment is very much based on the german language .
the educational system is also quite rightly based on the german language .
however there is a large multilingual population in germany , and we have to be practical about this .
the danger is not that , if for example turkish were to become stronger in germany , we would all end up speaking turkish . the issue is really that we need to see this multilingualism as a part of the cultural identity of immigrants , while at the same time to ensure - and this may sound harsh - that they can function effectively in our society .
objectively , we can see with recent generations of immigrants that retreating into their own communities brings social disadvantage .
so we shouldn ’ t stress the importance of integration because otherwise the german language would be endangered , but because we need to give all communities the opportunity to participate fully in society .

do we need a german equivalent to the “ academie francaise ” devoted to regulating , preserving and standardizing our language ?
that would probably be a bit difficult , because german is such a diverse language group .
traditionally , what is correct german has not been centrally determined .
for example , there has just been a dictionary published which describes the differences in the variants of german – what is spoken in austria , switzerland and then high german .
of course we could look at creating an institution concerned with the introduction of foreign words into the language .
but a comprehensive language academy , given the ways in which german changes , would be difficult .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de language -pipe- 24.06.2007 the german language 's role in a changing world großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flying the flag - german is still vital and relevant , says eichinger dw-world spoke with ludwig m. eichinger , director of the institute for the german language , about the place of german in the world today . how european is german ?
german is quite european .
you can see that in our history and in looking at german today .
the idea that german is separate from other european languages only started in the 19th century , following the unification of the german states as one nation .
over the last two years the goethe institute has promoted the “ power of language . ”
what “ power ” does german have today , and what does european integration mean for the german language ?
english has won out as the major international language , that ’ s well established now .
the issue is what worth and power a single language has at this point in time .
german is clearly important and powerful within europe , however german is not used as internationally as english or french .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ludwig m. eichinger in what areas does german play an international role ?
the field of natural sciences has been almost entirely given over to english .
there are a number of traditional fields of study where german has always been strong , and where it still plays a large role , including philosophy and music .
and there are some fields , such as art history , where german has , in recent decades , actually been the primary language .
is the use of german growing ?
german could become a european regional language in the east ; that is a reasonable possibility .
the linguistic connection between germany and its eastern neighbors dates back centuries , and those countries have a strong tradition of learning german .
however we also need to promote the german language , in europe especially , as a useful second foreign language .
in many countries english will be the first foreign language people choose to learn , but there are also good economic and practical reasons for learning german which we should promote . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : learning german helps social integration and prosperity of immigrants , says eichinger there are plans to enshrine german as the national language in germany ’ s constitution .
what do you think of this plan ?
the intentions behind the plan are good .
it ’ s about making the point that our language is not just a symbol , but saying that it should be maintained on a practical level as well .
on the other hand , i don ’ t think we have reached a point where we need to decree that it is critical that in germany we should speak german . in that sense it is not necessary to specify the german language in the constitution , which is a fairly general text .
that would imply that german is somehow endangered and that we need to do it to protect the language .
our problem is rather that of integration , given we have so many immigrants for whom german is not their first language . how multilingual is germany ?
germany is comparatively multilingual – but on another level quite monolingual .
the establishment is very much based on the german language .
the educational system is also quite rightly based on the german language .
however there is a large multilingual population in germany , and we have to be practical about this .
the danger is not that , if for example turkish were to become stronger in germany , we would all end up speaking turkish . the issue is really that we need to see this multilingualism as a part of the cultural identity of immigrants , while at the same time to ensure - and this may sound harsh - that they can function effectively in our society .
objectively , we can see with recent generations of immigrants that retreating into their own communities brings social disadvantage .
so we shouldn ’ t stress the importance of integration because otherwise the german language would be endangered , but because we need to give all communities the opportunity to participate fully in society .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spelling reform has made german a bit easier .
do we need a german equivalent to the “ academie francaise ” devoted to regulating , preserving and standardizing our language ?
that would probably be a bit difficult , because german is such a diverse language group .
traditionally , what is correct german has not been centrally determined .
for example , there has just been a dictionary published which describes the differences in the variants of german – what is spoken in austria , switzerland and then high german .

"
" it would have been better if this summit had failed , " the newspaper said in an editorial , adding that the bitter dispute over poland 's voting rights has shown that there is little hope for unity in the eu .
" that would have prevented the creation of a europe of two speeds and two classes .
the sickening double game played by the polish brothers kaczynski should make it clear to any fan of europe that this is now inevitable . "
continuing rancor relations between poland and germany have never been warm since world war ii and took another beating when warsaw threatened to veto a deal on a new treaty over the voting rights issue .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german papers are not amused with britain and poland before the summit began , the deeply conservative polish president lech kaczynski and his twin prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski evoked poland 's destruction at the hands of nazi germany as a reason why its population , and therefore its voting power , was so low .
in the end , poland won a considerable concession on the voting issue in brussels , persuading the bloc 's other 26 members to delay the full introduction of the new system until 2017 .
" warsaw is on board .
but the treaty should not yet be considered saved , " der tagesspiegel newspaper said .
it warned that the upcoming intergovernmental conference to finalize drafting the treaty and the ratification process present " the next obstacles . "
the berliner morgenpost agreed , saying that " disaster has been averted , for now . "
" it is annoying to see to what extent the nationalistic , egotistical blocking tactics of poland and britain paid off , " it added .
dangerous precedent the newspaper said it feared that a dangerous precedent has been set whereby nations who threaten to block progress within the european union will be given concessions in return for their cooperation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a journalist got a snooze in while waiting for politicians negotiating into the early hours last saturday morning " after a success like the one claimed by poland , there is a danger that this tactic will become common currency . "
welt am sonntag described the haggling that preceded the deal as " torture " and said despite its eventual success the summit will be remembered mostly for britain and poland 's " egotistical " behavior .
it predicted that relations between berlin and warsaw were heading for an " icy spell . "
" poland has failed to understand that the point of the european union is to bury the hatred we inherited , " the newspaper commented . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german is quite european .
you can see that in our history and in looking at german today .
the idea that german is separate from other european languages only started in the 19th century , following the unification of the german states as one nation .
over the last two years the goethe institute has promoted the “ power of language . ”
what “ power ” does german have today , and what does european integration mean for the german language ?
english has won out as the major international language , that ’ s well established now .
the issue is what worth and power a single language has at this point in time .
german is clearly important and powerful within europe , however german is not used as internationally as english or french .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ludwig m. eichinger in what areas does german play an international role ?
the field of natural sciences has been almost entirely given over to english .
there are a number of traditional fields of study where german has always been strong , and where it still plays a large role , including philosophy and music .
and there are some fields , such as art history , where german has , in recent decades , actually been the primary language .
is the use of german growing ?
german could become a european regional language in the east ; that is a reasonable possibility .
the linguistic connection between germany and its eastern neighbors dates back centuries , and those countries have a strong tradition of learning german .
however we also need to promote the german language , in europe especially , as a useful second foreign language .
in many countries english will be the first foreign language people choose to learn , but there are also good economic and practical reasons for learning german which we should promote . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : learning german helps social integration and prosperity of immigrants , says eichinger there are plans to enshrine german as the national language in germany ’ s constitution .
what do you think of this plan ?
the intentions behind the plan are good .
it ’ s about making the point that our language is not just a symbol , but saying that it should be maintained on a practical level as well .
on the other hand , i don ’ t think we have reached a point where we need to decree that it is critical that in germany we should speak german . in that sense it is not necessary to specify the german language in the constitution , which is a fairly general text .
that would imply that german is somehow endangered and that we need to do it to protect the language .
our problem is rather that of integration , given we have so many immigrants for whom german is not their first language . how multilingual is germany ?
germany is comparatively multilingual – but on another level quite monolingual .
the establishment is very much based on the german language .
the educational system is also quite rightly based on the german language .
however there is a large multilingual population in germany , and we have to be practical about this .
the danger is not that , if for example turkish were to become stronger in germany , we would all end up speaking turkish . the issue is really that we need to see this multilingualism as a part of the cultural identity of immigrants , while at the same time to ensure - and this may sound harsh - that they can function effectively in our society .
objectively , we can see with recent generations of immigrants that retreating into their own communities brings social disadvantage .
so we shouldn ’ t stress the importance of integration because otherwise the german language would be endangered , but because we need to give all communities the opportunity to participate fully in society .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spelling reform has made german a bit easier .
do we need a german equivalent to the “ academie francaise ” devoted to regulating , preserving and standardizing our language ?
that would probably be a bit difficult , because german is such a diverse language group .
traditionally , what is correct german has not been centrally determined .
for example , there has just been a dictionary published which describes the differences in the variants of german – what is spoken in austria , switzerland and then high german .
of course we could look at creating an institution concerned with the introduction of foreign words into the language .
but a comprehensive language academy , given the ways in which german changes , would be difficult .

britain 's treasury chief replaced tony blair as leader of the labour party sunday , days before he takes over as british prime minister . gordon brown was confirmed sunday as the new leader of britain 's governing labour party , three days before he succeeds tony blair as prime minister . blair introduced brown as the new " leader of our party , very soon to be leader of our country " at a labour party conference in manchester , northwest england , after the 56-year-old finance minister had been elected unopposed . blair said the party had proved wrong those who suggested there could not be an orderly transition of power before a beaming brown accepted his new role " with humility and pride , " saying : " leadership is an awesome responsibility . " brown takes over from blair , who served as leader since 1994 and restyled labour from an unfashionable left-wing party riven by self-destructive infighting into an electable center-left proposition . long-serving minister the chancellor of the exchequer , a father-of-two from scotland , served continuously in the post during blair 's 10 years in power , making him the longest serving british finance minister without interruption in history . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown has been waiting a long time for this job brown 's election came after two prospective candidates who wanted to stand against him failed to muster enough support from parliamentary colleagues to have their names put on the ballot . he will take over as premier on wednesday .

veterinary experts at the friedrich löffler institute , the government 's top veterinary laboratory , on the island of riems in the north of germany determined that two swans and a wild duck had contracted the h5n1 bird flu strain .
they were the first bird flu cases discovered in germany this year , and the first report of wild birds infected this year within the european union .
tests on the other five animals were continuing .
" i expect that these are infected , as well , " said karin koester , spokeswoman for the office of veterinary medicine in bavaria .

pet owners were warned not to let their dogs or cats roam free in the affected area .

britain 's treasury chief replaced tony blair as leader of the labour party sunday , days before he takes over as british prime minister . gordon brown was confirmed sunday as the new leader of britain 's governing labour party , three days before he succeeds tony blair as prime minister . blair introduced brown as the new " leader of our party , very soon to be leader of our country " at a labour party conference in manchester , northwest england , after the 56-year-old finance minister had been elected unopposed . blair said the party had proved wrong those who suggested there could not be an orderly transition of power before a beaming brown accepted his new role " with humility and pride , " saying : " leadership is an awesome responsibility . " brown takes over from blair , who served as leader since 1994 and restyled labour from an unfashionable left-wing party riven by self-destructive infighting into an electable center-left proposition . long-serving minister the chancellor of the exchequer , a father-of-two from scotland , served continuously in the post during blair 's 10 years in power , making him the longest serving british finance minister without interruption in history . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown has been waiting a long time for this job brown 's election came after two prospective candidates who wanted to stand against him failed to muster enough support from parliamentary colleagues to have their names put on the ballot . he will take over as premier on wednesday .

" " i do not believe politics is about celebrity , " brown has stated in an ill-concealed jibe at the blair years , which were dominated by spin , a relaxed style and close associations with the world of rock , pop and film . dw staff with wire reports -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

britain 's treasury chief replaced tony blair as leader of the labour party sunday , days before he takes over as british prime minister . gordon brown was confirmed sunday as the new leader of britain 's governing labour party , three days before he succeeds tony blair as prime minister . blair introduced brown as the new " leader of our party , very soon to be leader of our country " at a labour party conference in manchester , northwest england , after the 56-year-old finance minister had been elected unopposed . blair said the party had proved wrong those who suggested there could not be an orderly transition of power before a beaming brown accepted his new role " with humility and pride , " saying : " leadership is an awesome responsibility . " brown takes over from blair , who served as leader since 1994 and restyled labour from an unfashionable left-wing party riven by self-destructive infighting into an electable center-left proposition . long-serving minister the chancellor of the exchequer , a father-of-two from scotland , served continuously in the post during blair 's 10 years in power , making him the longest serving british finance minister without interruption in history . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown has been waiting a long time for this job brown 's election came after two prospective candidates who wanted to stand against him failed to muster enough support from parliamentary colleagues to have their names put on the ballot . he will take over as premier on wednesday .

" " i do not believe politics is about celebrity , " brown has stated in an ill-concealed jibe at the blair years , which were dominated by spin , a relaxed style and close associations with the world of rock , pop and film . dw staff with wire reports -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
" it would have been better if this summit had failed , " the newspaper said in an editorial , adding that the bitter dispute over poland 's voting rights has shown that there is little hope for unity in the eu .
" that would have prevented the creation of a europe of two speeds and two classes .
the sickening double game played by the polish brothers kaczynski should make it clear to any fan of europe that this is now inevitable . "
continuing rancor relations between poland and germany have never been warm since world war ii and took another beating when warsaw threatened to veto a deal on a new treaty over the voting rights issue .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german papers are not amused with britain and poland before the summit began , the deeply conservative polish president lech kaczynski and his twin prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski evoked poland 's destruction at the hands of nazi germany as a reason why its population , and therefore its voting power , was so low .
in the end , poland won a considerable concession on the voting issue in brussels , persuading the bloc 's other 26 members to delay the full introduction of the new system until 2017 .
" warsaw is on board .
but the treaty should not yet be considered saved , " der tagesspiegel newspaper said .
it warned that the upcoming intergovernmental conference to finalize drafting the treaty and the ratification process present " the next obstacles . "
the berliner morgenpost agreed , saying that " disaster has been averted , for now . "
" it is annoying to see to what extent the nationalistic , egotistical blocking tactics of poland and britain paid off , " it added .
dangerous precedent the newspaper said it feared that a dangerous precedent has been set whereby nations who threaten to block progress within the european union will be given concessions in return for their cooperation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a journalist got a snooze in while waiting for politicians negotiating into the early hours last saturday morning " after a success like the one claimed by poland , there is a danger that this tactic will become common currency . "
welt am sonntag described the haggling that preceded the deal as " torture " and said despite its eventual success the summit will be remembered mostly for britain and poland 's " egotistical " behavior .
it predicted that relations between berlin and warsaw were heading for an " icy spell . "
" poland has failed to understand that the point of the european union is to bury the hatred we inherited , " the newspaper commented . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german is quite european .
you can see that in our history and in looking at german today .
the idea that german is separate from other european languages only started in the 19th century , following the unification of the german states as one nation .
over the last two years the goethe institute has promoted the “ power of language . ”
what “ power ” does german have today , and what does european integration mean for the german language ?
english has won out as the major international language , that ’ s well established now .
the issue is what worth and power a single language has at this point in time .
german is clearly important and powerful within europe , however german is not used as internationally as english or french .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ludwig m. eichinger in what areas does german play an international role ?
the field of natural sciences has been almost entirely given over to english .
there are a number of traditional fields of study where german has always been strong , and where it still plays a large role , including philosophy and music .
and there are some fields , such as art history , where german has , in recent decades , actually been the primary language .
is the use of german growing ?
german could become a european regional language in the east ; that is a reasonable possibility .
the linguistic connection between germany and its eastern neighbors dates back centuries , and those countries have a strong tradition of learning german .
however we also need to promote the german language , in europe especially , as a useful second foreign language .
in many countries english will be the first foreign language people choose to learn , but there are also good economic and practical reasons for learning german which we should promote . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : learning german helps social integration and prosperity of immigrants , says eichinger there are plans to enshrine german as the national language in germany ’ s constitution .
what do you think of this plan ?
the intentions behind the plan are good .
it ’ s about making the point that our language is not just a symbol , but saying that it should be maintained on a practical level as well .
on the other hand , i don ’ t think we have reached a point where we need to decree that it is critical that in germany we should speak german . in that sense it is not necessary to specify the german language in the constitution , which is a fairly general text .
that would imply that german is somehow endangered and that we need to do it to protect the language .
our problem is rather that of integration , given we have so many immigrants for whom german is not their first language . how multilingual is germany ?
germany is comparatively multilingual – but on another level quite monolingual .
the establishment is very much based on the german language .
the educational system is also quite rightly based on the german language .
however there is a large multilingual population in germany , and we have to be practical about this .
the danger is not that , if for example turkish were to become stronger in germany , we would all end up speaking turkish . the issue is really that we need to see this multilingualism as a part of the cultural identity of immigrants , while at the same time to ensure - and this may sound harsh - that they can function effectively in our society .
objectively , we can see with recent generations of immigrants that retreating into their own communities brings social disadvantage .
so we shouldn ’ t stress the importance of integration because otherwise the german language would be endangered , but because we need to give all communities the opportunity to participate fully in society .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spelling reform has made german a bit easier .
do we need a german equivalent to the “ academie francaise ” devoted to regulating , preserving and standardizing our language ?
that would probably be a bit difficult , because german is such a diverse language group .
traditionally , what is correct german has not been centrally determined .
for example , there has just been a dictionary published which describes the differences in the variants of german – what is spoken in austria , switzerland and then high german .
of course we could look at creating an institution concerned with the introduction of foreign words into the language .
but a comprehensive language academy , given the ways in which german changes , would be difficult .

what 's your secret ? dirk grabow : it would probably be better to let others answer that question since it might sound self-aggrandizing , if i do .
but i think our success is down to the people involved with the club around the time of reunification .
the team could have fallen apart around 1990 .

that was hugely important .

dw-world.de spoke to hansa rostock president dirk grabow about his strategy for solving the problems that come with success . dw-world.de : having spent 11 seasons in the bundesliga 's first division since 1991 , rostock have been the most successful club from the former east germany in reunified germany .
what 's your secret ? dirk grabow : it would probably be better to let others answer that question since it might sound self-aggrandizing , if i do .
but i think our success is down to the people involved with the club around the time of reunification .
the team could have fallen apart around 1990 .
instead , we won the double in 1990-91 and qualified for the first division of the unified bundesliga .
that was hugely important .
we did n't disappear into a sinkhole .
instead we laid the foundations for 16 years of successful soccer . last year in the second division , it took until the final day of play for you to secure promotion .
what put you over the top ? i think our big plus was our togetherness as a team , and by that i do n't just mean the starting eleven , but the entire roster .
it was our great strength . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dirk grabow took over rostock 's presidency after their last relegation promotion has advantages and disadvantages .
two members of last season 's starting eleven , goalkeeper matthias schober and defender geldson , have gone elsewhere .
but you also have money to invest .
what 's your strategy ? first of all it 's completely normal that bigger clubs get interested in players who perform well at smaller ones .
that happens not just to us , but to other established clubs .
there can always be a bigger club looking to lure your players away .
our task now is to find replacement players who can not only maintain but improve our level of play .
we have to build a squad for the coming season that will be capable of staying up .
that 's our main priority at the moment . are you looking to acquire new players across the board or just at specific positions ? we have to focus on the positions where players have left .
that would first be in goal , and there we 've signed stefan wächter -lrb- former hamburg keeper -rrb- .
we also need reinforcements in our interior defense , and we already have one insofar as we exercised our purchase option on diego morais -lrb- who was previously on loan -rrb- .
he 'll be with us for the coming season , but there will surely be a couple of new players as well .
those are the main areas we 're working on . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hansa rostock fans are already gearing up for next season in 2004-05 rostock went down .
what have you learned from that season that could help you avoid relegation in the coming one ? the main thing is to have a squad like the one we had last season that sticks together as a team .
soccer is a team sport .
in the end , it 's the team - and not the sum of the best individual players - that decides whether you have success or not .
you ca n't necessarily plan success .
what you can plan is general performance .
you can develop performance , and we 'll be working every day to raise the level at which the team performs .
if we do that , success will follow . how important will players from rostock 's own amateur ranks be ? a number of years ago , we built a new youth training facility and a dormitory for our soccer academy .
we 're always trying to develop young players and integrate them into our professional team .
that 's the main task of our youth work , and it 's worked impressively in the past two seasons .
several players have made their way up and established themselves as regular members of the professional team .
and that 's a strategy we 'll continue to focus on in the future . and will rostock stay up ?

he is furious about his government ’ s plans to install a gigantic radar station as part of a controversial us missile defense system in central europe . “ we will fight , fight and fight it .
we will address our czech leaders , the parliament and so on .
and we have already written to the us congress and 92 broadcasting outlets in the entire world , ” said neoral at a press conference of the european parliament in brussels . “ our government has not reacted .
they are not of one mind with us .
the czech government doesn ’ t communicate with us , and when they do , it ’ s only through the media , ” he said . the main concern of neoral and other inhabitants is health , and the dangerous effects of radiation on soft tissue , especially the eyes . “ we read on american internet websites that the radiation emitted has a reach of up to 36 kilometers -lrb- 22 miles -rrb- , ” added neoral , who said that trokavec lies almost that distance from pilsen , the planned site of the installations .
the german border is roughly 100 kilometers to the west . demonstrations in prague have shown that many , if not most czechs are opposed to the us missile defense shield , but president vaclav klaus and prime minister mirek topolanek favor installing part of the system on czech soil . jan neoral is making strong waves for his position , which have already impressed various eu parliamentarians . “ i am waiting for the eu to say : this makes no sense .

they are germany 's first confirmed cases this year . at least three water birds found dead in the bavarian city of nuremberg were infected with a strain of bird flu that can be lethal to humans , health officials said sunday .
local authorities established a four-kilometer exclusion zone around two lakes where eight wild swans , geese and ducks died in the past six days .
veterinary experts at the friedrich löffler institute , the government 's top veterinary laboratory , on the island of riems in the north of germany determined that two swans and a wild duck had contracted the h5n1 bird flu strain .
they were the first bird flu cases discovered in germany this year , and the first report of wild birds infected this year within the european union .
tests on the other five animals were continuing .
" i expect that these are infected , as well , " said karin koester , spokeswoman for the office of veterinary medicine in bavaria .
in the meantime , officials ordered that all poultry farmers in the exclusion zone keep their animals indoors .
pet owners were warned not to let their dogs or cats roam free in the affected area .

britain 's treasury chief replaced tony blair as leader of the labour party sunday , days before he takes over as british prime minister . gordon brown was confirmed sunday as the new leader of britain 's governing labour party , three days before he succeeds tony blair as prime minister . blair introduced brown as the new " leader of our party , very soon to be leader of our country " at a labour party conference in manchester , northwest england , after the 56-year-old finance minister had been elected unopposed . blair said the party had proved wrong those who suggested there could not be an orderly transition of power before a beaming brown accepted his new role " with humility and pride , " saying : " leadership is an awesome responsibility . " brown takes over from blair , who served as leader since 1994 and restyled labour from an unfashionable left-wing party riven by self-destructive infighting into an electable center-left proposition . long-serving minister the chancellor of the exchequer , a father-of-two from scotland , served continuously in the post during blair 's 10 years in power , making him the longest serving british finance minister without interruption in history . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown has been waiting a long time for this job brown 's election came after two prospective candidates who wanted to stand against him failed to muster enough support from parliamentary colleagues to have their names put on the ballot . he will take over as premier on wednesday .
in britain , the head of the largest party in parliament becomes prime minister .
governing parties can change leader mid-term without a general election having to be called . the announcement at the bridgewater hall in manchester was met with thunderous applause from delegates packed into the concert venue . more serious style brown , whose media image is of an unsmiling serious-minded minister , beamed as the result was announced with his wife sarah looking on . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : their styles are different in a move to distance himself from the cosy " sofa politics " associated with blair 's " inner circle " government , brown has pledged to bring in outsiders and rule with a government " of all the talents . " " i do not believe politics is about celebrity , " brown has stated in an ill-concealed jibe at the blair years , which were dominated by spin , a relaxed style and close associations with the world of rock , pop and film . dw staff with wire reports -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german is quite european .
you can see that in our history and in looking at german today .
the idea that german is separate from other european languages only started in the 19th century , following the unification of the german states as one nation .
over the last two years the goethe institute has promoted the “ power of language . ”
what “ power ” does german have today , and what does european integration mean for the german language ?
english has won out as the major international language , that ’ s well established now .
the issue is what worth and power a single language has at this point in time .
german is clearly important and powerful within europe , however german is not used as internationally as english or french .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ludwig m. eichinger in what areas does german play an international role ?
the field of natural sciences has been almost entirely given over to english .
there are a number of traditional fields of study where german has always been strong , and where it still plays a large role , including philosophy and music .
and there are some fields , such as art history , where german has , in recent decades , actually been the primary language .
is the use of german growing ?
german could become a european regional language in the east ; that is a reasonable possibility .
the linguistic connection between germany and its eastern neighbors dates back centuries , and those countries have a strong tradition of learning german .
however we also need to promote the german language , in europe especially , as a useful second foreign language .
in many countries english will be the first foreign language people choose to learn , but there are also good economic and practical reasons for learning german which we should promote . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : learning german helps social integration and prosperity of immigrants , says eichinger there are plans to enshrine german as the national language in germany ’ s constitution .
what do you think of this plan ?
the intentions behind the plan are good .
it ’ s about making the point that our language is not just a symbol , but saying that it should be maintained on a practical level as well .
on the other hand , i don ’ t think we have reached a point where we need to decree that it is critical that in germany we should speak german . in that sense it is not necessary to specify the german language in the constitution , which is a fairly general text .
that would imply that german is somehow endangered and that we need to do it to protect the language .
our problem is rather that of integration , given we have so many immigrants for whom german is not their first language . how multilingual is germany ?
germany is comparatively multilingual – but on another level quite monolingual .
the establishment is very much based on the german language .
the educational system is also quite rightly based on the german language .
however there is a large multilingual population in germany , and we have to be practical about this .
the danger is not that , if for example turkish were to become stronger in germany , we would all end up speaking turkish . the issue is really that we need to see this multilingualism as a part of the cultural identity of immigrants , while at the same time to ensure - and this may sound harsh - that they can function effectively in our society .
objectively , we can see with recent generations of immigrants that retreating into their own communities brings social disadvantage .
so we shouldn ’ t stress the importance of integration because otherwise the german language would be endangered , but because we need to give all communities the opportunity to participate fully in society .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spelling reform has made german a bit easier .
do we need a german equivalent to the “ academie francaise ” devoted to regulating , preserving and standardizing our language ?
that would probably be a bit difficult , because german is such a diverse language group .
traditionally , what is correct german has not been centrally determined .
for example , there has just been a dictionary published which describes the differences in the variants of german – what is spoken in austria , switzerland and then high german .
of course we could look at creating an institution concerned with the introduction of foreign words into the language .
but a comprehensive language academy , given the ways in which german changes , would be difficult .

german is quite european .
you can see that in our history and in looking at german today .
the idea that german is separate from other european languages only started in the 19th century , following the unification of the german states as one nation .
over the last two years the goethe institute has promoted the “ power of language . ”
what “ power ” does german have today , and what does european integration mean for the german language ?
english has won out as the major international language , that ’ s well established now .
the issue is what worth and power a single language has at this point in time .
german is clearly important and powerful within europe , however german is not used as internationally as english or french .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ludwig m. eichinger in what areas does german play an international role ?
the field of natural sciences has been almost entirely given over to english .
there are a number of traditional fields of study where german has always been strong , and where it still plays a large role , including philosophy and music .
and there are some fields , such as art history , where german has , in recent decades , actually been the primary language .
is the use of german growing ?
german could become a european regional language in the east ; that is a reasonable possibility .
the linguistic connection between germany and its eastern neighbors dates back centuries , and those countries have a strong tradition of learning german .
however we also need to promote the german language , in europe especially , as a useful second foreign language .
in many countries english will be the first foreign language people choose to learn , but there are also good economic and practical reasons for learning german which we should promote . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : learning german helps social integration and prosperity of immigrants , says eichinger there are plans to enshrine german as the national language in germany ’ s constitution .
what do you think of this plan ?
the intentions behind the plan are good .
it ’ s about making the point that our language is not just a symbol , but saying that it should be maintained on a practical level as well .
on the other hand , i don ’ t think we have reached a point where we need to decree that it is critical that in germany we should speak german . in that sense it is not necessary to specify the german language in the constitution , which is a fairly general text .
that would imply that german is somehow endangered and that we need to do it to protect the language .
our problem is rather that of integration , given we have so many immigrants for whom german is not their first language . how multilingual is germany ?
germany is comparatively multilingual – but on another level quite monolingual .
the establishment is very much based on the german language .
the educational system is also quite rightly based on the german language .
however there is a large multilingual population in germany , and we have to be practical about this .
the danger is not that , if for example turkish were to become stronger in germany , we would all end up speaking turkish . the issue is really that we need to see this multilingualism as a part of the cultural identity of immigrants , while at the same time to ensure - and this may sound harsh - that they can function effectively in our society .
objectively , we can see with recent generations of immigrants that retreating into their own communities brings social disadvantage .
so we shouldn ’ t stress the importance of integration because otherwise the german language would be endangered , but because we need to give all communities the opportunity to participate fully in society .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spelling reform has made german a bit easier .
do we need a german equivalent to the “ academie francaise ” devoted to regulating , preserving and standardizing our language ?
that would probably be a bit difficult , because german is such a diverse language group .
traditionally , what is correct german has not been centrally determined .
for example , there has just been a dictionary published which describes the differences in the variants of german – what is spoken in austria , switzerland and then high german .
of course we could look at creating an institution concerned with the introduction of foreign words into the language .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de language -pipe- 24.06.2007 the german language 's role in a changing world großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flying the flag - german is still vital and relevant , says eichinger dw-world spoke with ludwig m. eichinger , director of the institute for the german language , about the place of german in the world today . how european is german ?
german is quite european .
you can see that in our history and in looking at german today .
the idea that german is separate from other european languages only started in the 19th century , following the unification of the german states as one nation .
over the last two years the goethe institute has promoted the “ power of language . ”
what “ power ” does german have today , and what does european integration mean for the german language ?
english has won out as the major international language , that ’ s well established now .
the issue is what worth and power a single language has at this point in time .
german is clearly important and powerful within europe , however german is not used as internationally as english or french .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ludwig m. eichinger in what areas does german play an international role ?
the field of natural sciences has been almost entirely given over to english .
there are a number of traditional fields of study where german has always been strong , and where it still plays a large role , including philosophy and music .
and there are some fields , such as art history , where german has , in recent decades , actually been the primary language .
is the use of german growing ?
german could become a european regional language in the east ; that is a reasonable possibility .
the linguistic connection between germany and its eastern neighbors dates back centuries , and those countries have a strong tradition of learning german .
however we also need to promote the german language , in europe especially , as a useful second foreign language .
in many countries english will be the first foreign language people choose to learn , but there are also good economic and practical reasons for learning german which we should promote . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : learning german helps social integration and prosperity of immigrants , says eichinger there are plans to enshrine german as the national language in germany ’ s constitution .
what do you think of this plan ?
the intentions behind the plan are good .
it ’ s about making the point that our language is not just a symbol , but saying that it should be maintained on a practical level as well .
on the other hand , i don ’ t think we have reached a point where we need to decree that it is critical that in germany we should speak german . in that sense it is not necessary to specify the german language in the constitution , which is a fairly general text .
that would imply that german is somehow endangered and that we need to do it to protect the language .
our problem is rather that of integration , given we have so many immigrants for whom german is not their first language . how multilingual is germany ?
germany is comparatively multilingual – but on another level quite monolingual .
the establishment is very much based on the german language .
the educational system is also quite rightly based on the german language .
however there is a large multilingual population in germany , and we have to be practical about this .
the danger is not that , if for example turkish were to become stronger in germany , we would all end up speaking turkish . the issue is really that we need to see this multilingualism as a part of the cultural identity of immigrants , while at the same time to ensure - and this may sound harsh - that they can function effectively in our society .
objectively , we can see with recent generations of immigrants that retreating into their own communities brings social disadvantage .
so we shouldn ’ t stress the importance of integration because otherwise the german language would be endangered , but because we need to give all communities the opportunity to participate fully in society .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spelling reform has made german a bit easier .
do we need a german equivalent to the “ academie francaise ” devoted to regulating , preserving and standardizing our language ?
that would probably be a bit difficult , because german is such a diverse language group .
traditionally , what is correct german has not been centrally determined .
for example , there has just been a dictionary published which describes the differences in the variants of german – what is spoken in austria , switzerland and then high german .
of course we could look at creating an institution concerned with the introduction of foreign words into the language .
but a comprehensive language academy , given the ways in which german changes , would be difficult .

german is quite european .
you can see that in our history and in looking at german today .
the idea that german is separate from other european languages only started in the 19th century , following the unification of the german states as one nation .
over the last two years the goethe institute has promoted the “ power of language . ”
what “ power ” does german have today , and what does european integration mean for the german language ?
english has won out as the major international language , that ’ s well established now .
the issue is what worth and power a single language has at this point in time .
german is clearly important and powerful within europe , however german is not used as internationally as english or french .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ludwig m. eichinger in what areas does german play an international role ?
the field of natural sciences has been almost entirely given over to english .
there are a number of traditional fields of study where german has always been strong , and where it still plays a large role , including philosophy and music .
and there are some fields , such as art history , where german has , in recent decades , actually been the primary language .
is the use of german growing ?
german could become a european regional language in the east ; that is a reasonable possibility .
the linguistic connection between germany and its eastern neighbors dates back centuries , and those countries have a strong tradition of learning german .
however we also need to promote the german language , in europe especially , as a useful second foreign language .
in many countries english will be the first foreign language people choose to learn , but there are also good economic and practical reasons for learning german which we should promote . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : learning german helps social integration and prosperity of immigrants , says eichinger there are plans to enshrine german as the national language in germany ’ s constitution .
what do you think of this plan ?
the intentions behind the plan are good .
it ’ s about making the point that our language is not just a symbol , but saying that it should be maintained on a practical level as well .
on the other hand , i don ’ t think we have reached a point where we need to decree that it is critical that in germany we should speak german . in that sense it is not necessary to specify the german language in the constitution , which is a fairly general text .
that would imply that german is somehow endangered and that we need to do it to protect the language .
our problem is rather that of integration , given we have so many immigrants for whom german is not their first language . how multilingual is germany ?
germany is comparatively multilingual – but on another level quite monolingual .
the establishment is very much based on the german language .
the educational system is also quite rightly based on the german language .
however there is a large multilingual population in germany , and we have to be practical about this .
the danger is not that , if for example turkish were to become stronger in germany , we would all end up speaking turkish . the issue is really that we need to see this multilingualism as a part of the cultural identity of immigrants , while at the same time to ensure - and this may sound harsh - that they can function effectively in our society .
objectively , we can see with recent generations of immigrants that retreating into their own communities brings social disadvantage .
so we shouldn ’ t stress the importance of integration because otherwise the german language would be endangered , but because we need to give all communities the opportunity to participate fully in society .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spelling reform has made german a bit easier .
do we need a german equivalent to the “ academie francaise ” devoted to regulating , preserving and standardizing our language ?
that would probably be a bit difficult , because german is such a diverse language group .
traditionally , what is correct german has not been centrally determined .
for example , there has just been a dictionary published which describes the differences in the variants of german – what is spoken in austria , switzerland and then high german .
of course we could look at creating an institution concerned with the introduction of foreign words into the language .
but a comprehensive language academy , given the ways in which german changes , would be difficult .

dw-world.de spoke to hansa rostock president dirk grabow about his strategy for solving the problems that come with success . dw-world.de : having spent 11 seasons in the bundesliga 's first division since 1991 , rostock have been the most successful club from the former east germany in reunified germany .
what 's your secret ? dirk grabow : it would probably be better to let others answer that question since it might sound self-aggrandizing , if i do .
but i think our success is down to the people involved with the club around the time of reunification .
the team could have fallen apart around 1990 .
instead , we won the double in 1990-91 and qualified for the first division of the unified bundesliga .
that was hugely important .
we did n't disappear into a sinkhole .
instead we laid the foundations for 16 years of successful soccer . last year in the second division , it took until the final day of play for you to secure promotion .
what put you over the top ? i think our big plus was our togetherness as a team , and by that i do n't just mean the starting eleven , but the entire roster .
it was our great strength . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dirk grabow took over rostock 's presidency after their last relegation promotion has advantages and disadvantages .
two members of last season 's starting eleven , goalkeeper matthias schober and defender geldson , have gone elsewhere .
but you also have money to invest .
what 's your strategy ? first of all it 's completely normal that bigger clubs get interested in players who perform well at smaller ones .
that happens not just to us , but to other established clubs .
there can always be a bigger club looking to lure your players away .
our task now is to find replacement players who can not only maintain but improve our level of play .
we have to build a squad for the coming season that will be capable of staying up .
that 's our main priority at the moment . are you looking to acquire new players across the board or just at specific positions ? we have to focus on the positions where players have left .
that would first be in goal , and there we 've signed stefan wächter -lrb- former hamburg keeper -rrb- .
we also need reinforcements in our interior defense , and we already have one insofar as we exercised our purchase option on diego morais -lrb- who was previously on loan -rrb- .
he 'll be with us for the coming season , but there will surely be a couple of new players as well .
those are the main areas we 're working on . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hansa rostock fans are already gearing up for next season in 2004-05 rostock went down .
what have you learned from that season that could help you avoid relegation in the coming one ? the main thing is to have a squad like the one we had last season that sticks together as a team .
soccer is a team sport .
in the end , it 's the team - and not the sum of the best individual players - that decides whether you have success or not .
you ca n't necessarily plan success .
what you can plan is general performance .
you can develop performance , and we 'll be working every day to raise the level at which the team performs .
if we do that , success will follow . how important will players from rostock 's own amateur ranks be ? a number of years ago , we built a new youth training facility and a dormitory for our soccer academy .
we 're always trying to develop young players and integrate them into our professional team .
that 's the main task of our youth work , and it 's worked impressively in the past two seasons .
several players have made their way up and established themselves as regular members of the professional team .
and that 's a strategy we 'll continue to focus on in the future . and will rostock stay up ?

dw-world.de spoke to hansa rostock president dirk grabow about his strategy for solving the problems that come with success . dw-world.de : having spent 11 seasons in the bundesliga 's first division since 1991 , rostock have been the most successful club from the former east germany in reunified germany .
what 's your secret ? dirk grabow : it would probably be better to let others answer that question since it might sound self-aggrandizing , if i do .
but i think our success is down to the people involved with the club around the time of reunification .
the team could have fallen apart around 1990 .
instead , we won the double in 1990-91 and qualified for the first division of the unified bundesliga .
that was hugely important .
we did n't disappear into a sinkhole .
instead we laid the foundations for 16 years of successful soccer . last year in the second division , it took until the final day of play for you to secure promotion .
what put you over the top ? i think our big plus was our togetherness as a team , and by that i do n't just mean the starting eleven , but the entire roster .
it was our great strength . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dirk grabow took over rostock 's presidency after their last relegation promotion has advantages and disadvantages .
two members of last season 's starting eleven , goalkeeper matthias schober and defender geldson , have gone elsewhere .
but you also have money to invest .
what 's your strategy ? first of all it 's completely normal that bigger clubs get interested in players who perform well at smaller ones .
that happens not just to us , but to other established clubs .
there can always be a bigger club looking to lure your players away .
our task now is to find replacement players who can not only maintain but improve our level of play .
we have to build a squad for the coming season that will be capable of staying up .
that 's our main priority at the moment . are you looking to acquire new players across the board or just at specific positions ? we have to focus on the positions where players have left .
that would first be in goal , and there we 've signed stefan wächter -lrb- former hamburg keeper -rrb- .
we also need reinforcements in our interior defense , and we already have one insofar as we exercised our purchase option on diego morais -lrb- who was previously on loan -rrb- .
he 'll be with us for the coming season , but there will surely be a couple of new players as well .
those are the main areas we 're working on . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hansa rostock fans are already gearing up for next season in 2004-05 rostock went down .
what have you learned from that season that could help you avoid relegation in the coming one ? the main thing is to have a squad like the one we had last season that sticks together as a team .
soccer is a team sport .
in the end , it 's the team - and not the sum of the best individual players - that decides whether you have success or not .
you ca n't necessarily plan success .
what you can plan is general performance .
you can develop performance , and we 'll be working every day to raise the level at which the team performs .
if we do that , success will follow . how important will players from rostock 's own amateur ranks be ? a number of years ago , we built a new youth training facility and a dormitory for our soccer academy .
we 're always trying to develop young players and integrate them into our professional team .
that 's the main task of our youth work , and it 's worked impressively in the past two seasons .
several players have made their way up and established themselves as regular members of the professional team .
and that 's a strategy we 'll continue to focus on in the future . and will rostock stay up ?
do you dream of emulating nuremberg 's surprise success last season and earning a spot in europe ? no -lrb- laughs -rrb- .
our primary goal has to be staying in the first division .
but i 'm convinced we 'll achieve it . jefferson chase interviewed dirk grabow send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-world.de spoke to hansa rostock president dirk grabow about his strategy for solving the problems that come with success . dw-world.de : having spent 11 seasons in the bundesliga 's first division since 1991 , rostock have been the most successful club from the former east germany in reunified germany .
what 's your secret ? dirk grabow : it would probably be better to let others answer that question since it might sound self-aggrandizing , if i do .
but i think our success is down to the people involved with the club around the time of reunification .
the team could have fallen apart around 1990 .
instead , we won the double in 1990-91 and qualified for the first division of the unified bundesliga .
that was hugely important .
we did n't disappear into a sinkhole .
instead we laid the foundations for 16 years of successful soccer . last year in the second division , it took until the final day of play for you to secure promotion .
what put you over the top ? i think our big plus was our togetherness as a team , and by that i do n't just mean the starting eleven , but the entire roster .
it was our great strength . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dirk grabow took over rostock 's presidency after their last relegation promotion has advantages and disadvantages .
two members of last season 's starting eleven , goalkeeper matthias schober and defender geldson , have gone elsewhere .
but you also have money to invest .
what 's your strategy ? first of all it 's completely normal that bigger clubs get interested in players who perform well at smaller ones .
that happens not just to us , but to other established clubs .
there can always be a bigger club looking to lure your players away .
our task now is to find replacement players who can not only maintain but improve our level of play .
we have to build a squad for the coming season that will be capable of staying up .
that 's our main priority at the moment . are you looking to acquire new players across the board or just at specific positions ? we have to focus on the positions where players have left .
that would first be in goal , and there we 've signed stefan wächter -lrb- former hamburg keeper -rrb- .
we also need reinforcements in our interior defense , and we already have one insofar as we exercised our purchase option on diego morais -lrb- who was previously on loan -rrb- .
he 'll be with us for the coming season , but there will surely be a couple of new players as well .
those are the main areas we 're working on . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hansa rostock fans are already gearing up for next season in 2004-05 rostock went down .
what have you learned from that season that could help you avoid relegation in the coming one ? the main thing is to have a squad like the one we had last season that sticks together as a team .
soccer is a team sport .
in the end , it 's the team - and not the sum of the best individual players - that decides whether you have success or not .
you ca n't necessarily plan success .
what you can plan is general performance .
you can develop performance , and we 'll be working every day to raise the level at which the team performs .
if we do that , success will follow . how important will players from rostock 's own amateur ranks be ? a number of years ago , we built a new youth training facility and a dormitory for our soccer academy .
we 're always trying to develop young players and integrate them into our professional team .
that 's the main task of our youth work , and it 's worked impressively in the past two seasons .
several players have made their way up and established themselves as regular members of the professional team .
and that 's a strategy we 'll continue to focus on in the future . and will rostock stay up ?

dw-world.de spoke to hansa rostock president dirk grabow about his strategy for solving the problems that come with success . dw-world.de : having spent 11 seasons in the bundesliga 's first division since 1991 , rostock have been the most successful club from the former east germany in reunified germany .
what 's your secret ? dirk grabow : it would probably be better to let others answer that question since it might sound self-aggrandizing , if i do .
but i think our success is down to the people involved with the club around the time of reunification .
the team could have fallen apart around 1990 .
instead , we won the double in 1990-91 and qualified for the first division of the unified bundesliga .
that was hugely important .
we did n't disappear into a sinkhole .
instead we laid the foundations for 16 years of successful soccer . last year in the second division , it took until the final day of play for you to secure promotion .
what put you over the top ? i think our big plus was our togetherness as a team , and by that i do n't just mean the starting eleven , but the entire roster .
it was our great strength . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dirk grabow took over rostock 's presidency after their last relegation promotion has advantages and disadvantages .
two members of last season 's starting eleven , goalkeeper matthias schober and defender geldson , have gone elsewhere .
but you also have money to invest .
what 's your strategy ? first of all it 's completely normal that bigger clubs get interested in players who perform well at smaller ones .
that happens not just to us , but to other established clubs .
there can always be a bigger club looking to lure your players away .
our task now is to find replacement players who can not only maintain but improve our level of play .
we have to build a squad for the coming season that will be capable of staying up .
that 's our main priority at the moment . are you looking to acquire new players across the board or just at specific positions ? we have to focus on the positions where players have left .
that would first be in goal , and there we 've signed stefan wächter -lrb- former hamburg keeper -rrb- .
we also need reinforcements in our interior defense , and we already have one insofar as we exercised our purchase option on diego morais -lrb- who was previously on loan -rrb- .

those are the main areas we 're working on . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hansa rostock fans are already gearing up for next season in 2004-05 rostock went down .
what have you learned from that season that could help you avoid relegation in the coming one ? the main thing is to have a squad like the one we had last season that sticks together as a team .
soccer is a team sport .
in the end , it 's the team - and not the sum of the best individual players - that decides whether you have success or not .
you ca n't necessarily plan success .
what you can plan is general performance .
you can develop performance , and we 'll be working every day to raise the level at which the team performs .
if we do that , success will follow . how important will players from rostock 's own amateur ranks be ? a number of years ago , we built a new youth training facility and a dormitory for our soccer academy .
we 're always trying to develop young players and integrate them into our professional team .
that 's the main task of our youth work , and it 's worked impressively in the past two seasons .
several players have made their way up and established themselves as regular members of the professional team .

dw-world.de spoke to hansa rostock president dirk grabow about his strategy for solving the problems that come with success . dw-world.de : having spent 11 seasons in the bundesliga 's first division since 1991 , rostock have been the most successful club from the former east germany in reunified germany .
what 's your secret ? dirk grabow : it would probably be better to let others answer that question since it might sound self-aggrandizing , if i do .
but i think our success is down to the people involved with the club around the time of reunification .
the team could have fallen apart around 1990 .
instead , we won the double in 1990-91 and qualified for the first division of the unified bundesliga .
that was hugely important .
we did n't disappear into a sinkhole .
instead we laid the foundations for 16 years of successful soccer . last year in the second division , it took until the final day of play for you to secure promotion .
what put you over the top ? i think our big plus was our togetherness as a team , and by that i do n't just mean the starting eleven , but the entire roster .
it was our great strength . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dirk grabow took over rostock 's presidency after their last relegation promotion has advantages and disadvantages .
two members of last season 's starting eleven , goalkeeper matthias schober and defender geldson , have gone elsewhere .
but you also have money to invest .
what 's your strategy ? first of all it 's completely normal that bigger clubs get interested in players who perform well at smaller ones .
that happens not just to us , but to other established clubs .
there can always be a bigger club looking to lure your players away .
our task now is to find replacement players who can not only maintain but improve our level of play .
we have to build a squad for the coming season that will be capable of staying up .
that 's our main priority at the moment . are you looking to acquire new players across the board or just at specific positions ? we have to focus on the positions where players have left .
that would first be in goal , and there we 've signed stefan wächter -lrb- former hamburg keeper -rrb- .
we also need reinforcements in our interior defense , and we already have one insofar as we exercised our purchase option on diego morais -lrb- who was previously on loan -rrb- .

those are the main areas we 're working on . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hansa rostock fans are already gearing up for next season in 2004-05 rostock went down .
what have you learned from that season that could help you avoid relegation in the coming one ? the main thing is to have a squad like the one we had last season that sticks together as a team .
soccer is a team sport .
in the end , it 's the team - and not the sum of the best individual players - that decides whether you have success or not .
you ca n't necessarily plan success .
what you can plan is general performance .
you can develop performance , and we 'll be working every day to raise the level at which the team performs .
if we do that , success will follow . how important will players from rostock 's own amateur ranks be ? a number of years ago , we built a new youth training facility and a dormitory for our soccer academy .
we 're always trying to develop young players and integrate them into our professional team .
that 's the main task of our youth work , and it 's worked impressively in the past two seasons .
several players have made their way up and established themselves as regular members of the professional team .

dw-world.de spoke to hansa rostock president dirk grabow about his strategy for solving the problems that come with success . dw-world.de : having spent 11 seasons in the bundesliga 's first division since 1991 , rostock have been the most successful club from the former east germany in reunified germany .
what 's your secret ? dirk grabow : it would probably be better to let others answer that question since it might sound self-aggrandizing , if i do .
but i think our success is down to the people involved with the club around the time of reunification .
the team could have fallen apart around 1990 .
instead , we won the double in 1990-91 and qualified for the first division of the unified bundesliga .
that was hugely important .
we did n't disappear into a sinkhole .
instead we laid the foundations for 16 years of successful soccer . last year in the second division , it took until the final day of play for you to secure promotion .
what put you over the top ? i think our big plus was our togetherness as a team , and by that i do n't just mean the starting eleven , but the entire roster .
it was our great strength . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dirk grabow took over rostock 's presidency after their last relegation promotion has advantages and disadvantages .
two members of last season 's starting eleven , goalkeeper matthias schober and defender geldson , have gone elsewhere .
but you also have money to invest .
what 's your strategy ? first of all it 's completely normal that bigger clubs get interested in players who perform well at smaller ones .
that happens not just to us , but to other established clubs .
there can always be a bigger club looking to lure your players away .
our task now is to find replacement players who can not only maintain but improve our level of play .
we have to build a squad for the coming season that will be capable of staying up .
that 's our main priority at the moment . are you looking to acquire new players across the board or just at specific positions ? we have to focus on the positions where players have left .
that would first be in goal , and there we 've signed stefan wächter -lrb- former hamburg keeper -rrb- .
we also need reinforcements in our interior defense , and we already have one insofar as we exercised our purchase option on diego morais -lrb- who was previously on loan -rrb- .
he 'll be with us for the coming season , but there will surely be a couple of new players as well .
those are the main areas we 're working on . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hansa rostock fans are already gearing up for next season in 2004-05 rostock went down .
what have you learned from that season that could help you avoid relegation in the coming one ? the main thing is to have a squad like the one we had last season that sticks together as a team .
soccer is a team sport .
in the end , it 's the team - and not the sum of the best individual players - that decides whether you have success or not .
you ca n't necessarily plan success .
what you can plan is general performance .
you can develop performance , and we 'll be working every day to raise the level at which the team performs .
if we do that , success will follow . how important will players from rostock 's own amateur ranks be ? a number of years ago , we built a new youth training facility and a dormitory for our soccer academy .
we 're always trying to develop young players and integrate them into our professional team .
that 's the main task of our youth work , and it 's worked impressively in the past two seasons .
several players have made their way up and established themselves as regular members of the professional team .
and that 's a strategy we 'll continue to focus on in the future . and will rostock stay up ?
do you dream of emulating nuremberg 's surprise success last season and earning a spot in europe ? no -lrb- laughs -rrb- .

german morticians plan a tv channel whose focus is on dying . reports on centuries-old rituals around death , obituaries made by surviving friends and family members or information on german funeral bureaucracy are what viewers can expect who tune in to the television station planned by the country 's association of funeral directors . " we want the channel to help remove the taboos around the subject of death , " said kerstin gernig , a spokesperson for the association . the channel , which is scheduled to begin broadcasting on satellite and on the internet in november , is aimed at germany 's expanding elderly population .
demographic changes in the country mean that the number of people over 60 is growing much more quickly than younger groups . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : information about funerals will be on offer but among this senior group , death is still a subject largely suppressed or ignored until it happens .
then , survivors are often at a loss over what to do with their feelings , or how to navigate the practical matters around funerals and estates . " we do n't want to proselytize , " said gernig .
" we want to provide information so people know everything that is involved . " the channel will be funded partly by obituaries that can be commissioned or produced by loved ones for the deceased , partly by partnerships the station hopes to establish with companies which produce products and services for older people , or facilities like nursing homes .
the station does not plan on featuring conventional advertisements . to be produced in cooperation with brandenburg-based eostv , planners are striving to avoid any kind of sensationalism .
an ethics advisory body will supervise the programming , which is to always be " serious and respectful , " according to gernig .
representatives from germany 's two main christian churches will sit on the ethics council , she said , although there are no plans as of yet to have a muslim member on board . kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he is furious about his government ’ s plans to install a gigantic radar station as part of a controversial us missile defense system in central europe . “ we will fight , fight and fight it .
we will address our czech leaders , the parliament and so on .
and we have already written to the us congress and 92 broadcasting outlets in the entire world , ” said neoral at a press conference of the european parliament in brussels . “ our government has not reacted .
they are not of one mind with us .
the czech government doesn ’ t communicate with us , and when they do , it ’ s only through the media , ” he said . the main concern of neoral and other inhabitants is health , and the dangerous effects of radiation on soft tissue , especially the eyes . “ we read on american internet websites that the radiation emitted has a reach of up to 36 kilometers -lrb- 22 miles -rrb- , ” added neoral , who said that trokavec lies almost that distance from pilsen , the planned site of the installations .
the german border is roughly 100 kilometers to the west . demonstrations in prague have shown that many , if not most czechs are opposed to the us missile defense shield , but president vaclav klaus and prime minister mirek topolanek favor installing part of the system on czech soil . jan neoral is making strong waves for his position , which have already impressed various eu parliamentarians . “ i am waiting for the eu to say : this makes no sense .
we don ’ t need a radar tracking system in europe , and we don ’ t want it either , ” he said . miriam klaussner -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-world.de spoke to hansa rostock president dirk grabow about his strategy for solving the problems that come with success . dw-world.de : having spent 11 seasons in the bundesliga 's first division since 1991 , rostock have been the most successful club from the former east germany in reunified germany .
what 's your secret ? dirk grabow : it would probably be better to let others answer that question since it might sound self-aggrandizing , if i do .
but i think our success is down to the people involved with the club around the time of reunification .
the team could have fallen apart around 1990 .
instead , we won the double in 1990-91 and qualified for the first division of the unified bundesliga .
that was hugely important .
we did n't disappear into a sinkhole .
instead we laid the foundations for 16 years of successful soccer . last year in the second division , it took until the final day of play for you to secure promotion .
what put you over the top ? i think our big plus was our togetherness as a team , and by that i do n't just mean the starting eleven , but the entire roster .
it was our great strength . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dirk grabow took over rostock 's presidency after their last relegation promotion has advantages and disadvantages .
two members of last season 's starting eleven , goalkeeper matthias schober and defender geldson , have gone elsewhere .
but you also have money to invest .
what 's your strategy ? first of all it 's completely normal that bigger clubs get interested in players who perform well at smaller ones .
that happens not just to us , but to other established clubs .
there can always be a bigger club looking to lure your players away .
our task now is to find replacement players who can not only maintain but improve our level of play .
we have to build a squad for the coming season that will be capable of staying up .
that 's our main priority at the moment . are you looking to acquire new players across the board or just at specific positions ? we have to focus on the positions where players have left .
that would first be in goal , and there we 've signed stefan wächter -lrb- former hamburg keeper -rrb- .
we also need reinforcements in our interior defense , and we already have one insofar as we exercised our purchase option on diego morais -lrb- who was previously on loan -rrb- .
he 'll be with us for the coming season , but there will surely be a couple of new players as well .
those are the main areas we 're working on . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hansa rostock fans are already gearing up for next season in 2004-05 rostock went down .
what have you learned from that season that could help you avoid relegation in the coming one ? the main thing is to have a squad like the one we had last season that sticks together as a team .
soccer is a team sport .
in the end , it 's the team - and not the sum of the best individual players - that decides whether you have success or not .
you ca n't necessarily plan success .
what you can plan is general performance .
you can develop performance , and we 'll be working every day to raise the level at which the team performs .
if we do that , success will follow . how important will players from rostock 's own amateur ranks be ? a number of years ago , we built a new youth training facility and a dormitory for our soccer academy .
we 're always trying to develop young players and integrate them into our professional team .
that 's the main task of our youth work , and it 's worked impressively in the past two seasons .
several players have made their way up and established themselves as regular members of the professional team .
and that 's a strategy we 'll continue to focus on in the future . and will rostock stay up ?
do you dream of emulating nuremberg 's surprise success last season and earning a spot in europe ? no -lrb- laughs -rrb- .
our primary goal has to be staying in the first division .
but i 'm convinced we 'll achieve it . jefferson chase interviewed dirk grabow send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-world.de spoke to hansa rostock president dirk grabow about his strategy for solving the problems that come with success . dw-world.de : having spent 11 seasons in the bundesliga 's first division since 1991 , rostock have been the most successful club from the former east germany in reunified germany .
what 's your secret ? dirk grabow : it would probably be better to let others answer that question since it might sound self-aggrandizing , if i do .
but i think our success is down to the people involved with the club around the time of reunification .
the team could have fallen apart around 1990 .
instead , we won the double in 1990-91 and qualified for the first division of the unified bundesliga .
that was hugely important .
we did n't disappear into a sinkhole .
instead we laid the foundations for 16 years of successful soccer . last year in the second division , it took until the final day of play for you to secure promotion .
what put you over the top ? i think our big plus was our togetherness as a team , and by that i do n't just mean the starting eleven , but the entire roster .
it was our great strength . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dirk grabow took over rostock 's presidency after their last relegation promotion has advantages and disadvantages .
two members of last season 's starting eleven , goalkeeper matthias schober and defender geldson , have gone elsewhere .
but you also have money to invest .
what 's your strategy ? first of all it 's completely normal that bigger clubs get interested in players who perform well at smaller ones .
that happens not just to us , but to other established clubs .
there can always be a bigger club looking to lure your players away .

he is furious about his government ’ s plans to install a gigantic radar station as part of a controversial us missile defense system in central europe . “ we will fight , fight and fight it .
we will address our czech leaders , the parliament and so on .
and we have already written to the us congress and 92 broadcasting outlets in the entire world , ” said neoral at a press conference of the european parliament in brussels . “ our government has not reacted .
they are not of one mind with us .
the czech government doesn ’ t communicate with us , and when they do , it ’ s only through the media , ” he said . the main concern of neoral and other inhabitants is health , and the dangerous effects of radiation on soft tissue , especially the eyes . “ we read on american internet websites that the radiation emitted has a reach of up to 36 kilometers -lrb- 22 miles -rrb- , ” added neoral , who said that trokavec lies almost that distance from pilsen , the planned site of the installations .
the german border is roughly 100 kilometers to the west . demonstrations in prague have shown that many , if not most czechs are opposed to the us missile defense shield , but president vaclav klaus and prime minister mirek topolanek favor installing part of the system on czech soil . jan neoral is making strong waves for his position , which have already impressed various eu parliamentarians . “ i am waiting for the eu to say : this makes no sense .
we don ’ t need a radar tracking system in europe , and we don ’ t want it either , ” he said . miriam klaussner -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he is furious about his government ’ s plans to install a gigantic radar station as part of a controversial us missile defense system in central europe . “ we will fight , fight and fight it .
we will address our czech leaders , the parliament and so on .
and we have already written to the us congress and 92 broadcasting outlets in the entire world , ” said neoral at a press conference of the european parliament in brussels . “ our government has not reacted .
they are not of one mind with us .
the czech government doesn ’ t communicate with us , and when they do , it ’ s only through the media , ” he said . the main concern of neoral and other inhabitants is health , and the dangerous effects of radiation on soft tissue , especially the eyes . “ we read on american internet websites that the radiation emitted has a reach of up to 36 kilometers -lrb- 22 miles -rrb- , ” added neoral , who said that trokavec lies almost that distance from pilsen , the planned site of the installations .
the german border is roughly 100 kilometers to the west . demonstrations in prague have shown that many , if not most czechs are opposed to the us missile defense shield , but president vaclav klaus and prime minister mirek topolanek favor installing part of the system on czech soil . jan neoral is making strong waves for his position , which have already impressed various eu parliamentarians . “ i am waiting for the eu to say : this makes no sense .

german is quite european .
you can see that in our history and in looking at german today .
the idea that german is separate from other european languages only started in the 19th century , following the unification of the german states as one nation .
over the last two years the goethe institute has promoted the “ power of language . ”
what “ power ” does german have today , and what does european integration mean for the german language ?
english has won out as the major international language , that ’ s well established now .
the issue is what worth and power a single language has at this point in time .
german is clearly important and powerful within europe , however german is not used as internationally as english or french .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ludwig m. eichinger in what areas does german play an international role ?
the field of natural sciences has been almost entirely given over to english .
there are a number of traditional fields of study where german has always been strong , and where it still plays a large role , including philosophy and music .
and there are some fields , such as art history , where german has , in recent decades , actually been the primary language .
is the use of german growing ?
german could become a european regional language in the east ; that is a reasonable possibility .
the linguistic connection between germany and its eastern neighbors dates back centuries , and those countries have a strong tradition of learning german .
however we also need to promote the german language , in europe especially , as a useful second foreign language .
in many countries english will be the first foreign language people choose to learn , but there are also good economic and practical reasons for learning german which we should promote . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : learning german helps social integration and prosperity of immigrants , says eichinger there are plans to enshrine german as the national language in germany ’ s constitution .
what do you think of this plan ?
the intentions behind the plan are good .
it ’ s about making the point that our language is not just a symbol , but saying that it should be maintained on a practical level as well .
on the other hand , i don ’ t think we have reached a point where we need to decree that it is critical that in germany we should speak german . in that sense it is not necessary to specify the german language in the constitution , which is a fairly general text .
that would imply that german is somehow endangered and that we need to do it to protect the language .
our problem is rather that of integration , given we have so many immigrants for whom german is not their first language . how multilingual is germany ?
germany is comparatively multilingual – but on another level quite monolingual .
the establishment is very much based on the german language .
the educational system is also quite rightly based on the german language .
however there is a large multilingual population in germany , and we have to be practical about this .
the danger is not that , if for example turkish were to become stronger in germany , we would all end up speaking turkish . the issue is really that we need to see this multilingualism as a part of the cultural identity of immigrants , while at the same time to ensure - and this may sound harsh - that they can function effectively in our society .
objectively , we can see with recent generations of immigrants that retreating into their own communities brings social disadvantage .
so we shouldn ’ t stress the importance of integration because otherwise the german language would be endangered , but because we need to give all communities the opportunity to participate fully in society .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spelling reform has made german a bit easier .
do we need a german equivalent to the “ academie francaise ” devoted to regulating , preserving and standardizing our language ?
that would probably be a bit difficult , because german is such a diverse language group .
traditionally , what is correct german has not been centrally determined .
for example , there has just been a dictionary published which describes the differences in the variants of german – what is spoken in austria , switzerland and then high german .
of course we could look at creating an institution concerned with the introduction of foreign words into the language .
but a comprehensive language academy , given the ways in which german changes , would be difficult .

the maxim of beauty being in the eye of the beholder is no more true than in people 's estimations of modern buildings .
to mark architecture week , the magazine has taken some of britain 's most controversial buildings to task .
but now we look back in the archive at the 1960s battle to save st pancras station .
the four buildings we have dealt with so far : gateshead car park , slough 's brunel roundabout , northampton greyfriars bus station , london 's milton court have all been post-war constructions .
while the enemies see an eyesore in need of imminent demolition , the supporters want time , time in order that people 's perspective on brutalism and raw concrete might change .
the enemies , however , believe no amount of time will see the public fall in love with the severe architecture of the 1960s and 1970s .
but before the battle for britain 's brutalist past , there were other battles over architecture that have shaped our current attitudes to our past .
one of the most notable of these was over the fate of perhaps the greatest victorian train station , st pancras in london .
looming over the busy euston road like a gothic castle , one might laugh at the thought this grade i-listed structure might ever have faced the axe .
but the sceptic should travel the short distance to nearby euston to witness the magnificence of that station .
or not , as the 4,500-ton stone doric arch that once greeted rail travellers , was demolished in 1962 , along with the rest of the station .
after an £ 800m refurbishment , its cousin at st pancras will , later this year , take the eurostar in the massive shed designed by william barlow , while the old midland grand hotel , which sits atop the concourse and was designed by george gilbert scott , will soon again be a hotel and apartment block .
but in the 1960s the railway powers-that-be had other ideas , with the demolition of the whole complex , or of just the hotel , very much on the cards .
the battle to save it - led by poet sir john betjeman - has now formed the basis for a play by richard shannon , staged near st pancras , entitled all our hellos and all of our goodbyes .
below , in a letter to a newspaper from 1966 , former civil servant and businessman sir edward playfair argues that st pancras should succumb to the wrecking ball .
a variety of other luminaries go on to argue that demolition is wrong .
demolish it - sir edward playfair , 1966 letter " can space be found for one who positively loathes the building ?
my reason for asking it is that -lrb- morally at least -rrb- the conservationists have it all their own way .

the maxim of beauty being in the eye of the beholder is no more true than in people 's estimations of modern buildings .
to mark architecture week , the magazine has taken some of britain 's most controversial buildings to task .
but now we look back in the archive at the 1960s battle to save st pancras station .
the four buildings we have dealt with so far : gateshead car park , slough 's brunel roundabout , northampton greyfriars bus station , london 's milton court have all been post-war constructions .
while the enemies see an eyesore in need of imminent demolition , the supporters want time , time in order that people 's perspective on brutalism and raw concrete might change .
the enemies , however , believe no amount of time will see the public fall in love with the severe architecture of the 1960s and 1970s .
st pancras now enlarge image but before the battle for britain 's brutalist past , there were other battles over architecture that have shaped our current attitudes to our past .
one of the most notable of these was over the fate of perhaps the greatest victorian train station , st pancras in london .
looming over the busy euston road like a gothic castle , one might laugh at the thought this grade i-listed structure might ever have faced the axe .
but the sceptic should travel the short distance to nearby euston to witness the magnificence of that station .
or not , as the 4,500-ton stone doric arch that once greeted rail travellers , was demolished in 1962 , along with the rest of the station .
after an £ 800m refurbishment , its cousin at st pancras will , later this year , take the eurostar in the massive shed designed by william barlow , while the old midland grand hotel , which sits atop the concourse and was designed by george gilbert scott , will soon again be a hotel and apartment block .
euston arch was flattened in the name of progress -lrb- picture : museum of london -rrb- but in the 1960s the railway powers-that-be had other ideas , with the demolition of the whole complex , or of just the hotel , very much on the cards .
the battle to save it - led by poet sir john betjeman - has now formed the basis for a play by richard shannon , staged near st pancras , entitled all our hellos and all of our goodbyes .
below , in a letter to a newspaper from 1966 , former civil servant and businessman sir edward playfair argues that st pancras should succumb to the wrecking ball .
a variety of other luminaries go on to argue that demolition is wrong .
demolish it - sir edward playfair , 1966 letter can space be found for one who positively loathes the building ?
my reason for asking it is that -lrb- morally at least -rrb- the conservationists have it all their own way .
they are the experts and the men of feeling ; those who do not share their views -lrb- as is implied -rrb- are ignorant followers of an obsolete fashion .
in fact , of course , his reaction and mine are both subjective , though his is much better informed .
the gothic towers did not appeal to some st pancras gives a lift to his spirit ; mine droops at its sight and i have never passed it without hoping that it would soon be demolished .

the maxim of beauty being in the eye of the beholder is no more true than in people 's estimations of modern buildings .
to mark architecture week , the magazine has taken some of britain 's most controversial buildings to task .
but now we look back in the archive at the 1960s battle to save st pancras station .
the four buildings we have dealt with so far : gateshead car park , slough 's brunel roundabout , northampton greyfriars bus station , london 's milton court have all been post-war constructions .
while the enemies see an eyesore in need of imminent demolition , the supporters want time , time in order that people 's perspective on brutalism and raw concrete might change .
the enemies , however , believe no amount of time will see the public fall in love with the severe architecture of the 1960s and 1970s .
st pancras now enlarge image but before the battle for britain 's brutalist past , there were other battles over architecture that have shaped our current attitudes to our past .
one of the most notable of these was over the fate of perhaps the greatest victorian train station , st pancras in london .
looming over the busy euston road like a gothic castle , one might laugh at the thought this grade i-listed structure might ever have faced the axe .
but the sceptic should travel the short distance to nearby euston to witness the magnificence of that station .
or not , as the 4,500-ton stone doric arch that once greeted rail travellers , was demolished in 1962 , along with the rest of the station .
after an £ 800m refurbishment , its cousin at st pancras will , later this year , take the eurostar in the massive shed designed by william barlow , while the old midland grand hotel , which sits atop the concourse and was designed by george gilbert scott , will soon again be a hotel and apartment block .
euston arch was flattened in the name of progress -lrb- picture : museum of london -rrb- but in the 1960s the railway powers-that-be had other ideas , with the demolition of the whole complex , or of just the hotel , very much on the cards .
the battle to save it - led by poet sir john betjeman - has now formed the basis for a play by richard shannon , staged near st pancras , entitled all our hellos and all of our goodbyes .
below , in a letter to a newspaper from 1966 , former civil servant and businessman sir edward playfair argues that st pancras should succumb to the wrecking ball .
a variety of other luminaries go on to argue that demolition is wrong .
demolish it - sir edward playfair , 1966 letter can space be found for one who positively loathes the building ?
my reason for asking it is that -lrb- morally at least -rrb- the conservationists have it all their own way .
they are the experts and the men of feeling ; those who do not share their views -lrb- as is implied -rrb- are ignorant followers of an obsolete fashion .
in fact , of course , his reaction and mine are both subjective , though his is much better informed .
the gothic towers did not appeal to some st pancras gives a lift to his spirit ; mine droops at its sight and i have never passed it without hoping that it would soon be demolished .
as a critic , i do not count against your correspondent ; as voters , ratepayers , passers-by and railway-travellers , we are equal .
haters of st pancras should register their feelings as emphatically as its lovers do .
not enough is said about the virtues of demolition .
the enemies of too much preservation should band together and make their case publicly .
the words " too much " are essential ; over most of the field destructionists and preservationists would agree , but in marginal cases rational policy would be more likely to emerge from a dialogue between the two than from the present tiger-and-shark battle of preservationists and developers .
the train shed was the widest single-span structure in the world anyway , it would be nice to see an intellectually respectable case made against the accepted view -lrb- fortunately countered by economic necessity -rrb- which is all for the national junkyard , the museum with far too many walls , plans distorted to accommodate the fashionable , the obsolete and the unusable , the restrictions placed on today 's architects in favour of the dead .
anyway , what fun it would be .
think of our delenda list , starting with elizabethan vulgarities -lrb- or further back if you wish -rrb- and rising to a climax in modern times , with st pancras at its head , advancing through waterhouse towards that arch-delendum the ministry of defence .
it is a pity that we destructionists are so passive ; we need an anti-betjeman to lead us .
keep it - various , 1960s extracts daily telegraph : " the extreme picturesqueness and fantasy of scott 's designs are firmly controlled by his strength of line and the asymmetrical balance of the parts .
the roof line is broken by a forest of chimney stacks , whole spires and spirelets pierce the sky with finials and crestings of wrought iron and copper - all combining to produce a skyline of wonder and delight ... "
victorian society 1966 report : " both scott 's hotel and barlow 's train shed at st pancras are indispensable masterpieces .
in their romantic skyline , technical mastery and internal splendour they express the finest qualities of the greatest period of british history and imperatively require preservation . "
eric de mare in the times : " whatever one may feel about st pancras as a work of art , no one can deny that its presence is powerful , not least as a grand symbol of what , for all its faults , was one of the greatest periods in this island 's history .
as a callow architectural student i despised all victorian architecture .
i can now see those many virtues it contains which are so signally lacking in the impersonal , faceless , joyless , minimal , rent-raising erections of today - not least at st pancras . "
st pancras being built enlarge image prof nikolaus pevsner : " the building by sir george gilbert scott is , side by side with the foreign office , his best secular building .
the train-shed by barlow has lost nothing of its elegance and sweep through the one hundred years since it was designed .
from the point of view of architecture and design neither can be spared . "
sir john summerson in the illustrated london news : " it is impossible not to admire scott 's dexterity .
this is not copy-book stuff ; scott really had gothic in his head .
motifs of the best and purest kind sprang to his aid at every juncture .
he was never at a loss for a profile or the ornament for a spandrel .
no man now living could put on a performance like this . "
below is a selection of your comments .
st. pancras and the midland are one of my favourite buildings in london .
i pass them every day on my way to work and i can never stop myself from looking up at it .
it is going to make a fantastic terminal for the eurostar , much more spectacular than waterloo .
what i want to know is what will become of the neighbouring great northern hotel ?
kathryn mcmahon , london i believe what this and all previous articles in this series have shown is how at odds architects and the public are , and perhaps always have been .
looking at these ' brutalist ' buildings i do not believe it was lack of innovation that sealed their doom in the eyes of the public , many of these buildings were -lrb- and some still are -rrb- innovative .
however i do believe that it is the lack of character which has brought their demise .
the intricate detailing of victorian buildings -lrb- and anything prior to that -rrb- has saved them from the wrecker 's ball .
personally i believe we 'll be having this discussion again in about 40 years time regarding all these almost identical modern glass structures - - perhaps there in lies the problem , they are all the same .
daniel trimm , birmingham , united kingdom i find it amusing that ' back then ' in the 60s and 70s , people were constantly looking to the future , building modern and futuristic buildings while trying to knock down the buildings that they saw as old and historical .
now we have swapped over , trying to restore and conserve the older buildings while knocking down the futuristic buildings of the 60s and 70s .
maybe in the future , people will compare both and conserve them equally , but probably try and demolish the buildings going up today .
heather , wolverhampton st pancras is the most romantic station in london , i hope it is always standing as it is a beautiful example of victorian gothic .
katolina , london i commute through st pancras every day , and i have mixed feelings about the place .
the hotel -lrb- which most people think is the station -rrb- is beautiful , especially compared with the horrid buildings around it .
the station itself is n't anything special , but i 'd still keep it , on the grounds that it 's probably a lot better than anything else that might be proposed .
for example , the new extension at the back is badly laid out , badly designed and needs to be pulled down already !
we need less of that !
nic brough , london sir edward 's argument for demolition of st pancras appears to amount to " i do n't like the look of it , neither do lots of others , not enough stuff gets demolished , oh go on , please ! "
not exactly convincing .
i have used st pancras more several years now , and the look of it as the conversion to st pancras international is almost completed is , in my opinion , superb .
the architects have managed to combine a marvellous modern platform for the use of midland mainline customers with the fabulous design of the main shed for the use of the eurostar platforms .
i think it is one of london 's best sites to see .
sam chew , loughborough , uk edward playfair is just a fashion junky .
it 's style which counts !
it 's taste which deserves admiration , conservation , and emulation .
that 's why the brutalist postwar horrors -lrb- except perhaps prisons , which should be brutalist horrors -rrb- deserve nothing more .
mike , hayes anyone supporting demolishing st pancras should take a look at euston or birmingham new street , the result of progress ...
paul , coventry , uk when st pancras international staff wave the first eurostars from london to paris from their station on the morning of 14 november 2007 it will be like when it first opened in the early morning of 1 october 1868 , at this time it was the wonder of the age .
in 2007 it will be the wonder of the world .
alastair lansley , london england i 'm struck by how modern the stupendous arch of the train shed looks .
it 's amazing .
thank goodness it survived .
john , edinburgh , uk i 'd like to see the houses these modern architects live in ; i 'll bet they all live in beautiful georgian terraces in bath or somewhere similar ...
given the sheer popularity of georgian , victorian and edwardian architecture in this country , particularly when it comes to houses , why do n't modern architects come up with designs with similar appeal , rather than the little square boxes that get built today ?

below is a selection of your comments .
st. pancras and the midland are one of my favourite buildings in london .
i pass them every day on my way to work and i can never stop myself from looking up at it .
it is going to make a fantastic terminal for the eurostar , much more spectacular than waterloo .
what i want to know is what will become of the neighbouring great northern hotel ?
kathryn mcmahon , london i believe what this and all previous articles in this series have shown is how at odds architects and the public are , and perhaps always have been .
looking at these ' brutalist ' buildings i do not believe it was lack of innovation that sealed their doom in the eyes of the public , many of these buildings were -lrb- and some still are -rrb- innovative .
however i do believe that it is the lack of character which has brought their demise .
the intricate detailing of victorian buildings -lrb- and anything prior to that -rrb- has saved them from the wrecker 's ball .
personally i believe we 'll be having this discussion again in about 40 years time regarding all these almost identical modern glass structures - - perhaps there in lies the problem , they are all the same .
daniel trimm , birmingham , united kingdom i find it amusing that ' back then ' in the 60s and 70s , people were constantly looking to the future , building modern and futuristic buildings while trying to knock down the buildings that they saw as old and historical .
now we have swapped over , trying to restore and conserve the older buildings while knocking down the futuristic buildings of the 60s and 70s .
maybe in the future , people will compare both and conserve them equally , but probably try and demolish the buildings going up today .
heather , wolverhampton st pancras is the most romantic station in london , i hope it is always standing as it is a beautiful example of victorian gothic .
katolina , london i commute through st pancras every day , and i have mixed feelings about the place .
the hotel -lrb- which most people think is the station -rrb- is beautiful , especially compared with the horrid buildings around it .
the station itself is n't anything special , but i 'd still keep it , on the grounds that it 's probably a lot better than anything else that might be proposed .
for example , the new extension at the back is badly laid out , badly designed and needs to be pulled down already !
we need less of that !
nic brough , london sir edward 's argument for demolition of st pancras appears to amount to " i do n't like the look of it , neither do lots of others , not enough stuff gets demolished , oh go on , please ! "
not exactly convincing .
i have used st pancras more several years now , and the look of it as the conversion to st pancras international is almost completed is , in my opinion , superb .
the architects have managed to combine a marvellous modern platform for the use of midland mainline customers with the fabulous design of the main shed for the use of the eurostar platforms .
i think it is one of london 's best sites to see .
sam chew , loughborough , uk edward playfair is just a fashion junky .
it 's style which counts !
it 's taste which deserves admiration , conservation , and emulation .
that 's why the brutalist postwar horrors -lrb- except perhaps prisons , which should be brutalist horrors -rrb- deserve nothing more .
mike , hayes anyone supporting demolishing st pancras should take a look at euston or birmingham new street , the result of progress ...
paul , coventry , uk when st pancras international staff wave the first eurostars from london to paris from their station on the morning of 14 november 2007 it will be like when it first opened in the early morning of 1 october 1868 , at this time it was the wonder of the age .
in 2007 it will be the wonder of the world .
alastair lansley , london england i 'm struck by how modern the stupendous arch of the train shed looks .
it 's amazing .
thank goodness it survived .
john , edinburgh , uk i 'd like to see the houses these modern architects live in ; i 'll bet they all live in beautiful georgian terraces in bath or somewhere similar ...
given the sheer popularity of georgian , victorian and edwardian architecture in this country , particularly when it comes to houses , why do n't modern architects come up with designs with similar appeal , rather than the little square boxes that get built today ?

the maxim of beauty being in the eye of the beholder is no more true than in people 's estimations of modern buildings .
to mark architecture week , the magazine has taken some of britain 's most controversial buildings to task .
but now we look back in the archive at the 1960s battle to save st pancras station .
the four buildings we have dealt with so far : gateshead car park , slough 's brunel roundabout , northampton greyfriars bus station , london 's milton court have all been post-war constructions .
while the enemies see an eyesore in need of imminent demolition , the supporters want time , time in order that people 's perspective on brutalism and raw concrete might change .
the enemies , however , believe no amount of time will see the public fall in love with the severe architecture of the 1960s and 1970s .
st pancras now enlarge image but before the battle for britain 's brutalist past , there were other battles over architecture that have shaped our current attitudes to our past .
one of the most notable of these was over the fate of perhaps the greatest victorian train station , st pancras in london .
looming over the busy euston road like a gothic castle , one might laugh at the thought this grade i-listed structure might ever have faced the axe .
but the sceptic should travel the short distance to nearby euston to witness the magnificence of that station .
or not , as the 4,500-ton stone doric arch that once greeted rail travellers , was demolished in 1962 , along with the rest of the station .
after an £ 800m refurbishment , its cousin at st pancras will , later this year , take the eurostar in the massive shed designed by william barlow , while the old midland grand hotel , which sits atop the concourse and was designed by george gilbert scott , will soon again be a hotel and apartment block .
euston arch was flattened in the name of progress -lrb- picture : museum of london -rrb- but in the 1960s the railway powers-that-be had other ideas , with the demolition of the whole complex , or of just the hotel , very much on the cards .
the battle to save it - led by poet sir john betjeman - has now formed the basis for a play by richard shannon , staged near st pancras , entitled all our hellos and all of our goodbyes .
below , in a letter to a newspaper from 1966 , former civil servant and businessman sir edward playfair argues that st pancras should succumb to the wrecking ball .
a variety of other luminaries go on to argue that demolition is wrong .
demolish it - sir edward playfair , 1966 letter can space be found for one who positively loathes the building ?
my reason for asking it is that -lrb- morally at least -rrb- the conservationists have it all their own way .
they are the experts and the men of feeling ; those who do not share their views -lrb- as is implied -rrb- are ignorant followers of an obsolete fashion .
in fact , of course , his reaction and mine are both subjective , though his is much better informed .
the gothic towers did not appeal to some st pancras gives a lift to his spirit ; mine droops at its sight and i have never passed it without hoping that it would soon be demolished .
as a critic , i do not count against your correspondent ; as voters , ratepayers , passers-by and railway-travellers , we are equal .
haters of st pancras should register their feelings as emphatically as its lovers do .
not enough is said about the virtues of demolition .
the enemies of too much preservation should band together and make their case publicly .
the words " too much " are essential ; over most of the field destructionists and preservationists would agree , but in marginal cases rational policy would be more likely to emerge from a dialogue between the two than from the present tiger-and-shark battle of preservationists and developers .
the train shed was the widest single-span structure in the world anyway , it would be nice to see an intellectually respectable case made against the accepted view -lrb- fortunately countered by economic necessity -rrb- which is all for the national junkyard , the museum with far too many walls , plans distorted to accommodate the fashionable , the obsolete and the unusable , the restrictions placed on today 's architects in favour of the dead .
anyway , what fun it would be .
think of our delenda list , starting with elizabethan vulgarities -lrb- or further back if you wish -rrb- and rising to a climax in modern times , with st pancras at its head , advancing through waterhouse towards that arch-delendum the ministry of defence .
it is a pity that we destructionists are so passive ; we need an anti-betjeman to lead us .
keep it - various , 1960s extracts daily telegraph : " the extreme picturesqueness and fantasy of scott 's designs are firmly controlled by his strength of line and the asymmetrical balance of the parts .
the roof line is broken by a forest of chimney stacks , whole spires and spirelets pierce the sky with finials and crestings of wrought iron and copper - all combining to produce a skyline of wonder and delight ... "
victorian society 1966 report : " both scott 's hotel and barlow 's train shed at st pancras are indispensable masterpieces .
in their romantic skyline , technical mastery and internal splendour they express the finest qualities of the greatest period of british history and imperatively require preservation . "
eric de mare in the times : " whatever one may feel about st pancras as a work of art , no one can deny that its presence is powerful , not least as a grand symbol of what , for all its faults , was one of the greatest periods in this island 's history .
as a callow architectural student i despised all victorian architecture .
i can now see those many virtues it contains which are so signally lacking in the impersonal , faceless , joyless , minimal , rent-raising erections of today - not least at st pancras . "

the study involved 23 primary schools , five secondaries and three further education colleges .
these were in barking and dagenham , sandwell and durham - all areas of relative though different social and economic disadvantage .
varied results they drew up their own plans and were given money - totalling £ 34m - to spend on " high levels " of hardware , software and training .

the £ 34m ict test bed project by computer agency becta in three deprived areas of england showed gains in some gcse and primary school test scores .
ofsted inspectors tended to disregard ict , and computer use was inhibited by assessment methods , the study found .
but ofsted denied the report findings , saying its inspections highlighted the effectiveness of ict .
the study involved 23 primary schools , five secondaries and three further education colleges .
these were in barking and dagenham , sandwell and durham - all areas of relative though different social and economic disadvantage .
varied results they drew up their own plans and were given money - totalling £ 34m - to spend on " high levels " of hardware , software and training .
results of the test bed schools were compared with similar institutions elsewhere and with national averages , in a study evaluated by manchester metropolitan and nottingham trent universities : at key stage 1 -lrb- aged seven -rrb- : " no significant differences " in key stage 2 tests -lrb- aged 11 -rrb- , the rate of improvement was higher for test bed schools and some even passed the national average for english at key stage 3 -lrb- 14-year-olds -rrb- : no significant differences at gcse -lrb- aged 16 -rrb- : no difference in overall pass rate , but test bed pupils did better than those in comparator schools in getting five good grades including english and maths post-16 : little change - test bed students scored same points per exam but took fewer a-levels than comparators .
the report says one of the reasons for the greater gains in primary schools may be that there was more scope for flexibility in the curriculum .
the research also investigated teachers ' concerns about ofsted inspections .
" there was a pattern of inspectors disregarding the use of ict as an integral part of learning across the curriculum and , in some cases , not accepting evidence presented through ict , " the report said .
if becta is concerned about the 11 schools their report refers to , we would welcome them sharing their concerns with ofsted ofsted spokeswoman " clearly , in ict-rich schools ict is no longer ' merely ' a curriculum subject but a vehicle for learning across the whole curriculum and this needs to be built into inspection criteria .

a spokeswoman said : " if becta is concerned about the 11 schools their report refers to , we would welcome them sharing their concerns with ofsted . "

" assessment practices , particularly the requirement to complete all examinations in handwriting , are not aligned with schools ' increasing use of ict for students ' writing , " the report said .

" my grandfather was effectively bankrupt by the end of the war , " says the great man 's grandson - also called winston churchill .
churchill was forced to put his home , chartwell in kent , on the market .
" lord camrose , the then proprietor of the daily telegraph was outraged , " says young winston .
" and he corralled 10 wealthy well-wishers and they each ponied up the princely sum of £ 5,000 .
" so for £ 55,000 - which was a lot of money in those days - they bought chartwell on the understanding that my grandparents would live there until the end of their days and then it would be presented to the nation . "
' cut off ' in contrast to churchill , blair will receive a severance package from the state worth some £ 300,000 a year .
thanks to some astute lobbying by other ex-pms , blair will get a car , a police driver and round-the-clock special branch protection .
he will also receive an immediate prime-ministerial pension of almost £ 64,000 a year as well as a further £ 84,000 to run his office - on top of what he makes as an mp .
but how will blair cope with life in the ex-prime ministers ' club , after what his predecessor john major describes as the longest farewell tour since dame nelly melba ?
one of blair 's closest advisers inside number 10 told me : " tony still does n't know what is going to hit him .
" the thing he will miss most of all is being cut off from top-grade information .
" he will no longer receive secret intelligence reports and papers and briefings which tell him what is really going on - both in britain and the rest of the world . "
when i put this to john major - a rueful smile of recognition came over his face .
he produced an answer worthy of donald rumsfeld : " people ask you questions and you 're about to answer and you think to yourself , ' hang on , i 'm about to express an opinion on this and i have n't seen the papers .
i do n't know what it is that the prime minister knows that i no longer know ' .
" so here am i about to say that i think he should have handled this differently , but he may know something that i once would have known that nobody else knows . "
' disorientating experience ' blair will also face the practical problems of adapting to the loss of the life-support system provided by number 10 .
" when you stop being prime minister it 's a very disorienting experience , because you go in such a short period of time from having everything arranged for you to being on your own , " says lord powell , who was margaret thatcher 's right-hand man for seven years when she was prime minister . "
you are very ex as an ex-prime minister " former tory cabinet minister ken clarke " you do n't have an up-to-date telephone book of your own because of course number 10 had all your telephone numbers .
code numbers have probably changed since you came in .
" i remember being rung up by margaret thatcher a week or two after she left number 10 and being told on a sunday she had a plumbing problem .
and i said ' oh dear , better get a plumber in ' .
and a long silence .
' how do i do that ? '
' well ' , i said , ' try the yellow pages ' .
and that 's the way we had to go .
i ended up ringing the plumber in the yellow pages . "
the biggest question of all is how to fill the suddenly empty days .
the former tory cabinet minister , ken clarke , who as an mp since 1970 has watched five prime ministers come and go says : " like a departing captain of industry , tony will want the next big job in the career .
" in his case i think it will be trying to govern the world and advise all the other political leaders how to run things .
and he 'll find that difficult , because you are very ex as an ex-prime minister . "
blair 's meeting with the pope on saturday is one key to what he plans to do .
according to one of blair 's closest advisers : " tony is obsessed with the idea of becoming a roving envoy who would seek to reconcile the abrahamic religions of christianity , judaism and islam . "
blair sought papal endorsement for his plans to set up an inter-faith foundation - headed by himself .
and there are also strong hopes in the white house of blair becoming a middle east peace negotiator on behalf of the west .
ken clarke scoffs at these ideas : " not that tony would ask for my advice , but if he did i would say , ' forget about reconciling the faiths .
you have disqualified yourself from that in a very big way ' . "
memoirs goldmine blair 's former press secretary alastair campbell is unsurprisingly more sanguine .
" there are all sorts of things tony will do in the future , " he says .
" he is 54 - while gladstone and churchill were in their 80s when they left office .
and if you look at someone like bill clinton and al gore and you see what they have achieved since leaving office - tony 's going to want some of that : to still be involved and focus on the big international stuff - like climate change and africa . "
" an ex-prime minister 's a rather unusual fish in politics " former prime minister john major but blair is also sitting on a goldmine - his memoirs .
campbell has long described his own diaries as his pension .
blair 's will be worth many times more .
i asked campbell 's literary agent , ed victor , the new yorker who 's now the top london literary agent to the superstars , how much he thought blair would get . " £ 5m - plus or minus , " replied victor .
" and he should sell his memoirs immediately he steps down .
ronald reagan did the deal the day after he left office , and that was very smart .
thatcher waited and i think she got less money as a result . "
blair will also have to decide on whether to stay involved in domestic politics or whether he will sign a peace treaty with gordon brown .
" an ex-prime minister 's a rather unusual fish in politics , " says john major .
" if they say nothing , what are they doing there ?
if they say something , there 's every chance it will be construed as an oblique attack on your successor .
so it is extremely difficult to have a role that is n't capable of severe misinterpretation . "
" i think tony blair would make a minimum of $ 150,000 -lrb- £ 75,000 -rrb- per lecture in america " literary agent ed victor " i certainly do n't think tony will be hanging around , backseat driving on gordon , " says alastair campbell .
one sure way that blair can make big bucks outside politics is by following his wife 's footsteps on the american lecture circuit .
although the rapture that once greeted him after 9/11 has waned , blair remains the most popular and recognisable british public figure there since lady thatcher .
he would wow us lecture audiences .
" and the lecture circuit has another purpose for you as an ex-prime minister .
when you have been used to public adulation , at least appearing before wildly enthusiastic audiences of hundreds of americans in tuscaloosa or elsewhere , still has a nice role in your life .
" it makes you think you are still admired and wanted - and psychologically it 's a great compensation for the loss of office . "
" i think tony blair would make a minimum of $ 150,000 -lrb- £ 75,000 -rrb- per lecture in america : all expenses paid , flown there first class , put up in a nice suite , " says ed victor .
" if he does 10 a year - say one a month - he will be making huge , huge money . "
finding happiness but can all the money in the world make up for the loss of the most political drug of all - power ?
" i do n't know whether you can be happy after being prime minister , but i can tell you that i do n't believe margaret thatcher has not had a happy day in her life since she ceased being prime minister , " says charles powell .
it may take you a very long time to adjust fully to no longer being the most powerful person in the land .
for the one thing all members of the ex-prime ministers ' club have in common is that they have lost the most exciting job that they will ever have .
ken clarke sums it up : " i think almost all of them , if you said that , by some amazing miracle , you could go back tomorrow and you could be prime minister again and take on all that hassle , and all that strain , and all that criticism , and all those crises , they 'd all have jumped at it and gone straight back straight away . "
how to be ex-prime minister , michael cockerell 's tv documentary , will be shown on bbc four on sunday at 2100bst .

but how will blair cope with life in the ex-prime ministers ' club , after what his predecessor john major describes as the longest farewell tour since dame nelly melba ?
sir winston churchill was effectively bankrupt by the end of the war one of blair 's closest advisers inside number 10 told me : " tony still does n't know what is going to hit him .
" the thing he will miss most of all is being cut off from top-grade information .
" he will no longer receive secret intelligence reports and papers and briefings which tell him what is really going on - both in britain and the rest of the world . "
when i put this to john major - a rueful smile of recognition came over his face .
he produced an answer worthy of donald rumsfeld : " people ask you questions and you 're about to answer and you think to yourself , ' hang on , i 'm about to express an opinion on this and i have n't seen the papers .
i do n't know what it is that the prime minister knows that i no longer know ' .
" so here am i about to say that i think he should have handled this differently , but he may know something that i once would have known that nobody else knows . "
' disorientating experience ' blair will also face the practical problems of adapting to the loss of the life-support system provided by number 10 .
" when you stop being prime minister it 's a very disorienting experience , because you go in such a short period of time from having everything arranged for you to being on your own , " says lord powell , who was margaret thatcher 's right-hand man for seven years when she was prime minister .
you are very ex as an ex-prime minister former tory cabinet minister ken clarke " you do n't have an up-to-date telephone book of your own because of course number 10 had all your telephone numbers .
code numbers have probably changed since you came in .
" i remember being rung up by margaret thatcher a week or two after she left number 10 and being told on a sunday she had a plumbing problem .
and i said ' oh dear , better get a plumber in ' .
and a long silence .
' how do i do that ? '
' well ' , i said , ' try the yellow pages ' .
and that 's the way we had to go .
i ended up ringing the plumber in the yellow pages . "
the biggest question of all is how to fill the suddenly empty days .
the former tory cabinet minister , ken clarke , who as an mp since 1970 has watched five prime ministers come and go says : " like a departing captain of industry , tony will want the next big job in the career .
" in his case i think it will be trying to govern the world and advise all the other political leaders how to run things .
and he 'll find that difficult , because you are very ex as an ex-prime minister . "
baroness thatcher was not used to dealing with mundane matters blair 's meeting with the pope on saturday is one key to what he plans to do .
according to one of blair 's closest advisers : " tony is obsessed with the idea of becoming a roving envoy who would seek to reconcile the abrahamic religions of christianity , judaism and islam . "
blair sought papal endorsement for his plans to set up an inter-faith foundation - headed by himself .
and there are also strong hopes in the white house of blair becoming a middle east peace negotiator on behalf of the west .
ken clarke scoffs at these ideas : " not that tony would ask for my advice , but if he did i would say , ' forget about reconciling the faiths .
you have disqualified yourself from that in a very big way ' . "
memoirs goldmine blair 's former press secretary alastair campbell is unsurprisingly more sanguine .
" there are all sorts of things tony will do in the future , " he says .
" he is 54 - while gladstone and churchill were in their 80s when they left office .
and if you look at someone like bill clinton and al gore and you see what they have achieved since leaving office - tony 's going to want some of that : to still be involved and focus on the big international stuff - like climate change and africa . "
an ex-prime minister 's a rather unusual fish in politics former prime minister john major but blair is also sitting on a goldmine - his memoirs .
campbell has long described his own diaries as his pension .
blair 's will be worth many times more .
i asked campbell 's literary agent , ed victor , the new yorker who 's now the top london literary agent to the superstars , how much he thought blair would get . " £ 5m - plus or minus , " replied victor .
" and he should sell his memoirs immediately he steps down .
ronald reagan did the deal the day after he left office , and that was very smart .
thatcher waited and i think she got less money as a result . "
blair will also have to decide on whether to stay involved in domestic politics or whether he will sign a peace treaty with gordon brown .
" an ex-prime minister 's a rather unusual fish in politics , " says john major .
" if they say nothing , what are they doing there ?
if they say something , there 's every chance it will be construed as an oblique attack on your successor .
so it is extremely difficult to have a role that is n't capable of severe misinterpretation . "
i think tony blair would make a minimum of $ 150,000 -lrb- £ 75,000 -rrb- per lecture in america literary agent ed victor " i certainly do n't think tony will be hanging around , backseat driving on gordon , " says alastair campbell .
one sure way that blair can make big bucks outside politics is by following his wife 's footsteps on the american lecture circuit .
although the rapture that once greeted him after 9/11 has waned , blair remains the most popular and recognisable british public figure there since lady thatcher .
he would wow us lecture audiences .
" and the lecture circuit has another purpose for you as an ex-prime minister .
when you have been used to public adulation , at least appearing before wildly enthusiastic audiences of hundreds of americans in tuscaloosa or elsewhere , still has a nice role in your life .
" it makes you think you are still admired and wanted - and psychologically it 's a great compensation for the loss of office . "
" i think tony blair would make a minimum of $ 150,000 -lrb- £ 75,000 -rrb- per lecture in america : all expenses paid , flown there first class , put up in a nice suite , " says ed victor .
" if he does 10 a year - say one a month - he will be making huge , huge money . "
finding happiness but can all the money in the world make up for the loss of the most political drug of all - power ?
alastair campbell says blair will focus on the " big international stuff " " i do n't know whether you can be happy after being prime minister , but i can tell you that i do n't believe margaret thatcher has not had a happy day in her life since she ceased being prime minister , " says charles powell .
it may take you a very long time to adjust fully to no longer being the most powerful person in the land .
for the one thing all members of the ex-prime ministers ' club have in common is that they have lost the most exciting job that they will ever have .
ken clarke sums it up : " i think almost all of them , if you said that , by some amazing miracle , you could go back tomorrow and you could be prime minister again and take on all that hassle , and all that strain , and all that criticism , and all those crises , they 'd all have jumped at it and gone straight back straight away .

" my grandfather was effectively bankrupt by the end of the war , " says the great man 's grandson - also called winston churchill .
churchill was forced to put his home , chartwell in kent , on the market .
" lord camrose , the then proprietor of the daily telegraph was outraged , " says young winston .
" and he corralled 10 wealthy well-wishers and they each ponied up the princely sum of £ 5,000 .
" so for £ 55,000 - which was a lot of money in those days - they bought chartwell on the understanding that my grandparents would live there until the end of their days and then it would be presented to the nation . "
' cut off ' in contrast to churchill , blair will receive a severance package from the state worth some £ 300,000 a year .
thanks to some astute lobbying by other ex-pms , blair will get a car , a police driver and round-the-clock special branch protection .

" my grandfather was effectively bankrupt by the end of the war , " says the great man 's grandson - also called winston churchill .
churchill was forced to put his home , chartwell in kent , on the market .
" lord camrose , the then proprietor of the daily telegraph was outraged , " says young winston .
" and he corralled 10 wealthy well-wishers and they each ponied up the princely sum of £ 5,000 .
" so for £ 55,000 - which was a lot of money in those days - they bought chartwell on the understanding that my grandparents would live there until the end of their days and then it would be presented to the nation . "
' cut off ' in contrast to churchill , blair will receive a severance package from the state worth some £ 300,000 a year .
thanks to some astute lobbying by other ex-pms , blair will get a car , a police driver and round-the-clock special branch protection .
he will also receive an immediate prime-ministerial pension of almost £ 64,000 a year as well as a further £ 84,000 to run his office - on top of what he makes as an mp .
but how will blair cope with life in the ex-prime ministers ' club , after what his predecessor john major describes as the longest farewell tour since dame nelly melba ?
sir winston churchill was effectively bankrupt by the end of the war one of blair 's closest advisers inside number 10 told me : " tony still does n't know what is going to hit him .
" the thing he will miss most of all is being cut off from top-grade information .
" he will no longer receive secret intelligence reports and papers and briefings which tell him what is really going on - both in britain and the rest of the world . "
when i put this to john major - a rueful smile of recognition came over his face .
he produced an answer worthy of donald rumsfeld : " people ask you questions and you 're about to answer and you think to yourself , ' hang on , i 'm about to express an opinion on this and i have n't seen the papers .
i do n't know what it is that the prime minister knows that i no longer know ' .
" so here am i about to say that i think he should have handled this differently , but he may know something that i once would have known that nobody else knows . "
' disorientating experience ' blair will also face the practical problems of adapting to the loss of the life-support system provided by number 10 .
" when you stop being prime minister it 's a very disorienting experience , because you go in such a short period of time from having everything arranged for you to being on your own , " says lord powell , who was margaret thatcher 's right-hand man for seven years when she was prime minister .
you are very ex as an ex-prime minister former tory cabinet minister ken clarke " you do n't have an up-to-date telephone book of your own because of course number 10 had all your telephone numbers .
code numbers have probably changed since you came in .
" i remember being rung up by margaret thatcher a week or two after she left number 10 and being told on a sunday she had a plumbing problem .
and i said ' oh dear , better get a plumber in ' .
and a long silence .
' how do i do that ? '
' well ' , i said , ' try the yellow pages ' .
and that 's the way we had to go .
i ended up ringing the plumber in the yellow pages . "
the biggest question of all is how to fill the suddenly empty days .
the former tory cabinet minister , ken clarke , who as an mp since 1970 has watched five prime ministers come and go says : " like a departing captain of industry , tony will want the next big job in the career .
" in his case i think it will be trying to govern the world and advise all the other political leaders how to run things .
and he 'll find that difficult , because you are very ex as an ex-prime minister . "
baroness thatcher was not used to dealing with mundane matters blair 's meeting with the pope on saturday is one key to what he plans to do .
according to one of blair 's closest advisers : " tony is obsessed with the idea of becoming a roving envoy who would seek to reconcile the abrahamic religions of christianity , judaism and islam . "
blair sought papal endorsement for his plans to set up an inter-faith foundation - headed by himself .
and there are also strong hopes in the white house of blair becoming a middle east peace negotiator on behalf of the west .
ken clarke scoffs at these ideas : " not that tony would ask for my advice , but if he did i would say , ' forget about reconciling the faiths .
you have disqualified yourself from that in a very big way ' . "
memoirs goldmine blair 's former press secretary alastair campbell is unsurprisingly more sanguine .
" there are all sorts of things tony will do in the future , " he says .
" he is 54 - while gladstone and churchill were in their 80s when they left office .
and if you look at someone like bill clinton and al gore and you see what they have achieved since leaving office - tony 's going to want some of that : to still be involved and focus on the big international stuff - like climate change and africa . "
an ex-prime minister 's a rather unusual fish in politics former prime minister john major but blair is also sitting on a goldmine - his memoirs .
campbell has long described his own diaries as his pension .
blair 's will be worth many times more .
i asked campbell 's literary agent , ed victor , the new yorker who 's now the top london literary agent to the superstars , how much he thought blair would get . " £ 5m - plus or minus , " replied victor .
" and he should sell his memoirs immediately he steps down .
ronald reagan did the deal the day after he left office , and that was very smart .
thatcher waited and i think she got less money as a result . "
blair will also have to decide on whether to stay involved in domestic politics or whether he will sign a peace treaty with gordon brown .
" an ex-prime minister 's a rather unusual fish in politics , " says john major .
" if they say nothing , what are they doing there ?
if they say something , there 's every chance it will be construed as an oblique attack on your successor .
so it is extremely difficult to have a role that is n't capable of severe misinterpretation . "
i think tony blair would make a minimum of $ 150,000 -lrb- £ 75,000 -rrb- per lecture in america literary agent ed victor " i certainly do n't think tony will be hanging around , backseat driving on gordon , " says alastair campbell .
one sure way that blair can make big bucks outside politics is by following his wife 's footsteps on the american lecture circuit .
although the rapture that once greeted him after 9/11 has waned , blair remains the most popular and recognisable british public figure there since lady thatcher .
he would wow us lecture audiences .
" and the lecture circuit has another purpose for you as an ex-prime minister .
when you have been used to public adulation , at least appearing before wildly enthusiastic audiences of hundreds of americans in tuscaloosa or elsewhere , still has a nice role in your life .
" it makes you think you are still admired and wanted - and psychologically it 's a great compensation for the loss of office . "
" i think tony blair would make a minimum of $ 150,000 -lrb- £ 75,000 -rrb- per lecture in america : all expenses paid , flown there first class , put up in a nice suite , " says ed victor .
" if he does 10 a year - say one a month - he will be making huge , huge money . "
finding happiness but can all the money in the world make up for the loss of the most political drug of all - power ?
alastair campbell says blair will focus on the " big international stuff " " i do n't know whether you can be happy after being prime minister , but i can tell you that i do n't believe margaret thatcher has not had a happy day in her life since she ceased being prime minister , " says charles powell .
it may take you a very long time to adjust fully to no longer being the most powerful person in the land .
for the one thing all members of the ex-prime ministers ' club have in common is that they have lost the most exciting job that they will ever have .
ken clarke sums it up : " i think almost all of them , if you said that , by some amazing miracle , you could go back tomorrow and you could be prime minister again and take on all that hassle , and all that strain , and all that criticism , and all those crises , they 'd all have jumped at it and gone straight back straight away .

" my grandfather was effectively bankrupt by the end of the war , " says the great man 's grandson - also called winston churchill .
churchill was forced to put his home , chartwell in kent , on the market .
" lord camrose , the then proprietor of the daily telegraph was outraged , " says young winston .
" and he corralled 10 wealthy well-wishers and they each ponied up the princely sum of £ 5,000 .
" so for £ 55,000 - which was a lot of money in those days - they bought chartwell on the understanding that my grandparents would live there until the end of their days and then it would be presented to the nation . "
' cut off ' in contrast to churchill , blair will receive a severance package from the state worth some £ 300,000 a year .
thanks to some astute lobbying by other ex-pms , blair will get a car , a police driver and round-the-clock special branch protection .
he will also receive an immediate prime-ministerial pension of almost £ 64,000 a year as well as a further £ 84,000 to run his office - on top of what he makes as an mp .
but how will blair cope with life in the ex-prime ministers ' club , after what his predecessor john major describes as the longest farewell tour since dame nelly melba ?
sir winston churchill was effectively bankrupt by the end of the war one of blair 's closest advisers inside number 10 told me : " tony still does n't know what is going to hit him .
" the thing he will miss most of all is being cut off from top-grade information .
" he will no longer receive secret intelligence reports and papers and briefings which tell him what is really going on - both in britain and the rest of the world . "
when i put this to john major - a rueful smile of recognition came over his face .
he produced an answer worthy of donald rumsfeld : " people ask you questions and you 're about to answer and you think to yourself , ' hang on , i 'm about to express an opinion on this and i have n't seen the papers .
i do n't know what it is that the prime minister knows that i no longer know ' .
" so here am i about to say that i think he should have handled this differently , but he may know something that i once would have known that nobody else knows . "
' disorientating experience ' blair will also face the practical problems of adapting to the loss of the life-support system provided by number 10 .
" when you stop being prime minister it 's a very disorienting experience , because you go in such a short period of time from having everything arranged for you to being on your own , " says lord powell , who was margaret thatcher 's right-hand man for seven years when she was prime minister .
you are very ex as an ex-prime minister former tory cabinet minister ken clarke " you do n't have an up-to-date telephone book of your own because of course number 10 had all your telephone numbers .
code numbers have probably changed since you came in .
" i remember being rung up by margaret thatcher a week or two after she left number 10 and being told on a sunday she had a plumbing problem .
and i said ' oh dear , better get a plumber in ' .
and a long silence .
' how do i do that ? '
' well ' , i said , ' try the yellow pages ' .
and that 's the way we had to go .
i ended up ringing the plumber in the yellow pages . "
the biggest question of all is how to fill the suddenly empty days .
the former tory cabinet minister , ken clarke , who as an mp since 1970 has watched five prime ministers come and go says : " like a departing captain of industry , tony will want the next big job in the career .
" in his case i think it will be trying to govern the world and advise all the other political leaders how to run things .
and he 'll find that difficult , because you are very ex as an ex-prime minister . "
baroness thatcher was not used to dealing with mundane matters blair 's meeting with the pope on saturday is one key to what he plans to do .
according to one of blair 's closest advisers : " tony is obsessed with the idea of becoming a roving envoy who would seek to reconcile the abrahamic religions of christianity , judaism and islam . "
blair sought papal endorsement for his plans to set up an inter-faith foundation - headed by himself .
and there are also strong hopes in the white house of blair becoming a middle east peace negotiator on behalf of the west .
ken clarke scoffs at these ideas : " not that tony would ask for my advice , but if he did i would say , ' forget about reconciling the faiths .
you have disqualified yourself from that in a very big way ' . "
memoirs goldmine blair 's former press secretary alastair campbell is unsurprisingly more sanguine .
" there are all sorts of things tony will do in the future , " he says .
" he is 54 - while gladstone and churchill were in their 80s when they left office .
and if you look at someone like bill clinton and al gore and you see what they have achieved since leaving office - tony 's going to want some of that : to still be involved and focus on the big international stuff - like climate change and africa . "
an ex-prime minister 's a rather unusual fish in politics former prime minister john major but blair is also sitting on a goldmine - his memoirs .
campbell has long described his own diaries as his pension .
blair 's will be worth many times more .
i asked campbell 's literary agent , ed victor , the new yorker who 's now the top london literary agent to the superstars , how much he thought blair would get . " £ 5m - plus or minus , " replied victor .
" and he should sell his memoirs immediately he steps down .
ronald reagan did the deal the day after he left office , and that was very smart .
thatcher waited and i think she got less money as a result . "
blair will also have to decide on whether to stay involved in domestic politics or whether he will sign a peace treaty with gordon brown .
" an ex-prime minister 's a rather unusual fish in politics , " says john major .
" if they say nothing , what are they doing there ?
if they say something , there 's every chance it will be construed as an oblique attack on your successor .
so it is extremely difficult to have a role that is n't capable of severe misinterpretation . "
i think tony blair would make a minimum of $ 150,000 -lrb- £ 75,000 -rrb- per lecture in america literary agent ed victor " i certainly do n't think tony will be hanging around , backseat driving on gordon , " says alastair campbell .
one sure way that blair can make big bucks outside politics is by following his wife 's footsteps on the american lecture circuit .
although the rapture that once greeted him after 9/11 has waned , blair remains the most popular and recognisable british public figure there since lady thatcher .
he would wow us lecture audiences .
" and the lecture circuit has another purpose for you as an ex-prime minister .

bbc news -pipe- programmes -pipe- politics show -pipe- brown : ' no ' to treaty referendum bbc news / politics show graphics version bbc sport home politics show -pipe- archive -pipe- contact us -pipe- faqs -pipe- interviews -pipe- meet the team -pipe- sunday , 24 june 2007 , 08:23 gmt 09:23 uk brown : ' no ' to treaty referendum " we did what we set out to do and that was to make sure that in these areas we were properly protected as a country " gordon brown speaking to jon sopel on sunday 24 june , the incoming prime minister , gordon brown , congratulated tony blair on the deal he negotiated at the brussels summit , and said he did not think the reform treaty merited a referendum .
test yourself with the gordon brown quiz here ...
" thanks to the negotiating skill of tony they -lsb- four red lines -rsb- have been achieved , " he said " and i think people when they look at the small print will see that we did what we set out to do and that was to make sure that in these areas we were properly protected as a country to make our own decisions when we want to do so . "
" on the face of it , " he continued , " we 've got all the details coming through from all the protocols as well as the amending treaty itself what we set out to achieve which is protecting the british national interest in these four crucial areas .
" for example , the charter of rights , we should be protected in british law on that and all the other areas we seem to have been able thanks to the negotiation to have achieved that .
" on that basis , like every other treaty that has been negotiated - nice , amsterdam , maastricht - and that while many other people will call for a referendum it seems to me that we have met our negotiating position . "
blair 's experience mr brown was asked about the idea of tony blair becoming a middle east envoy for the major powers .
he responded warmly to the idea , saying : " i think tony blair , " he insisted , " not only has made an immense contribution not just to our national life , but to the international community , but obviously has a very great contribution that if he chooses to make , and i believe he will be pressed to make that contribution , that he should be invited to make .
" tony blair has a great knowledge both of reconciliation , and how to make it happen as we found from northern ireland , and a great interest in the areas we were just talking about . "
underhand approach ?
jon sopel put to mr brown that he appeared to have acted in an underhand way when he offered lord ashdown a job , after ming campbell had said " no " lib dem would serve .
mr brown angrily rejected this accusation saying " this is not a correct account of what happened - it is a total travesty of what happened .
" what i would say to you is absolutely this ... that there are people of expertise and wide experience .
" they may not be in your own political party but in the case of northern ireland , i was talking to someone who had something to offer and i think it 's right that we are inclusive and it 's right to draw on all the talents , and i think you will see that we are in a position whether it 's in one capacity or another to draw on some of the talents of our society who are not normally associated with party political events and forces . "
leaning left ?
mr brown was asked whether or not deputy leadership candidates had hinted at shifts to the left on issues like trident , taxes and relations with the us .
gordon brown sent a shot across their bows : " nobody is going to serve in the government of the labour party starting on wednesday who is not prepared to support the manifesto of our party .
" when people make these comments , they have got to look at what the policy of our party is and the policy the government is pursuing and there will have to be discipline in the government that i lead . "
council housing retreat he also appeared to retreat from his own recent statements suggesting that more council houses might be built : " i think you 've got to look at how the public sector as a whole can contribute and then make up your mind about where the right contribution can be made .
" housing associations yes - councils get receipts obviously from the houses that they sell , but i think you 're going to have to be patient and wait until we look at the detail of what is going to be done . "
law and order mr brown suggested a new role for citizens ' juries - akin to jury service in criminal trials , in which ordinary people would contribute to the policy-making process .
he said : " i believe that citizens ' juries and citizens ' jury service could become a thing of the future - inviting people from all parts of the country , 600 constituencies , one , two or three hundred people discussing an issue through , feedback to government and then government responding and saying this is what we are going to do as a result .
" this is an important way of consulting . "
business advisory council and he announced the setting up of a business advisory council , in which business leaders would keep him informed about the issues of most concern to them : " if you take the example of business , you know i feel that we could do better in the way we engage the business community in the big decisions about the future of our country .
" and so i 'm going to propose over the next few days that we have a business council for britain , and that business council will be able to look at , adjudicate upon , inquire into the policies that we are pursuing .
" it will also be able to look at how some of the parts of business policy at the moment , the industrial policy , technology policy , should be independent of the government , like the bank of england is independent of government .
" but i want to draw on and have a better relationship with all the great business leaders of our country who should be playing a part in helping us build a stronger economy , and of course a more prosperous society for the years to come . "
scotland 's funding gordon brown also made it clear that there would be no more money to the scottish parliament from central government .
" the scottish parliament has a budget .
if it chooses to spend its budget on one thing and not the other , then it will not be able to spend the money .
" if it spends it on reduced fees - on old people or healthcare of something else ¿ there is no more money coming from us in central government . "
interview transcript jon sopel : gordon brown , how is your government going to be different to tony blair 's ?
gordon brown : new challenges , new priorities , new ways of governing .
i think what people are seeing is in 2007 what we 've got to do is quite different from some of the things we had to do in 1997 , so we 've got the problem of climate change , we 've got global economic competition , we 've got the problem also of terrorism and security , but equally we 've got the issue of people 's rising aspirations .
so people want better health care , they want schools to be of the highest standard , they want our public services to be tailored to their needs , and it 's responding to people 's rising aspirations partly because of our success but partly because people legitimately have higher expectations of government .
there is the challenge particularly for public services in the years to come .
jon sopel : but how can you argue that gordon brown is going to be a big change when you 've been one of the principal architects of the past ten years of government ?
gordon brown : well you see what i 've realised over ten years - and i 've been talking about this as i go round the country - is that yes in 1997 we had to do things and almost pull a lever , so we had to have a new deal to get people back to work .
we 've got a million people ... now two million people back into work .
in 2007 the challenges are a bit different .
you 've got to involve and engage people far more , so all decisions that we make will have to be build from an understanding of grassroots opinion , people being more engaged in the decision making .
the old method was if a politician went out in the country you have a public meeting .
then we had like television question times .
now what you 've got to do , because we 've got to listen to people 's real concerns , is engage people in discussing right through a big issue .
you know , it could be the health service , it could be drugs , these are big issues about how our community is changing as a result of globalisation .
it could be smoking , i did one on that .
it could be the british way of life , i did one on that .
but what happens is , you ask people , look , here are the problems that we 've got .
we ca n't solve these problems on our own .
we can only solve them if you yourself are in engaged in ... like the environment , you ca n't solve it without personal responsibility and people accepting that they have a role to play .
and then you work through the problem , i believe that citizens ' juries and citizens ' jury service , could become a thing of the future , inviting people in all parts of the country , perhaps on a day like this , 600 constituencies , 100 or 200 or 300 people there discussing an issue through , feed back to government and then government responding and saying this is what we 're going to do as a result .
i think this is an important way of consulting .
jon sopel : okay , you said it when you launched your campaign that the nhs would be your priority and that education would be your passion .
let 's talk about the priority .
what does it mean that the nhs is going to be your priority ?
gordon brown : because i 've been listening to what people say about the nhs and we have got to do better and we will do better , and i think what 's happened is that people see that the new investment is being made , they see the new hospitals , they see that there are nurses being hired , they see the new equipment as well , but i think there 's really three things they want to be sure about , one is that the nhs is here for you when you need it , so people are worried about gps opening hours , about can they have a range of services at a local level for weekends and for after hours .
the second thing is that people are pleased often by the standard of surgical care in the hospital but worried about , in a way , higher aspirations , making them worried about personal care , and so we 've got to deal with these issues of cleanliness in food and standards and aftercare and the time that a doctor and a nurse has to deal with the patient , and if i may just finish with the third thing , is we 've got to lead the world in the new cures from breast cancer to diabetes , to dealing with some of the diseases that have yet to be conquered , britain , with its national health service , can , i believe , lead the world .
jon sopel : is it your problem that you 've been obsessed by targets in the government and despite the billions that you 've pumped in , ordinary people are more concerned about whether their a & e department is going to close or whether they 're going to go into hospital and come out with a super bug .
gordon brown : and we 've got to respond to people 's concerns directly and you 're not a government in the modern world if you 're not listening all the time and responding to these concerns .
jon sopel : so have you been too target driven ?
you 've imposed , i think , 64 targets on the nhs with the treasury monitoring everything from the number of undisclosed invoices paid by nhs bodies to the . and let me read this : " the co-efficient variation of the timed market forces factor adjusted reference cost index through an nhs trust . "
it sounds like you 're trying to suffocate the health service .
gordon brown : no .
what we 're trying to do is to get value for money .
but value for money will be achieved in the longer term , as i have been proposing .
if we can get that real time , local ... you see in new york - i 've been in new york - looked at the police , every week the police ... almost every day , update their results on how they 're performing .
people then challenge the police and say : " look , you can do better in my precinct , in my neighbourhood " and it 's got to be the same for the health service in the future , where at a local level people will be able to get the information about what the waits are , what the standard of care is , how many reported incidents there are of something going wrong whether it 's in the health service or anywhere else , and then challenge .
now that 's where we 're trying to move over the next few years .
jon sopel : well let 's turn from your priority to your passion now and education .
how would you answer this from one of our viewers , susan lang , who has contacted us from lichfield .
she 's said : " why is it only english and welsh students are the only students in the european union who are not allowed to study in scotland for free but it 's our taxes which pays for the rest of the eu to study there ? "
gordon brown : look , the scottish parliament has a budget .
if it chooses to spend its budget on one thing and not the other then it will not be able to spend money if it spends it on reduced fees , on old people or on health care or on something else .
now devolution , like to a local council or to a scottish or welsh parliament , it 's about the local people making the decisions .
but if they use the money for one thing , they ca n't use it for something else .
there is no more money coming from us , from central government .
jon sopel : but you said , when you spoke to the bbc editors on friday , that : " i think you 've got to continue to look at the evolution of the constitution and you 've got to be sensitive to the needs of 85 % of the population who are english . "
it sounds like you think that the english might have a grievance .
gordon brown : i think that the constitution can only work if all parts of the united kingdom feel that it offers them both a recognition of their needs and is sensitive to any complaints that they have .
so if there is a sense in any part of the united kingdom that we 've got to do things better , we 've got to look at it .
jon sopel : do you sense the english have a grievance then ?
gordon brown : i sense that the constitution is in the process , as i said on friday , of evolution , and i sense also that we can respond to some of these concerns in a way that preserves the unity of the united kingdom , and the one thing i 'm clear about , whether it 's been in scotland or wales or in england itself is that people do want , in the majority , to remain part of the united kingdom .
jon sopel : okay , you 've spoken about a government of all the talents , and you tried and failed offering a job to a very senior liberal democrat .
do n't you find yourself a bit like the football association where it goes after the former brazilian coach phil scolari and ends up with steve mcclaren ?
gordon brown : no , because i believe that if you 're looking at how a country can do better in years to come , you 've got to try and build a shared consensus a bit different from a football team , you 've got to try and build a shared consensus about what the authorities are , and you should try to draw on the advice of , and sometimes the engagement in government , of people who have got expertise , who 've got something to offer , who 've been proven to have a certain wisdom in a particular area .
and i think , if you take the example of business , you know , i feel we could do better in the way that we engage the business community in the big decisions about the future of our country .
and so i 'm going to propose over the next few days that we have a business council for britain and that business council will be able to look at , adjudicate to parliament and inquire into the policies that we are pursuing , and it will also be able to look at how some of the parts of business policy at the moment , industrial policy , technology , should be independent of government , like the bank of england is independent is government in government , but i want to draw and have a better relationship with all the great business leaders of our country who should be playing a part in helping us build a stronger economy , and of course , a more prosperous society for the years to come .
jon sopel : okay , let me just go back to lord ashdown , was n't it rather sneaky and underhand .
sir menzies campbell , your friend , had said to you : " no liberal democrat is going to serve " and after he said that to you , you still tried to get off a ...
gordon brown : i 'm not going to get into private conversations but that is a total travesty of actually what happened , but these are confidential conversations and it 's not for me to breach confidences .
the one thing i say is where someone ...
jon sopel : so it 's not true that you went to paddy ashdown ming campbell would say no liberal democrat would serve ?
gordon brown : this is not a correct account of what happened .
it is a travesty of what happened .
what i would say to you is absolutely this , that there are people of expertise , there are people who have got wide experience .
they may not be in your own political party but as was the case of northern ireland , i was talking to someone who had something to offer .
and i think it 's right that we are inclusive .
i think it 's right that we try to draw on all the talents , and i think you 'll see that we are in a position , whether it 's in one capacity or another , to draw on some of the talents of our society who are not normally associated with party political events and forces , because they too believe , like me , that what matters at the end of the day is the future of our country and building a better britain and building a shared sense of national purpose , and i think that people look to us to bring an end to the old politics that are too tribal , that have been too divisive and be inclusive and reach out and try to bring in people who have got something to offer .
jon sopel : very interesting what you say .
so should we expect that come this thursday when you announce the shape of your government , that there will be non-labour members in it at some ministerial level ?
gordon brown : i 'm not going to make any announcements , tempting , you know , when talking to you and not to the house of commons or to any other audience , but i 'm not going to pre-empt any announcement .
jon sopel : but listening to what you said , it sounds like a logical ...
gordon brown : i think the principle that we should work on for the future of british politics is that we have to be far more inquisitive , we have to reach out more , there are people with contributions that they can make - not necessarily in government positions as ministers but contributions they can make to our national life , and there are people of standing whose talents that i will want to draw on to make for a better government of this country .
jon sopel : so without prejudging , then you 've said , yes you would like to have a government without ... with .. you know , maybe some other people that have non-labour party members in it .
gordon brown : well i 've said already , and i actually said on friday , it 's just this , there are some people who are not associated with any political party who 've got an expertise that they can offer .
now it may be they 'd undertake a review for us , it may be that they come in , in an advisory role , it may be in other capacities as well .
but the principle is in my view right , we are talking about building a better britain , a more successful economy , a stronger society , i want to draw on the talents of people who can contribute to that and i think most people watching this programme will say that old tribal divisive politics have got less to offer than an inclusive approach that i 'm talking about .
jon sopel : okay , just one more thing on the new politics .
lord goldsmith amounted that he 's standing down as attorney general .
is it a chance for you to look again at the role of attorney general and maybe depoliticise that role ?
gordon brown : well i 'm talking , as you probably know , about looking at the whole of our constitution .
we 've had some great changes over the last few years but it is time to look again at how parliament can gain more power from the executive and how the people itself can gain more power from parliament and the executive , and of course , in the context of that you would be prepared to look at the role of attorney general .
jon sopel : right , hopefully a couple of simple questions .
are you committed to having a deputy prime minister ?
gordon brown : that 's for me to decide at a later date and not to make any announcements on today .
jon sopel : and are you committed , if you do decide to have a deputy prime minister , that that person should be whoever wins the deputy leadership contest ?
gordon brown : well i 'm not going to get into that because first of all this is not the time to do so when i 've not talked to any of my colleagues before talking to you but also the time to make these decisions is when i announce them on wednesday and thursday .
jon sopel : but i 'm sure if i said : " are you going to have a chancellor of the exchequer ? "
are you going to have a foreign secretary and whatever else , you 'd say yes of course i am .
why ca n't you say you are going to have a deputy prime minister ?
gordon brown : i 'm enjoying the discussion but this is something i have to discuss with my colleagues .
jon sopel : okay , let 's talk about the deputy leadership contest because you 've been stressing the new politics but it seems like the deputy leadership contest at times has seemed like a trip down memory lane with a massive lurch to the left .
gordon brown : i did not and i do n't believe that that is the case .
i think we 've got some very good candidates .
they 've been putting forward their own views , but i also think that no matter what causes you want to throw at me that what they 've said , i mean generally speaking , there 's nobody here is going to serve in the government of the labour party starting on wednesday who is not prepared to support the manifesto of our party .
jon sopel : yes , so i will give you a ...
gordon brown : i thought that was very ...
jon sopel : well exactly .
harriet harman calling for the united states to be taken the security council in guantanamo bay .
john cruddas wanting higher tax rates , peter hain 's appalled by city bonuses .
gordon brown : i think when people make these comments they have got to look at what the policy of our party is , what the policy of the government is pursuing and there will have to be discipline in the government that i lead .
jon sopel : that 's a shot across the bow , is n't it ?
gordon brown : i think it 's very important for people to recognise that as we move forward the manifesto is what we put to the public , we 've got to honour that manifesto , that is an issue of trust that we have with the electorate and people who have additional views to put forward , by all means , put them forward to the next manifesto , but we are not going to go beyond implementing the principles and the policies of this manifesto and somehow change it overnight .
jon sopel : just on one thing that has come out of the deputy leadership contest which does seem to have gained some traction , it 's the idea of councils being allowed to build more council houses .
gordon brown : i think you 'll find that the debate about housing is becoming far broader than it was a few years ago .
in other words , we 've got a national priority to build more houses and of course the private sector will build almost ... the biggest share of them .
housing associations are doing what they can and we will increase the budget for social housing by 50 % and we 've got to look at whether the arrangements that governed the building of housing both to rent and to buy are going to get us the results that we need , which is to meet the demand , particularly - as i found going round the country - of young couples wanting to get onto the housing ladder for the first time , frustrated they 're not able to do , and that 's why i said the new challenge is affordable housing and it 's one that we will address immediately .
jon sopel : so would you build council houses ?
gordon brown : i think you 've got to look at how the public sector as a whole can contribute and then make up your mind about where the right contribution can be made .
jon sopel : so there might be a role for ...
gordon brown : housing associations yes , councils get receipts obviously from the houses that they sell , but i think you 're going to have to be patient and wait till we look at the detail of what has got to be done , because the national priority is that we build houses in a way that they are affordable for people and we 've got to recognise that while more and more people want houses to buy and to own , and this is a great thing , people getting on the housing ladder , there are many also who need houses to rent .
jon sopel : okay .
there 's an eu summit that ended in the wee small hours of saturday morning .
do you sign up fully to what tony blair has agreed in brussels ?
gordon brown : well there were four red lines that we set down , very clear that we could not be overruled on foreign and defence policy or on justice and home policy , or on , if you like , business and social and employment legislation , and we had a particular concern about social security .
i 've read that the detail of what has come out of this , and it seems that all our four red lines , thanks to the negotiating skill of tony , they have been achieved , and i think people when they look at the small print there will see that we did what we set out to do and that was to make sure that in these areas we were properly protected as a country to make our own decisions when we wanted to do so .
jon sopel : so , on the basis of what has been signed , does there need to be a referendum on it ?
gordon brown : well of course there 's going to be a debate about this , but my judgement is that if we were to get these four red lines achieved , and my judgement is that we have achieved these four really demands that britain had of the european union , that that means that just in the case of all the other amending treaties , the nice and maastricht and so on , that the public would not therefore expect there to be a referendum , and i think i 'm right in saying that no other country , and i think there were five who were about to or had had referendums , no other country in the rest of europe now thinks it 's necessary to have a referendum other than those that are constitutionally bound to do so .
jon sopel : i heard the foreign secretary say : " but of course there have been some areas where brussels has more power , there 's been more agreement of qualified majority voting and got the veto .
william hague , the shadow foreign secretary says : " given their manifesto commitment to a referendum on the eve of the constitution the government have absolutely no democratic mandate to introduce these major changes without letting the british people have the final say in a referendum . "
gordon brown : well he would say that , would n't he , but when it came to maastricht when the conservatives were in power , they did n't have a referendum .
you 've got to look at the small print here rather than the political rhetoric and in each of the areas where we set out to achieve our negotiated objectives , either we are not affected directly by the european amended treaty because we have an exemption or an opt-in in some cases , or , alternatively , it does n't count that effect that people claimed on british institutions or british law .
jon sopel : but there is going to be extension of majority voting on foreign policy , a european foreign minister in all but name , end to the national veto on things like transport and energy , those things matter .
gordon brown : well , let 's get to the heart of qualified majority voting .
in each of the major treaties , and actually the biggest one was when mrs thatcher negotiated the single european act , there has been qualified majority voting in many cases because we have asked for it so that we can get decisions made in key areas .
so it 's not a matter of principle that there should never be qualified majority voting .
look , the european union is now 27 , it 's got to work better .
this is not a new constitution , it 's an amending treaty .
all these symbols that were talked about before are not there .
the charter of rights we have got a position in the protocol that protects us , so in the key areas the fundamental issues that people raised beforehand i believe our strong negotiating position has been successful .
jon sopel : so despite the pressure that may come from the mail , the sun , who knows whichever papers , and the opposition political parties - no referendum ?
gordon brown : well it looks on the face of it , and we 're just getting all the details obviously of what has been agreed and what has been published , and particularly the protocols which go side by side with the other decisions that have been made , that all four of what we set out to achieve as our negotiating red lines we have met our objectives in that and therefore the issues that we were worried about have been dealt with .
and as with the other treaties in the past , and as i suspect with other countries who have decided to hold a referendum before but are not going to do so now , we see us having met our negotiated objectives .
jon sopel : now you just praised there tony blair 's negotiating skills .
it 's being touted around that he might become a middle east envoy for the quartet .
what would you think of that ?
gordon brown : well i think tony blair not only has made an immense contribution , not just to our national life but to the international community , but obviously has a very major contribution that if he chooses to make and i believe he will be pressed to make that contribution , he should be invited to make .
and tony blair has a great knowledge of both reconciliation on how to make it happen as we 've done from northern ireland and a great interest in the areas that we 're just talking about .
and so what tony blair can do to help both world peace and prosperity over the next few years is something that no doubt he will be considering and obviously i hope he 's in a position to make a contribution .
jon sopel : so you say he will be pressed , this is real , this is ... it sounds like you 're making it sound like it 's quite close that he will become the middle east envoy for the quartet .
gordon brown : now hold on , i do n't know the individual discussions that have taken place but you know in many areas tony will be asked , as i suspect you will know , to make a contribution , whether it 's on interfaith dialogue in which he 's got a great interest , or on the future of africa where he 's taken himself a very big role in trying to make possible some of the breakthroughs we 've had in debt relief and on aid and the on the empowerment of the poor and developing countries .
in all these areas i think people will continue to press tony to do things and no doubt he 'll choose what is the best contribution that he thinks he can make to public life in the future .
jon sopel : is there going to be any difference in your relationship with president bush ?
gordon brown : i think the relationship between a british prime minister and an american president has always got to be a strong one .
no , i have not known president bush in the way that tony blair has known president bush , and obviously they 've had a relationship from exactly the time that president bush took over , but i believe that the relationship between britain and america is fundamental to our future success .
i find it strange that we have political parties in this country saying that they 're now anti-european and anti-american .
the whole purpose of a good foreign policy is to build alliances for progress and i want us to play a part in what i think will be a very big issue , and that 's reshaping the international institutions , but fundamental to our partnerships and alliances are our relationship with europe , our relationship with america and of course our relationship with the commonwealth .
jon sopel : okay .
we started this interview talking about how your government was going to be different to tony blair 's , how are you going to personally change in maybe the way that you deal with your colleagues ?
gordon brown : i think when you 're chancellor , let 's be honest , you 've got to say to people if they come for money - no .
and it 's a different job from being the leader of the party where i believe you 've got to bring people together and you 've got to reach out .
in the country as a whole which is what i find most exciting of all , the challenge in modern politics you know is to build a shared sense of national purpose .
the challenge is to try and get people together and build a consensus .
so we 've got long-term decisions we 've got to make about how much and how ... and what polity we invest in education , about what we 've got to do about science and innovation .
you 've got to build a national consensus .
so i believe that the role that i 've got to play is bringing people together to make sure that we , britain , can have a strong sense of shared purpose in the way that other countries also do .
jon sopel : this weekend tony blair has gone off to see the pope amid speculation that he may be converting to catholicism .
can i ask you what part will your faith play when you become prime minister ?
gordon brown : as you know , i grew up and my father was a minister to the church , and has been a very strong influence in my life .
i think the most important thing it 's taught me is to treat everybody equally , to show respect to all people and to feel a sense of responsibility to other people , and i 'm not one of those people who want to lecture of hector about what is i think essentially a very personal thing .
but i am very clear , as someone who has strong convictions that what i grew up with and what i was taught when i was young has had a huge influence in my life .
jon sopel : and a final personal thing , are you concerned for your family given the exposure that you 're all going to be subject to once you move into no.10 ?
gordon brown : i think we 've had to live with some of it for the last few years .
obviously i hope people will respect that i 've got very , very young children , but i think also people have a right to know who you are , what you believe , what you stand for , what you 're trying to achieve , so that is very much part of the job that you 've got to show people that you are who you are and not try to sort of use some excuse to run away from the attention that you 've got to have , and people have a right to know what you want to say .

test yourself with the gordon brown quiz here ...
" thanks to the negotiating skill of tony they -lsb- four red lines -rsb- have been achieved , " he said " and i think people when they look at the small print will see that we did what we set out to do and that was to make sure that in these areas we were properly protected as a country to make our own decisions when we want to do so . "
" on the face of it , " he continued , " we 've got all the details coming through from all the protocols as well as the amending treaty itself what we set out to achieve which is protecting the british national interest in these four crucial areas .
" for example , the charter of rights , we should be protected in british law on that and all the other areas we seem to have been able thanks to the negotiation to have achieved that .
" on that basis , like every other treaty that has been negotiated - nice , amsterdam , maastricht - and that while many other people will call for a referendum it seems to me that we have met our negotiating position . "
blair 's experience mr brown was asked about the idea of tony blair becoming a middle east envoy for the major powers .
he responded warmly to the idea , saying : " i think tony blair , " he insisted , " not only has made an immense contribution not just to our national life , but to the international community , but obviously has a very great contribution that if he chooses to make , and i believe he will be pressed to make that contribution , that he should be invited to make .
" tony blair has a great knowledge both of reconciliation , and how to make it happen as we found from northern ireland , and a great interest in the areas we were just talking about . "
underhand approach ?
jon sopel put to mr brown that he appeared to have acted in an underhand way when he offered lord ashdown a job , after ming campbell had said " no " lib dem would serve .
mr brown angrily rejected this accusation saying " this is not a correct account of what happened - it is a total travesty of what happened .
" what i would say to you is absolutely this ... that there are people of expertise and wide experience .
" they may not be in your own political party but in the case of northern ireland , i was talking to someone who had something to offer and i think it 's right that we are inclusive and it 's right to draw on all the talents , and i think you will see that we are in a position whether it 's in one capacity or another to draw on some of the talents of our society who are not normally associated with party political events and forces . "
leaning left ?
mr brown was asked whether or not deputy leadership candidates had hinted at shifts to the left on issues like trident , taxes and relations with the us .
gordon brown sent a shot across their bows : " nobody is going to serve in the government of the labour party starting on wednesday who is not prepared to support the manifesto of our party .
" when people make these comments , they have got to look at what the policy of our party is and the policy the government is pursuing and there will have to be discipline in the government that i lead . "
council housing retreat he also appeared to retreat from his own recent statements suggesting that more council houses might be built : " i think you 've got to look at how the public sector as a whole can contribute and then make up your mind about where the right contribution can be made .
" housing associations yes - councils get receipts obviously from the houses that they sell , but i think you 're going to have to be patient and wait until we look at the detail of what is going to be done . "
law and order mr brown suggested a new role for citizens ' juries - akin to jury service in criminal trials , in which ordinary people would contribute to the policy-making process .
he said : " i believe that citizens ' juries and citizens ' jury service could become a thing of the future - inviting people from all parts of the country , 600 constituencies , one , two or three hundred people discussing an issue through , feedback to government and then government responding and saying this is what we are going to do as a result .
" this is an important way of consulting . "
business advisory council and he announced the setting up of a business advisory council , in which business leaders would keep him informed about the issues of most concern to them : " if you take the example of business , you know i feel that we could do better in the way we engage the business community in the big decisions about the future of our country .
" and so i 'm going to propose over the next few days that we have a business council for britain , and that business council will be able to look at , adjudicate upon , inquire into the policies that we are pursuing .
" it will also be able to look at how some of the parts of business policy at the moment , the industrial policy , technology policy , should be independent of the government , like the bank of england is independent of government .
" but i want to draw on and have a better relationship with all the great business leaders of our country who should be playing a part in helping us build a stronger economy , and of course a more prosperous society for the years to come . "
scotland 's funding gordon brown also made it clear that there would be no more money to the scottish parliament from central government .
" the scottish parliament has a budget .
if it chooses to spend its budget on one thing and not the other , then it will not be able to spend the money .
" if it spends it on reduced fees - on old people or healthcare of something else ¿ there is no more money coming from us in central government . "
interview transcript jon sopel : gordon brown , how is your government going to be different to tony blair 's ?
gordon brown : new challenges , new priorities , new ways of governing .
i think what people are seeing is in 2007 what we 've got to do is quite different from some of the things we had to do in 1997 , so we 've got the problem of climate change , we 've got global economic competition , we 've got the problem also of terrorism and security , but equally we 've got the issue of people 's rising aspirations .
so people want better health care , they want schools to be of the highest standard , they want our public services to be tailored to their needs , and it 's responding to people 's rising aspirations partly because of our success but partly because people legitimately have higher expectations of government .
there is the challenge particularly for public services in the years to come .
jon sopel : but how can you argue that gordon brown is going to be a big change when you 've been one of the principal architects of the past ten years of government ?
gordon brown : well you see what i 've realised over ten years - and i 've been talking about this as i go round the country - is that yes in 1997 we had to do things and almost pull a lever , so we had to have a new deal to get people back to work .
we 've got a million people ... now two million people back into work .
in 2007 the challenges are a bit different .
you 've got to involve and engage people far more , so all decisions that we make will have to be build from an understanding of grassroots opinion , people being more engaged in the decision making .
the old method was if a politician went out in the country you have a public meeting .
then we had like television question times .
now what you 've got to do , because we 've got to listen to people 's real concerns , is engage people in discussing right through a big issue .
you know , it could be the health service , it could be drugs , these are big issues about how our community is changing as a result of globalisation .
it could be smoking , i did one on that .
it could be the british way of life , i did one on that .
but what happens is , you ask people , look , here are the problems that we 've got .
we ca n't solve these problems on our own .
we can only solve them if you yourself are in engaged in ... like the environment , you ca n't solve it without personal responsibility and people accepting that they have a role to play .
and then you work through the problem , i believe that citizens ' juries and citizens ' jury service , could become a thing of the future , inviting people in all parts of the country , perhaps on a day like this , 600 constituencies , 100 or 200 or 300 people there discussing an issue through , feed back to government and then government responding and saying this is what we 're going to do as a result .
i think this is an important way of consulting .
jon sopel : okay , you said it when you launched your campaign that the nhs would be your priority and that education would be your passion .
let 's talk about the priority .
what does it mean that the nhs is going to be your priority ?
gordon brown : because i 've been listening to what people say about the nhs and we have got to do better and we will do better , and i think what 's happened is that people see that the new investment is being made , they see the new hospitals , they see that there are nurses being hired , they see the new equipment as well , but i think there 's really three things they want to be sure about , one is that the nhs is here for you when you need it , so people are worried about gps opening hours , about can they have a range of services at a local level for weekends and for after hours .
the second thing is that people are pleased often by the standard of surgical care in the hospital but worried about , in a way , higher aspirations , making them worried about personal care , and so we 've got to deal with these issues of cleanliness in food and standards and aftercare and the time that a doctor and a nurse has to deal with the patient , and if i may just finish with the third thing , is we 've got to lead the world in the new cures from breast cancer to diabetes , to dealing with some of the diseases that have yet to be conquered , britain , with its national health service , can , i believe , lead the world .
jon sopel : is it your problem that you 've been obsessed by targets in the government and despite the billions that you 've pumped in , ordinary people are more concerned about whether their a & e department is going to close or whether they 're going to go into hospital and come out with a super bug .
gordon brown : and we 've got to respond to people 's concerns directly and you 're not a government in the modern world if you 're not listening all the time and responding to these concerns .
jon sopel : so have you been too target driven ?
you 've imposed , i think , 64 targets on the nhs with the treasury monitoring everything from the number of undisclosed invoices paid by nhs bodies to the . and let me read this : " the co-efficient variation of the timed market forces factor adjusted reference cost index through an nhs trust . "
it sounds like you 're trying to suffocate the health service .
gordon brown : no .
what we 're trying to do is to get value for money .
but value for money will be achieved in the longer term , as i have been proposing .
if we can get that real time , local ... you see in new york - i 've been in new york - looked at the police , every week the police ... almost every day , update their results on how they 're performing .
people then challenge the police and say : " look , you can do better in my precinct , in my neighbourhood " and it 's got to be the same for the health service in the future , where at a local level people will be able to get the information about what the waits are , what the standard of care is , how many reported incidents there are of something going wrong whether it 's in the health service or anywhere else , and then challenge .
now that 's where we 're trying to move over the next few years .
jon sopel : well let 's turn from your priority to your passion now and education .
how would you answer this from one of our viewers , susan lang , who has contacted us from lichfield .
she 's said : " why is it only english and welsh students are the only students in the european union who are not allowed to study in scotland for free but it 's our taxes which pays for the rest of the eu to study there ? "
gordon brown : look , the scottish parliament has a budget .
if it chooses to spend its budget on one thing and not the other then it will not be able to spend money if it spends it on reduced fees , on old people or on health care or on something else .
now devolution , like to a local council or to a scottish or welsh parliament , it 's about the local people making the decisions .
but if they use the money for one thing , they ca n't use it for something else .
there is no more money coming from us , from central government .
jon sopel : but you said , when you spoke to the bbc editors on friday , that : " i think you 've got to continue to look at the evolution of the constitution and you 've got to be sensitive to the needs of 85 % of the population who are english . "
it sounds like you think that the english might have a grievance .
gordon brown : i think that the constitution can only work if all parts of the united kingdom feel that it offers them both a recognition of their needs and is sensitive to any complaints that they have .
so if there is a sense in any part of the united kingdom that we 've got to do things better , we 've got to look at it .
jon sopel : do you sense the english have a grievance then ?
gordon brown : i sense that the constitution is in the process , as i said on friday , of evolution , and i sense also that we can respond to some of these concerns in a way that preserves the unity of the united kingdom , and the one thing i 'm clear about , whether it 's been in scotland or wales or in england itself is that people do want , in the majority , to remain part of the united kingdom .
jon sopel : okay , you 've spoken about a government of all the talents , and you tried and failed offering a job to a very senior liberal democrat .
do n't you find yourself a bit like the football association where it goes after the former brazilian coach phil scolari and ends up with steve mcclaren ?
gordon brown : no , because i believe that if you 're looking at how a country can do better in years to come , you 've got to try and build a shared consensus a bit different from a football team , you 've got to try and build a shared consensus about what the authorities are , and you should try to draw on the advice of , and sometimes the engagement in government , of people who have got expertise , who 've got something to offer , who 've been proven to have a certain wisdom in a particular area .
and i think , if you take the example of business , you know , i feel we could do better in the way that we engage the business community in the big decisions about the future of our country .
and so i 'm going to propose over the next few days that we have a business council for britain and that business council will be able to look at , adjudicate to parliament and inquire into the policies that we are pursuing , and it will also be able to look at how some of the parts of business policy at the moment , industrial policy , technology , should be independent of government , like the bank of england is independent is government in government , but i want to draw and have a better relationship with all the great business leaders of our country who should be playing a part in helping us build a stronger economy , and of course , a more prosperous society for the years to come .
jon sopel : okay , let me just go back to lord ashdown , was n't it rather sneaky and underhand .
sir menzies campbell , your friend , had said to you : " no liberal democrat is going to serve " and after he said that to you , you still tried to get off a ...
gordon brown : i 'm not going to get into private conversations but that is a total travesty of actually what happened , but these are confidential conversations and it 's not for me to breach confidences .
the one thing i say is where someone ...
jon sopel : so it 's not true that you went to paddy ashdown ming campbell would say no liberal democrat would serve ?
gordon brown : this is not a correct account of what happened .
it is a travesty of what happened .
what i would say to you is absolutely this , that there are people of expertise , there are people who have got wide experience .
they may not be in your own political party but as was the case of northern ireland , i was talking to someone who had something to offer .
and i think it 's right that we are inclusive .
i think it 's right that we try to draw on all the talents , and i think you 'll see that we are in a position , whether it 's in one capacity or another , to draw on some of the talents of our society who are not normally associated with party political events and forces , because they too believe , like me , that what matters at the end of the day is the future of our country and building a better britain and building a shared sense of national purpose , and i think that people look to us to bring an end to the old politics that are too tribal , that have been too divisive and be inclusive and reach out and try to bring in people who have got something to offer .
jon sopel : very interesting what you say .
so should we expect that come this thursday when you announce the shape of your government , that there will be non-labour members in it at some ministerial level ?
gordon brown : i 'm not going to make any announcements , tempting , you know , when talking to you and not to the house of commons or to any other audience , but i 'm not going to pre-empt any announcement .
jon sopel : but listening to what you said , it sounds like a logical ...
gordon brown : i think the principle that we should work on for the future of british politics is that we have to be far more inquisitive , we have to reach out more , there are people with contributions that they can make - not necessarily in government positions as ministers but contributions they can make to our national life , and there are people of standing whose talents that i will want to draw on to make for a better government of this country .
jon sopel : so without prejudging , then you 've said , yes you would like to have a government without ... with .. you know , maybe some other people that have non-labour party members in it .
gordon brown : well i 've said already , and i actually said on friday , it 's just this , there are some people who are not associated with any political party who 've got an expertise that they can offer .
now it may be they 'd undertake a review for us , it may be that they come in , in an advisory role , it may be in other capacities as well .
but the principle is in my view right , we are talking about building a better britain , a more successful economy , a stronger society , i want to draw on the talents of people who can contribute to that and i think most people watching this programme will say that old tribal divisive politics have got less to offer than an inclusive approach that i 'm talking about .
jon sopel : okay , just one more thing on the new politics .
lord goldsmith amounted that he 's standing down as attorney general .
is it a chance for you to look again at the role of attorney general and maybe depoliticise that role ?
gordon brown : well i 'm talking , as you probably know , about looking at the whole of our constitution .
we 've had some great changes over the last few years but it is time to look again at how parliament can gain more power from the executive and how the people itself can gain more power from parliament and the executive , and of course , in the context of that you would be prepared to look at the role of attorney general .
jon sopel : right , hopefully a couple of simple questions .
are you committed to having a deputy prime minister ?
gordon brown : that 's for me to decide at a later date and not to make any announcements on today .
jon sopel : and are you committed , if you do decide to have a deputy prime minister , that that person should be whoever wins the deputy leadership contest ?
gordon brown : well i 'm not going to get into that because first of all this is not the time to do so when i 've not talked to any of my colleagues before talking to you but also the time to make these decisions is when i announce them on wednesday and thursday .
jon sopel : but i 'm sure if i said : " are you going to have a chancellor of the exchequer ? "
are you going to have a foreign secretary and whatever else , you 'd say yes of course i am .
why ca n't you say you are going to have a deputy prime minister ?
gordon brown : i 'm enjoying the discussion but this is something i have to discuss with my colleagues .
jon sopel : okay , let 's talk about the deputy leadership contest because you 've been stressing the new politics but it seems like the deputy leadership contest at times has seemed like a trip down memory lane with a massive lurch to the left .
gordon brown : i did not and i do n't believe that that is the case .
i think we 've got some very good candidates .
they 've been putting forward their own views , but i also think that no matter what causes you want to throw at me that what they 've said , i mean generally speaking , there 's nobody here is going to serve in the government of the labour party starting on wednesday who is not prepared to support the manifesto of our party .
jon sopel : yes , so i will give you a ...
gordon brown : i thought that was very ...
jon sopel : well exactly .
harriet harman calling for the united states to be taken the security council in guantanamo bay .
john cruddas wanting higher tax rates , peter hain 's appalled by city bonuses .
gordon brown : i think when people make these comments they have got to look at what the policy of our party is , what the policy of the government is pursuing and there will have to be discipline in the government that i lead .
jon sopel : that 's a shot across the bow , is n't it ?
gordon brown : i think it 's very important for people to recognise that as we move forward the manifesto is what we put to the public , we 've got to honour that manifesto , that is an issue of trust that we have with the electorate and people who have additional views to put forward , by all means , put them forward to the next manifesto , but we are not going to go beyond implementing the principles and the policies of this manifesto and somehow change it overnight .
jon sopel : just on one thing that has come out of the deputy leadership contest which does seem to have gained some traction , it 's the idea of councils being allowed to build more council houses .
gordon brown : i think you 'll find that the debate about housing is becoming far broader than it was a few years ago .
in other words , we 've got a national priority to build more houses and of course the private sector will build almost ... the biggest share of them .
housing associations are doing what they can and we will increase the budget for social housing by 50 % and we 've got to look at whether the arrangements that governed the building of housing both to rent and to buy are going to get us the results that we need , which is to meet the demand , particularly - as i found going round the country - of young couples wanting to get onto the housing ladder for the first time , frustrated they 're not able to do , and that 's why i said the new challenge is affordable housing and it 's one that we will address immediately .
jon sopel : so would you build council houses ?
gordon brown : i think you 've got to look at how the public sector as a whole can contribute and then make up your mind about where the right contribution can be made .
jon sopel : so there might be a role for ...
gordon brown : housing associations yes , councils get receipts obviously from the houses that they sell , but i think you 're going to have to be patient and wait till we look at the detail of what has got to be done , because the national priority is that we build houses in a way that they are affordable for people and we 've got to recognise that while more and more people want houses to buy and to own , and this is a great thing , people getting on the housing ladder , there are many also who need houses to rent .
jon sopel : okay .
there 's an eu summit that ended in the wee small hours of saturday morning .
do you sign up fully to what tony blair has agreed in brussels ?
gordon brown : well there were four red lines that we set down , very clear that we could not be overruled on foreign and defence policy or on justice and home policy , or on , if you like , business and social and employment legislation , and we had a particular concern about social security .
i 've read that the detail of what has come out of this , and it seems that all our four red lines , thanks to the negotiating skill of tony , they have been achieved , and i think people when they look at the small print there will see that we did what we set out to do and that was to make sure that in these areas we were properly protected as a country to make our own decisions when we wanted to do so .
jon sopel : so , on the basis of what has been signed , does there need to be a referendum on it ?
gordon brown : well of course there 's going to be a debate about this , but my judgement is that if we were to get these four red lines achieved , and my judgement is that we have achieved these four really demands that britain had of the european union , that that means that just in the case of all the other amending treaties , the nice and maastricht and so on , that the public would not therefore expect there to be a referendum , and i think i 'm right in saying that no other country , and i think there were five who were about to or had had referendums , no other country in the rest of europe now thinks it 's necessary to have a referendum other than those that are constitutionally bound to do so .
jon sopel : i heard the foreign secretary say : " but of course there have been some areas where brussels has more power , there 's been more agreement of qualified majority voting and got the veto .
william hague , the shadow foreign secretary says : " given their manifesto commitment to a referendum on the eve of the constitution the government have absolutely no democratic mandate to introduce these major changes without letting the british people have the final say in a referendum . "
gordon brown : well he would say that , would n't he , but when it came to maastricht when the conservatives were in power , they did n't have a referendum .
you 've got to look at the small print here rather than the political rhetoric and in each of the areas where we set out to achieve our negotiated objectives , either we are not affected directly by the european amended treaty because we have an exemption or an opt-in in some cases , or , alternatively , it does n't count that effect that people claimed on british institutions or british law .
jon sopel : but there is going to be extension of majority voting on foreign policy , a european foreign minister in all but name , end to the national veto on things like transport and energy , those things matter .
gordon brown : well , let 's get to the heart of qualified majority voting .
in each of the major treaties , and actually the biggest one was when mrs thatcher negotiated the single european act , there has been qualified majority voting in many cases because we have asked for it so that we can get decisions made in key areas .
so it 's not a matter of principle that there should never be qualified majority voting .
look , the european union is now 27 , it 's got to work better .
this is not a new constitution , it 's an amending treaty .
all these symbols that were talked about before are not there .
the charter of rights we have got a position in the protocol that protects us , so in the key areas the fundamental issues that people raised beforehand i believe our strong negotiating position has been successful .
jon sopel : so despite the pressure that may come from the mail , the sun , who knows whichever papers , and the opposition political parties - no referendum ?
gordon brown : well it looks on the face of it , and we 're just getting all the details obviously of what has been agreed and what has been published , and particularly the protocols which go side by side with the other decisions that have been made , that all four of what we set out to achieve as our negotiating red lines we have met our objectives in that and therefore the issues that we were worried about have been dealt with .
and as with the other treaties in the past , and as i suspect with other countries who have decided to hold a referendum before but are not going to do so now , we see us having met our negotiated objectives .
jon sopel : now you just praised there tony blair 's negotiating skills .
it 's being touted around that he might become a middle east envoy for the quartet .
what would you think of that ?
gordon brown : well i think tony blair not only has made an immense contribution , not just to our national life but to the international community , but obviously has a very major contribution that if he chooses to make and i believe he will be pressed to make that contribution , he should be invited to make .
and tony blair has a great knowledge of both reconciliation on how to make it happen as we 've done from northern ireland and a great interest in the areas that we 're just talking about .
and so what tony blair can do to help both world peace and prosperity over the next few years is something that no doubt he will be considering and obviously i hope he 's in a position to make a contribution .
jon sopel : so you say he will be pressed , this is real , this is ... it sounds like you 're making it sound like it 's quite close that he will become the middle east envoy for the quartet .
gordon brown : now hold on , i do n't know the individual discussions that have taken place but you know in many areas tony will be asked , as i suspect you will know , to make a contribution , whether it 's on interfaith dialogue in which he 's got a great interest , or on the future of africa where he 's taken himself a very big role in trying to make possible some of the breakthroughs we 've had in debt relief and on aid and the on the empowerment of the poor and developing countries .
in all these areas i think people will continue to press tony to do things and no doubt he 'll choose what is the best contribution that he thinks he can make to public life in the future .
jon sopel : is there going to be any difference in your relationship with president bush ?
gordon brown : i think the relationship between a british prime minister and an american president has always got to be a strong one .
no , i have not known president bush in the way that tony blair has known president bush , and obviously they 've had a relationship from exactly the time that president bush took over , but i believe that the relationship between britain and america is fundamental to our future success .
i find it strange that we have political parties in this country saying that they 're now anti-european and anti-american .
the whole purpose of a good foreign policy is to build alliances for progress and i want us to play a part in what i think will be a very big issue , and that 's reshaping the international institutions , but fundamental to our partnerships and alliances are our relationship with europe , our relationship with america and of course our relationship with the commonwealth .
jon sopel : okay .
we started this interview talking about how your government was going to be different to tony blair 's , how are you going to personally change in maybe the way that you deal with your colleagues ?
gordon brown : i think when you 're chancellor , let 's be honest , you 've got to say to people if they come for money - no .
and it 's a different job from being the leader of the party where i believe you 've got to bring people together and you 've got to reach out .
in the country as a whole which is what i find most exciting of all , the challenge in modern politics you know is to build a shared sense of national purpose .
the challenge is to try and get people together and build a consensus .
so we 've got long-term decisions we 've got to make about how much and how ... and what polity we invest in education , about what we 've got to do about science and innovation .
you 've got to build a national consensus .
so i believe that the role that i 've got to play is bringing people together to make sure that we , britain , can have a strong sense of shared purpose in the way that other countries also do .
jon sopel : this weekend tony blair has gone off to see the pope amid speculation that he may be converting to catholicism .
can i ask you what part will your faith play when you become prime minister ?
gordon brown : as you know , i grew up and my father was a minister to the church , and has been a very strong influence in my life .
i think the most important thing it 's taught me is to treat everybody equally , to show respect to all people and to feel a sense of responsibility to other people , and i 'm not one of those people who want to lecture of hector about what is i think essentially a very personal thing .
but i am very clear , as someone who has strong convictions that what i grew up with and what i was taught when i was young has had a huge influence in my life .
jon sopel : and a final personal thing , are you concerned for your family given the exposure that you 're all going to be subject to once you move into no.10 ?
gordon brown : i think we 've had to live with some of it for the last few years .
obviously i hope people will respect that i 've got very , very young children , but i think also people have a right to know who you are , what you believe , what you stand for , what you 're trying to achieve , so that is very much part of the job that you 've got to show people that you are who you are and not try to sort of use some excuse to run away from the attention that you 've got to have , and people have a right to know what you want to say .

" thanks to the negotiating skill of tony they -lsb- four red lines -rsb- have been achieved , " he said " and i think people when they look at the small print will see that we did what we set out to do and that was to make sure that in these areas we were properly protected as a country to make our own decisions when we want to do so . "
" on the face of it , " he continued , " we 've got all the details coming through from all the protocols as well as the amending treaty itself what we set out to achieve which is protecting the british national interest in these four crucial areas .
" for example , the charter of rights , we should be protected in british law on that and all the other areas we seem to have been able thanks to the negotiation to have achieved that .
" on that basis , like every other treaty that has been negotiated - nice , amsterdam , maastricht - and that while many other people will call for a referendum it seems to me that we have met our negotiating position . "
blair 's experience mr brown was asked about the idea of tony blair becoming a middle east envoy for the major powers .
he responded warmly to the idea , saying : " i think tony blair , " he insisted , " not only has made an immense contribution not just to our national life , but to the international community , but obviously has a very great contribution that if he chooses to make , and i believe he will be pressed to make that contribution , that he should be invited to make .
" tony blair has a great knowledge both of reconciliation , and how to make it happen as we found from northern ireland , and a great interest in the areas we were just talking about . "
underhand approach ?
jon sopel put to mr brown that he appeared to have acted in an underhand way when he offered lord ashdown a job , after ming campbell had said " no " lib dem would serve .
mr brown angrily rejected this accusation saying " this is not a correct account of what happened - it is a total travesty of what happened .
" what i would say to you is absolutely this ... that there are people of expertise and wide experience .
" they may not be in your own political party but in the case of northern ireland , i was talking to someone who had something to offer and i think it 's right that we are inclusive and it 's right to draw on all the talents , and i think you will see that we are in a position whether it 's in one capacity or another to draw on some of the talents of our society who are not normally associated with party political events and forces . "
leaning left ?
mr brown was asked whether or not deputy leadership candidates had hinted at shifts to the left on issues like trident , taxes and relations with the us .
gordon brown sent a shot across their bows : " nobody is going to serve in the government of the labour party starting on wednesday who is not prepared to support the manifesto of our party .
" when people make these comments , they have got to look at what the policy of our party is and the policy the government is pursuing and there will have to be discipline in the government that i lead . "
council housing retreat he also appeared to retreat from his own recent statements suggesting that more council houses might be built : " i think you 've got to look at how the public sector as a whole can contribute and then make up your mind about where the right contribution can be made .
" housing associations yes - councils get receipts obviously from the houses that they sell , but i think you 're going to have to be patient and wait until we look at the detail of what is going to be done . "
law and order mr brown suggested a new role for citizens ' juries - akin to jury service in criminal trials , in which ordinary people would contribute to the policy-making process .
he said : " i believe that citizens ' juries and citizens ' jury service could become a thing of the future - inviting people from all parts of the country , 600 constituencies , one , two or three hundred people discussing an issue through , feedback to government and then government responding and saying this is what we are going to do as a result .
" this is an important way of consulting . "
business advisory council and he announced the setting up of a business advisory council , in which business leaders would keep him informed about the issues of most concern to them : " if you take the example of business , you know i feel that we could do better in the way we engage the business community in the big decisions about the future of our country .
" and so i 'm going to propose over the next few days that we have a business council for britain , and that business council will be able to look at , adjudicate upon , inquire into the policies that we are pursuing .
" it will also be able to look at how some of the parts of business policy at the moment , the industrial policy , technology policy , should be independent of the government , like the bank of england is independent of government .
" but i want to draw on and have a better relationship with all the great business leaders of our country who should be playing a part in helping us build a stronger economy , and of course a more prosperous society for the years to come . "
scotland 's funding gordon brown also made it clear that there would be no more money to the scottish parliament from central government .
" the scottish parliament has a budget .
if it chooses to spend its budget on one thing and not the other , then it will not be able to spend the money .
" if it spends it on reduced fees - on old people or healthcare of something else ¿ there is no more money coming from us in central government . "
interview transcript jon sopel : gordon brown , how is your government going to be different to tony blair 's ?
gordon brown : new challenges , new priorities , new ways of governing .
i think what people are seeing is in 2007 what we 've got to do is quite different from some of the things we had to do in 1997 , so we 've got the problem of climate change , we 've got global economic competition , we 've got the problem also of terrorism and security , but equally we 've got the issue of people 's rising aspirations .
so people want better health care , they want schools to be of the highest standard , they want our public services to be tailored to their needs , and it 's responding to people 's rising aspirations partly because of our success but partly because people legitimately have higher expectations of government .
there is the challenge particularly for public services in the years to come .
jon sopel : but how can you argue that gordon brown is going to be a big change when you 've been one of the principal architects of the past ten years of government ?
gordon brown : well you see what i 've realised over ten years - and i 've been talking about this as i go round the country - is that yes in 1997 we had to do things and almost pull a lever , so we had to have a new deal to get people back to work .
we 've got a million people ... now two million people back into work .
in 2007 the challenges are a bit different .
you 've got to involve and engage people far more , so all decisions that we make will have to be build from an understanding of grassroots opinion , people being more engaged in the decision making .
the old method was if a politician went out in the country you have a public meeting .
then we had like television question times .
now what you 've got to do , because we 've got to listen to people 's real concerns , is engage people in discussing right through a big issue .
you know , it could be the health service , it could be drugs , these are big issues about how our community is changing as a result of globalisation .
it could be smoking , i did one on that .
it could be the british way of life , i did one on that .
but what happens is , you ask people , look , here are the problems that we 've got .
we ca n't solve these problems on our own .
we can only solve them if you yourself are in engaged in ... like the environment , you ca n't solve it without personal responsibility and people accepting that they have a role to play .
and then you work through the problem , i believe that citizens ' juries and citizens ' jury service , could become a thing of the future , inviting people in all parts of the country , perhaps on a day like this , 600 constituencies , 100 or 200 or 300 people there discussing an issue through , feed back to government and then government responding and saying this is what we 're going to do as a result .
i think this is an important way of consulting .
jon sopel : okay , you said it when you launched your campaign that the nhs would be your priority and that education would be your passion .
let 's talk about the priority .
what does it mean that the nhs is going to be your priority ?
gordon brown : because i 've been listening to what people say about the nhs and we have got to do better and we will do better , and i think what 's happened is that people see that the new investment is being made , they see the new hospitals , they see that there are nurses being hired , they see the new equipment as well , but i think there 's really three things they want to be sure about , one is that the nhs is here for you when you need it , so people are worried about gps opening hours , about can they have a range of services at a local level for weekends and for after hours .
the second thing is that people are pleased often by the standard of surgical care in the hospital but worried about , in a way , higher aspirations , making them worried about personal care , and so we 've got to deal with these issues of cleanliness in food and standards and aftercare and the time that a doctor and a nurse has to deal with the patient , and if i may just finish with the third thing , is we 've got to lead the world in the new cures from breast cancer to diabetes , to dealing with some of the diseases that have yet to be conquered , britain , with its national health service , can , i believe , lead the world .
jon sopel : is it your problem that you 've been obsessed by targets in the government and despite the billions that you 've pumped in , ordinary people are more concerned about whether their a & e department is going to close or whether they 're going to go into hospital and come out with a super bug .
gordon brown : and we 've got to respond to people 's concerns directly and you 're not a government in the modern world if you 're not listening all the time and responding to these concerns .
jon sopel : so have you been too target driven ?
you 've imposed , i think , 64 targets on the nhs with the treasury monitoring everything from the number of undisclosed invoices paid by nhs bodies to the . and let me read this : " the co-efficient variation of the timed market forces factor adjusted reference cost index through an nhs trust . "
it sounds like you 're trying to suffocate the health service .
gordon brown : no .
what we 're trying to do is to get value for money .
but value for money will be achieved in the longer term , as i have been proposing .
if we can get that real time , local ... you see in new york - i 've been in new york - looked at the police , every week the police ... almost every day , update their results on how they 're performing .
people then challenge the police and say : " look , you can do better in my precinct , in my neighbourhood " and it 's got to be the same for the health service in the future , where at a local level people will be able to get the information about what the waits are , what the standard of care is , how many reported incidents there are of something going wrong whether it 's in the health service or anywhere else , and then challenge .
now that 's where we 're trying to move over the next few years .
jon sopel : well let 's turn from your priority to your passion now and education .
how would you answer this from one of our viewers , susan lang , who has contacted us from lichfield .
she 's said : " why is it only english and welsh students are the only students in the european union who are not allowed to study in scotland for free but it 's our taxes which pays for the rest of the eu to study there ? "
gordon brown : look , the scottish parliament has a budget .
if it chooses to spend its budget on one thing and not the other then it will not be able to spend money if it spends it on reduced fees , on old people or on health care or on something else .
now devolution , like to a local council or to a scottish or welsh parliament , it 's about the local people making the decisions .
but if they use the money for one thing , they ca n't use it for something else .
there is no more money coming from us , from central government .
jon sopel : but you said , when you spoke to the bbc editors on friday , that : " i think you 've got to continue to look at the evolution of the constitution and you 've got to be sensitive to the needs of 85 % of the population who are english . "
it sounds like you think that the english might have a grievance .
gordon brown : i think that the constitution can only work if all parts of the united kingdom feel that it offers them both a recognition of their needs and is sensitive to any complaints that they have .
so if there is a sense in any part of the united kingdom that we 've got to do things better , we 've got to look at it .
jon sopel : do you sense the english have a grievance then ?
gordon brown : i sense that the constitution is in the process , as i said on friday , of evolution , and i sense also that we can respond to some of these concerns in a way that preserves the unity of the united kingdom , and the one thing i 'm clear about , whether it 's been in scotland or wales or in england itself is that people do want , in the majority , to remain part of the united kingdom .
jon sopel : okay , you 've spoken about a government of all the talents , and you tried and failed offering a job to a very senior liberal democrat .
do n't you find yourself a bit like the football association where it goes after the former brazilian coach phil scolari and ends up with steve mcclaren ?
gordon brown : no , because i believe that if you 're looking at how a country can do better in years to come , you 've got to try and build a shared consensus a bit different from a football team , you 've got to try and build a shared consensus about what the authorities are , and you should try to draw on the advice of , and sometimes the engagement in government , of people who have got expertise , who 've got something to offer , who 've been proven to have a certain wisdom in a particular area .
and i think , if you take the example of business , you know , i feel we could do better in the way that we engage the business community in the big decisions about the future of our country .
and so i 'm going to propose over the next few days that we have a business council for britain and that business council will be able to look at , adjudicate to parliament and inquire into the policies that we are pursuing , and it will also be able to look at how some of the parts of business policy at the moment , industrial policy , technology , should be independent of government , like the bank of england is independent is government in government , but i want to draw and have a better relationship with all the great business leaders of our country who should be playing a part in helping us build a stronger economy , and of course , a more prosperous society for the years to come .
jon sopel : okay , let me just go back to lord ashdown , was n't it rather sneaky and underhand .
sir menzies campbell , your friend , had said to you : " no liberal democrat is going to serve " and after he said that to you , you still tried to get off a ...
gordon brown : i 'm not going to get into private conversations but that is a total travesty of actually what happened , but these are confidential conversations and it 's not for me to breach confidences .
the one thing i say is where someone ...
jon sopel : so it 's not true that you went to paddy ashdown ming campbell would say no liberal democrat would serve ?
gordon brown : this is not a correct account of what happened .
it is a travesty of what happened .
what i would say to you is absolutely this , that there are people of expertise , there are people who have got wide experience .
they may not be in your own political party but as was the case of northern ireland , i was talking to someone who had something to offer .
and i think it 's right that we are inclusive .
i think it 's right that we try to draw on all the talents , and i think you 'll see that we are in a position , whether it 's in one capacity or another , to draw on some of the talents of our society who are not normally associated with party political events and forces , because they too believe , like me , that what matters at the end of the day is the future of our country and building a better britain and building a shared sense of national purpose , and i think that people look to us to bring an end to the old politics that are too tribal , that have been too divisive and be inclusive and reach out and try to bring in people who have got something to offer .
jon sopel : very interesting what you say .
so should we expect that come this thursday when you announce the shape of your government , that there will be non-labour members in it at some ministerial level ?
gordon brown : i 'm not going to make any announcements , tempting , you know , when talking to you and not to the house of commons or to any other audience , but i 'm not going to pre-empt any announcement .
jon sopel : but listening to what you said , it sounds like a logical ...
gordon brown : i think the principle that we should work on for the future of british politics is that we have to be far more inquisitive , we have to reach out more , there are people with contributions that they can make - not necessarily in government positions as ministers but contributions they can make to our national life , and there are people of standing whose talents that i will want to draw on to make for a better government of this country .
jon sopel : so without prejudging , then you 've said , yes you would like to have a government without ... with .. you know , maybe some other people that have non-labour party members in it .
gordon brown : well i 've said already , and i actually said on friday , it 's just this , there are some people who are not associated with any political party who 've got an expertise that they can offer .
now it may be they 'd undertake a review for us , it may be that they come in , in an advisory role , it may be in other capacities as well .
but the principle is in my view right , we are talking about building a better britain , a more successful economy , a stronger society , i want to draw on the talents of people who can contribute to that and i think most people watching this programme will say that old tribal divisive politics have got less to offer than an inclusive approach that i 'm talking about .
jon sopel : okay , just one more thing on the new politics .
lord goldsmith amounted that he 's standing down as attorney general .
is it a chance for you to look again at the role of attorney general and maybe depoliticise that role ?
gordon brown : well i 'm talking , as you probably know , about looking at the whole of our constitution .
we 've had some great changes over the last few years but it is time to look again at how parliament can gain more power from the executive and how the people itself can gain more power from parliament and the executive , and of course , in the context of that you would be prepared to look at the role of attorney general .
jon sopel : right , hopefully a couple of simple questions .
are you committed to having a deputy prime minister ?
gordon brown : that 's for me to decide at a later date and not to make any announcements on today .
jon sopel : and are you committed , if you do decide to have a deputy prime minister , that that person should be whoever wins the deputy leadership contest ?
gordon brown : well i 'm not going to get into that because first of all this is not the time to do so when i 've not talked to any of my colleagues before talking to you but also the time to make these decisions is when i announce them on wednesday and thursday .
jon sopel : but i 'm sure if i said : " are you going to have a chancellor of the exchequer ? "
are you going to have a foreign secretary and whatever else , you 'd say yes of course i am .
why ca n't you say you are going to have a deputy prime minister ?
gordon brown : i 'm enjoying the discussion but this is something i have to discuss with my colleagues .
jon sopel : okay , let 's talk about the deputy leadership contest because you 've been stressing the new politics but it seems like the deputy leadership contest at times has seemed like a trip down memory lane with a massive lurch to the left .
gordon brown : i did not and i do n't believe that that is the case .
i think we 've got some very good candidates .
they 've been putting forward their own views , but i also think that no matter what causes you want to throw at me that what they 've said , i mean generally speaking , there 's nobody here is going to serve in the government of the labour party starting on wednesday who is not prepared to support the manifesto of our party .
jon sopel : yes , so i will give you a ...
gordon brown : i thought that was very ...
jon sopel : well exactly .
harriet harman calling for the united states to be taken the security council in guantanamo bay .
john cruddas wanting higher tax rates , peter hain 's appalled by city bonuses .
gordon brown : i think when people make these comments they have got to look at what the policy of our party is , what the policy of the government is pursuing and there will have to be discipline in the government that i lead .
jon sopel : that 's a shot across the bow , is n't it ?
gordon brown : i think it 's very important for people to recognise that as we move forward the manifesto is what we put to the public , we 've got to honour that manifesto , that is an issue of trust that we have with the electorate and people who have additional views to put forward , by all means , put them forward to the next manifesto , but we are not going to go beyond implementing the principles and the policies of this manifesto and somehow change it overnight .
jon sopel : just on one thing that has come out of the deputy leadership contest which does seem to have gained some traction , it 's the idea of councils being allowed to build more council houses .
gordon brown : i think you 'll find that the debate about housing is becoming far broader than it was a few years ago .
in other words , we 've got a national priority to build more houses and of course the private sector will build almost ... the biggest share of them .
housing associations are doing what they can and we will increase the budget for social housing by 50 % and we 've got to look at whether the arrangements that governed the building of housing both to rent and to buy are going to get us the results that we need , which is to meet the demand , particularly - as i found going round the country - of young couples wanting to get onto the housing ladder for the first time , frustrated they 're not able to do , and that 's why i said the new challenge is affordable housing and it 's one that we will address immediately .
jon sopel : so would you build council houses ?
gordon brown : i think you 've got to look at how the public sector as a whole can contribute and then make up your mind about where the right contribution can be made .
jon sopel : so there might be a role for ...
gordon brown : housing associations yes , councils get receipts obviously from the houses that they sell , but i think you 're going to have to be patient and wait till we look at the detail of what has got to be done , because the national priority is that we build houses in a way that they are affordable for people and we 've got to recognise that while more and more people want houses to buy and to own , and this is a great thing , people getting on the housing ladder , there are many also who need houses to rent .
jon sopel : okay .
there 's an eu summit that ended in the wee small hours of saturday morning .
do you sign up fully to what tony blair has agreed in brussels ?
gordon brown : well there were four red lines that we set down , very clear that we could not be overruled on foreign and defence policy or on justice and home policy , or on , if you like , business and social and employment legislation , and we had a particular concern about social security .
i 've read that the detail of what has come out of this , and it seems that all our four red lines , thanks to the negotiating skill of tony , they have been achieved , and i think people when they look at the small print there will see that we did what we set out to do and that was to make sure that in these areas we were properly protected as a country to make our own decisions when we wanted to do so .
jon sopel : so , on the basis of what has been signed , does there need to be a referendum on it ?
gordon brown : well of course there 's going to be a debate about this , but my judgement is that if we were to get these four red lines achieved , and my judgement is that we have achieved these four really demands that britain had of the european union , that that means that just in the case of all the other amending treaties , the nice and maastricht and so on , that the public would not therefore expect there to be a referendum , and i think i 'm right in saying that no other country , and i think there were five who were about to or had had referendums , no other country in the rest of europe now thinks it 's necessary to have a referendum other than those that are constitutionally bound to do so .
jon sopel : i heard the foreign secretary say : " but of course there have been some areas where brussels has more power , there 's been more agreement of qualified majority voting and got the veto .
william hague , the shadow foreign secretary says : " given their manifesto commitment to a referendum on the eve of the constitution the government have absolutely no democratic mandate to introduce these major changes without letting the british people have the final say in a referendum . "
gordon brown : well he would say that , would n't he , but when it came to maastricht when the conservatives were in power , they did n't have a referendum .
you 've got to look at the small print here rather than the political rhetoric and in each of the areas where we set out to achieve our negotiated objectives , either we are not affected directly by the european amended treaty because we have an exemption or an opt-in in some cases , or , alternatively , it does n't count that effect that people claimed on british institutions or british law .
jon sopel : but there is going to be extension of majority voting on foreign policy , a european foreign minister in all but name , end to the national veto on things like transport and energy , those things matter .
gordon brown : well , let 's get to the heart of qualified majority voting .
in each of the major treaties , and actually the biggest one was when mrs thatcher negotiated the single european act , there has been qualified majority voting in many cases because we have asked for it so that we can get decisions made in key areas .
so it 's not a matter of principle that there should never be qualified majority voting .
look , the european union is now 27 , it 's got to work better .
this is not a new constitution , it 's an amending treaty .
all these symbols that were talked about before are not there .
the charter of rights we have got a position in the protocol that protects us , so in the key areas the fundamental issues that people raised beforehand i believe our strong negotiating position has been successful .
jon sopel : so despite the pressure that may come from the mail , the sun , who knows whichever papers , and the opposition political parties - no referendum ?
gordon brown : well it looks on the face of it , and we 're just getting all the details obviously of what has been agreed and what has been published , and particularly the protocols which go side by side with the other decisions that have been made , that all four of what we set out to achieve as our negotiating red lines we have met our objectives in that and therefore the issues that we were worried about have been dealt with .
and as with the other treaties in the past , and as i suspect with other countries who have decided to hold a referendum before but are not going to do so now , we see us having met our negotiated objectives .
jon sopel : now you just praised there tony blair 's negotiating skills .
it 's being touted around that he might become a middle east envoy for the quartet .
what would you think of that ?
gordon brown : well i think tony blair not only has made an immense contribution , not just to our national life but to the international community , but obviously has a very major contribution that if he chooses to make and i believe he will be pressed to make that contribution , he should be invited to make .
and tony blair has a great knowledge of both reconciliation on how to make it happen as we 've done from northern ireland and a great interest in the areas that we 're just talking about .
and so what tony blair can do to help both world peace and prosperity over the next few years is something that no doubt he will be considering and obviously i hope he 's in a position to make a contribution .
jon sopel : so you say he will be pressed , this is real , this is ... it sounds like you 're making it sound like it 's quite close that he will become the middle east envoy for the quartet .
gordon brown : now hold on , i do n't know the individual discussions that have taken place but you know in many areas tony will be asked , as i suspect you will know , to make a contribution , whether it 's on interfaith dialogue in which he 's got a great interest , or on the future of africa where he 's taken himself a very big role in trying to make possible some of the breakthroughs we 've had in debt relief and on aid and the on the empowerment of the poor and developing countries .
in all these areas i think people will continue to press tony to do things and no doubt he 'll choose what is the best contribution that he thinks he can make to public life in the future .
jon sopel : is there going to be any difference in your relationship with president bush ?
gordon brown : i think the relationship between a british prime minister and an american president has always got to be a strong one .
no , i have not known president bush in the way that tony blair has known president bush , and obviously they 've had a relationship from exactly the time that president bush took over , but i believe that the relationship between britain and america is fundamental to our future success .
i find it strange that we have political parties in this country saying that they 're now anti-european and anti-american .
the whole purpose of a good foreign policy is to build alliances for progress and i want us to play a part in what i think will be a very big issue , and that 's reshaping the international institutions , but fundamental to our partnerships and alliances are our relationship with europe , our relationship with america and of course our relationship with the commonwealth .
jon sopel : okay .
we started this interview talking about how your government was going to be different to tony blair 's , how are you going to personally change in maybe the way that you deal with your colleagues ?
gordon brown : i think when you 're chancellor , let 's be honest , you 've got to say to people if they come for money - no .
and it 's a different job from being the leader of the party where i believe you 've got to bring people together and you 've got to reach out .
in the country as a whole which is what i find most exciting of all , the challenge in modern politics you know is to build a shared sense of national purpose .
the challenge is to try and get people together and build a consensus .
so we 've got long-term decisions we 've got to make about how much and how ... and what polity we invest in education , about what we 've got to do about science and innovation .
you 've got to build a national consensus .
so i believe that the role that i 've got to play is bringing people together to make sure that we , britain , can have a strong sense of shared purpose in the way that other countries also do .
jon sopel : this weekend tony blair has gone off to see the pope amid speculation that he may be converting to catholicism .
can i ask you what part will your faith play when you become prime minister ?
gordon brown : as you know , i grew up and my father was a minister to the church , and has been a very strong influence in my life .
i think the most important thing it 's taught me is to treat everybody equally , to show respect to all people and to feel a sense of responsibility to other people , and i 'm not one of those people who want to lecture of hector about what is i think essentially a very personal thing .
but i am very clear , as someone who has strong convictions that what i grew up with and what i was taught when i was young has had a huge influence in my life .
jon sopel : and a final personal thing , are you concerned for your family given the exposure that you 're all going to be subject to once you move into no.10 ?
gordon brown : i think we 've had to live with some of it for the last few years .
obviously i hope people will respect that i 've got very , very young children , but i think also people have a right to know who you are , what you believe , what you stand for , what you 're trying to achieve , so that is very much part of the job that you 've got to show people that you are who you are and not try to sort of use some excuse to run away from the attention that you 've got to have , and people have a right to know what you want to say .

test yourself with the gordon brown quiz here ...
" thanks to the negotiating skill of tony they -lsb- four red lines -rsb- have been achieved , " he said " and i think people when they look at the small print will see that we did what we set out to do and that was to make sure that in these areas we were properly protected as a country to make our own decisions when we want to do so . "
" on the face of it , " he continued , " we 've got all the details coming through from all the protocols as well as the amending treaty itself what we set out to achieve which is protecting the british national interest in these four crucial areas .
" for example , the charter of rights , we should be protected in british law on that and all the other areas we seem to have been able thanks to the negotiation to have achieved that .
" on that basis , like every other treaty that has been negotiated - nice , amsterdam , maastricht - and that while many other people will call for a referendum it seems to me that we have met our negotiating position . "
blair 's experience mr brown was asked about the idea of tony blair becoming a middle east envoy for the major powers .
he responded warmly to the idea , saying : " i think tony blair , " he insisted , " not only has made an immense contribution not just to our national life , but to the international community , but obviously has a very great contribution that if he chooses to make , and i believe he will be pressed to make that contribution , that he should be invited to make .
" tony blair has a great knowledge both of reconciliation , and how to make it happen as we found from northern ireland , and a great interest in the areas we were just talking about . "
underhand approach ?
jon sopel put to mr brown that he appeared to have acted in an underhand way when he offered lord ashdown a job , after ming campbell had said " no " lib dem would serve .
mr brown angrily rejected this accusation saying " this is not a correct account of what happened - it is a total travesty of what happened .
" what i would say to you is absolutely this ... that there are people of expertise and wide experience .
" they may not be in your own political party but in the case of northern ireland , i was talking to someone who had something to offer and i think it 's right that we are inclusive and it 's right to draw on all the talents , and i think you will see that we are in a position whether it 's in one capacity or another to draw on some of the talents of our society who are not normally associated with party political events and forces . "
leaning left ?
mr brown was asked whether or not deputy leadership candidates had hinted at shifts to the left on issues like trident , taxes and relations with the us .
gordon brown sent a shot across their bows : " nobody is going to serve in the government of the labour party starting on wednesday who is not prepared to support the manifesto of our party .
" when people make these comments , they have got to look at what the policy of our party is and the policy the government is pursuing and there will have to be discipline in the government that i lead . "
council housing retreat he also appeared to retreat from his own recent statements suggesting that more council houses might be built : " i think you 've got to look at how the public sector as a whole can contribute and then make up your mind about where the right contribution can be made .
" housing associations yes - councils get receipts obviously from the houses that they sell , but i think you 're going to have to be patient and wait until we look at the detail of what is going to be done . "
law and order mr brown suggested a new role for citizens ' juries - akin to jury service in criminal trials , in which ordinary people would contribute to the policy-making process .
he said : " i believe that citizens ' juries and citizens ' jury service could become a thing of the future - inviting people from all parts of the country , 600 constituencies , one , two or three hundred people discussing an issue through , feedback to government and then government responding and saying this is what we are going to do as a result .
" this is an important way of consulting . "
business advisory council and he announced the setting up of a business advisory council , in which business leaders would keep him informed about the issues of most concern to them : " if you take the example of business , you know i feel that we could do better in the way we engage the business community in the big decisions about the future of our country .
" and so i 'm going to propose over the next few days that we have a business council for britain , and that business council will be able to look at , adjudicate upon , inquire into the policies that we are pursuing .
" it will also be able to look at how some of the parts of business policy at the moment , the industrial policy , technology policy , should be independent of the government , like the bank of england is independent of government .
" but i want to draw on and have a better relationship with all the great business leaders of our country who should be playing a part in helping us build a stronger economy , and of course a more prosperous society for the years to come . "
scotland 's funding gordon brown also made it clear that there would be no more money to the scottish parliament from central government .
" the scottish parliament has a budget .
if it chooses to spend its budget on one thing and not the other , then it will not be able to spend the money .
" if it spends it on reduced fees - on old people or healthcare of something else ¿ there is no more money coming from us in central government . "
interview transcript jon sopel : gordon brown , how is your government going to be different to tony blair 's ?
gordon brown : new challenges , new priorities , new ways of governing .
i think what people are seeing is in 2007 what we 've got to do is quite different from some of the things we had to do in 1997 , so we 've got the problem of climate change , we 've got global economic competition , we 've got the problem also of terrorism and security , but equally we 've got the issue of people 's rising aspirations .
so people want better health care , they want schools to be of the highest standard , they want our public services to be tailored to their needs , and it 's responding to people 's rising aspirations partly because of our success but partly because people legitimately have higher expectations of government .
there is the challenge particularly for public services in the years to come .
jon sopel : but how can you argue that gordon brown is going to be a big change when you 've been one of the principal architects of the past ten years of government ?
gordon brown : well you see what i 've realised over ten years - and i 've been talking about this as i go round the country - is that yes in 1997 we had to do things and almost pull a lever , so we had to have a new deal to get people back to work .
we 've got a million people ... now two million people back into work .
in 2007 the challenges are a bit different .
you 've got to involve and engage people far more , so all decisions that we make will have to be build from an understanding of grassroots opinion , people being more engaged in the decision making .
the old method was if a politician went out in the country you have a public meeting .
then we had like television question times .
now what you 've got to do , because we 've got to listen to people 's real concerns , is engage people in discussing right through a big issue .
you know , it could be the health service , it could be drugs , these are big issues about how our community is changing as a result of globalisation .
it could be smoking , i did one on that .
it could be the british way of life , i did one on that .
but what happens is , you ask people , look , here are the problems that we 've got .
we ca n't solve these problems on our own .
we can only solve them if you yourself are in engaged in ... like the environment , you ca n't solve it without personal responsibility and people accepting that they have a role to play .
and then you work through the problem , i believe that citizens ' juries and citizens ' jury service , could become a thing of the future , inviting people in all parts of the country , perhaps on a day like this , 600 constituencies , 100 or 200 or 300 people there discussing an issue through , feed back to government and then government responding and saying this is what we 're going to do as a result .
i think this is an important way of consulting .
jon sopel : okay , you said it when you launched your campaign that the nhs would be your priority and that education would be your passion .
let 's talk about the priority .
what does it mean that the nhs is going to be your priority ?
gordon brown : because i 've been listening to what people say about the nhs and we have got to do better and we will do better , and i think what 's happened is that people see that the new investment is being made , they see the new hospitals , they see that there are nurses being hired , they see the new equipment as well , but i think there 's really three things they want to be sure about , one is that the nhs is here for you when you need it , so people are worried about gps opening hours , about can they have a range of services at a local level for weekends and for after hours .
the second thing is that people are pleased often by the standard of surgical care in the hospital but worried about , in a way , higher aspirations , making them worried about personal care , and so we 've got to deal with these issues of cleanliness in food and standards and aftercare and the time that a doctor and a nurse has to deal with the patient , and if i may just finish with the third thing , is we 've got to lead the world in the new cures from breast cancer to diabetes , to dealing with some of the diseases that have yet to be conquered , britain , with its national health service , can , i believe , lead the world .
jon sopel : is it your problem that you 've been obsessed by targets in the government and despite the billions that you 've pumped in , ordinary people are more concerned about whether their a & e department is going to close or whether they 're going to go into hospital and come out with a super bug .
gordon brown : and we 've got to respond to people 's concerns directly and you 're not a government in the modern world if you 're not listening all the time and responding to these concerns .
jon sopel : so have you been too target driven ?
you 've imposed , i think , 64 targets on the nhs with the treasury monitoring everything from the number of undisclosed invoices paid by nhs bodies to the . and let me read this : " the co-efficient variation of the timed market forces factor adjusted reference cost index through an nhs trust . "
it sounds like you 're trying to suffocate the health service .
gordon brown : no .
what we 're trying to do is to get value for money .
but value for money will be achieved in the longer term , as i have been proposing .
if we can get that real time , local ... you see in new york - i 've been in new york - looked at the police , every week the police ... almost every day , update their results on how they 're performing .
people then challenge the police and say : " look , you can do better in my precinct , in my neighbourhood " and it 's got to be the same for the health service in the future , where at a local level people will be able to get the information about what the waits are , what the standard of care is , how many reported incidents there are of something going wrong whether it 's in the health service or anywhere else , and then challenge .
now that 's where we 're trying to move over the next few years .
jon sopel : well let 's turn from your priority to your passion now and education .
how would you answer this from one of our viewers , susan lang , who has contacted us from lichfield .
she 's said : " why is it only english and welsh students are the only students in the european union who are not allowed to study in scotland for free but it 's our taxes which pays for the rest of the eu to study there ? "
gordon brown : look , the scottish parliament has a budget .
if it chooses to spend its budget on one thing and not the other then it will not be able to spend money if it spends it on reduced fees , on old people or on health care or on something else .
now devolution , like to a local council or to a scottish or welsh parliament , it 's about the local people making the decisions .
but if they use the money for one thing , they ca n't use it for something else .
there is no more money coming from us , from central government .
jon sopel : but you said , when you spoke to the bbc editors on friday , that : " i think you 've got to continue to look at the evolution of the constitution and you 've got to be sensitive to the needs of 85 % of the population who are english . "
it sounds like you think that the english might have a grievance .
gordon brown : i think that the constitution can only work if all parts of the united kingdom feel that it offers them both a recognition of their needs and is sensitive to any complaints that they have .
so if there is a sense in any part of the united kingdom that we 've got to do things better , we 've got to look at it .
jon sopel : do you sense the english have a grievance then ?
gordon brown : i sense that the constitution is in the process , as i said on friday , of evolution , and i sense also that we can respond to some of these concerns in a way that preserves the unity of the united kingdom , and the one thing i 'm clear about , whether it 's been in scotland or wales or in england itself is that people do want , in the majority , to remain part of the united kingdom .
jon sopel : okay , you 've spoken about a government of all the talents , and you tried and failed offering a job to a very senior liberal democrat .
do n't you find yourself a bit like the football association where it goes after the former brazilian coach phil scolari and ends up with steve mcclaren ?
gordon brown : no , because i believe that if you 're looking at how a country can do better in years to come , you 've got to try and build a shared consensus a bit different from a football team , you 've got to try and build a shared consensus about what the authorities are , and you should try to draw on the advice of , and sometimes the engagement in government , of people who have got expertise , who 've got something to offer , who 've been proven to have a certain wisdom in a particular area .
and i think , if you take the example of business , you know , i feel we could do better in the way that we engage the business community in the big decisions about the future of our country .
and so i 'm going to propose over the next few days that we have a business council for britain and that business council will be able to look at , adjudicate to parliament and inquire into the policies that we are pursuing , and it will also be able to look at how some of the parts of business policy at the moment , industrial policy , technology , should be independent of government , like the bank of england is independent is government in government , but i want to draw and have a better relationship with all the great business leaders of our country who should be playing a part in helping us build a stronger economy , and of course , a more prosperous society for the years to come .
jon sopel : okay , let me just go back to lord ashdown , was n't it rather sneaky and underhand .
sir menzies campbell , your friend , had said to you : " no liberal democrat is going to serve " and after he said that to you , you still tried to get off a ...
gordon brown : i 'm not going to get into private conversations but that is a total travesty of actually what happened , but these are confidential conversations and it 's not for me to breach confidences .
the one thing i say is where someone ...
jon sopel : so it 's not true that you went to paddy ashdown ming campbell would say no liberal democrat would serve ?
gordon brown : this is not a correct account of what happened .
it is a travesty of what happened .
what i would say to you is absolutely this , that there are people of expertise , there are people who have got wide experience .
they may not be in your own political party but as was the case of northern ireland , i was talking to someone who had something to offer .
and i think it 's right that we are inclusive .
i think it 's right that we try to draw on all the talents , and i think you 'll see that we are in a position , whether it 's in one capacity or another , to draw on some of the talents of our society who are not normally associated with party political events and forces , because they too believe , like me , that what matters at the end of the day is the future of our country and building a better britain and building a shared sense of national purpose , and i think that people look to us to bring an end to the old politics that are too tribal , that have been too divisive and be inclusive and reach out and try to bring in people who have got something to offer .
jon sopel : very interesting what you say .
so should we expect that come this thursday when you announce the shape of your government , that there will be non-labour members in it at some ministerial level ?
gordon brown : i 'm not going to make any announcements , tempting , you know , when talking to you and not to the house of commons or to any other audience , but i 'm not going to pre-empt any announcement .
jon sopel : but listening to what you said , it sounds like a logical ...
gordon brown : i think the principle that we should work on for the future of british politics is that we have to be far more inquisitive , we have to reach out more , there are people with contributions that they can make - not necessarily in government positions as ministers but contributions they can make to our national life , and there are people of standing whose talents that i will want to draw on to make for a better government of this country .
jon sopel : so without prejudging , then you 've said , yes you would like to have a government without ... with .. you know , maybe some other people that have non-labour party members in it .
gordon brown : well i 've said already , and i actually said on friday , it 's just this , there are some people who are not associated with any political party who 've got an expertise that they can offer .
now it may be they 'd undertake a review for us , it may be that they come in , in an advisory role , it may be in other capacities as well .
but the principle is in my view right , we are talking about building a better britain , a more successful economy , a stronger society , i want to draw on the talents of people who can contribute to that and i think most people watching this programme will say that old tribal divisive politics have got less to offer than an inclusive approach that i 'm talking about .
jon sopel : okay , just one more thing on the new politics .
lord goldsmith amounted that he 's standing down as attorney general .
is it a chance for you to look again at the role of attorney general and maybe depoliticise that role ?
gordon brown : well i 'm talking , as you probably know , about looking at the whole of our constitution .
we 've had some great changes over the last few years but it is time to look again at how parliament can gain more power from the executive and how the people itself can gain more power from parliament and the executive , and of course , in the context of that you would be prepared to look at the role of attorney general .
jon sopel : right , hopefully a couple of simple questions .
are you committed to having a deputy prime minister ?
gordon brown : that 's for me to decide at a later date and not to make any announcements on today .
jon sopel : and are you committed , if you do decide to have a deputy prime minister , that that person should be whoever wins the deputy leadership contest ?
gordon brown : well i 'm not going to get into that because first of all this is not the time to do so when i 've not talked to any of my colleagues before talking to you but also the time to make these decisions is when i announce them on wednesday and thursday .
jon sopel : but i 'm sure if i said : " are you going to have a chancellor of the exchequer ? "
are you going to have a foreign secretary and whatever else , you 'd say yes of course i am .
why ca n't you say you are going to have a deputy prime minister ?
gordon brown : i 'm enjoying the discussion but this is something i have to discuss with my colleagues .
jon sopel : okay , let 's talk about the deputy leadership contest because you 've been stressing the new politics but it seems like the deputy leadership contest at times has seemed like a trip down memory lane with a massive lurch to the left .
gordon brown : i did not and i do n't believe that that is the case .
i think we 've got some very good candidates .
they 've been putting forward their own views , but i also think that no matter what causes you want to throw at me that what they 've said , i mean generally speaking , there 's nobody here is going to serve in the government of the labour party starting on wednesday who is not prepared to support the manifesto of our party .
jon sopel : yes , so i will give you a ...
gordon brown : i thought that was very ...
jon sopel : well exactly .
harriet harman calling for the united states to be taken the security council in guantanamo bay .
john cruddas wanting higher tax rates , peter hain 's appalled by city bonuses .
gordon brown : i think when people make these comments they have got to look at what the policy of our party is , what the policy of the government is pursuing and there will have to be discipline in the government that i lead .
jon sopel : that 's a shot across the bow , is n't it ?
gordon brown : i think it 's very important for people to recognise that as we move forward the manifesto is what we put to the public , we 've got to honour that manifesto , that is an issue of trust that we have with the electorate and people who have additional views to put forward , by all means , put them forward to the next manifesto , but we are not going to go beyond implementing the principles and the policies of this manifesto and somehow change it overnight .
jon sopel : just on one thing that has come out of the deputy leadership contest which does seem to have gained some traction , it 's the idea of councils being allowed to build more council houses .
gordon brown : i think you 'll find that the debate about housing is becoming far broader than it was a few years ago .
in other words , we 've got a national priority to build more houses and of course the private sector will build almost ... the biggest share of them .
housing associations are doing what they can and we will increase the budget for social housing by 50 % and we 've got to look at whether the arrangements that governed the building of housing both to rent and to buy are going to get us the results that we need , which is to meet the demand , particularly - as i found going round the country - of young couples wanting to get onto the housing ladder for the first time , frustrated they 're not able to do , and that 's why i said the new challenge is affordable housing and it 's one that we will address immediately .
jon sopel : so would you build council houses ?
gordon brown : i think you 've got to look at how the public sector as a whole can contribute and then make up your mind about where the right contribution can be made .
jon sopel : so there might be a role for ...
gordon brown : housing associations yes , councils get receipts obviously from the houses that they sell , but i think you 're going to have to be patient and wait till we look at the detail of what has got to be done , because the national priority is that we build houses in a way that they are affordable for people and we 've got to recognise that while more and more people want houses to buy and to own , and this is a great thing , people getting on the housing ladder , there are many also who need houses to rent .
jon sopel : okay .
there 's an eu summit that ended in the wee small hours of saturday morning .
do you sign up fully to what tony blair has agreed in brussels ?
gordon brown : well there were four red lines that we set down , very clear that we could not be overruled on foreign and defence policy or on justice and home policy , or on , if you like , business and social and employment legislation , and we had a particular concern about social security .
i 've read that the detail of what has come out of this , and it seems that all our four red lines , thanks to the negotiating skill of tony , they have been achieved , and i think people when they look at the small print there will see that we did what we set out to do and that was to make sure that in these areas we were properly protected as a country to make our own decisions when we wanted to do so .
jon sopel : so , on the basis of what has been signed , does there need to be a referendum on it ?
gordon brown : well of course there 's going to be a debate about this , but my judgement is that if we were to get these four red lines achieved , and my judgement is that we have achieved these four really demands that britain had of the european union , that that means that just in the case of all the other amending treaties , the nice and maastricht and so on , that the public would not therefore expect there to be a referendum , and i think i 'm right in saying that no other country , and i think there were five who were about to or had had referendums , no other country in the rest of europe now thinks it 's necessary to have a referendum other than those that are constitutionally bound to do so .
jon sopel : i heard the foreign secretary say : " but of course there have been some areas where brussels has more power , there 's been more agreement of qualified majority voting and got the veto .
william hague , the shadow foreign secretary says : " given their manifesto commitment to a referendum on the eve of the constitution the government have absolutely no democratic mandate to introduce these major changes without letting the british people have the final say in a referendum . "
gordon brown : well he would say that , would n't he , but when it came to maastricht when the conservatives were in power , they did n't have a referendum .
you 've got to look at the small print here rather than the political rhetoric and in each of the areas where we set out to achieve our negotiated objectives , either we are not affected directly by the european amended treaty because we have an exemption or an opt-in in some cases , or , alternatively , it does n't count that effect that people claimed on british institutions or british law .
jon sopel : but there is going to be extension of majority voting on foreign policy , a european foreign minister in all but name , end to the national veto on things like transport and energy , those things matter .
gordon brown : well , let 's get to the heart of qualified majority voting .
in each of the major treaties , and actually the biggest one was when mrs thatcher negotiated the single european act , there has been qualified majority voting in many cases because we have asked for it so that we can get decisions made in key areas .
so it 's not a matter of principle that there should never be qualified majority voting .
look , the european union is now 27 , it 's got to work better .
this is not a new constitution , it 's an amending treaty .
all these symbols that were talked about before are not there .
the charter of rights we have got a position in the protocol that protects us , so in the key areas the fundamental issues that people raised beforehand i believe our strong negotiating position has been successful .
jon sopel : so despite the pressure that may come from the mail , the sun , who knows whichever papers , and the opposition political parties - no referendum ?
gordon brown : well it looks on the face of it , and we 're just getting all the details obviously of what has been agreed and what has been published , and particularly the protocols which go side by side with the other decisions that have been made , that all four of what we set out to achieve as our negotiating red lines we have met our objectives in that and therefore the issues that we were worried about have been dealt with .
and as with the other treaties in the past , and as i suspect with other countries who have decided to hold a referendum before but are not going to do so now , we see us having met our negotiated objectives .
jon sopel : now you just praised there tony blair 's negotiating skills .
it 's being touted around that he might become a middle east envoy for the quartet .
what would you think of that ?
gordon brown : well i think tony blair not only has made an immense contribution , not just to our national life but to the international community , but obviously has a very major contribution that if he chooses to make and i believe he will be pressed to make that contribution , he should be invited to make .
and tony blair has a great knowledge of both reconciliation on how to make it happen as we 've done from northern ireland and a great interest in the areas that we 're just talking about .
and so what tony blair can do to help both world peace and prosperity over the next few years is something that no doubt he will be considering and obviously i hope he 's in a position to make a contribution .
jon sopel : so you say he will be pressed , this is real , this is ... it sounds like you 're making it sound like it 's quite close that he will become the middle east envoy for the quartet .
gordon brown : now hold on , i do n't know the individual discussions that have taken place but you know in many areas tony will be asked , as i suspect you will know , to make a contribution , whether it 's on interfaith dialogue in which he 's got a great interest , or on the future of africa where he 's taken himself a very big role in trying to make possible some of the breakthroughs we 've had in debt relief and on aid and the on the empowerment of the poor and developing countries .
in all these areas i think people will continue to press tony to do things and no doubt he 'll choose what is the best contribution that he thinks he can make to public life in the future .
jon sopel : is there going to be any difference in your relationship with president bush ?
gordon brown : i think the relationship between a british prime minister and an american president has always got to be a strong one .
no , i have not known president bush in the way that tony blair has known president bush , and obviously they 've had a relationship from exactly the time that president bush took over , but i believe that the relationship between britain and america is fundamental to our future success .
i find it strange that we have political parties in this country saying that they 're now anti-european and anti-american .
the whole purpose of a good foreign policy is to build alliances for progress and i want us to play a part in what i think will be a very big issue , and that 's reshaping the international institutions , but fundamental to our partnerships and alliances are our relationship with europe , our relationship with america and of course our relationship with the commonwealth .
jon sopel : okay .
we started this interview talking about how your government was going to be different to tony blair 's , how are you going to personally change in maybe the way that you deal with your colleagues ?
gordon brown : i think when you 're chancellor , let 's be honest , you 've got to say to people if they come for money - no .
and it 's a different job from being the leader of the party where i believe you 've got to bring people together and you 've got to reach out .
in the country as a whole which is what i find most exciting of all , the challenge in modern politics you know is to build a shared sense of national purpose .
the challenge is to try and get people together and build a consensus .
so we 've got long-term decisions we 've got to make about how much and how ... and what polity we invest in education , about what we 've got to do about science and innovation .
you 've got to build a national consensus .
so i believe that the role that i 've got to play is bringing people together to make sure that we , britain , can have a strong sense of shared purpose in the way that other countries also do .
jon sopel : this weekend tony blair has gone off to see the pope amid speculation that he may be converting to catholicism .
can i ask you what part will your faith play when you become prime minister ?
gordon brown : as you know , i grew up and my father was a minister to the church , and has been a very strong influence in my life .
i think the most important thing it 's taught me is to treat everybody equally , to show respect to all people and to feel a sense of responsibility to other people , and i 'm not one of those people who want to lecture of hector about what is i think essentially a very personal thing .
but i am very clear , as someone who has strong convictions that what i grew up with and what i was taught when i was young has had a huge influence in my life .
jon sopel : and a final personal thing , are you concerned for your family given the exposure that you 're all going to be subject to once you move into no.10 ?
gordon brown : i think we 've had to live with some of it for the last few years .
obviously i hope people will respect that i 've got very , very young children , but i think also people have a right to know who you are , what you believe , what you stand for , what you 're trying to achieve , so that is very much part of the job that you 've got to show people that you are who you are and not try to sort of use some excuse to run away from the attention that you 've got to have , and people have a right to know what you want to say .

test yourself with the gordon brown quiz here ...
" thanks to the negotiating skill of tony they -lsb- four red lines -rsb- have been achieved , " he said " and i think people when they look at the small print will see that we did what we set out to do and that was to make sure that in these areas we were properly protected as a country to make our own decisions when we want to do so . "
" on the face of it , " he continued , " we 've got all the details coming through from all the protocols as well as the amending treaty itself what we set out to achieve which is protecting the british national interest in these four crucial areas .
" for example , the charter of rights , we should be protected in british law on that and all the other areas we seem to have been able thanks to the negotiation to have achieved that .
" on that basis , like every other treaty that has been negotiated - nice , amsterdam , maastricht - and that while many other people will call for a referendum it seems to me that we have met our negotiating position . "
blair 's experience mr brown was asked about the idea of tony blair becoming a middle east envoy for the major powers .
he responded warmly to the idea , saying : " i think tony blair , " he insisted , " not only has made an immense contribution not just to our national life , but to the international community , but obviously has a very great contribution that if he chooses to make , and i believe he will be pressed to make that contribution , that he should be invited to make .
" tony blair has a great knowledge both of reconciliation , and how to make it happen as we found from northern ireland , and a great interest in the areas we were just talking about . "
underhand approach ?
jon sopel put to mr brown that he appeared to have acted in an underhand way when he offered lord ashdown a job , after ming campbell had said " no " lib dem would serve .
mr brown angrily rejected this accusation saying " this is not a correct account of what happened - it is a total travesty of what happened .
" what i would say to you is absolutely this ... that there are people of expertise and wide experience .
" they may not be in your own political party but in the case of northern ireland , i was talking to someone who had something to offer and i think it 's right that we are inclusive and it 's right to draw on all the talents , and i think you will see that we are in a position whether it 's in one capacity or another to draw on some of the talents of our society who are not normally associated with party political events and forces . "
leaning left ?
mr brown was asked whether or not deputy leadership candidates had hinted at shifts to the left on issues like trident , taxes and relations with the us .
gordon brown sent a shot across their bows : " nobody is going to serve in the government of the labour party starting on wednesday who is not prepared to support the manifesto of our party .
" when people make these comments , they have got to look at what the policy of our party is and the policy the government is pursuing and there will have to be discipline in the government that i lead . "
council housing retreat he also appeared to retreat from his own recent statements suggesting that more council houses might be built : " i think you 've got to look at how the public sector as a whole can contribute and then make up your mind about where the right contribution can be made .
" housing associations yes - councils get receipts obviously from the houses that they sell , but i think you 're going to have to be patient and wait until we look at the detail of what is going to be done . "
law and order mr brown suggested a new role for citizens ' juries - akin to jury service in criminal trials , in which ordinary people would contribute to the policy-making process .
he said : " i believe that citizens ' juries and citizens ' jury service could become a thing of the future - inviting people from all parts of the country , 600 constituencies , one , two or three hundred people discussing an issue through , feedback to government and then government responding and saying this is what we are going to do as a result .
" this is an important way of consulting . "
business advisory council and he announced the setting up of a business advisory council , in which business leaders would keep him informed about the issues of most concern to them : " if you take the example of business , you know i feel that we could do better in the way we engage the business community in the big decisions about the future of our country .
" and so i 'm going to propose over the next few days that we have a business council for britain , and that business council will be able to look at , adjudicate upon , inquire into the policies that we are pursuing .
" it will also be able to look at how some of the parts of business policy at the moment , the industrial policy , technology policy , should be independent of the government , like the bank of england is independent of government .
" but i want to draw on and have a better relationship with all the great business leaders of our country who should be playing a part in helping us build a stronger economy , and of course a more prosperous society for the years to come . "
scotland 's funding gordon brown also made it clear that there would be no more money to the scottish parliament from central government .
" the scottish parliament has a budget .
if it chooses to spend its budget on one thing and not the other , then it will not be able to spend the money .
" if it spends it on reduced fees - on old people or healthcare of something else ¿ there is no more money coming from us in central government . "
interview transcript jon sopel : gordon brown , how is your government going to be different to tony blair 's ?
gordon brown : new challenges , new priorities , new ways of governing .
i think what people are seeing is in 2007 what we 've got to do is quite different from some of the things we had to do in 1997 , so we 've got the problem of climate change , we 've got global economic competition , we 've got the problem also of terrorism and security , but equally we 've got the issue of people 's rising aspirations .
so people want better health care , they want schools to be of the highest standard , they want our public services to be tailored to their needs , and it 's responding to people 's rising aspirations partly because of our success but partly because people legitimately have higher expectations of government .
there is the challenge particularly for public services in the years to come .
jon sopel : but how can you argue that gordon brown is going to be a big change when you 've been one of the principal architects of the past ten years of government ?
gordon brown : well you see what i 've realised over ten years - and i 've been talking about this as i go round the country - is that yes in 1997 we had to do things and almost pull a lever , so we had to have a new deal to get people back to work .
we 've got a million people ... now two million people back into work .
in 2007 the challenges are a bit different .
you 've got to involve and engage people far more , so all decisions that we make will have to be build from an understanding of grassroots opinion , people being more engaged in the decision making .
the old method was if a politician went out in the country you have a public meeting .
then we had like television question times .
now what you 've got to do , because we 've got to listen to people 's real concerns , is engage people in discussing right through a big issue .
you know , it could be the health service , it could be drugs , these are big issues about how our community is changing as a result of globalisation .
it could be smoking , i did one on that .
it could be the british way of life , i did one on that .
but what happens is , you ask people , look , here are the problems that we 've got .
we ca n't solve these problems on our own .
we can only solve them if you yourself are in engaged in ... like the environment , you ca n't solve it without personal responsibility and people accepting that they have a role to play .
and then you work through the problem , i believe that citizens ' juries and citizens ' jury service , could become a thing of the future , inviting people in all parts of the country , perhaps on a day like this , 600 constituencies , 100 or 200 or 300 people there discussing an issue through , feed back to government and then government responding and saying this is what we 're going to do as a result .
i think this is an important way of consulting .
jon sopel : okay , you said it when you launched your campaign that the nhs would be your priority and that education would be your passion .
let 's talk about the priority .
what does it mean that the nhs is going to be your priority ?
gordon brown : because i 've been listening to what people say about the nhs and we have got to do better and we will do better , and i think what 's happened is that people see that the new investment is being made , they see the new hospitals , they see that there are nurses being hired , they see the new equipment as well , but i think there 's really three things they want to be sure about , one is that the nhs is here for you when you need it , so people are worried about gps opening hours , about can they have a range of services at a local level for weekends and for after hours .
the second thing is that people are pleased often by the standard of surgical care in the hospital but worried about , in a way , higher aspirations , making them worried about personal care , and so we 've got to deal with these issues of cleanliness in food and standards and aftercare and the time that a doctor and a nurse has to deal with the patient , and if i may just finish with the third thing , is we 've got to lead the world in the new cures from breast cancer to diabetes , to dealing with some of the diseases that have yet to be conquered , britain , with its national health service , can , i believe , lead the world .
jon sopel : is it your problem that you 've been obsessed by targets in the government and despite the billions that you 've pumped in , ordinary people are more concerned about whether their a & e department is going to close or whether they 're going to go into hospital and come out with a super bug .
gordon brown : and we 've got to respond to people 's concerns directly and you 're not a government in the modern world if you 're not listening all the time and responding to these concerns .
jon sopel : so have you been too target driven ?
you 've imposed , i think , 64 targets on the nhs with the treasury monitoring everything from the number of undisclosed invoices paid by nhs bodies to the . and let me read this : " the co-efficient variation of the timed market forces factor adjusted reference cost index through an nhs trust . "
it sounds like you 're trying to suffocate the health service .
gordon brown : no .
what we 're trying to do is to get value for money .
but value for money will be achieved in the longer term , as i have been proposing .
if we can get that real time , local ... you see in new york - i 've been in new york - looked at the police , every week the police ... almost every day , update their results on how they 're performing .
people then challenge the police and say : " look , you can do better in my precinct , in my neighbourhood " and it 's got to be the same for the health service in the future , where at a local level people will be able to get the information about what the waits are , what the standard of care is , how many reported incidents there are of something going wrong whether it 's in the health service or anywhere else , and then challenge .
now that 's where we 're trying to move over the next few years .
jon sopel : well let 's turn from your priority to your passion now and education .
how would you answer this from one of our viewers , susan lang , who has contacted us from lichfield .
she 's said : " why is it only english and welsh students are the only students in the european union who are not allowed to study in scotland for free but it 's our taxes which pays for the rest of the eu to study there ? "
gordon brown : look , the scottish parliament has a budget .
if it chooses to spend its budget on one thing and not the other then it will not be able to spend money if it spends it on reduced fees , on old people or on health care or on something else .
now devolution , like to a local council or to a scottish or welsh parliament , it 's about the local people making the decisions .
but if they use the money for one thing , they ca n't use it for something else .
there is no more money coming from us , from central government .
jon sopel : but you said , when you spoke to the bbc editors on friday , that : " i think you 've got to continue to look at the evolution of the constitution and you 've got to be sensitive to the needs of 85 % of the population who are english . "
it sounds like you think that the english might have a grievance .
gordon brown : i think that the constitution can only work if all parts of the united kingdom feel that it offers them both a recognition of their needs and is sensitive to any complaints that they have .
so if there is a sense in any part of the united kingdom that we 've got to do things better , we 've got to look at it .
jon sopel : do you sense the english have a grievance then ?
gordon brown : i sense that the constitution is in the process , as i said on friday , of evolution , and i sense also that we can respond to some of these concerns in a way that preserves the unity of the united kingdom , and the one thing i 'm clear about , whether it 's been in scotland or wales or in england itself is that people do want , in the majority , to remain part of the united kingdom .
jon sopel : okay , you 've spoken about a government of all the talents , and you tried and failed offering a job to a very senior liberal democrat .
do n't you find yourself a bit like the football association where it goes after the former brazilian coach phil scolari and ends up with steve mcclaren ?
gordon brown : no , because i believe that if you 're looking at how a country can do better in years to come , you 've got to try and build a shared consensus a bit different from a football team , you 've got to try and build a shared consensus about what the authorities are , and you should try to draw on the advice of , and sometimes the engagement in government , of people who have got expertise , who 've got something to offer , who 've been proven to have a certain wisdom in a particular area .
and i think , if you take the example of business , you know , i feel we could do better in the way that we engage the business community in the big decisions about the future of our country .
and so i 'm going to propose over the next few days that we have a business council for britain and that business council will be able to look at , adjudicate to parliament and inquire into the policies that we are pursuing , and it will also be able to look at how some of the parts of business policy at the moment , industrial policy , technology , should be independent of government , like the bank of england is independent is government in government , but i want to draw and have a better relationship with all the great business leaders of our country who should be playing a part in helping us build a stronger economy , and of course , a more prosperous society for the years to come .
jon sopel : okay , let me just go back to lord ashdown , was n't it rather sneaky and underhand .
sir menzies campbell , your friend , had said to you : " no liberal democrat is going to serve " and after he said that to you , you still tried to get off a ...
gordon brown : i 'm not going to get into private conversations but that is a total travesty of actually what happened , but these are confidential conversations and it 's not for me to breach confidences .
the one thing i say is where someone ...
jon sopel : so it 's not true that you went to paddy ashdown ming campbell would say no liberal democrat would serve ?
gordon brown : this is not a correct account of what happened .
it is a travesty of what happened .
what i would say to you is absolutely this , that there are people of expertise , there are people who have got wide experience .
they may not be in your own political party but as was the case of northern ireland , i was talking to someone who had something to offer .
and i think it 's right that we are inclusive .
i think it 's right that we try to draw on all the talents , and i think you 'll see that we are in a position , whether it 's in one capacity or another , to draw on some of the talents of our society who are not normally associated with party political events and forces , because they too believe , like me , that what matters at the end of the day is the future of our country and building a better britain and building a shared sense of national purpose , and i think that people look to us to bring an end to the old politics that are too tribal , that have been too divisive and be inclusive and reach out and try to bring in people who have got something to offer .
jon sopel : very interesting what you say .
so should we expect that come this thursday when you announce the shape of your government , that there will be non-labour members in it at some ministerial level ?
gordon brown : i 'm not going to make any announcements , tempting , you know , when talking to you and not to the house of commons or to any other audience , but i 'm not going to pre-empt any announcement .
jon sopel : but listening to what you said , it sounds like a logical ...
gordon brown : i think the principle that we should work on for the future of british politics is that we have to be far more inquisitive , we have to reach out more , there are people with contributions that they can make - not necessarily in government positions as ministers but contributions they can make to our national life , and there are people of standing whose talents that i will want to draw on to make for a better government of this country .
jon sopel : so without prejudging , then you 've said , yes you would like to have a government without ... with .. you know , maybe some other people that have non-labour party members in it .
gordon brown : well i 've said already , and i actually said on friday , it 's just this , there are some people who are not associated with any political party who 've got an expertise that they can offer .
now it may be they 'd undertake a review for us , it may be that they come in , in an advisory role , it may be in other capacities as well .
but the principle is in my view right , we are talking about building a better britain , a more successful economy , a stronger society , i want to draw on the talents of people who can contribute to that and i think most people watching this programme will say that old tribal divisive politics have got less to offer than an inclusive approach that i 'm talking about .
jon sopel : okay , just one more thing on the new politics .
lord goldsmith amounted that he 's standing down as attorney general .
is it a chance for you to look again at the role of attorney general and maybe depoliticise that role ?
gordon brown : well i 'm talking , as you probably know , about looking at the whole of our constitution .
we 've had some great changes over the last few years but it is time to look again at how parliament can gain more power from the executive and how the people itself can gain more power from parliament and the executive , and of course , in the context of that you would be prepared to look at the role of attorney general .
jon sopel : right , hopefully a couple of simple questions .
are you committed to having a deputy prime minister ?
gordon brown : that 's for me to decide at a later date and not to make any announcements on today .
jon sopel : and are you committed , if you do decide to have a deputy prime minister , that that person should be whoever wins the deputy leadership contest ?
gordon brown : well i 'm not going to get into that because first of all this is not the time to do so when i 've not talked to any of my colleagues before talking to you but also the time to make these decisions is when i announce them on wednesday and thursday .
jon sopel : but i 'm sure if i said : " are you going to have a chancellor of the exchequer ? "
are you going to have a foreign secretary and whatever else , you 'd say yes of course i am .
why ca n't you say you are going to have a deputy prime minister ?
gordon brown : i 'm enjoying the discussion but this is something i have to discuss with my colleagues .
jon sopel : okay , let 's talk about the deputy leadership contest because you 've been stressing the new politics but it seems like the deputy leadership contest at times has seemed like a trip down memory lane with a massive lurch to the left .
gordon brown : i did not and i do n't believe that that is the case .
i think we 've got some very good candidates .
they 've been putting forward their own views , but i also think that no matter what causes you want to throw at me that what they 've said , i mean generally speaking , there 's nobody here is going to serve in the government of the labour party starting on wednesday who is not prepared to support the manifesto of our party .
jon sopel : yes , so i will give you a ...
gordon brown : i thought that was very ...
jon sopel : well exactly .
harriet harman calling for the united states to be taken the security council in guantanamo bay .
john cruddas wanting higher tax rates , peter hain 's appalled by city bonuses .
gordon brown : i think when people make these comments they have got to look at what the policy of our party is , what the policy of the government is pursuing and there will have to be discipline in the government that i lead .
jon sopel : that 's a shot across the bow , is n't it ?
gordon brown : i think it 's very important for people to recognise that as we move forward the manifesto is what we put to the public , we 've got to honour that manifesto , that is an issue of trust that we have with the electorate and people who have additional views to put forward , by all means , put them forward to the next manifesto , but we are not going to go beyond implementing the principles and the policies of this manifesto and somehow change it overnight .
jon sopel : just on one thing that has come out of the deputy leadership contest which does seem to have gained some traction , it 's the idea of councils being allowed to build more council houses .
gordon brown : i think you 'll find that the debate about housing is becoming far broader than it was a few years ago .
in other words , we 've got a national priority to build more houses and of course the private sector will build almost ... the biggest share of them .
housing associations are doing what they can and we will increase the budget for social housing by 50 % and we 've got to look at whether the arrangements that governed the building of housing both to rent and to buy are going to get us the results that we need , which is to meet the demand , particularly - as i found going round the country - of young couples wanting to get onto the housing ladder for the first time , frustrated they 're not able to do , and that 's why i said the new challenge is affordable housing and it 's one that we will address immediately .
jon sopel : so would you build council houses ?
gordon brown : i think you 've got to look at how the public sector as a whole can contribute and then make up your mind about where the right contribution can be made .
jon sopel : so there might be a role for ...
gordon brown : housing associations yes , councils get receipts obviously from the houses that they sell , but i think you 're going to have to be patient and wait till we look at the detail of what has got to be done , because the national priority is that we build houses in a way that they are affordable for people and we 've got to recognise that while more and more people want houses to buy and to own , and this is a great thing , people getting on the housing ladder , there are many also who need houses to rent .
jon sopel : okay .
there 's an eu summit that ended in the wee small hours of saturday morning .
do you sign up fully to what tony blair has agreed in brussels ?
gordon brown : well there were four red lines that we set down , very clear that we could not be overruled on foreign and defence policy or on justice and home policy , or on , if you like , business and social and employment legislation , and we had a particular concern about social security .
i 've read that the detail of what has come out of this , and it seems that all our four red lines , thanks to the negotiating skill of tony , they have been achieved , and i think people when they look at the small print there will see that we did what we set out to do and that was to make sure that in these areas we were properly protected as a country to make our own decisions when we wanted to do so .
jon sopel : so , on the basis of what has been signed , does there need to be a referendum on it ?
gordon brown : well of course there 's going to be a debate about this , but my judgement is that if we were to get these four red lines achieved , and my judgement is that we have achieved these four really demands that britain had of the european union , that that means that just in the case of all the other amending treaties , the nice and maastricht and so on , that the public would not therefore expect there to be a referendum , and i think i 'm right in saying that no other country , and i think there were five who were about to or had had referendums , no other country in the rest of europe now thinks it 's necessary to have a referendum other than those that are constitutionally bound to do so .
jon sopel : i heard the foreign secretary say : " but of course there have been some areas where brussels has more power , there 's been more agreement of qualified majority voting and got the veto .
william hague , the shadow foreign secretary says : " given their manifesto commitment to a referendum on the eve of the constitution the government have absolutely no democratic mandate to introduce these major changes without letting the british people have the final say in a referendum . "
gordon brown : well he would say that , would n't he , but when it came to maastricht when the conservatives were in power , they did n't have a referendum .
you 've got to look at the small print here rather than the political rhetoric and in each of the areas where we set out to achieve our negotiated objectives , either we are not affected directly by the european amended treaty because we have an exemption or an opt-in in some cases , or , alternatively , it does n't count that effect that people claimed on british institutions or british law .
jon sopel : but there is going to be extension of majority voting on foreign policy , a european foreign minister in all but name , end to the national veto on things like transport and energy , those things matter .
gordon brown : well , let 's get to the heart of qualified majority voting .
in each of the major treaties , and actually the biggest one was when mrs thatcher negotiated the single european act , there has been qualified majority voting in many cases because we have asked for it so that we can get decisions made in key areas .
so it 's not a matter of principle that there should never be qualified majority voting .
look , the european union is now 27 , it 's got to work better .
this is not a new constitution , it 's an amending treaty .
all these symbols that were talked about before are not there .
the charter of rights we have got a position in the protocol that protects us , so in the key areas the fundamental issues that people raised beforehand i believe our strong negotiating position has been successful .
jon sopel : so despite the pressure that may come from the mail , the sun , who knows whichever papers , and the opposition political parties - no referendum ?
gordon brown : well it looks on the face of it , and we 're just getting all the details obviously of what has been agreed and what has been published , and particularly the protocols which go side by side with the other decisions that have been made , that all four of what we set out to achieve as our negotiating red lines we have met our objectives in that and therefore the issues that we were worried about have been dealt with .
and as with the other treaties in the past , and as i suspect with other countries who have decided to hold a referendum before but are not going to do so now , we see us having met our negotiated objectives .
jon sopel : now you just praised there tony blair 's negotiating skills .
it 's being touted around that he might become a middle east envoy for the quartet .
what would you think of that ?
gordon brown : well i think tony blair not only has made an immense contribution , not just to our national life but to the international community , but obviously has a very major contribution that if he chooses to make and i believe he will be pressed to make that contribution , he should be invited to make .
and tony blair has a great knowledge of both reconciliation on how to make it happen as we 've done from northern ireland and a great interest in the areas that we 're just talking about .
and so what tony blair can do to help both world peace and prosperity over the next few years is something that no doubt he will be considering and obviously i hope he 's in a position to make a contribution .
jon sopel : so you say he will be pressed , this is real , this is ... it sounds like you 're making it sound like it 's quite close that he will become the middle east envoy for the quartet .
gordon brown : now hold on , i do n't know the individual discussions that have taken place but you know in many areas tony will be asked , as i suspect you will know , to make a contribution , whether it 's on interfaith dialogue in which he 's got a great interest , or on the future of africa where he 's taken himself a very big role in trying to make possible some of the breakthroughs we 've had in debt relief and on aid and the on the empowerment of the poor and developing countries .
in all these areas i think people will continue to press tony to do things and no doubt he 'll choose what is the best contribution that he thinks he can make to public life in the future .
jon sopel : is there going to be any difference in your relationship with president bush ?
gordon brown : i think the relationship between a british prime minister and an american president has always got to be a strong one .
no , i have not known president bush in the way that tony blair has known president bush , and obviously they 've had a relationship from exactly the time that president bush took over , but i believe that the relationship between britain and america is fundamental to our future success .
i find it strange that we have political parties in this country saying that they 're now anti-european and anti-american .
the whole purpose of a good foreign policy is to build alliances for progress and i want us to play a part in what i think will be a very big issue , and that 's reshaping the international institutions , but fundamental to our partnerships and alliances are our relationship with europe , our relationship with america and of course our relationship with the commonwealth .
jon sopel : okay .
we started this interview talking about how your government was going to be different to tony blair 's , how are you going to personally change in maybe the way that you deal with your colleagues ?
gordon brown : i think when you 're chancellor , let 's be honest , you 've got to say to people if they come for money - no .
and it 's a different job from being the leader of the party where i believe you 've got to bring people together and you 've got to reach out .
in the country as a whole which is what i find most exciting of all , the challenge in modern politics you know is to build a shared sense of national purpose .
the challenge is to try and get people together and build a consensus .
so we 've got long-term decisions we 've got to make about how much and how ... and what polity we invest in education , about what we 've got to do about science and innovation .
you 've got to build a national consensus .
so i believe that the role that i 've got to play is bringing people together to make sure that we , britain , can have a strong sense of shared purpose in the way that other countries also do .
jon sopel : this weekend tony blair has gone off to see the pope amid speculation that he may be converting to catholicism .
can i ask you what part will your faith play when you become prime minister ?
gordon brown : as you know , i grew up and my father was a minister to the church , and has been a very strong influence in my life .
i think the most important thing it 's taught me is to treat everybody equally , to show respect to all people and to feel a sense of responsibility to other people , and i 'm not one of those people who want to lecture of hector about what is i think essentially a very personal thing .
but i am very clear , as someone who has strong convictions that what i grew up with and what i was taught when i was young has had a huge influence in my life .
jon sopel : and a final personal thing , are you concerned for your family given the exposure that you 're all going to be subject to once you move into no.10 ?
gordon brown : i think we 've had to live with some of it for the last few years .
obviously i hope people will respect that i 've got very , very young children , but i think also people have a right to know who you are , what you believe , what you stand for , what you 're trying to achieve , so that is very much part of the job that you 've got to show people that you are who you are and not try to sort of use some excuse to run away from the attention that you 've got to have , and people have a right to know what you want to say .

test yourself with the gordon brown quiz here ...
" thanks to the negotiating skill of tony they -lsb- four red lines -rsb- have been achieved , " he said " and i think people when they look at the small print will see that we did what we set out to do and that was to make sure that in these areas we were properly protected as a country to make our own decisions when we want to do so . "
" on the face of it , " he continued , " we 've got all the details coming through from all the protocols as well as the amending treaty itself what we set out to achieve which is protecting the british national interest in these four crucial areas .
" for example , the charter of rights , we should be protected in british law on that and all the other areas we seem to have been able thanks to the negotiation to have achieved that .
" on that basis , like every other treaty that has been negotiated - nice , amsterdam , maastricht - and that while many other people will call for a referendum it seems to me that we have met our negotiating position . "
blair 's experience mr brown was asked about the idea of tony blair becoming a middle east envoy for the major powers .
he responded warmly to the idea , saying : " i think tony blair , " he insisted , " not only has made an immense contribution not just to our national life , but to the international community , but obviously has a very great contribution that if he chooses to make , and i believe he will be pressed to make that contribution , that he should be invited to make .
" tony blair has a great knowledge both of reconciliation , and how to make it happen as we found from northern ireland , and a great interest in the areas we were just talking about . "
underhand approach ?
jon sopel put to mr brown that he appeared to have acted in an underhand way when he offered lord ashdown a job , after ming campbell had said " no " lib dem would serve .
mr brown angrily rejected this accusation saying " this is not a correct account of what happened - it is a total travesty of what happened .
" what i would say to you is absolutely this ... that there are people of expertise and wide experience .
" they may not be in your own political party but in the case of northern ireland , i was talking to someone who had something to offer and i think it 's right that we are inclusive and it 's right to draw on all the talents , and i think you will see that we are in a position whether it 's in one capacity or another to draw on some of the talents of our society who are not normally associated with party political events and forces . "
leaning left ?
mr brown was asked whether or not deputy leadership candidates had hinted at shifts to the left on issues like trident , taxes and relations with the us .
gordon brown sent a shot across their bows : " nobody is going to serve in the government of the labour party starting on wednesday who is not prepared to support the manifesto of our party .
" when people make these comments , they have got to look at what the policy of our party is and the policy the government is pursuing and there will have to be discipline in the government that i lead . "
council housing retreat he also appeared to retreat from his own recent statements suggesting that more council houses might be built : " i think you 've got to look at how the public sector as a whole can contribute and then make up your mind about where the right contribution can be made .
" housing associations yes - councils get receipts obviously from the houses that they sell , but i think you 're going to have to be patient and wait until we look at the detail of what is going to be done . "
law and order mr brown suggested a new role for citizens ' juries - akin to jury service in criminal trials , in which ordinary people would contribute to the policy-making process .
he said : " i believe that citizens ' juries and citizens ' jury service could become a thing of the future - inviting people from all parts of the country , 600 constituencies , one , two or three hundred people discussing an issue through , feedback to government and then government responding and saying this is what we are going to do as a result .
" this is an important way of consulting . "
business advisory council and he announced the setting up of a business advisory council , in which business leaders would keep him informed about the issues of most concern to them : " if you take the example of business , you know i feel that we could do better in the way we engage the business community in the big decisions about the future of our country .
" and so i 'm going to propose over the next few days that we have a business council for britain , and that business council will be able to look at , adjudicate upon , inquire into the policies that we are pursuing .
" it will also be able to look at how some of the parts of business policy at the moment , the industrial policy , technology policy , should be independent of the government , like the bank of england is independent of government .
" but i want to draw on and have a better relationship with all the great business leaders of our country who should be playing a part in helping us build a stronger economy , and of course a more prosperous society for the years to come . "
scotland 's funding gordon brown also made it clear that there would be no more money to the scottish parliament from central government .
" the scottish parliament has a budget .
if it chooses to spend its budget on one thing and not the other , then it will not be able to spend the money .
" if it spends it on reduced fees - on old people or healthcare of something else ¿ there is no more money coming from us in central government . "
interview transcript jon sopel : gordon brown , how is your government going to be different to tony blair 's ?
gordon brown : new challenges , new priorities , new ways of governing .
i think what people are seeing is in 2007 what we 've got to do is quite different from some of the things we had to do in 1997 , so we 've got the problem of climate change , we 've got global economic competition , we 've got the problem also of terrorism and security , but equally we 've got the issue of people 's rising aspirations .
so people want better health care , they want schools to be of the highest standard , they want our public services to be tailored to their needs , and it 's responding to people 's rising aspirations partly because of our success but partly because people legitimately have higher expectations of government .
there is the challenge particularly for public services in the years to come .
jon sopel : but how can you argue that gordon brown is going to be a big change when you 've been one of the principal architects of the past ten years of government ?
gordon brown : well you see what i 've realised over ten years - and i 've been talking about this as i go round the country - is that yes in 1997 we had to do things and almost pull a lever , so we had to have a new deal to get people back to work .
we 've got a million people ... now two million people back into work .
in 2007 the challenges are a bit different .
you 've got to involve and engage people far more , so all decisions that we make will have to be build from an understanding of grassroots opinion , people being more engaged in the decision making .
the old method was if a politician went out in the country you have a public meeting .
then we had like television question times .
now what you 've got to do , because we 've got to listen to people 's real concerns , is engage people in discussing right through a big issue .
you know , it could be the health service , it could be drugs , these are big issues about how our community is changing as a result of globalisation .
it could be smoking , i did one on that .
it could be the british way of life , i did one on that .
but what happens is , you ask people , look , here are the problems that we 've got .
we ca n't solve these problems on our own .
we can only solve them if you yourself are in engaged in ... like the environment , you ca n't solve it without personal responsibility and people accepting that they have a role to play .
and then you work through the problem , i believe that citizens ' juries and citizens ' jury service , could become a thing of the future , inviting people in all parts of the country , perhaps on a day like this , 600 constituencies , 100 or 200 or 300 people there discussing an issue through , feed back to government and then government responding and saying this is what we 're going to do as a result .
i think this is an important way of consulting .
jon sopel : okay , you said it when you launched your campaign that the nhs would be your priority and that education would be your passion .
let 's talk about the priority .
what does it mean that the nhs is going to be your priority ?
gordon brown : because i 've been listening to what people say about the nhs and we have got to do better and we will do better , and i think what 's happened is that people see that the new investment is being made , they see the new hospitals , they see that there are nurses being hired , they see the new equipment as well , but i think there 's really three things they want to be sure about , one is that the nhs is here for you when you need it , so people are worried about gps opening hours , about can they have a range of services at a local level for weekends and for after hours .
the second thing is that people are pleased often by the standard of surgical care in the hospital but worried about , in a way , higher aspirations , making them worried about personal care , and so we 've got to deal with these issues of cleanliness in food and standards and aftercare and the time that a doctor and a nurse has to deal with the patient , and if i may just finish with the third thing , is we 've got to lead the world in the new cures from breast cancer to diabetes , to dealing with some of the diseases that have yet to be conquered , britain , with its national health service , can , i believe , lead the world .
jon sopel : is it your problem that you 've been obsessed by targets in the government and despite the billions that you 've pumped in , ordinary people are more concerned about whether their a & e department is going to close or whether they 're going to go into hospital and come out with a super bug .
gordon brown : and we 've got to respond to people 's concerns directly and you 're not a government in the modern world if you 're not listening all the time and responding to these concerns .
jon sopel : so have you been too target driven ?
you 've imposed , i think , 64 targets on the nhs with the treasury monitoring everything from the number of undisclosed invoices paid by nhs bodies to the . and let me read this : " the co-efficient variation of the timed market forces factor adjusted reference cost index through an nhs trust . "
it sounds like you 're trying to suffocate the health service .
gordon brown : no .
what we 're trying to do is to get value for money .
but value for money will be achieved in the longer term , as i have been proposing .
if we can get that real time , local ... you see in new york - i 've been in new york - looked at the police , every week the police ... almost every day , update their results on how they 're performing .
people then challenge the police and say : " look , you can do better in my precinct , in my neighbourhood " and it 's got to be the same for the health service in the future , where at a local level people will be able to get the information about what the waits are , what the standard of care is , how many reported incidents there are of something going wrong whether it 's in the health service or anywhere else , and then challenge .
now that 's where we 're trying to move over the next few years .
jon sopel : well let 's turn from your priority to your passion now and education .
how would you answer this from one of our viewers , susan lang , who has contacted us from lichfield .
she 's said : " why is it only english and welsh students are the only students in the european union who are not allowed to study in scotland for free but it 's our taxes which pays for the rest of the eu to study there ? "
gordon brown : look , the scottish parliament has a budget .
if it chooses to spend its budget on one thing and not the other then it will not be able to spend money if it spends it on reduced fees , on old people or on health care or on something else .
now devolution , like to a local council or to a scottish or welsh parliament , it 's about the local people making the decisions .
but if they use the money for one thing , they ca n't use it for something else .
there is no more money coming from us , from central government .
jon sopel : but you said , when you spoke to the bbc editors on friday , that : " i think you 've got to continue to look at the evolution of the constitution and you 've got to be sensitive to the needs of 85 % of the population who are english . "
it sounds like you think that the english might have a grievance .
gordon brown : i think that the constitution can only work if all parts of the united kingdom feel that it offers them both a recognition of their needs and is sensitive to any complaints that they have .
so if there is a sense in any part of the united kingdom that we 've got to do things better , we 've got to look at it .
jon sopel : do you sense the english have a grievance then ?
gordon brown : i sense that the constitution is in the process , as i said on friday , of evolution , and i sense also that we can respond to some of these concerns in a way that preserves the unity of the united kingdom , and the one thing i 'm clear about , whether it 's been in scotland or wales or in england itself is that people do want , in the majority , to remain part of the united kingdom .
jon sopel : okay , you 've spoken about a government of all the talents , and you tried and failed offering a job to a very senior liberal democrat .
do n't you find yourself a bit like the football association where it goes after the former brazilian coach phil scolari and ends up with steve mcclaren ?
gordon brown : no , because i believe that if you 're looking at how a country can do better in years to come , you 've got to try and build a shared consensus a bit different from a football team , you 've got to try and build a shared consensus about what the authorities are , and you should try to draw on the advice of , and sometimes the engagement in government , of people who have got expertise , who 've got something to offer , who 've been proven to have a certain wisdom in a particular area .
and i think , if you take the example of business , you know , i feel we could do better in the way that we engage the business community in the big decisions about the future of our country .
and so i 'm going to propose over the next few days that we have a business council for britain and that business council will be able to look at , adjudicate to parliament and inquire into the policies that we are pursuing , and it will also be able to look at how some of the parts of business policy at the moment , industrial policy , technology , should be independent of government , like the bank of england is independent is government in government , but i want to draw and have a better relationship with all the great business leaders of our country who should be playing a part in helping us build a stronger economy , and of course , a more prosperous society for the years to come .
jon sopel : okay , let me just go back to lord ashdown , was n't it rather sneaky and underhand .
sir menzies campbell , your friend , had said to you : " no liberal democrat is going to serve " and after he said that to you , you still tried to get off a ...
gordon brown : i 'm not going to get into private conversations but that is a total travesty of actually what happened , but these are confidential conversations and it 's not for me to breach confidences .
the one thing i say is where someone ...
jon sopel : so it 's not true that you went to paddy ashdown ming campbell would say no liberal democrat would serve ?
gordon brown : this is not a correct account of what happened .
it is a travesty of what happened .
what i would say to you is absolutely this , that there are people of expertise , there are people who have got wide experience .
they may not be in your own political party but as was the case of northern ireland , i was talking to someone who had something to offer .
and i think it 's right that we are inclusive .
i think it 's right that we try to draw on all the talents , and i think you 'll see that we are in a position , whether it 's in one capacity or another , to draw on some of the talents of our society who are not normally associated with party political events and forces , because they too believe , like me , that what matters at the end of the day is the future of our country and building a better britain and building a shared sense of national purpose , and i think that people look to us to bring an end to the old politics that are too tribal , that have been too divisive and be inclusive and reach out and try to bring in people who have got something to offer .
jon sopel : very interesting what you say .
so should we expect that come this thursday when you announce the shape of your government , that there will be non-labour members in it at some ministerial level ?
gordon brown : i 'm not going to make any announcements , tempting , you know , when talking to you and not to the house of commons or to any other audience , but i 'm not going to pre-empt any announcement .
jon sopel : but listening to what you said , it sounds like a logical ...
gordon brown : i think the principle that we should work on for the future of british politics is that we have to be far more inquisitive , we have to reach out more , there are people with contributions that they can make - not necessarily in government positions as ministers but contributions they can make to our national life , and there are people of standing whose talents that i will want to draw on to make for a better government of this country .
jon sopel : so without prejudging , then you 've said , yes you would like to have a government without ... with .. you know , maybe some other people that have non-labour party members in it .
gordon brown : well i 've said already , and i actually said on friday , it 's just this , there are some people who are not associated with any political party who 've got an expertise that they can offer .
now it may be they 'd undertake a review for us , it may be that they come in , in an advisory role , it may be in other capacities as well .
but the principle is in my view right , we are talking about building a better britain , a more successful economy , a stronger society , i want to draw on the talents of people who can contribute to that and i think most people watching this programme will say that old tribal divisive politics have got less to offer than an inclusive approach that i 'm talking about .
jon sopel : okay , just one more thing on the new politics .
lord goldsmith amounted that he 's standing down as attorney general .
is it a chance for you to look again at the role of attorney general and maybe depoliticise that role ?
gordon brown : well i 'm talking , as you probably know , about looking at the whole of our constitution .
we 've had some great changes over the last few years but it is time to look again at how parliament can gain more power from the executive and how the people itself can gain more power from parliament and the executive , and of course , in the context of that you would be prepared to look at the role of attorney general .
jon sopel : right , hopefully a couple of simple questions .
are you committed to having a deputy prime minister ?
gordon brown : that 's for me to decide at a later date and not to make any announcements on today .
jon sopel : and are you committed , if you do decide to have a deputy prime minister , that that person should be whoever wins the deputy leadership contest ?
gordon brown : well i 'm not going to get into that because first of all this is not the time to do so when i 've not talked to any of my colleagues before talking to you but also the time to make these decisions is when i announce them on wednesday and thursday .
jon sopel : but i 'm sure if i said : " are you going to have a chancellor of the exchequer ? "
are you going to have a foreign secretary and whatever else , you 'd say yes of course i am .
why ca n't you say you are going to have a deputy prime minister ?
gordon brown : i 'm enjoying the discussion but this is something i have to discuss with my colleagues .
jon sopel : okay , let 's talk about the deputy leadership contest because you 've been stressing the new politics but it seems like the deputy leadership contest at times has seemed like a trip down memory lane with a massive lurch to the left .
gordon brown : i did not and i do n't believe that that is the case .
i think we 've got some very good candidates .
they 've been putting forward their own views , but i also think that no matter what causes you want to throw at me that what they 've said , i mean generally speaking , there 's nobody here is going to serve in the government of the labour party starting on wednesday who is not prepared to support the manifesto of our party .
jon sopel : yes , so i will give you a ...
gordon brown : i thought that was very ...
jon sopel : well exactly .
harriet harman calling for the united states to be taken the security council in guantanamo bay .
john cruddas wanting higher tax rates , peter hain 's appalled by city bonuses .
gordon brown : i think when people make these comments they have got to look at what the policy of our party is , what the policy of the government is pursuing and there will have to be discipline in the government that i lead .
jon sopel : that 's a shot across the bow , is n't it ?
gordon brown : i think it 's very important for people to recognise that as we move forward the manifesto is what we put to the public , we 've got to honour that manifesto , that is an issue of trust that we have with the electorate and people who have additional views to put forward , by all means , put them forward to the next manifesto , but we are not going to go beyond implementing the principles and the policies of this manifesto and somehow change it overnight .
jon sopel : just on one thing that has come out of the deputy leadership contest which does seem to have gained some traction , it 's the idea of councils being allowed to build more council houses .
gordon brown : i think you 'll find that the debate about housing is becoming far broader than it was a few years ago .
in other words , we 've got a national priority to build more houses and of course the private sector will build almost ... the biggest share of them .
housing associations are doing what they can and we will increase the budget for social housing by 50 % and we 've got to look at whether the arrangements that governed the building of housing both to rent and to buy are going to get us the results that we need , which is to meet the demand , particularly - as i found going round the country - of young couples wanting to get onto the housing ladder for the first time , frustrated they 're not able to do , and that 's why i said the new challenge is affordable housing and it 's one that we will address immediately .
jon sopel : so would you build council houses ?
gordon brown : i think you 've got to look at how the public sector as a whole can contribute and then make up your mind about where the right contribution can be made .
jon sopel : so there might be a role for ...
gordon brown : housing associations yes , councils get receipts obviously from the houses that they sell , but i think you 're going to have to be patient and wait till we look at the detail of what has got to be done , because the national priority is that we build houses in a way that they are affordable for people and we 've got to recognise that while more and more people want houses to buy and to own , and this is a great thing , people getting on the housing ladder , there are many also who need houses to rent .
jon sopel : okay .
there 's an eu summit that ended in the wee small hours of saturday morning .
do you sign up fully to what tony blair has agreed in brussels ?
gordon brown : well there were four red lines that we set down , very clear that we could not be overruled on foreign and defence policy or on justice and home policy , or on , if you like , business and social and employment legislation , and we had a particular concern about social security .
i 've read that the detail of what has come out of this , and it seems that all our four red lines , thanks to the negotiating skill of tony , they have been achieved , and i think people when they look at the small print there will see that we did what we set out to do and that was to make sure that in these areas we were properly protected as a country to make our own decisions when we wanted to do so .
jon sopel : so , on the basis of what has been signed , does there need to be a referendum on it ?
gordon brown : well of course there 's going to be a debate about this , but my judgement is that if we were to get these four red lines achieved , and my judgement is that we have achieved these four really demands that britain had of the european union , that that means that just in the case of all the other amending treaties , the nice and maastricht and so on , that the public would not therefore expect there to be a referendum , and i think i 'm right in saying that no other country , and i think there were five who were about to or had had referendums , no other country in the rest of europe now thinks it 's necessary to have a referendum other than those that are constitutionally bound to do so .
jon sopel : i heard the foreign secretary say : " but of course there have been some areas where brussels has more power , there 's been more agreement of qualified majority voting and got the veto .
william hague , the shadow foreign secretary says : " given their manifesto commitment to a referendum on the eve of the constitution the government have absolutely no democratic mandate to introduce these major changes without letting the british people have the final say in a referendum . "
gordon brown : well he would say that , would n't he , but when it came to maastricht when the conservatives were in power , they did n't have a referendum .
you 've got to look at the small print here rather than the political rhetoric and in each of the areas where we set out to achieve our negotiated objectives , either we are not affected directly by the european amended treaty because we have an exemption or an opt-in in some cases , or , alternatively , it does n't count that effect that people claimed on british institutions or british law .
jon sopel : but there is going to be extension of majority voting on foreign policy , a european foreign minister in all but name , end to the national veto on things like transport and energy , those things matter .
gordon brown : well , let 's get to the heart of qualified majority voting .
in each of the major treaties , and actually the biggest one was when mrs thatcher negotiated the single european act , there has been qualified majority voting in many cases because we have asked for it so that we can get decisions made in key areas .
so it 's not a matter of principle that there should never be qualified majority voting .
look , the european union is now 27 , it 's got to work better .
this is not a new constitution , it 's an amending treaty .
all these symbols that were talked about before are not there .
the charter of rights we have got a position in the protocol that protects us , so in the key areas the fundamental issues that people raised beforehand i believe our strong negotiating position has been successful .
jon sopel : so despite the pressure that may come from the mail , the sun , who knows whichever papers , and the opposition political parties - no referendum ?
gordon brown : well it looks on the face of it , and we 're just getting all the details obviously of what has been agreed and what has been published , and particularly the protocols which go side by side with the other decisions that have been made , that all four of what we set out to achieve as our negotiating red lines we have met our objectives in that and therefore the issues that we were worried about have been dealt with .
and as with the other treaties in the past , and as i suspect with other countries who have decided to hold a referendum before but are not going to do so now , we see us having met our negotiated objectives .
jon sopel : now you just praised there tony blair 's negotiating skills .
it 's being touted around that he might become a middle east envoy for the quartet .
what would you think of that ?
gordon brown : well i think tony blair not only has made an immense contribution , not just to our national life but to the international community , but obviously has a very major contribution that if he chooses to make and i believe he will be pressed to make that contribution , he should be invited to make .
and tony blair has a great knowledge of both reconciliation on how to make it happen as we 've done from northern ireland and a great interest in the areas that we 're just talking about .
and so what tony blair can do to help both world peace and prosperity over the next few years is something that no doubt he will be considering and obviously i hope he 's in a position to make a contribution .
jon sopel : so you say he will be pressed , this is real , this is ... it sounds like you 're making it sound like it 's quite close that he will become the middle east envoy for the quartet .
gordon brown : now hold on , i do n't know the individual discussions that have taken place but you know in many areas tony will be asked , as i suspect you will know , to make a contribution , whether it 's on interfaith dialogue in which he 's got a great interest , or on the future of africa where he 's taken himself a very big role in trying to make possible some of the breakthroughs we 've had in debt relief and on aid and the on the empowerment of the poor and developing countries .
in all these areas i think people will continue to press tony to do things and no doubt he 'll choose what is the best contribution that he thinks he can make to public life in the future .
jon sopel : is there going to be any difference in your relationship with president bush ?
gordon brown : i think the relationship between a british prime minister and an american president has always got to be a strong one .
no , i have not known president bush in the way that tony blair has known president bush , and obviously they 've had a relationship from exactly the time that president bush took over , but i believe that the relationship between britain and america is fundamental to our future success .
i find it strange that we have political parties in this country saying that they 're now anti-european and anti-american .
the whole purpose of a good foreign policy is to build alliances for progress and i want us to play a part in what i think will be a very big issue , and that 's reshaping the international institutions , but fundamental to our partnerships and alliances are our relationship with europe , our relationship with america and of course our relationship with the commonwealth .
jon sopel : okay .
we started this interview talking about how your government was going to be different to tony blair 's , how are you going to personally change in maybe the way that you deal with your colleagues ?
gordon brown : i think when you 're chancellor , let 's be honest , you 've got to say to people if they come for money - no .
and it 's a different job from being the leader of the party where i believe you 've got to bring people together and you 've got to reach out .
in the country as a whole which is what i find most exciting of all , the challenge in modern politics you know is to build a shared sense of national purpose .
the challenge is to try and get people together and build a consensus .
so we 've got long-term decisions we 've got to make about how much and how ... and what polity we invest in education , about what we 've got to do about science and innovation .
you 've got to build a national consensus .
so i believe that the role that i 've got to play is bringing people together to make sure that we , britain , can have a strong sense of shared purpose in the way that other countries also do .
jon sopel : this weekend tony blair has gone off to see the pope amid speculation that he may be converting to catholicism .
can i ask you what part will your faith play when you become prime minister ?
gordon brown : as you know , i grew up and my father was a minister to the church , and has been a very strong influence in my life .
i think the most important thing it 's taught me is to treat everybody equally , to show respect to all people and to feel a sense of responsibility to other people , and i 'm not one of those people who want to lecture of hector about what is i think essentially a very personal thing .
but i am very clear , as someone who has strong convictions that what i grew up with and what i was taught when i was young has had a huge influence in my life .
jon sopel : and a final personal thing , are you concerned for your family given the exposure that you 're all going to be subject to once you move into no.10 ?
gordon brown : i think we 've had to live with some of it for the last few years .
obviously i hope people will respect that i 've got very , very young children , but i think also people have a right to know who you are , what you believe , what you stand for , what you 're trying to achieve , so that is very much part of the job that you 've got to show people that you are who you are and not try to sort of use some excuse to run away from the attention that you 've got to have , and people have a right to know what you want to say .

last updated : sunday , 24 june 2007 , 08:23 gmt 09:23 uk e-mail this to a friend printable version brown : ' no ' to treaty referendum we did what we set out to do and that was to make sure that in these areas we were properly protected as a country gordon brown speaking to jon sopel on sunday 24 june , the incoming prime minister , gordon brown , congratulated tony blair on the deal he negotiated at the brussels summit , and said he did not think the reform treaty merited a referendum .
test yourself with the gordon brown quiz here ...
" thanks to the negotiating skill of tony they -lsb- four red lines -rsb- have been achieved , " he said " and i think people when they look at the small print will see that we did what we set out to do and that was to make sure that in these areas we were properly protected as a country to make our own decisions when we want to do so . "
" on the face of it , " he continued , " we 've got all the details coming through from all the protocols as well as the amending treaty itself what we set out to achieve which is protecting the british national interest in these four crucial areas .
" for example , the charter of rights , we should be protected in british law on that and all the other areas we seem to have been able thanks to the negotiation to have achieved that .
" on that basis , like every other treaty that has been negotiated - nice , amsterdam , maastricht - and that while many other people will call for a referendum it seems to me that we have met our negotiating position . "
blair 's experience mr brown was asked about the idea of tony blair becoming a middle east envoy for the major powers .
he responded warmly to the idea , saying : " i think tony blair , " he insisted , " not only has made an immense contribution not just to our national life , but to the international community , but obviously has a very great contribution that if he chooses to make , and i believe he will be pressed to make that contribution , that he should be invited to make .
" tony blair has a great knowledge both of reconciliation , and how to make it happen as we found from northern ireland , and a great interest in the areas we were just talking about . "
underhand approach ?
jon sopel put to mr brown that he appeared to have acted in an underhand way when he offered lord ashdown a job , after ming campbell had said " no " lib dem would serve .
mr brown angrily rejected this accusation saying " this is not a correct account of what happened - it is a total travesty of what happened .
" what i would say to you is absolutely this ... that there are people of expertise and wide experience .
" they may not be in your own political party but in the case of northern ireland , i was talking to someone who had something to offer and i think it 's right that we are inclusive and it 's right to draw on all the talents , and i think you will see that we are in a position whether it 's in one capacity or another to draw on some of the talents of our society who are not normally associated with party political events and forces . "
leaning left ?
mr brown was asked whether or not deputy leadership candidates had hinted at shifts to the left on issues like trident , taxes and relations with the us .
gordon brown sent a shot across their bows : " nobody is going to serve in the government of the labour party starting on wednesday who is not prepared to support the manifesto of our party .
" when people make these comments , they have got to look at what the policy of our party is and the policy the government is pursuing and there will have to be discipline in the government that i lead . "
council housing retreat he also appeared to retreat from his own recent statements suggesting that more council houses might be built : " i think you 've got to look at how the public sector as a whole can contribute and then make up your mind about where the right contribution can be made .
" housing associations yes - councils get receipts obviously from the houses that they sell , but i think you 're going to have to be patient and wait until we look at the detail of what is going to be done . "
law and order mr brown suggested a new role for citizens ' juries - akin to jury service in criminal trials , in which ordinary people would contribute to the policy-making process .
he said : " i believe that citizens ' juries and citizens ' jury service could become a thing of the future - inviting people from all parts of the country , 600 constituencies , one , two or three hundred people discussing an issue through , feedback to government and then government responding and saying this is what we are going to do as a result .
" this is an important way of consulting . "
business advisory council and he announced the setting up of a business advisory council , in which business leaders would keep him informed about the issues of most concern to them : " if you take the example of business , you know i feel that we could do better in the way we engage the business community in the big decisions about the future of our country .
" and so i 'm going to propose over the next few days that we have a business council for britain , and that business council will be able to look at , adjudicate upon , inquire into the policies that we are pursuing .
" it will also be able to look at how some of the parts of business policy at the moment , the industrial policy , technology policy , should be independent of the government , like the bank of england is independent of government .
" but i want to draw on and have a better relationship with all the great business leaders of our country who should be playing a part in helping us build a stronger economy , and of course a more prosperous society for the years to come . "
scotland 's funding gordon brown also made it clear that there would be no more money to the scottish parliament from central government .
" the scottish parliament has a budget .
if it chooses to spend its budget on one thing and not the other , then it will not be able to spend the money .
" if it spends it on reduced fees - on old people or healthcare of something else ¿ there is no more money coming from us in central government . "
interview transcript jon sopel : gordon brown , how is your government going to be different to tony blair 's ?
gordon brown : new challenges , new priorities , new ways of governing .
i think what people are seeing is in 2007 what we 've got to do is quite different from some of the things we had to do in 1997 , so we 've got the problem of climate change , we 've got global economic competition , we 've got the problem also of terrorism and security , but equally we 've got the issue of people 's rising aspirations .
so people want better health care , they want schools to be of the highest standard , they want our public services to be tailored to their needs , and it 's responding to people 's rising aspirations partly because of our success but partly because people legitimately have higher expectations of government .
there is the challenge particularly for public services in the years to come .
jon sopel : but how can you argue that gordon brown is going to be a big change when you 've been one of the principal architects of the past ten years of government ?
gordon brown : well you see what i 've realised over ten years - and i 've been talking about this as i go round the country - is that yes in 1997 we had to do things and almost pull a lever , so we had to have a new deal to get people back to work .
we 've got a million people ... now two million people back into work .
in 2007 the challenges are a bit different .
you 've got to involve and engage people far more , so all decisions that we make will have to be build from an understanding of grassroots opinion , people being more engaged in the decision making .
the old method was if a politician went out in the country you have a public meeting .
then we had like television question times .
now what you 've got to do , because we 've got to listen to people 's real concerns , is engage people in discussing right through a big issue .
you know , it could be the health service , it could be drugs , these are big issues about how our community is changing as a result of globalisation .
it could be smoking , i did one on that .
it could be the british way of life , i did one on that .
but what happens is , you ask people , look , here are the problems that we 've got .
we ca n't solve these problems on our own .
we can only solve them if you yourself are in engaged in ... like the environment , you ca n't solve it without personal responsibility and people accepting that they have a role to play .
and then you work through the problem , i believe that citizens ' juries and citizens ' jury service , could become a thing of the future , inviting people in all parts of the country , perhaps on a day like this , 600 constituencies , 100 or 200 or 300 people there discussing an issue through , feed back to government and then government responding and saying this is what we 're going to do as a result .
i think this is an important way of consulting .
jon sopel : okay , you said it when you launched your campaign that the nhs would be your priority and that education would be your passion .
let 's talk about the priority .
what does it mean that the nhs is going to be your priority ?
gordon brown : because i 've been listening to what people say about the nhs and we have got to do better and we will do better , and i think what 's happened is that people see that the new investment is being made , they see the new hospitals , they see that there are nurses being hired , they see the new equipment as well , but i think there 's really three things they want to be sure about , one is that the nhs is here for you when you need it , so people are worried about gps opening hours , about can they have a range of services at a local level for weekends and for after hours .
the second thing is that people are pleased often by the standard of surgical care in the hospital but worried about , in a way , higher aspirations , making them worried about personal care , and so we 've got to deal with these issues of cleanliness in food and standards and aftercare and the time that a doctor and a nurse has to deal with the patient , and if i may just finish with the third thing , is we 've got to lead the world in the new cures from breast cancer to diabetes , to dealing with some of the diseases that have yet to be conquered , britain , with its national health service , can , i believe , lead the world .
jon sopel : is it your problem that you 've been obsessed by targets in the government and despite the billions that you 've pumped in , ordinary people are more concerned about whether their a & e department is going to close or whether they 're going to go into hospital and come out with a super bug .
gordon brown : and we 've got to respond to people 's concerns directly and you 're not a government in the modern world if you 're not listening all the time and responding to these concerns .
jon sopel : so have you been too target driven ?
you 've imposed , i think , 64 targets on the nhs with the treasury monitoring everything from the number of undisclosed invoices paid by nhs bodies to the . and let me read this : " the co-efficient variation of the timed market forces factor adjusted reference cost index through an nhs trust . "
it sounds like you 're trying to suffocate the health service .
gordon brown : no .
what we 're trying to do is to get value for money .
but value for money will be achieved in the longer term , as i have been proposing .
if we can get that real time , local ... you see in new york - i 've been in new york - looked at the police , every week the police ... almost every day , update their results on how they 're performing .
people then challenge the police and say : " look , you can do better in my precinct , in my neighbourhood " and it 's got to be the same for the health service in the future , where at a local level people will be able to get the information about what the waits are , what the standard of care is , how many reported incidents there are of something going wrong whether it 's in the health service or anywhere else , and then challenge .
now that 's where we 're trying to move over the next few years .
jon sopel : well let 's turn from your priority to your passion now and education .
how would you answer this from one of our viewers , susan lang , who has contacted us from lichfield .
she 's said : " why is it only english and welsh students are the only students in the european union who are not allowed to study in scotland for free but it 's our taxes which pays for the rest of the eu to study there ? "
gordon brown : look , the scottish parliament has a budget .
if it chooses to spend its budget on one thing and not the other then it will not be able to spend money if it spends it on reduced fees , on old people or on health care or on something else .
now devolution , like to a local council or to a scottish or welsh parliament , it 's about the local people making the decisions .
but if they use the money for one thing , they ca n't use it for something else .
there is no more money coming from us , from central government .
jon sopel : but you said , when you spoke to the bbc editors on friday , that : " i think you 've got to continue to look at the evolution of the constitution and you 've got to be sensitive to the needs of 85 % of the population who are english . "
it sounds like you think that the english might have a grievance .
gordon brown : i think that the constitution can only work if all parts of the united kingdom feel that it offers them both a recognition of their needs and is sensitive to any complaints that they have .
so if there is a sense in any part of the united kingdom that we 've got to do things better , we 've got to look at it .
jon sopel : do you sense the english have a grievance then ?
gordon brown : i sense that the constitution is in the process , as i said on friday , of evolution , and i sense also that we can respond to some of these concerns in a way that preserves the unity of the united kingdom , and the one thing i 'm clear about , whether it 's been in scotland or wales or in england itself is that people do want , in the majority , to remain part of the united kingdom .
jon sopel : okay , you 've spoken about a government of all the talents , and you tried and failed offering a job to a very senior liberal democrat .
do n't you find yourself a bit like the football association where it goes after the former brazilian coach phil scolari and ends up with steve mcclaren ?
gordon brown : no , because i believe that if you 're looking at how a country can do better in years to come , you 've got to try and build a shared consensus a bit different from a football team , you 've got to try and build a shared consensus about what the authorities are , and you should try to draw on the advice of , and sometimes the engagement in government , of people who have got expertise , who 've got something to offer , who 've been proven to have a certain wisdom in a particular area .
and i think , if you take the example of business , you know , i feel we could do better in the way that we engage the business community in the big decisions about the future of our country .
and so i 'm going to propose over the next few days that we have a business council for britain and that business council will be able to look at , adjudicate to parliament and inquire into the policies that we are pursuing , and it will also be able to look at how some of the parts of business policy at the moment , industrial policy , technology , should be independent of government , like the bank of england is independent is government in government , but i want to draw and have a better relationship with all the great business leaders of our country who should be playing a part in helping us build a stronger economy , and of course , a more prosperous society for the years to come .
jon sopel : okay , let me just go back to lord ashdown , was n't it rather sneaky and underhand .
sir menzies campbell , your friend , had said to you : " no liberal democrat is going to serve " and after he said that to you , you still tried to get off a ...
gordon brown : i 'm not going to get into private conversations but that is a total travesty of actually what happened , but these are confidential conversations and it 's not for me to breach confidences .
the one thing i say is where someone ...
jon sopel : so it 's not true that you went to paddy ashdown ming campbell would say no liberal democrat would serve ?
gordon brown : this is not a correct account of what happened .
it is a travesty of what happened .
what i would say to you is absolutely this , that there are people of expertise , there are people who have got wide experience .
they may not be in your own political party but as was the case of northern ireland , i was talking to someone who had something to offer .
and i think it 's right that we are inclusive .
i think it 's right that we try to draw on all the talents , and i think you 'll see that we are in a position , whether it 's in one capacity or another , to draw on some of the talents of our society who are not normally associated with party political events and forces , because they too believe , like me , that what matters at the end of the day is the future of our country and building a better britain and building a shared sense of national purpose , and i think that people look to us to bring an end to the old politics that are too tribal , that have been too divisive and be inclusive and reach out and try to bring in people who have got something to offer .
jon sopel : very interesting what you say .
so should we expect that come this thursday when you announce the shape of your government , that there will be non-labour members in it at some ministerial level ?
gordon brown : i 'm not going to make any announcements , tempting , you know , when talking to you and not to the house of commons or to any other audience , but i 'm not going to pre-empt any announcement .
jon sopel : but listening to what you said , it sounds like a logical ...
gordon brown : i think the principle that we should work on for the future of british politics is that we have to be far more inquisitive , we have to reach out more , there are people with contributions that they can make - not necessarily in government positions as ministers but contributions they can make to our national life , and there are people of standing whose talents that i will want to draw on to make for a better government of this country .
jon sopel : so without prejudging , then you 've said , yes you would like to have a government without ... with .. you know , maybe some other people that have non-labour party members in it .
gordon brown : well i 've said already , and i actually said on friday , it 's just this , there are some people who are not associated with any political party who 've got an expertise that they can offer .
now it may be they 'd undertake a review for us , it may be that they come in , in an advisory role , it may be in other capacities as well .
but the principle is in my view right , we are talking about building a better britain , a more successful economy , a stronger society , i want to draw on the talents of people who can contribute to that and i think most people watching this programme will say that old tribal divisive politics have got less to offer than an inclusive approach that i 'm talking about .
jon sopel : okay , just one more thing on the new politics .
lord goldsmith amounted that he 's standing down as attorney general .
is it a chance for you to look again at the role of attorney general and maybe depoliticise that role ?
gordon brown : well i 'm talking , as you probably know , about looking at the whole of our constitution .
we 've had some great changes over the last few years but it is time to look again at how parliament can gain more power from the executive and how the people itself can gain more power from parliament and the executive , and of course , in the context of that you would be prepared to look at the role of attorney general .
jon sopel : right , hopefully a couple of simple questions .
are you committed to having a deputy prime minister ?
gordon brown : that 's for me to decide at a later date and not to make any announcements on today .
jon sopel : and are you committed , if you do decide to have a deputy prime minister , that that person should be whoever wins the deputy leadership contest ?
gordon brown : well i 'm not going to get into that because first of all this is not the time to do so when i 've not talked to any of my colleagues before talking to you but also the time to make these decisions is when i announce them on wednesday and thursday .
jon sopel : but i 'm sure if i said : " are you going to have a chancellor of the exchequer ? "
are you going to have a foreign secretary and whatever else , you 'd say yes of course i am .
why ca n't you say you are going to have a deputy prime minister ?
gordon brown : i 'm enjoying the discussion but this is something i have to discuss with my colleagues .
jon sopel : okay , let 's talk about the deputy leadership contest because you 've been stressing the new politics but it seems like the deputy leadership contest at times has seemed like a trip down memory lane with a massive lurch to the left .
gordon brown : i did not and i do n't believe that that is the case .
i think we 've got some very good candidates .
they 've been putting forward their own views , but i also think that no matter what causes you want to throw at me that what they 've said , i mean generally speaking , there 's nobody here is going to serve in the government of the labour party starting on wednesday who is not prepared to support the manifesto of our party .
jon sopel : yes , so i will give you a ...
gordon brown : i thought that was very ...
jon sopel : well exactly .
harriet harman calling for the united states to be taken the security council in guantanamo bay .
john cruddas wanting higher tax rates , peter hain 's appalled by city bonuses .
gordon brown : i think when people make these comments they have got to look at what the policy of our party is , what the policy of the government is pursuing and there will have to be discipline in the government that i lead .
jon sopel : that 's a shot across the bow , is n't it ?
gordon brown : i think it 's very important for people to recognise that as we move forward the manifesto is what we put to the public , we 've got to honour that manifesto , that is an issue of trust that we have with the electorate and people who have additional views to put forward , by all means , put them forward to the next manifesto , but we are not going to go beyond implementing the principles and the policies of this manifesto and somehow change it overnight .
jon sopel : just on one thing that has come out of the deputy leadership contest which does seem to have gained some traction , it 's the idea of councils being allowed to build more council houses .
gordon brown : i think you 'll find that the debate about housing is becoming far broader than it was a few years ago .
in other words , we 've got a national priority to build more houses and of course the private sector will build almost ... the biggest share of them .
housing associations are doing what they can and we will increase the budget for social housing by 50 % and we 've got to look at whether the arrangements that governed the building of housing both to rent and to buy are going to get us the results that we need , which is to meet the demand , particularly - as i found going round the country - of young couples wanting to get onto the housing ladder for the first time , frustrated they 're not able to do , and that 's why i said the new challenge is affordable housing and it 's one that we will address immediately .
jon sopel : so would you build council houses ?
gordon brown : i think you 've got to look at how the public sector as a whole can contribute and then make up your mind about where the right contribution can be made .
jon sopel : so there might be a role for ...
gordon brown : housing associations yes , councils get receipts obviously from the houses that they sell , but i think you 're going to have to be patient and wait till we look at the detail of what has got to be done , because the national priority is that we build houses in a way that they are affordable for people and we 've got to recognise that while more and more people want houses to buy and to own , and this is a great thing , people getting on the housing ladder , there are many also who need houses to rent .
jon sopel : okay .
there 's an eu summit that ended in the wee small hours of saturday morning .
do you sign up fully to what tony blair has agreed in brussels ?
gordon brown : well there were four red lines that we set down , very clear that we could not be overruled on foreign and defence policy or on justice and home policy , or on , if you like , business and social and employment legislation , and we had a particular concern about social security .
i 've read that the detail of what has come out of this , and it seems that all our four red lines , thanks to the negotiating skill of tony , they have been achieved , and i think people when they look at the small print there will see that we did what we set out to do and that was to make sure that in these areas we were properly protected as a country to make our own decisions when we wanted to do so .
jon sopel : so , on the basis of what has been signed , does there need to be a referendum on it ?
gordon brown : well of course there 's going to be a debate about this , but my judgement is that if we were to get these four red lines achieved , and my judgement is that we have achieved these four really demands that britain had of the european union , that that means that just in the case of all the other amending treaties , the nice and maastricht and so on , that the public would not therefore expect there to be a referendum , and i think i 'm right in saying that no other country , and i think there were five who were about to or had had referendums , no other country in the rest of europe now thinks it 's necessary to have a referendum other than those that are constitutionally bound to do so .
jon sopel : i heard the foreign secretary say : " but of course there have been some areas where brussels has more power , there 's been more agreement of qualified majority voting and got the veto .
william hague , the shadow foreign secretary says : " given their manifesto commitment to a referendum on the eve of the constitution the government have absolutely no democratic mandate to introduce these major changes without letting the british people have the final say in a referendum . "
gordon brown : well he would say that , would n't he , but when it came to maastricht when the conservatives were in power , they did n't have a referendum .
you 've got to look at the small print here rather than the political rhetoric and in each of the areas where we set out to achieve our negotiated objectives , either we are not affected directly by the european amended treaty because we have an exemption or an opt-in in some cases , or , alternatively , it does n't count that effect that people claimed on british institutions or british law .
jon sopel : but there is going to be extension of majority voting on foreign policy , a european foreign minister in all but name , end to the national veto on things like transport and energy , those things matter .
gordon brown : well , let 's get to the heart of qualified majority voting .
in each of the major treaties , and actually the biggest one was when mrs thatcher negotiated the single european act , there has been qualified majority voting in many cases because we have asked for it so that we can get decisions made in key areas .
so it 's not a matter of principle that there should never be qualified majority voting .
look , the european union is now 27 , it 's got to work better .
this is not a new constitution , it 's an amending treaty .
all these symbols that were talked about before are not there .
the charter of rights we have got a position in the protocol that protects us , so in the key areas the fundamental issues that people raised beforehand i believe our strong negotiating position has been successful .
jon sopel : so despite the pressure that may come from the mail , the sun , who knows whichever papers , and the opposition political parties - no referendum ?
gordon brown : well it looks on the face of it , and we 're just getting all the details obviously of what has been agreed and what has been published , and particularly the protocols which go side by side with the other decisions that have been made , that all four of what we set out to achieve as our negotiating red lines we have met our objectives in that and therefore the issues that we were worried about have been dealt with .
and as with the other treaties in the past , and as i suspect with other countries who have decided to hold a referendum before but are not going to do so now , we see us having met our negotiated objectives .
jon sopel : now you just praised there tony blair 's negotiating skills .
it 's being touted around that he might become a middle east envoy for the quartet .
what would you think of that ?
gordon brown : well i think tony blair not only has made an immense contribution , not just to our national life but to the international community , but obviously has a very major contribution that if he chooses to make and i believe he will be pressed to make that contribution , he should be invited to make .
and tony blair has a great knowledge of both reconciliation on how to make it happen as we 've done from northern ireland and a great interest in the areas that we 're just talking about .
and so what tony blair can do to help both world peace and prosperity over the next few years is something that no doubt he will be considering and obviously i hope he 's in a position to make a contribution .
jon sopel : so you say he will be pressed , this is real , this is ... it sounds like you 're making it sound like it 's quite close that he will become the middle east envoy for the quartet .
gordon brown : now hold on , i do n't know the individual discussions that have taken place but you know in many areas tony will be asked , as i suspect you will know , to make a contribution , whether it 's on interfaith dialogue in which he 's got a great interest , or on the future of africa where he 's taken himself a very big role in trying to make possible some of the breakthroughs we 've had in debt relief and on aid and the on the empowerment of the poor and developing countries .
in all these areas i think people will continue to press tony to do things and no doubt he 'll choose what is the best contribution that he thinks he can make to public life in the future .
jon sopel : is there going to be any difference in your relationship with president bush ?
gordon brown : i think the relationship between a british prime minister and an american president has always got to be a strong one .
no , i have not known president bush in the way that tony blair has known president bush , and obviously they 've had a relationship from exactly the time that president bush took over , but i believe that the relationship between britain and america is fundamental to our future success .
i find it strange that we have political parties in this country saying that they 're now anti-european and anti-american .
the whole purpose of a good foreign policy is to build alliances for progress and i want us to play a part in what i think will be a very big issue , and that 's reshaping the international institutions , but fundamental to our partnerships and alliances are our relationship with europe , our relationship with america and of course our relationship with the commonwealth .
jon sopel : okay .
we started this interview talking about how your government was going to be different to tony blair 's , how are you going to personally change in maybe the way that you deal with your colleagues ?
gordon brown : i think when you 're chancellor , let 's be honest , you 've got to say to people if they come for money - no .
and it 's a different job from being the leader of the party where i believe you 've got to bring people together and you 've got to reach out .
in the country as a whole which is what i find most exciting of all , the challenge in modern politics you know is to build a shared sense of national purpose .
the challenge is to try and get people together and build a consensus .
so we 've got long-term decisions we 've got to make about how much and how ... and what polity we invest in education , about what we 've got to do about science and innovation .
you 've got to build a national consensus .
so i believe that the role that i 've got to play is bringing people together to make sure that we , britain , can have a strong sense of shared purpose in the way that other countries also do .
jon sopel : this weekend tony blair has gone off to see the pope amid speculation that he may be converting to catholicism .
can i ask you what part will your faith play when you become prime minister ?
gordon brown : as you know , i grew up and my father was a minister to the church , and has been a very strong influence in my life .
i think the most important thing it 's taught me is to treat everybody equally , to show respect to all people and to feel a sense of responsibility to other people , and i 'm not one of those people who want to lecture of hector about what is i think essentially a very personal thing .
but i am very clear , as someone who has strong convictions that what i grew up with and what i was taught when i was young has had a huge influence in my life .
jon sopel : and a final personal thing , are you concerned for your family given the exposure that you 're all going to be subject to once you move into no.10 ?
gordon brown : i think we 've had to live with some of it for the last few years .
obviously i hope people will respect that i 've got very , very young children , but i think also people have a right to know who you are , what you believe , what you stand for , what you 're trying to achieve , so that is very much part of the job that you 've got to show people that you are who you are and not try to sort of use some excuse to run away from the attention that you 've got to have , and people have a right to know what you want to say .
jon sopel : gordon brown , thank you very much .
