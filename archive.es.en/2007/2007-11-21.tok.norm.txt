20 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ancient sea scorpion is the biggest known bug the 46-centimeter -lrb- 18-inch -rrb- claw probably came from an animal around 2.5 meters -lrb- eight feet , two inches -rrb- in length - half a meter longer than any previously found . " this is an amazing discovery , " said simon braddy from the department of earth sciences at the university of bristol in england , in a press release . braddy , along with poschmann from the general department of cultural heritage in rhineland-palatinate and erik tetlie from yale university , co-authored the report . scientists surprised at size of find " we have known for some time that the fossil record yields monster millipedes , super-sized scorpions , colossal cockroaches , and jumbo dragonflies , but we never realized , until now , just how big some of these ancient creepy-crawlies were , " braddy added . poschmann described finding the claw in an area that probably had once been an ancient estuary or swamp . " i was loosening pieces of rock with a hammer and chisel when i suddenly realized there was a dark patch of organic matter on a freshly removed slab .
after some cleaning i could identify this as a small part of a large claw , " poschmann said . " although i did n't know if it was complete or not , i decided to try and get it out .
the pieces had to be cleaned separately , dried , and then glued back together .
it was then put into a white plaster jacket to stabilize it , " he said . theories vary on reason for monstrous size bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paleontologists are at work all over germany the article said the discovery of the 390-million-year-old giant fossil claw proved that arthropods -lrb- spiders , insects and crabs with segmented bodies , jointed limbs and a hard external skeleton -rrb- were much larger in the past than previously thought . biologists delving into the earth 's distant past are divided as to how some arthropods were able to develop to such monstrous sizes .
some suggest that they benefited from an oxygen-rich atmosphere , while others argue that they had to get bigger in order to keep up with the supersizing of their likely prey , the early armored fish . " there is no simple single explanation , " braddy said . " it is more likely that some ancient arthropods were big because there was little competition from the vertebrates , as we see today .
if the amount of oxygen in the atmosphere suddenly increased , it does n't mean all the bugs would get bigger . " species only found in present-day germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the extinct ancestors of this scorpion were much larger despite their name , sea scorpions - known as eurypterids - were not true scorpions .
equipped with long , flat , jointed carapaces , they stalked warm shallow sea waters from around 500 million to 250 million years ago , eventually moving into fresh water . eurypterids are believed to be the extinct aquatic ancestors of today 's scorpions and possibly all arachnids , a class of joint-legged , invertebrate animals , including spiders , scorpions , mites and ticks . braddy said the fossil was from a jaekelopterus rhenaniae , a kind of scorpion that lived only in germany for about 10 million years , about 400 million years ago . dw staff -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" today we have presented another case of successful , functional autonomy , it is the case of aland islands within finland , " said slobodan samardzic , serbia 's minister for kosovo .
the proposal follows previous serbian proposals inspired by east germany and hong kong designed to dissuade kosovo from declaring independence from serbia .
aland is an archipelago of more than 6,000 islands in the baltic sea , about half way between sweden and finland .
its population of nearly 27,000 speaks swedish .
in 1917 , its residents asked to join sweden , but their bid was blocked by the league of nations , which decided that the archipelago should remain finnish but be granted greater autonomy .
" once again belgrade has come up with a fresh idea on the table , " said serbian foreign minister vuk jeremic , who also urged his kosovo counterparts to stop talking about independence and show " an open mind " during the negotiations .
earlier tuesday , kosovo 's prime minister-in-waiting , hashim thaci , had said he was willing to consult with the united states and the european union before proclaiming his province 's independence from serbia .
" we will take a decision on kosovo -lsb- independence -rsb- after december 10 , together with the us and the eu , " thaci said .
the united nations set a deadline for dec .
10 which would see the conclusion of diplomatic efforts led by the us-eu-russia troika .
the troika is struggling to negotiate a solution on the final status of the predominantly ethnic-albanian province , which is aspiring to become an independent state .
thaci indicates a softening tone after eu talks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kostunica , left , with eu commission president barroso tuesday 's talks in brussels mark the first time that thaci will have met face-to-face with serbian prime minister vojislav kostunica since he won the elections held in kosovo on saturday .
his latest comment appeared to suggest that the kosovo leadership was willing to soften its stance after coming under pressure from the eu not to be too hasty about declaring unilateral independence after dec .
10 .
his position was mirrored by similar remarks made by kosovo 's president , fatmir sejdiu .
" we will coordinate each and every step that we take with the international community , " said sejdiu , adding that kosovo had a strong interest in having its state of independence recognized by the world 's main powers .
kosovo 's plans for independence are strongly opposed by serbia , which enjoys the backing of russia in the un security council .
so far , both parties have made little progress on proposals put forward by the troika 's leader , german diplomat wolfgang ischinger .
russia has also already threatened to veto a deal granting kosovo independence put forward by un mediator martti ahtisaari .
troika 's leader more optimistic of success bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ischinger hopes to have an agreement by the dec .
10 deadline despite widespread pessimism about the outcome of tuesday 's talks , ischinger said he was in " good spirits " as he arrived in brussels .
" we will have a good troika session today and i am quite confident it will be a productive one , " he added .
such comments contrasted with remarks made by ischinger on monday , when he appeared to concede that no settlement was likely to be agreed by the dec .
10 deadline .
kosovo , whose population of about 2 million is 90 percent ethnic albanian , has been under un administration since 1999 , when nato bombing raids drove serbian troops out of the province .
while the us has said it is ready to recognize an independent kosovo , russia is opposed .
the eu is split on the matter , with all but a handful of its 27 member states willing to side with the us .
the troika is expected to hold a new , and probably final , round of talks in vienna on nov .

" today we have presented another case of successful , functional autonomy , it is the case of aland islands within finland , " said slobodan samardzic , serbia 's minister for kosovo .
the proposal follows previous serbian proposals inspired by east germany and hong kong designed to dissuade kosovo from declaring independence from serbia .
aland is an archipelago of more than 6,000 islands in the baltic sea , about half way between sweden and finland .
its population of nearly 27,000 speaks swedish .
in 1917 , its residents asked to join sweden , but their bid was blocked by the league of nations , which decided that the archipelago should remain finnish but be granted greater autonomy .
" once again belgrade has come up with a fresh idea on the table , " said serbian foreign minister vuk jeremic , who also urged his kosovo counterparts to stop talking about independence and show " an open mind " during the negotiations .
earlier tuesday , kosovo 's prime minister-in-waiting , hashim thaci , had said he was willing to consult with the united states and the european union before proclaiming his province 's independence from serbia .
" we will take a decision on kosovo -lsb- independence -rsb- after december 10 , together with the us and the eu , " thaci said .
the united nations set a deadline for dec .

his position was mirrored by similar remarks made by kosovo 's president , fatmir sejdiu .
" we will coordinate each and every step that we take with the international community , " said sejdiu , adding that kosovo had a strong interest in having its state of independence recognized by the world 's main powers .
kosovo 's plans for independence are strongly opposed by serbia , which enjoys the backing of russia in the un security council .
so far , both parties have made little progress on proposals put forward by the troika 's leader , german diplomat wolfgang ischinger .
russia has also already threatened to veto a deal granting kosovo independence put forward by un mediator martti ahtisaari .

" today we have presented another case of successful , functional autonomy , it is the case of aland islands within finland , " said slobodan samardzic , serbia 's minister for kosovo .
the proposal follows previous serbian proposals inspired by east germany and hong kong designed to dissuade kosovo from declaring independence from serbia .
aland is an archipelago of more than 6,000 islands in the baltic sea , about half way between sweden and finland .
its population of nearly 27,000 speaks swedish .
in 1917 , its residents asked to join sweden , but their bid was blocked by the league of nations , which decided that the archipelago should remain finnish but be granted greater autonomy .
" once again belgrade has come up with a fresh idea on the table , " said serbian foreign minister vuk jeremic , who also urged his kosovo counterparts to stop talking about independence and show " an open mind " during the negotiations .
earlier tuesday , kosovo 's prime minister-in-waiting , hashim thaci , had said he was willing to consult with the united states and the european union before proclaiming his province 's independence from serbia .
" we will take a decision on kosovo -lsb- independence -rsb- after december 10 , together with the us and the eu , " thaci said .
the united nations set a deadline for dec .
10 which would see the conclusion of diplomatic efforts led by the us-eu-russia troika .
the troika is struggling to negotiate a solution on the final status of the predominantly ethnic-albanian province , which is aspiring to become an independent state .
thaci indicates a softening tone after eu talks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kostunica , left , with eu commission president barroso tuesday 's talks in brussels mark the first time that thaci will have met face-to-face with serbian prime minister vojislav kostunica since he won the elections held in kosovo on saturday .
his latest comment appeared to suggest that the kosovo leadership was willing to soften its stance after coming under pressure from the eu not to be too hasty about declaring unilateral independence after dec .
10 .
his position was mirrored by similar remarks made by kosovo 's president , fatmir sejdiu .
" we will coordinate each and every step that we take with the international community , " said sejdiu , adding that kosovo had a strong interest in having its state of independence recognized by the world 's main powers .
kosovo 's plans for independence are strongly opposed by serbia , which enjoys the backing of russia in the un security council .
so far , both parties have made little progress on proposals put forward by the troika 's leader , german diplomat wolfgang ischinger .
russia has also already threatened to veto a deal granting kosovo independence put forward by un mediator martti ahtisaari .
troika 's leader more optimistic of success bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ischinger hopes to have an agreement by the dec .
10 deadline despite widespread pessimism about the outcome of tuesday 's talks , ischinger said he was in " good spirits " as he arrived in brussels .
" we will have a good troika session today and i am quite confident it will be a productive one , " he added .
such comments contrasted with remarks made by ischinger on monday , when he appeared to concede that no settlement was likely to be agreed by the dec .
10 deadline .
kosovo , whose population of about 2 million is 90 percent ethnic albanian , has been under un administration since 1999 , when nato bombing raids drove serbian troops out of the province .
while the us has said it is ready to recognize an independent kosovo , russia is opposed .
the eu is split on the matter , with all but a handful of its 27 member states willing to side with the us .
the troika is expected to hold a new , and probably final , round of talks in vienna on nov .

dw-world.de looks at germany 's foreign minister and - now - vice chancellor . steinmeier , a social democrat , took over from party colleague franz müntefering , who resigned last week to take care of his wife in her battle against cancer .
the 51-year-old has served as germany 's foreign minister since november 2005 , but his tenure in that office has remained low-key .
that 's partly due to the popularity of his predecessor , the green party 's joschka fischer , and to the tendency of conservative chancellor angela merkel to take center stage at foreign policy events .
a trained lawyer , steinmeier has a reputation as a political pragmatist capable of mediating between differing views .
he was also considered the closest advisor to gerhard schröder , merkel 's social democratic predecessor , and a major architect of schröder 's stance against the us-led war in iraq .
criticism of past activities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier has so far had good relations with his partners in government steinmeier has , however , come under fire in conjunction with his post as chief-of-staff of the federal chancellery under schröder , a position he held from 1999 to 2005 .
in particular , steinmeier has been criticized for his handling of the case of murat kurnaz , a turkish man born and residing in germany who the us imprisoned without proof of any wrongdoing for five years at the guantanamo bay prison camp in cuba .
critics say steinmeier refused an offer by the united states in 2002 to release kurnaz .
earlier this year , steinmeier was called to testify in front of a parliamentary investigative committee about the case and said he had no knowledge of the offer in question .

dw-world.de looks at germany 's foreign minister and - now - vice chancellor . steinmeier , a social democrat , took over from party colleague franz müntefering , who resigned last week to take care of his wife in her battle against cancer .
the 51-year-old has served as germany 's foreign minister since november 2005 , but his tenure in that office has remained low-key .
that 's partly due to the popularity of his predecessor , the green party 's joschka fischer , and to the tendency of conservative chancellor angela merkel to take center stage at foreign policy events .
a trained lawyer , steinmeier has a reputation as a political pragmatist capable of mediating between differing views .
he was also considered the closest advisor to gerhard schröder , merkel 's social democratic predecessor , and a major architect of schröder 's stance against the us-led war in iraq .
criticism of past activities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier has so far had good relations with his partners in government steinmeier has , however , come under fire in conjunction with his post as chief-of-staff of the federal chancellery under schröder , a position he held from 1999 to 2005 .
in particular , steinmeier has been criticized for his handling of the case of murat kurnaz , a turkish man born and residing in germany who the us imprisoned without proof of any wrongdoing for five years at the guantanamo bay prison camp in cuba .
critics say steinmeier refused an offer by the united states in 2002 to release kurnaz .
earlier this year , steinmeier was called to testify in front of a parliamentary investigative committee about the case and said he had no knowledge of the offer in question .
on a lighter side , steinmeier recently raised smiles when he teamed up with his french foreign ministerial counterpart to record an ill-conceived rhythm-and-blues song in berlin .
no real increase in power bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : his talents as a singer have been called into question the duties of the vice chancellor are largely ceremonial , consisting mainly of deputizing at functions the chancellor is not able to attend .
in contrast to the vice president of the united states , the vice chancellor does not inherit the chancellorship , should a chancellor die in office .
still , steinmeier 's assumption of the new position , in addition to his serving as germany 's foreign minister , can only bolster his public profile and solidify his role within the grand coalition .

21 , aimed at ending an eight-day transport strike . sncf said there had been a " concerted campaign of sabotage " on rail lines of the high-speed tgv network .
sncf charged that the sabotage was aimed at stopping services from resuming as the eighth day of rail strikes began . sncf management in a statement said there had been " several acts " occurring " at the same time on the network , " as quoted by afp news agency . the company said sabotage consisted of several fires , including a " very large " blaze on the atlantic branch that damaged 30 kilometers -lrb- 18 miles -rrb- of the signal network and which had forced tgv trains to use normal tracks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : railway workers blocked a road in central marseille on monday in protest along the tgv 's northern and south-eastern lines , sncf said that " the deliberate shutting of signal switches is creating signal problems , and other arson attacks on cables have been reported , " as cited by afp . an arson attack on other cable arteries has also stopped normal train traffic since early wednesday morning . possible hour-long delays sncf said it expected the attacks to prompt hour-long delays along the tgv network that carries the majority of traffic between major french cities . transport minister dominique bussereau said the attacks were " grave and reprehensible acts of violence . ...
what is totally unacceptable is their apparent coordinated nature . " union leaders also condemned the incidents , with the head of the railway branch of the general labor confederation -lrb- cgt -rrb- , didier le reste , saying : " these acts of violence could have serious effects on rail safety .

21 , aimed at ending an eight-day transport strike . sncf said there had been a " concerted campaign of sabotage " on rail lines of the high-speed tgv network .
sncf charged that the sabotage was aimed at stopping services from resuming as the eighth day of rail strikes began . sncf management in a statement said there had been " several acts " occurring " at the same time on the network , " as quoted by afp news agency . the company said sabotage consisted of several fires , including a " very large " blaze on the atlantic branch that damaged 30 kilometers -lrb- 18 miles -rrb- of the signal network and which had forced tgv trains to use normal tracks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : railway workers blocked a road in central marseille on monday in protest along the tgv 's northern and south-eastern lines , sncf said that " the deliberate shutting of signal switches is creating signal problems , and other arson attacks on cables have been reported , " as cited by afp . an arson attack on other cable arteries has also stopped normal train traffic since early wednesday morning . possible hour-long delays sncf said it expected the attacks to prompt hour-long delays along the tgv network that carries the majority of traffic between major french cities . transport minister dominique bussereau said the attacks were " grave and reprehensible acts of violence . ...
what is totally unacceptable is their apparent coordinated nature . " union leaders also condemned the incidents , with the head of the railway branch of the general labor confederation -lrb- cgt -rrb- , didier le reste , saying : " these acts of violence could have serious effects on rail safety .
they are unspeakable acts carried out by cowards . " the alleged sabotage came as talks were to take place between unions , management and government representatives to put an end to a nationwide rail strike over pension reforms . on tuesday , french president nicolas sarkozy promised to stand by his economic reforms and urged strikers to return to work . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : policemen also participated in protests on tuesday " we will not yield and we will not retreat , " the president said . french ministers have said they will not back off from the pension reform , which increases contribution periods for the half million beneficiaries of " special " pensions systems so they are in line with the rest of the population .
currently , they retire two and a half years earlier than most . also on tuesday , the rail workers were accompanied by hundreds of thousands of striking teachers , nurses , tax officials and other state employees demanding pay raises and an end to job cuts . mass rallies against the government were held in cities around the country , with some 30,000 people marching with banners through paris . many back to work bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as travelers wait , the strike is costing up to 400 million euros -lrb- $ 590 million -rrb- a day sncf predicted that service would improve on wednesday , with an estimated 400 out of 700 tgv trains running .
paris metro operator ratp said it expected about one train in four to be operating . fewer and fewer rail workers have been participating in the strikes since the dispute over pension reform began .
on tuesday , the numbers stood at 27 percent of workers at sncf , and 18 percent at ratp .

" banks will also be invited to abolish existing discriminations , either based on nationality or residence , which abusively prevent individuals from opening accounts on a cross-border basis , " the commission said . making customers more mobile would in turn encourage more foreign banks to penetrate new markets . bolstering small companies the commission also plans to introduce a " small business act " by next year to help remove red tape for small companies seeking to operate in more than one eu nation . the draft also called for the establishment of a " one-stop shop " to give information to consumers and small businesses on their rights in the single market . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only a quarter of firms and consumers do business accross eu borders " today 's package puts consumers and small businesses first .

" it 's important that small businesses and consumers understand that the internal market is not just for big businesses , it 's for them as well , " he said . an overhaul of european consumer law is also planned . room for improvement the commission identified 23 economic sectors where the single market is not working well and said it would develop more targeted policies to improve the situation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to the eu , too much trade takes place inside national borders " only 26 percent of consumers make cross-border operations , and only 24 percent of business retailers .
in practical terms , the market remains , above all , national , " barroso said . the adoption of the strategic package follows an interim report submitted at the eu summit in february , which set out key principles for the bloc to take forward its strategy for the single market . the eu began 50 years ago as a free-trade association of six member states - belgium , france , germany , italy , luxembourg and the netherlands .

dw-world.de looks at germany 's foreign minister and - now - vice chancellor . steinmeier , a social democrat , took over from party colleague franz müntefering , who resigned last week to take care of his wife in her battle against cancer .
the 51-year-old has served as germany 's foreign minister since november 2005 , but his tenure in that office has remained low-key .
that 's partly due to the popularity of his predecessor , the green party 's joschka fischer , and to the tendency of conservative chancellor angela merkel to take center stage at foreign policy events .
a trained lawyer , steinmeier has a reputation as a political pragmatist capable of mediating between differing views .

critics say steinmeier refused an offer by the united states in 2002 to release kurnaz .
earlier this year , steinmeier was called to testify in front of a parliamentary investigative committee about the case and said he had no knowledge of the offer in question .

" this is an amazing discovery , " said simon braddy from the department of earth sciences at the university of bristol in england , in a press release . braddy , along with poschmann from the general department of cultural heritage in rhineland-palatinate and erik tetlie from yale university , co-authored the report . scientists surprised at size of find " we have known for some time that the fossil record yields monster millipedes , super-sized scorpions , colossal cockroaches , and jumbo dragonflies , but we never realized , until now , just how big some of these ancient creepy-crawlies were , " braddy added . poschmann described finding the claw in an area that probably had once been an ancient estuary or swamp .

after some cleaning i could identify this as a small part of a large claw , " poschmann said . " although i did n't know if it was complete or not , i decided to try and get it out .

some suggest that they benefited from an oxygen-rich atmosphere , while others argue that they had to get bigger in order to keep up with the supersizing of their likely prey , the early armored fish . " there is no simple single explanation , " braddy said . " it is more likely that some ancient arthropods were big because there was little competition from the vertebrates , as we see today .

" today we have presented another case of successful , functional autonomy , it is the case of aland islands within finland , " said slobodan samardzic , serbia 's minister for kosovo .
the proposal follows previous serbian proposals inspired by east germany and hong kong designed to dissuade kosovo from declaring independence from serbia .
aland is an archipelago of more than 6,000 islands in the baltic sea , about half way between sweden and finland .
its population of nearly 27,000 speaks swedish .
in 1917 , its residents asked to join sweden , but their bid was blocked by the league of nations , which decided that the archipelago should remain finnish but be granted greater autonomy .
" once again belgrade has come up with a fresh idea on the table , " said serbian foreign minister vuk jeremic , who also urged his kosovo counterparts to stop talking about independence and show " an open mind " during the negotiations .
earlier tuesday , kosovo 's prime minister-in-waiting , hashim thaci , had said he was willing to consult with the united states and the european union before proclaiming his province 's independence from serbia .
" we will take a decision on kosovo -lsb- independence -rsb- after december 10 , together with the us and the eu , " thaci said .
the united nations set a deadline for dec .
10 which would see the conclusion of diplomatic efforts led by the us-eu-russia troika .
the troika is struggling to negotiate a solution on the final status of the predominantly ethnic-albanian province , which is aspiring to become an independent state .
thaci indicates a softening tone after eu talks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kostunica , left , with eu commission president barroso tuesday 's talks in brussels mark the first time that thaci will have met face-to-face with serbian prime minister vojislav kostunica since he won the elections held in kosovo on saturday .
his latest comment appeared to suggest that the kosovo leadership was willing to soften its stance after coming under pressure from the eu not to be too hasty about declaring unilateral independence after dec .
10 .
his position was mirrored by similar remarks made by kosovo 's president , fatmir sejdiu .
" we will coordinate each and every step that we take with the international community , " said sejdiu , adding that kosovo had a strong interest in having its state of independence recognized by the world 's main powers .
kosovo 's plans for independence are strongly opposed by serbia , which enjoys the backing of russia in the un security council .
so far , both parties have made little progress on proposals put forward by the troika 's leader , german diplomat wolfgang ischinger .
russia has also already threatened to veto a deal granting kosovo independence put forward by un mediator martti ahtisaari .
troika 's leader more optimistic of success bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ischinger hopes to have an agreement by the dec .
10 deadline despite widespread pessimism about the outcome of tuesday 's talks , ischinger said he was in " good spirits " as he arrived in brussels .
" we will have a good troika session today and i am quite confident it will be a productive one , " he added .
such comments contrasted with remarks made by ischinger on monday , when he appeared to concede that no settlement was likely to be agreed by the dec .
10 deadline .
kosovo , whose population of about 2 million is 90 percent ethnic albanian , has been under un administration since 1999 , when nato bombing raids drove serbian troops out of the province .
while the us has said it is ready to recognize an independent kosovo , russia is opposed .
the eu is split on the matter , with all but a handful of its 27 member states willing to side with the us .
the troika is expected to hold a new , and probably final , round of talks in vienna on nov .

hyseni rejected serbia 's latest proposal which would turn kosovo into an autonomous province modeled on aland , a swedish-speaking archipelago belonging to finland , saying there was " nothing new " to it .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : kosovo in pursuit of indepedence major eu powers , us recognize kosovo independence kosovo independence : what can the world expect ? us , germany cautious on kosovo as separatists call for action serbia , russia move to annul kosovo independence kosovo -pipe- 21.11.2007 serbia proposes finnish province model for kosovo großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thaci said he was willing to work with the us and eu as serbia proposes a new plan a proposal by serbian officials attending talks in brussels with their kosovo counterparts and the eu-us-russia mediating troika envisages kosovo as an autonomous province modeled on a swedish-speaking archipelago . " today we have presented another case of successful , functional autonomy , it is the case of aland islands within finland , " said slobodan samardzic , serbia 's minister for kosovo .
the proposal follows previous serbian proposals inspired by east germany and hong kong designed to dissuade kosovo from declaring independence from serbia .
aland is an archipelago of more than 6,000 islands in the baltic sea , about half way between sweden and finland .
its population of nearly 27,000 speaks swedish .
in 1917 , its residents asked to join sweden , but their bid was blocked by the league of nations , which decided that the archipelago should remain finnish but be granted greater autonomy .
" once again belgrade has come up with a fresh idea on the table , " said serbian foreign minister vuk jeremic , who also urged his kosovo counterparts to stop talking about independence and show " an open mind " during the negotiations .
earlier tuesday , kosovo 's prime minister-in-waiting , hashim thaci , had said he was willing to consult with the united states and the european union before proclaiming his province 's independence from serbia .
" we will take a decision on kosovo -lsb- independence -rsb- after december 10 , together with the us and the eu , " thaci said .
the united nations set a deadline for dec .
10 which would see the conclusion of diplomatic efforts led by the us-eu-russia troika .
the troika is struggling to negotiate a solution on the final status of the predominantly ethnic-albanian province , which is aspiring to become an independent state .
thaci indicates a softening tone after eu talks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kostunica , left , with eu commission president barroso tuesday 's talks in brussels mark the first time that thaci will have met face-to-face with serbian prime minister vojislav kostunica since he won the elections held in kosovo on saturday .
his latest comment appeared to suggest that the kosovo leadership was willing to soften its stance after coming under pressure from the eu not to be too hasty about declaring unilateral independence after dec .
10 .
his position was mirrored by similar remarks made by kosovo 's president , fatmir sejdiu .
" we will coordinate each and every step that we take with the international community , " said sejdiu , adding that kosovo had a strong interest in having its state of independence recognized by the world 's main powers .
kosovo 's plans for independence are strongly opposed by serbia , which enjoys the backing of russia in the un security council .
so far , both parties have made little progress on proposals put forward by the troika 's leader , german diplomat wolfgang ischinger .
russia has also already threatened to veto a deal granting kosovo independence put forward by un mediator martti ahtisaari .
troika 's leader more optimistic of success bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ischinger hopes to have an agreement by the dec .
10 deadline despite widespread pessimism about the outcome of tuesday 's talks , ischinger said he was in " good spirits " as he arrived in brussels .
" we will have a good troika session today and i am quite confident it will be a productive one , " he added .
such comments contrasted with remarks made by ischinger on monday , when he appeared to concede that no settlement was likely to be agreed by the dec .
10 deadline .
kosovo , whose population of about 2 million is 90 percent ethnic albanian , has been under un administration since 1999 , when nato bombing raids drove serbian troops out of the province .
while the us has said it is ready to recognize an independent kosovo , russia is opposed .
the eu is split on the matter , with all but a handful of its 27 member states willing to side with the us .
the troika is expected to hold a new , and probably final , round of talks in vienna on nov .

the proposal follows previous serbian proposals inspired by east germany and hong kong designed to dissuade kosovo from declaring independence from serbia .
aland is an archipelago of more than 6,000 islands in the baltic sea , about half way between sweden and finland .
its population of nearly 27,000 speaks swedish .
in 1917 , its residents asked to join sweden , but their bid was blocked by the league of nations , which decided that the archipelago should remain finnish but be granted greater autonomy .
" once again belgrade has come up with a fresh idea on the table , " said serbian foreign minister vuk jeremic , who also urged his kosovo counterparts to stop talking about independence and show " an open mind " during the negotiations .
earlier tuesday , kosovo 's prime minister-in-waiting , hashim thaci , had said he was willing to consult with the united states and the european union before proclaiming his province 's independence from serbia .
" we will take a decision on kosovo -lsb- independence -rsb- after december 10 , together with the us and the eu , " thaci said .
the united nations set a deadline for dec .

" we will coordinate each and every step that we take with the international community , " said sejdiu , adding that kosovo had a strong interest in having its state of independence recognized by the world 's main powers .
kosovo 's plans for independence are strongly opposed by serbia , which enjoys the backing of russia in the un security council .
so far , both parties have made little progress on proposals put forward by the troika 's leader , german diplomat wolfgang ischinger .
russia has also already threatened to veto a deal granting kosovo independence put forward by un mediator martti ahtisaari .

20 , the european commission is taking steps toward achieving a true single market economy in the bloc . making it easier to switch bank accounts , helping consumers seek redress in other member states and opening up the car insurance industry to more competition are among the plans described in the draft . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the commission wants to shake up the banking sector " essentially , i want consumers to be able to shop around for the best deal in financial services in the same way that they do when buying a tv or a car , " eu internal market commissioner charlie mccreevy told a news conference . making it easier to change banks " if the consumer is unhappy , he or she should , without any fuss or delay , be able to change their account from one bank to another .
how easy is that ?
in some member states it 's not at all easy , " mccreevy said . the commission envisages making switches between domestic banks easier , first by giving a deadline for direct debits and standing orders to be redirected to the new lender . " banks will also be invited to abolish existing discriminations , either based on nationality or residence , which abusively prevent individuals from opening accounts on a cross-border basis , " the commission said . making customers more mobile would in turn encourage more foreign banks to penetrate new markets . bolstering small companies the commission also plans to introduce a " small business act " by next year to help remove red tape for small companies seeking to operate in more than one eu nation . the draft also called for the establishment of a " one-stop shop " to give information to consumers and small businesses on their rights in the single market . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only a quarter of firms and consumers do business accross eu borders " today 's package puts consumers and small businesses first .
it marks the start of a new cycle for the single market .
we need to make the strong base we already have work even better , " commission president jose manuel barroso told journalists . " it 's important that small businesses and consumers understand that the internal market is not just for big businesses , it 's for them as well , " he said . an overhaul of european consumer law is also planned . room for improvement the commission identified 23 economic sectors where the single market is not working well and said it would develop more targeted policies to improve the situation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to the eu , too much trade takes place inside national borders " only 26 percent of consumers make cross-border operations , and only 24 percent of business retailers .
in practical terms , the market remains , above all , national , " barroso said . the adoption of the strategic package follows an interim report submitted at the eu summit in february , which set out key principles for the bloc to take forward its strategy for the single market . the eu began 50 years ago as a free-trade association of six member states - belgium , france , germany , italy , luxembourg and the netherlands .
since then it has expanded to 27 members . dw staff -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" today we have presented another case of successful , functional autonomy , it is the case of aland islands within finland , " said slobodan samardzic , serbia 's minister for kosovo .
the proposal follows previous serbian proposals inspired by east germany and hong kong designed to dissuade kosovo from declaring independence from serbia .
aland is an archipelago of more than 6,000 islands in the baltic sea , about half way between sweden and finland .
its population of nearly 27,000 speaks swedish .
in 1917 , its residents asked to join sweden , but their bid was blocked by the league of nations , which decided that the archipelago should remain finnish but be granted greater autonomy .
" once again belgrade has come up with a fresh idea on the table , " said serbian foreign minister vuk jeremic , who also urged his kosovo counterparts to stop talking about independence and show " an open mind " during the negotiations .
earlier tuesday , kosovo 's prime minister-in-waiting , hashim thaci , had said he was willing to consult with the united states and the european union before proclaiming his province 's independence from serbia .
" we will take a decision on kosovo -lsb- independence -rsb- after december 10 , together with the us and the eu , " thaci said .

dw-world.de looks at germany 's foreign minister and - now - vice chancellor . steinmeier , a social democrat , took over from party colleague franz müntefering , who resigned last week to take care of his wife in her battle against cancer .
the 51-year-old has served as germany 's foreign minister since november 2005 , but his tenure in that office has remained low-key .
that 's partly due to the popularity of his predecessor , the green party 's joschka fischer , and to the tendency of conservative chancellor angela merkel to take center stage at foreign policy events .
a trained lawyer , steinmeier has a reputation as a political pragmatist capable of mediating between differing views .
he was also considered the closest advisor to gerhard schröder , merkel 's social democratic predecessor , and a major architect of schröder 's stance against the us-led war in iraq .

in particular , steinmeier has been criticized for his handling of the case of murat kurnaz , a turkish man born and residing in germany who the us imprisoned without proof of any wrongdoing for five years at the guantanamo bay prison camp in cuba .
critics say steinmeier refused an offer by the united states in 2002 to release kurnaz .
earlier this year , steinmeier was called to testify in front of a parliamentary investigative committee about the case and said he had no knowledge of the offer in question .

dw-world.de looks at germany 's foreign minister and - now - vice chancellor . steinmeier , a social democrat , took over from party colleague franz müntefering , who resigned last week to take care of his wife in her battle against cancer .
the 51-year-old has served as germany 's foreign minister since november 2005 , but his tenure in that office has remained low-key .
that 's partly due to the popularity of his predecessor , the green party 's joschka fischer , and to the tendency of conservative chancellor angela merkel to take center stage at foreign policy events .
a trained lawyer , steinmeier has a reputation as a political pragmatist capable of mediating between differing views .

in particular , steinmeier has been criticized for his handling of the case of murat kurnaz , a turkish man born and residing in germany who the us imprisoned without proof of any wrongdoing for five years at the guantanamo bay prison camp in cuba .
critics say steinmeier refused an offer by the united states in 2002 to release kurnaz .
earlier this year , steinmeier was called to testify in front of a parliamentary investigative committee about the case and said he had no knowledge of the offer in question .

" today we have presented another case of successful , functional autonomy , it is the case of aland islands within finland , " said slobodan samardzic , serbia 's minister for kosovo .
the proposal follows previous serbian proposals inspired by east germany and hong kong designed to dissuade kosovo from declaring independence from serbia .
aland is an archipelago of more than 6,000 islands in the baltic sea , about half way between sweden and finland .
its population of nearly 27,000 speaks swedish .
in 1917 , its residents asked to join sweden , but their bid was blocked by the league of nations , which decided that the archipelago should remain finnish but be granted greater autonomy .
" once again belgrade has come up with a fresh idea on the table , " said serbian foreign minister vuk jeremic , who also urged his kosovo counterparts to stop talking about independence and show " an open mind " during the negotiations .
earlier tuesday , kosovo 's prime minister-in-waiting , hashim thaci , had said he was willing to consult with the united states and the european union before proclaiming his province 's independence from serbia .
" we will take a decision on kosovo -lsb- independence -rsb- after december 10 , together with the us and the eu , " thaci said .
the united nations set a deadline for dec .
10 which would see the conclusion of diplomatic efforts led by the us-eu-russia troika .
the troika is struggling to negotiate a solution on the final status of the predominantly ethnic-albanian province , which is aspiring to become an independent state .
thaci indicates a softening tone after eu talks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kostunica , left , with eu commission president barroso tuesday 's talks in brussels mark the first time that thaci will have met face-to-face with serbian prime minister vojislav kostunica since he won the elections held in kosovo on saturday .
his latest comment appeared to suggest that the kosovo leadership was willing to soften its stance after coming under pressure from the eu not to be too hasty about declaring unilateral independence after dec .
10 .
his position was mirrored by similar remarks made by kosovo 's president , fatmir sejdiu .
" we will coordinate each and every step that we take with the international community , " said sejdiu , adding that kosovo had a strong interest in having its state of independence recognized by the world 's main powers .
kosovo 's plans for independence are strongly opposed by serbia , which enjoys the backing of russia in the un security council .
so far , both parties have made little progress on proposals put forward by the troika 's leader , german diplomat wolfgang ischinger .
russia has also already threatened to veto a deal granting kosovo independence put forward by un mediator martti ahtisaari .
troika 's leader more optimistic of success bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ischinger hopes to have an agreement by the dec .
10 deadline despite widespread pessimism about the outcome of tuesday 's talks , ischinger said he was in " good spirits " as he arrived in brussels .
" we will have a good troika session today and i am quite confident it will be a productive one , " he added .
such comments contrasted with remarks made by ischinger on monday , when he appeared to concede that no settlement was likely to be agreed by the dec .
10 deadline .
kosovo , whose population of about 2 million is 90 percent ethnic albanian , has been under un administration since 1999 , when nato bombing raids drove serbian troops out of the province .
while the us has said it is ready to recognize an independent kosovo , russia is opposed .
the eu is split on the matter , with all but a handful of its 27 member states willing to side with the us .
the troika is expected to hold a new , and probably final , round of talks in vienna on nov .

" today we have presented another case of successful , functional autonomy , it is the case of aland islands within finland , " said slobodan samardzic , serbia 's minister for kosovo .
the proposal follows previous serbian proposals inspired by east germany and hong kong designed to dissuade kosovo from declaring independence from serbia .
aland is an archipelago of more than 6,000 islands in the baltic sea , about half way between sweden and finland .
its population of nearly 27,000 speaks swedish .
in 1917 , its residents asked to join sweden , but their bid was blocked by the league of nations , which decided that the archipelago should remain finnish but be granted greater autonomy .
" once again belgrade has come up with a fresh idea on the table , " said serbian foreign minister vuk jeremic , who also urged his kosovo counterparts to stop talking about independence and show " an open mind " during the negotiations .
earlier tuesday , kosovo 's prime minister-in-waiting , hashim thaci , had said he was willing to consult with the united states and the european union before proclaiming his province 's independence from serbia .
" we will take a decision on kosovo -lsb- independence -rsb- after december 10 , together with the us and the eu , " thaci said .
the united nations set a deadline for dec .
10 which would see the conclusion of diplomatic efforts led by the us-eu-russia troika .
the troika is struggling to negotiate a solution on the final status of the predominantly ethnic-albanian province , which is aspiring to become an independent state .
thaci indicates a softening tone after eu talks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kostunica , left , with eu commission president barroso tuesday 's talks in brussels mark the first time that thaci will have met face-to-face with serbian prime minister vojislav kostunica since he won the elections held in kosovo on saturday .
his latest comment appeared to suggest that the kosovo leadership was willing to soften its stance after coming under pressure from the eu not to be too hasty about declaring unilateral independence after dec .
10 .
his position was mirrored by similar remarks made by kosovo 's president , fatmir sejdiu .
" we will coordinate each and every step that we take with the international community , " said sejdiu , adding that kosovo had a strong interest in having its state of independence recognized by the world 's main powers .
kosovo 's plans for independence are strongly opposed by serbia , which enjoys the backing of russia in the un security council .
so far , both parties have made little progress on proposals put forward by the troika 's leader , german diplomat wolfgang ischinger .
russia has also already threatened to veto a deal granting kosovo independence put forward by un mediator martti ahtisaari .
troika 's leader more optimistic of success bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ischinger hopes to have an agreement by the dec .
10 deadline despite widespread pessimism about the outcome of tuesday 's talks , ischinger said he was in " good spirits " as he arrived in brussels .
" we will have a good troika session today and i am quite confident it will be a productive one , " he added .
such comments contrasted with remarks made by ischinger on monday , when he appeared to concede that no settlement was likely to be agreed by the dec .
10 deadline .
kosovo , whose population of about 2 million is 90 percent ethnic albanian , has been under un administration since 1999 , when nato bombing raids drove serbian troops out of the province .
while the us has said it is ready to recognize an independent kosovo , russia is opposed .
the eu is split on the matter , with all but a handful of its 27 member states willing to side with the us .

20 , failed to break a deadlock over the future status of the breakaway province .
both sides stuck to their previous positions but agreed to hold intensive talks next week . meeting in brussels under the auspices of the eu-us-russia troika , serbian and kosovo delegations were unable to make progress on finding a solution for the future status of the serbian breakaway province .
according to a statement issued by european , us and russian mediators , negotiators for kosovo rejected a serb offer of broad autonomy and insisted that nothing short of an eu-supervised independence would be acceptable .
" yet again , i can not report any progress due to the intransigence of the serbian delegation , " said skender hyseni , spokesman for the kosovo delegation .
hyseni rejected serbia 's latest proposal which would turn kosovo into an autonomous province modeled on aland , a swedish-speaking archipelago belonging to finland , saying there was " nothing new " to it .
he also said kosovo had endured a long period of " harsh occupation " and that it had become a " de facto independent " state awaiting recognition from the international community .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kostunica -lrb- l . -rrb- blamed the kosovars for the impasse serbia 's delegation , led by president boris tadic and prime minister vojislav kostunica , rejected kosovo 's demands for independence and accused their counterparts of wasting time ahead of a dec .
10 deadline set by the united nations for an agreement to be reached .
" serbia is always looking for compromises .
if someone is wasting time , it 's not serbia , " kostunica said .
final chance for compromise ?
kosovo 's prime minister-in-waiting , hashim thaci , said he was willing to consult with the united states and the european union before proclaiming his province 's independence from serbia .

" in violation of previous agreements , certain member countries in the nato alliance are increasing their military resources next to our borders , " he said in an obvious reference to us plans to set up missile defense sites in poland and the czech republic . " of course , we can not allow ourselves to remain indifferent to this obvious muscle-flexing , " he added and ordered military officials to raise the combat readiness of the country 's nuclear forces as a response . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato 's secretary general has said the western alliance and russia face " difficult work " the speech , which came less than two weeks before the dec .

" one of the most important tasks remains raising the combat readiness of the strategic nuclear forces .
they should be ready to deliver a quick and adequate reply to any aggressor , " russian news agency interfax quoted putin as saying . russia would also consider pulling out of a key arms control accord with nato countries , if the alliance continued to push forward with its military activities in eastern europe . signed by western and former warsaw pact states in 1990 , the conventional forces in europe -lrb- cfe -rrb- treaty limits the deployment of tanks , aircraft and other heavy military weaponry .

russia has said it can not adhere to the cfe rules until members of the north atlantic treaty organization approve them . " we wo n't observe any obligations unilaterally , " putin said .
" our partners did not ratify the treaty and some did not even sign it , " he added . earlier in the year , putin threatened to suspend adherence to the cfe following a heated row over us plans for the anti-missile defense shield in eastern europe .
although washington has said the initiative is designed to guard against attacks from " rogue states , " moscow views it as an attempt by the us to expand its military influence into russia 's backyard . putin also pointed out that russian proposals to install a single missile defense system under joint control have received no response from the west . dw staff -lrb- ktz , als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

20 , the european commission is taking steps toward achieving a true single market economy in the bloc . making it easier to switch bank accounts , helping consumers seek redress in other member states and opening up the car insurance industry to more competition are among the plans described in the draft . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the commission wants to shake up the banking sector " essentially , i want consumers to be able to shop around for the best deal in financial services in the same way that they do when buying a tv or a car , " eu internal market commissioner charlie mccreevy told a news conference . making it easier to change banks " if the consumer is unhappy , he or she should , without any fuss or delay , be able to change their account from one bank to another .
how easy is that ?
in some member states it 's not at all easy , " mccreevy said . the commission envisages making switches between domestic banks easier , first by giving a deadline for direct debits and standing orders to be redirected to the new lender . " banks will also be invited to abolish existing discriminations , either based on nationality or residence , which abusively prevent individuals from opening accounts on a cross-border basis , " the commission said . making customers more mobile would in turn encourage more foreign banks to penetrate new markets . bolstering small companies the commission also plans to introduce a " small business act " by next year to help remove red tape for small companies seeking to operate in more than one eu nation . the draft also called for the establishment of a " one-stop shop " to give information to consumers and small businesses on their rights in the single market . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only a quarter of firms and consumers do business accross eu borders " today 's package puts consumers and small businesses first .
it marks the start of a new cycle for the single market .
we need to make the strong base we already have work even better , " commission president jose manuel barroso told journalists . " it 's important that small businesses and consumers understand that the internal market is not just for big businesses , it 's for them as well , " he said . an overhaul of european consumer law is also planned . room for improvement the commission identified 23 economic sectors where the single market is not working well and said it would develop more targeted policies to improve the situation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to the eu , too much trade takes place inside national borders " only 26 percent of consumers make cross-border operations , and only 24 percent of business retailers .
in practical terms , the market remains , above all , national , " barroso said . the adoption of the strategic package follows an interim report submitted at the eu summit in february , which set out key principles for the bloc to take forward its strategy for the single market . the eu began 50 years ago as a free-trade association of six member states - belgium , france , germany , italy , luxembourg and the netherlands .
since then it has expanded to 27 members . dw staff -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

20 , failed to break a deadlock over the future status of the breakaway province .
both sides stuck to their previous positions but agreed to hold intensive talks next week . meeting in brussels under the auspices of the eu-us-russia troika , serbian and kosovo delegations were unable to make progress on finding a solution for the future status of the serbian breakaway province .
according to a statement issued by european , us and russian mediators , negotiators for kosovo rejected a serb offer of broad autonomy and insisted that nothing short of an eu-supervised independence would be acceptable .
" yet again , i can not report any progress due to the intransigence of the serbian delegation , " said skender hyseni , spokesman for the kosovo delegation .
hyseni rejected serbia 's latest proposal which would turn kosovo into an autonomous province modeled on aland , a swedish-speaking archipelago belonging to finland , saying there was " nothing new " to it .
he also said kosovo had endured a long period of " harsh occupation " and that it had become a " de facto independent " state awaiting recognition from the international community .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kostunica -lrb- l . -rrb- blamed the kosovars for the impasse serbia 's delegation , led by president boris tadic and prime minister vojislav kostunica , rejected kosovo 's demands for independence and accused their counterparts of wasting time ahead of a dec .
10 deadline set by the united nations for an agreement to be reached .
" serbia is always looking for compromises .
if someone is wasting time , it 's not serbia , " kostunica said .
final chance for compromise ?
kosovo 's prime minister-in-waiting , hashim thaci , said he was willing to consult with the united states and the european union before proclaiming his province 's independence from serbia .
" we will take a decision on kosovo after dec .
10 , together with the us and eu , " thaci said .
serbian president tadic dismissed imposed solutions as unhelpful and said unilateral announcements of independence by kosovo would stand in the way of an agreement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thaci is focused on independence for kosovo a last-ditch attempt to find a compromise is slated to take place in austria on nov .
26-28 , the troika said in its statement .
the predominantly ethnic-albanian province of two million people is aspiring to become independent and to eventually join the eu and nato .
but the eu , which is split over whether to recognize the new country , has urged its leaders not to be too hasty in declaring independence .

" banks will also be invited to abolish existing discriminations , either based on nationality or residence , which abusively prevent individuals from opening accounts on a cross-border basis , " the commission said . making customers more mobile would in turn encourage more foreign banks to penetrate new markets . bolstering small companies the commission also plans to introduce a " small business act " by next year to help remove red tape for small companies seeking to operate in more than one eu nation . the draft also called for the establishment of a " one-stop shop " to give information to consumers and small businesses on their rights in the single market . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only a quarter of firms and consumers do business accross eu borders " today 's package puts consumers and small businesses first .
it marks the start of a new cycle for the single market .
we need to make the strong base we already have work even better , " commission president jose manuel barroso told journalists . " it 's important that small businesses and consumers understand that the internal market is not just for big businesses , it 's for them as well , " he said . an overhaul of european consumer law is also planned . room for improvement the commission identified 23 economic sectors where the single market is not working well and said it would develop more targeted policies to improve the situation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to the eu , too much trade takes place inside national borders " only 26 percent of consumers make cross-border operations , and only 24 percent of business retailers .
in practical terms , the market remains , above all , national , " barroso said . the adoption of the strategic package follows an interim report submitted at the eu summit in february , which set out key principles for the bloc to take forward its strategy for the single market . the eu began 50 years ago as a free-trade association of six member states - belgium , france , germany , italy , luxembourg and the netherlands .
since then it has expanded to 27 members . dw staff -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

although washington has said the initiative is designed to guard against attacks from " rogue states , " moscow views it as an attempt by the us to expand its military influence into russia 's backyard . putin also pointed out that russian proposals to install a single missile defense system under joint control have received no response from the west . dw staff -lrb- ktz , als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

20 , president putin warned that moscow would not remain indifferent to nato 's recent activities on its borders . " in violation of previous agreements , certain member countries in the nato alliance are increasing their military resources next to our borders , " he said in an obvious reference to us plans to set up missile defense sites in poland and the czech republic . " of course , we can not allow ourselves to remain indifferent to this obvious muscle-flexing , " he added and ordered military officials to raise the combat readiness of the country 's nuclear forces as a response . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato 's secretary general has said the western alliance and russia face " difficult work " the speech , which came less than two weeks before the dec .
2 parliamentary elections and was broadcast on state television , reflects putin 's increasingly assertive posture amid the growing tensions between russia and the west . more than just angry rhetoric ? the kremlin leader , who earlier this year threatened to target nuclear missiles at europe , said he wanted russia 's nuclear arsenal put on a higher level of readiness . " one of the most important tasks remains raising the combat readiness of the strategic nuclear forces .
they should be ready to deliver a quick and adequate reply to any aggressor , " russian news agency interfax quoted putin as saying . russia would also consider pulling out of a key arms control accord with nato countries , if the alliance continued to push forward with its military activities in eastern europe . signed by western and former warsaw pact states in 1990 , the conventional forces in europe -lrb- cfe -rrb- treaty limits the deployment of tanks , aircraft and other heavy military weaponry .
the accord was revised in 1999 to take into account former soviet satellites joining nato . new version of treaty not ratified bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgia said in august that a russian plane of this type violated the nation 's airspace however , the western alliance has refused to ratify the new version until moscow pulls its remaining troops out of georgia and moldova .

20 , the european commission is taking steps toward achieving a true single market economy in the bloc . making it easier to switch bank accounts , helping consumers seek redress in other member states and opening up the car insurance industry to more competition are among the plans described in the draft . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the commission wants to shake up the banking sector " essentially , i want consumers to be able to shop around for the best deal in financial services in the same way that they do when buying a tv or a car , " eu internal market commissioner charlie mccreevy told a news conference . making it easier to change banks " if the consumer is unhappy , he or she should , without any fuss or delay , be able to change their account from one bank to another .
how easy is that ?
in some member states it 's not at all easy , " mccreevy said . the commission envisages making switches between domestic banks easier , first by giving a deadline for direct debits and standing orders to be redirected to the new lender . " banks will also be invited to abolish existing discriminations , either based on nationality or residence , which abusively prevent individuals from opening accounts on a cross-border basis , " the commission said . making customers more mobile would in turn encourage more foreign banks to penetrate new markets . bolstering small companies the commission also plans to introduce a " small business act " by next year to help remove red tape for small companies seeking to operate in more than one eu nation . the draft also called for the establishment of a " one-stop shop " to give information to consumers and small businesses on their rights in the single market . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only a quarter of firms and consumers do business accross eu borders " today 's package puts consumers and small businesses first .
it marks the start of a new cycle for the single market .
we need to make the strong base we already have work even better , " commission president jose manuel barroso told journalists . " it 's important that small businesses and consumers understand that the internal market is not just for big businesses , it 's for them as well , " he said . an overhaul of european consumer law is also planned . room for improvement the commission identified 23 economic sectors where the single market is not working well and said it would develop more targeted policies to improve the situation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to the eu , too much trade takes place inside national borders " only 26 percent of consumers make cross-border operations , and only 24 percent of business retailers .
in practical terms , the market remains , above all , national , " barroso said . the adoption of the strategic package follows an interim report submitted at the eu summit in february , which set out key principles for the bloc to take forward its strategy for the single market . the eu began 50 years ago as a free-trade association of six member states - belgium , france , germany , italy , luxembourg and the netherlands .
since then it has expanded to 27 members . dw staff -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" today we have presented another case of successful , functional autonomy , it is the case of aland islands within finland , " said slobodan samardzic , serbia 's minister for kosovo .
the proposal follows previous serbian proposals inspired by east germany and hong kong designed to dissuade kosovo from declaring independence from serbia .
aland is an archipelago of more than 6,000 islands in the baltic sea , about half way between sweden and finland .
its population of nearly 27,000 speaks swedish .
in 1917 , its residents asked to join sweden , but their bid was blocked by the league of nations , which decided that the archipelago should remain finnish but be granted greater autonomy .
" once again belgrade has come up with a fresh idea on the table , " said serbian foreign minister vuk jeremic , who also urged his kosovo counterparts to stop talking about independence and show " an open mind " during the negotiations .
earlier tuesday , kosovo 's prime minister-in-waiting , hashim thaci , had said he was willing to consult with the united states and the european union before proclaiming his province 's independence from serbia .
" we will take a decision on kosovo -lsb- independence -rsb- after december 10 , together with the us and the eu , " thaci said .
the united nations set a deadline for dec .
10 which would see the conclusion of diplomatic efforts led by the us-eu-russia troika .
the troika is struggling to negotiate a solution on the final status of the predominantly ethnic-albanian province , which is aspiring to become an independent state .
thaci indicates a softening tone after eu talks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kostunica , left , with eu commission president barroso tuesday 's talks in brussels mark the first time that thaci will have met face-to-face with serbian prime minister vojislav kostunica since he won the elections held in kosovo on saturday .
his latest comment appeared to suggest that the kosovo leadership was willing to soften its stance after coming under pressure from the eu not to be too hasty about declaring unilateral independence after dec .
10 .
his position was mirrored by similar remarks made by kosovo 's president , fatmir sejdiu .
" we will coordinate each and every step that we take with the international community , " said sejdiu , adding that kosovo had a strong interest in having its state of independence recognized by the world 's main powers .
kosovo 's plans for independence are strongly opposed by serbia , which enjoys the backing of russia in the un security council .
so far , both parties have made little progress on proposals put forward by the troika 's leader , german diplomat wolfgang ischinger .
russia has also already threatened to veto a deal granting kosovo independence put forward by un mediator martti ahtisaari .

" today we have presented another case of successful , functional autonomy , it is the case of aland islands within finland , " said slobodan samardzic , serbia 's minister for kosovo .
the proposal follows previous serbian proposals inspired by east germany and hong kong designed to dissuade kosovo from declaring independence from serbia .
aland is an archipelago of more than 6,000 islands in the baltic sea , about half way between sweden and finland .
its population of nearly 27,000 speaks swedish .
in 1917 , its residents asked to join sweden , but their bid was blocked by the league of nations , which decided that the archipelago should remain finnish but be granted greater autonomy .
" once again belgrade has come up with a fresh idea on the table , " said serbian foreign minister vuk jeremic , who also urged his kosovo counterparts to stop talking about independence and show " an open mind " during the negotiations .
earlier tuesday , kosovo 's prime minister-in-waiting , hashim thaci , had said he was willing to consult with the united states and the european union before proclaiming his province 's independence from serbia .
" we will take a decision on kosovo -lsb- independence -rsb- after december 10 , together with the us and the eu , " thaci said .
the united nations set a deadline for dec .
10 which would see the conclusion of diplomatic efforts led by the us-eu-russia troika .
the troika is struggling to negotiate a solution on the final status of the predominantly ethnic-albanian province , which is aspiring to become an independent state .
thaci indicates a softening tone after eu talks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kostunica , left , with eu commission president barroso tuesday 's talks in brussels mark the first time that thaci will have met face-to-face with serbian prime minister vojislav kostunica since he won the elections held in kosovo on saturday .
his latest comment appeared to suggest that the kosovo leadership was willing to soften its stance after coming under pressure from the eu not to be too hasty about declaring unilateral independence after dec .
10 .
his position was mirrored by similar remarks made by kosovo 's president , fatmir sejdiu .
" we will coordinate each and every step that we take with the international community , " said sejdiu , adding that kosovo had a strong interest in having its state of independence recognized by the world 's main powers .
kosovo 's plans for independence are strongly opposed by serbia , which enjoys the backing of russia in the un security council .
so far , both parties have made little progress on proposals put forward by the troika 's leader , german diplomat wolfgang ischinger .
russia has also already threatened to veto a deal granting kosovo independence put forward by un mediator martti ahtisaari .
troika 's leader more optimistic of success bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ischinger hopes to have an agreement by the dec .
10 deadline despite widespread pessimism about the outcome of tuesday 's talks , ischinger said he was in " good spirits " as he arrived in brussels .
" we will have a good troika session today and i am quite confident it will be a productive one , " he added .
such comments contrasted with remarks made by ischinger on monday , when he appeared to concede that no settlement was likely to be agreed by the dec .
10 deadline .
kosovo , whose population of about 2 million is 90 percent ethnic albanian , has been under un administration since 1999 , when nato bombing raids drove serbian troops out of the province .
while the us has said it is ready to recognize an independent kosovo , russia is opposed .
the eu is split on the matter , with all but a handful of its 27 member states willing to side with the us .
the troika is expected to hold a new , and probably final , round of talks in vienna on nov .

dw-world.de looks at germany 's foreign minister and - now - vice chancellor . steinmeier , a social democrat , took over from party colleague franz müntefering , who resigned last week to take care of his wife in her battle against cancer .
the 51-year-old has served as germany 's foreign minister since november 2005 , but his tenure in that office has remained low-key .
that 's partly due to the popularity of his predecessor , the green party 's joschka fischer , and to the tendency of conservative chancellor angela merkel to take center stage at foreign policy events .
a trained lawyer , steinmeier has a reputation as a political pragmatist capable of mediating between differing views .
he was also considered the closest advisor to gerhard schröder , merkel 's social democratic predecessor , and a major architect of schröder 's stance against the us-led war in iraq .

in particular , steinmeier has been criticized for his handling of the case of murat kurnaz , a turkish man born and residing in germany who the us imprisoned without proof of any wrongdoing for five years at the guantanamo bay prison camp in cuba .
critics say steinmeier refused an offer by the united states in 2002 to release kurnaz .
earlier this year , steinmeier was called to testify in front of a parliamentary investigative committee about the case and said he had no knowledge of the offer in question .

dw-world.de looks at germany 's foreign minister and - now - vice chancellor . steinmeier , a social democrat , took over from party colleague franz müntefering , who resigned last week to take care of his wife in her battle against cancer .
the 51-year-old has served as germany 's foreign minister since november 2005 , but his tenure in that office has remained low-key .
that 's partly due to the popularity of his predecessor , the green party 's joschka fischer , and to the tendency of conservative chancellor angela merkel to take center stage at foreign policy events .
a trained lawyer , steinmeier has a reputation as a political pragmatist capable of mediating between differing views .
he was also considered the closest advisor to gerhard schröder , merkel 's social democratic predecessor , and a major architect of schröder 's stance against the us-led war in iraq .
criticism of past activities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier has so far had good relations with his partners in government steinmeier has , however , come under fire in conjunction with his post as chief-of-staff of the federal chancellery under schröder , a position he held from 1999 to 2005 .
in particular , steinmeier has been criticized for his handling of the case of murat kurnaz , a turkish man born and residing in germany who the us imprisoned without proof of any wrongdoing for five years at the guantanamo bay prison camp in cuba .
critics say steinmeier refused an offer by the united states in 2002 to release kurnaz .
earlier this year , steinmeier was called to testify in front of a parliamentary investigative committee about the case and said he had no knowledge of the offer in question .
on a lighter side , steinmeier recently raised smiles when he teamed up with his french foreign ministerial counterpart to record an ill-conceived rhythm-and-blues song in berlin .
no real increase in power bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : his talents as a singer have been called into question the duties of the vice chancellor are largely ceremonial , consisting mainly of deputizing at functions the chancellor is not able to attend .
in contrast to the vice president of the united states , the vice chancellor does not inherit the chancellorship , should a chancellor die in office .
still , steinmeier 's assumption of the new position , in addition to his serving as germany 's foreign minister , can only bolster his public profile and solidify his role within the grand coalition .

20 , the european commission is taking steps toward achieving a true single market economy in the bloc . making it easier to switch bank accounts , helping consumers seek redress in other member states and opening up the car insurance industry to more competition are among the plans described in the draft . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the commission wants to shake up the banking sector " essentially , i want consumers to be able to shop around for the best deal in financial services in the same way that they do when buying a tv or a car , " eu internal market commissioner charlie mccreevy told a news conference . making it easier to change banks " if the consumer is unhappy , he or she should , without any fuss or delay , be able to change their account from one bank to another .
how easy is that ?
in some member states it 's not at all easy , " mccreevy said . the commission envisages making switches between domestic banks easier , first by giving a deadline for direct debits and standing orders to be redirected to the new lender . " banks will also be invited to abolish existing discriminations , either based on nationality or residence , which abusively prevent individuals from opening accounts on a cross-border basis , " the commission said . making customers more mobile would in turn encourage more foreign banks to penetrate new markets . bolstering small companies the commission also plans to introduce a " small business act " by next year to help remove red tape for small companies seeking to operate in more than one eu nation . the draft also called for the establishment of a " one-stop shop " to give information to consumers and small businesses on their rights in the single market . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only a quarter of firms and consumers do business accross eu borders " today 's package puts consumers and small businesses first .
it marks the start of a new cycle for the single market .
we need to make the strong base we already have work even better , " commission president jose manuel barroso told journalists . " it 's important that small businesses and consumers understand that the internal market is not just for big businesses , it 's for them as well , " he said . an overhaul of european consumer law is also planned . room for improvement the commission identified 23 economic sectors where the single market is not working well and said it would develop more targeted policies to improve the situation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to the eu , too much trade takes place inside national borders " only 26 percent of consumers make cross-border operations , and only 24 percent of business retailers .
in practical terms , the market remains , above all , national , " barroso said . the adoption of the strategic package follows an interim report submitted at the eu summit in february , which set out key principles for the bloc to take forward its strategy for the single market . the eu began 50 years ago as a free-trade association of six member states - belgium , france , germany , italy , luxembourg and the netherlands .
since then it has expanded to 27 members . dw staff -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

both sides stuck to their previous positions but agreed to hold intensive talks next week . meeting in brussels under the auspices of the eu-us-russia troika , serbian and kosovo delegations were unable to make progress on finding a solution for the future status of the serbian breakaway province .
according to a statement issued by european , us and russian mediators , negotiators for kosovo rejected a serb offer of broad autonomy and insisted that nothing short of an eu-supervised independence would be acceptable .
" yet again , i can not report any progress due to the intransigence of the serbian delegation , " said skender hyseni , spokesman for the kosovo delegation .
hyseni rejected serbia 's latest proposal which would turn kosovo into an autonomous province modeled on aland , a swedish-speaking archipelago belonging to finland , saying there was " nothing new " to it .
he also said kosovo had endured a long period of " harsh occupation " and that it had become a " de facto independent " state awaiting recognition from the international community .

" we will take a decision on kosovo after dec .

paris metro operator ratp said it expected about one train in four to be operating . fewer and fewer rail workers have been participating in the strikes since the dispute over pension reform began .
on tuesday , the numbers stood at 27 percent of workers at sncf , and 18 percent at ratp .
those hard-core strikers have demanded the complete withdrawal of the center-right government 's pension reform . on wednesday , teachers , postal workers and civil servants had returned to work after their tuesday protests over the government 's economic reforms , reuters reported . accident on corsica separately , on the french island of corsica , two trains collided on wednesday , injuring 24 people .

paris metro operator ratp said it expected about one train in four to be operating . fewer and fewer rail workers have been participating in the strikes since the dispute over pension reform began .
on tuesday , the numbers stood at 27 percent of workers at sncf , and 18 percent at ratp .
those hard-core strikers have demanded the complete withdrawal of the center-right government 's pension reform . on wednesday , teachers , postal workers and civil servants had returned to work after their tuesday protests over the government 's economic reforms , reuters reported . accident on corsica separately , on the french island of corsica , two trains collided on wednesday , injuring 24 people .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 21.11.2007 foreign minister takes over as germany 's vice chancellor großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frank-walter steinmeier now has a second job long known as a behind-the-scenes politician , frank-walter steinmeier assumed another high-profile post on wednesday .
dw-world.de looks at germany 's foreign minister and - now - vice chancellor . steinmeier , a social democrat , took over from party colleague franz müntefering , who resigned last week to take care of his wife in her battle against cancer .
the 51-year-old has served as germany 's foreign minister since november 2005 , but his tenure in that office has remained low-key .
that 's partly due to the popularity of his predecessor , the green party 's joschka fischer , and to the tendency of conservative chancellor angela merkel to take center stage at foreign policy events .
a trained lawyer , steinmeier has a reputation as a political pragmatist capable of mediating between differing views .
he was also considered the closest advisor to gerhard schröder , merkel 's social democratic predecessor , and a major architect of schröder 's stance against the us-led war in iraq .
criticism of past activities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier has so far had good relations with his partners in government steinmeier has , however , come under fire in conjunction with his post as chief-of-staff of the federal chancellery under schröder , a position he held from 1999 to 2005 .
in particular , steinmeier has been criticized for his handling of the case of murat kurnaz , a turkish man born and residing in germany who the us imprisoned without proof of any wrongdoing for five years at the guantanamo bay prison camp in cuba .
critics say steinmeier refused an offer by the united states in 2002 to release kurnaz .
earlier this year , steinmeier was called to testify in front of a parliamentary investigative committee about the case and said he had no knowledge of the offer in question .
on a lighter side , steinmeier recently raised smiles when he teamed up with his french foreign ministerial counterpart to record an ill-conceived rhythm-and-blues song in berlin .

dw-world.de looks at germany 's foreign minister and - now - vice chancellor . steinmeier , a social democrat , took over from party colleague franz müntefering , who resigned last week to take care of his wife in her battle against cancer .
the 51-year-old has served as germany 's foreign minister since november 2005 , but his tenure in that office has remained low-key .
that 's partly due to the popularity of his predecessor , the green party 's joschka fischer , and to the tendency of conservative chancellor angela merkel to take center stage at foreign policy events .
a trained lawyer , steinmeier has a reputation as a political pragmatist capable of mediating between differing views .

critics say steinmeier refused an offer by the united states in 2002 to release kurnaz .
earlier this year , steinmeier was called to testify in front of a parliamentary investigative committee about the case and said he had no knowledge of the offer in question .

" today we have presented another case of successful , functional autonomy , it is the case of aland islands within finland , " said slobodan samardzic , serbia 's minister for kosovo .
the proposal follows previous serbian proposals inspired by east germany and hong kong designed to dissuade kosovo from declaring independence from serbia .
aland is an archipelago of more than 6,000 islands in the baltic sea , about half way between sweden and finland .
its population of nearly 27,000 speaks swedish .
in 1917 , its residents asked to join sweden , but their bid was blocked by the league of nations , which decided that the archipelago should remain finnish but be granted greater autonomy .
" once again belgrade has come up with a fresh idea on the table , " said serbian foreign minister vuk jeremic , who also urged his kosovo counterparts to stop talking about independence and show " an open mind " during the negotiations .
earlier tuesday , kosovo 's prime minister-in-waiting , hashim thaci , had said he was willing to consult with the united states and the european union before proclaiming his province 's independence from serbia .
" we will take a decision on kosovo -lsb- independence -rsb- after december 10 , together with the us and the eu , " thaci said .
the united nations set a deadline for dec .

his position was mirrored by similar remarks made by kosovo 's president , fatmir sejdiu .
" we will coordinate each and every step that we take with the international community , " said sejdiu , adding that kosovo had a strong interest in having its state of independence recognized by the world 's main powers .
kosovo 's plans for independence are strongly opposed by serbia , which enjoys the backing of russia in the un security council .
so far , both parties have made little progress on proposals put forward by the troika 's leader , german diplomat wolfgang ischinger .
russia has also already threatened to veto a deal granting kosovo independence put forward by un mediator martti ahtisaari .

20 , the european commission is taking steps toward achieving a true single market economy in the bloc . making it easier to switch bank accounts , helping consumers seek redress in other member states and opening up the car insurance industry to more competition are among the plans described in the draft . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the commission wants to shake up the banking sector " essentially , i want consumers to be able to shop around for the best deal in financial services in the same way that they do when buying a tv or a car , " eu internal market commissioner charlie mccreevy told a news conference . making it easier to change banks " if the consumer is unhappy , he or she should , without any fuss or delay , be able to change their account from one bank to another .
how easy is that ?
in some member states it 's not at all easy , " mccreevy said . the commission envisages making switches between domestic banks easier , first by giving a deadline for direct debits and standing orders to be redirected to the new lender . " banks will also be invited to abolish existing discriminations , either based on nationality or residence , which abusively prevent individuals from opening accounts on a cross-border basis , " the commission said . making customers more mobile would in turn encourage more foreign banks to penetrate new markets . bolstering small companies the commission also plans to introduce a " small business act " by next year to help remove red tape for small companies seeking to operate in more than one eu nation . the draft also called for the establishment of a " one-stop shop " to give information to consumers and small businesses on their rights in the single market . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only a quarter of firms and consumers do business accross eu borders " today 's package puts consumers and small businesses first .
it marks the start of a new cycle for the single market .
we need to make the strong base we already have work even better , " commission president jose manuel barroso told journalists . " it 's important that small businesses and consumers understand that the internal market is not just for big businesses , it 's for them as well , " he said . an overhaul of european consumer law is also planned . room for improvement the commission identified 23 economic sectors where the single market is not working well and said it would develop more targeted policies to improve the situation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to the eu , too much trade takes place inside national borders " only 26 percent of consumers make cross-border operations , and only 24 percent of business retailers .
in practical terms , the market remains , above all , national , " barroso said . the adoption of the strategic package follows an interim report submitted at the eu summit in february , which set out key principles for the bloc to take forward its strategy for the single market . the eu began 50 years ago as a free-trade association of six member states - belgium , france , germany , italy , luxembourg and the netherlands .

" today we have presented another case of successful , functional autonomy , it is the case of aland islands within finland , " said slobodan samardzic , serbia 's minister for kosovo .
the proposal follows previous serbian proposals inspired by east germany and hong kong designed to dissuade kosovo from declaring independence from serbia .
aland is an archipelago of more than 6,000 islands in the baltic sea , about half way between sweden and finland .
its population of nearly 27,000 speaks swedish .
in 1917 , its residents asked to join sweden , but their bid was blocked by the league of nations , which decided that the archipelago should remain finnish but be granted greater autonomy .
" once again belgrade has come up with a fresh idea on the table , " said serbian foreign minister vuk jeremic , who also urged his kosovo counterparts to stop talking about independence and show " an open mind " during the negotiations .
earlier tuesday , kosovo 's prime minister-in-waiting , hashim thaci , had said he was willing to consult with the united states and the european union before proclaiming his province 's independence from serbia .
" we will take a decision on kosovo -lsb- independence -rsb- after december 10 , together with the us and the eu , " thaci said .
the united nations set a deadline for dec .
10 which would see the conclusion of diplomatic efforts led by the us-eu-russia troika .
the troika is struggling to negotiate a solution on the final status of the predominantly ethnic-albanian province , which is aspiring to become an independent state .
thaci indicates a softening tone after eu talks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kostunica , left , with eu commission president barroso tuesday 's talks in brussels mark the first time that thaci will have met face-to-face with serbian prime minister vojislav kostunica since he won the elections held in kosovo on saturday .
his latest comment appeared to suggest that the kosovo leadership was willing to soften its stance after coming under pressure from the eu not to be too hasty about declaring unilateral independence after dec .
10 .
his position was mirrored by similar remarks made by kosovo 's president , fatmir sejdiu .
" we will coordinate each and every step that we take with the international community , " said sejdiu , adding that kosovo had a strong interest in having its state of independence recognized by the world 's main powers .
kosovo 's plans for independence are strongly opposed by serbia , which enjoys the backing of russia in the un security council .
so far , both parties have made little progress on proposals put forward by the troika 's leader , german diplomat wolfgang ischinger .
russia has also already threatened to veto a deal granting kosovo independence put forward by un mediator martti ahtisaari .
troika 's leader more optimistic of success bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ischinger hopes to have an agreement by the dec .

such comments contrasted with remarks made by ischinger on monday , when he appeared to concede that no settlement was likely to be agreed by the dec .

kosovo , whose population of about 2 million is 90 percent ethnic albanian , has been under un administration since 1999 , when nato bombing raids drove serbian troops out of the province .
while the us has said it is ready to recognize an independent kosovo , russia is opposed .

20 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ancient sea scorpion is the biggest known bug the 46-centimeter -lrb- 18-inch -rrb- claw probably came from an animal around 2.5 meters -lrb- eight feet , two inches -rrb- in length - half a meter longer than any previously found . " this is an amazing discovery , " said simon braddy from the department of earth sciences at the university of bristol in england , in a press release . braddy , along with poschmann from the general department of cultural heritage in rhineland-palatinate and erik tetlie from yale university , co-authored the report . scientists surprised at size of find " we have known for some time that the fossil record yields monster millipedes , super-sized scorpions , colossal cockroaches , and jumbo dragonflies , but we never realized , until now , just how big some of these ancient creepy-crawlies were , " braddy added . poschmann described finding the claw in an area that probably had once been an ancient estuary or swamp . " i was loosening pieces of rock with a hammer and chisel when i suddenly realized there was a dark patch of organic matter on a freshly removed slab .
after some cleaning i could identify this as a small part of a large claw , " poschmann said . " although i did n't know if it was complete or not , i decided to try and get it out .
the pieces had to be cleaned separately , dried , and then glued back together .
it was then put into a white plaster jacket to stabilize it , " he said . theories vary on reason for monstrous size bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paleontologists are at work all over germany the article said the discovery of the 390-million-year-old giant fossil claw proved that arthropods -lrb- spiders , insects and crabs with segmented bodies , jointed limbs and a hard external skeleton -rrb- were much larger in the past than previously thought . biologists delving into the earth 's distant past are divided as to how some arthropods were able to develop to such monstrous sizes .
some suggest that they benefited from an oxygen-rich atmosphere , while others argue that they had to get bigger in order to keep up with the supersizing of their likely prey , the early armored fish . " there is no simple single explanation , " braddy said . " it is more likely that some ancient arthropods were big because there was little competition from the vertebrates , as we see today .
if the amount of oxygen in the atmosphere suddenly increased , it does n't mean all the bugs would get bigger . " species only found in present-day germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the extinct ancestors of this scorpion were much larger despite their name , sea scorpions - known as eurypterids - were not true scorpions .
equipped with long , flat , jointed carapaces , they stalked warm shallow sea waters from around 500 million to 250 million years ago , eventually moving into fresh water . eurypterids are believed to be the extinct aquatic ancestors of today 's scorpions and possibly all arachnids , a class of joint-legged , invertebrate animals , including spiders , scorpions , mites and ticks . braddy said the fossil was from a jaekelopterus rhenaniae , a kind of scorpion that lived only in germany for about 10 million years , about 400 million years ago . dw staff -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

both sides stuck to their previous positions but agreed to hold intensive talks next week . meeting in brussels under the auspices of the eu-us-russia troika , serbian and kosovo delegations were unable to make progress on finding a solution for the future status of the serbian breakaway province .

20 , the european commission is taking steps toward achieving a true single market economy in the bloc . making it easier to switch bank accounts , helping consumers seek redress in other member states and opening up the car insurance industry to more competition are among the plans described in the draft . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the commission wants to shake up the banking sector " essentially , i want consumers to be able to shop around for the best deal in financial services in the same way that they do when buying a tv or a car , " eu internal market commissioner charlie mccreevy told a news conference . making it easier to change banks " if the consumer is unhappy , he or she should , without any fuss or delay , be able to change their account from one bank to another .
how easy is that ?
in some member states it 's not at all easy , " mccreevy said . the commission envisages making switches between domestic banks easier , first by giving a deadline for direct debits and standing orders to be redirected to the new lender . " banks will also be invited to abolish existing discriminations , either based on nationality or residence , which abusively prevent individuals from opening accounts on a cross-border basis , " the commission said . making customers more mobile would in turn encourage more foreign banks to penetrate new markets . bolstering small companies the commission also plans to introduce a " small business act " by next year to help remove red tape for small companies seeking to operate in more than one eu nation . the draft also called for the establishment of a " one-stop shop " to give information to consumers and small businesses on their rights in the single market . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only a quarter of firms and consumers do business accross eu borders " today 's package puts consumers and small businesses first .
it marks the start of a new cycle for the single market .
we need to make the strong base we already have work even better , " commission president jose manuel barroso told journalists . " it 's important that small businesses and consumers understand that the internal market is not just for big businesses , it 's for them as well , " he said . an overhaul of european consumer law is also planned . room for improvement the commission identified 23 economic sectors where the single market is not working well and said it would develop more targeted policies to improve the situation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to the eu , too much trade takes place inside national borders " only 26 percent of consumers make cross-border operations , and only 24 percent of business retailers .
in practical terms , the market remains , above all , national , " barroso said . the adoption of the strategic package follows an interim report submitted at the eu summit in february , which set out key principles for the bloc to take forward its strategy for the single market . the eu began 50 years ago as a free-trade association of six member states - belgium , france , germany , italy , luxembourg and the netherlands .

20 , the european commission is taking steps toward achieving a true single market economy in the bloc . making it easier to switch bank accounts , helping consumers seek redress in other member states and opening up the car insurance industry to more competition are among the plans described in the draft . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the commission wants to shake up the banking sector " essentially , i want consumers to be able to shop around for the best deal in financial services in the same way that they do when buying a tv or a car , " eu internal market commissioner charlie mccreevy told a news conference . making it easier to change banks " if the consumer is unhappy , he or she should , without any fuss or delay , be able to change their account from one bank to another .
how easy is that ?
in some member states it 's not at all easy , " mccreevy said . the commission envisages making switches between domestic banks easier , first by giving a deadline for direct debits and standing orders to be redirected to the new lender . " banks will also be invited to abolish existing discriminations , either based on nationality or residence , which abusively prevent individuals from opening accounts on a cross-border basis , " the commission said . making customers more mobile would in turn encourage more foreign banks to penetrate new markets . bolstering small companies the commission also plans to introduce a " small business act " by next year to help remove red tape for small companies seeking to operate in more than one eu nation . the draft also called for the establishment of a " one-stop shop " to give information to consumers and small businesses on their rights in the single market . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only a quarter of firms and consumers do business accross eu borders " today 's package puts consumers and small businesses first .
it marks the start of a new cycle for the single market .
we need to make the strong base we already have work even better , " commission president jose manuel barroso told journalists . " it 's important that small businesses and consumers understand that the internal market is not just for big businesses , it 's for them as well , " he said . an overhaul of european consumer law is also planned . room for improvement the commission identified 23 economic sectors where the single market is not working well and said it would develop more targeted policies to improve the situation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to the eu , too much trade takes place inside national borders " only 26 percent of consumers make cross-border operations , and only 24 percent of business retailers .
in practical terms , the market remains , above all , national , " barroso said . the adoption of the strategic package follows an interim report submitted at the eu summit in february , which set out key principles for the bloc to take forward its strategy for the single market . the eu began 50 years ago as a free-trade association of six member states - belgium , france , germany , italy , luxembourg and the netherlands .
since then it has expanded to 27 members . dw staff -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" our partners did not ratify the treaty and some did not even sign it , " he added . earlier in the year , putin threatened to suspend adherence to the cfe following a heated row over us plans for the anti-missile defense shield in eastern europe .
although washington has said the initiative is designed to guard against attacks from " rogue states , " moscow views it as an attempt by the us to expand its military influence into russia 's backyard . putin also pointed out that russian proposals to install a single missile defense system under joint control have received no response from the west . dw staff -lrb- ktz , als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

21 , aimed at ending an eight-day transport strike . sncf said there had been a " concerted campaign of sabotage " on rail lines of the high-speed tgv network .
sncf charged that the sabotage was aimed at stopping services from resuming as the eighth day of rail strikes began . sncf management in a statement said there had been " several acts " occurring " at the same time on the network , " as quoted by afp news agency . the company said sabotage consisted of several fires , including a " very large " blaze on the atlantic branch that damaged 30 kilometers -lrb- 18 miles -rrb- of the signal network and which had forced tgv trains to use normal tracks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : railway workers blocked a road in central marseille on monday in protest along the tgv 's northern and south-eastern lines , sncf said that " the deliberate shutting of signal switches is creating signal problems , and other arson attacks on cables have been reported , " as cited by afp . an arson attack on other cable arteries has also stopped normal train traffic since early wednesday morning . possible hour-long delays sncf said it expected the attacks to prompt hour-long delays along the tgv network that carries the majority of traffic between major french cities . transport minister dominique bussereau said the attacks were " grave and reprehensible acts of violence . ...
what is totally unacceptable is their apparent coordinated nature . " union leaders also condemned the incidents , with the head of the railway branch of the general labor confederation -lrb- cgt -rrb- , didier le reste , saying : " these acts of violence could have serious effects on rail safety .
they are unspeakable acts carried out by cowards . " the alleged sabotage came as talks were to take place between unions , management and government representatives to put an end to a nationwide rail strike over pension reforms . on tuesday , french president nicolas sarkozy promised to stand by his economic reforms and urged strikers to return to work . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : policemen also participated in protests on tuesday " we will not yield and we will not retreat , " the president said . french ministers have said they will not back off from the pension reform , which increases contribution periods for the half million beneficiaries of " special " pensions systems so they are in line with the rest of the population .
currently , they retire two and a half years earlier than most . also on tuesday , the rail workers were accompanied by hundreds of thousands of striking teachers , nurses , tax officials and other state employees demanding pay raises and an end to job cuts . mass rallies against the government were held in cities around the country , with some 30,000 people marching with banners through paris . many back to work bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as travelers wait , the strike is costing up to 400 million euros -lrb- $ 590 million -rrb- a day sncf predicted that service would improve on wednesday , with an estimated 400 out of 700 tgv trains running .
paris metro operator ratp said it expected about one train in four to be operating . fewer and fewer rail workers have been participating in the strikes since the dispute over pension reform began .
on tuesday , the numbers stood at 27 percent of workers at sncf , and 18 percent at ratp .
those hard-core strikers have demanded the complete withdrawal of the center-right government 's pension reform . on wednesday , teachers , postal workers and civil servants had returned to work after their tuesday protests over the government 's economic reforms , reuters reported . accident on corsica separately , on the french island of corsica , two trains collided on wednesday , injuring 24 people .
the trains rammed into each other on a stretch of single track that connects the island 's two main towns - ajaccio and bastia .
an official said that some passengers had suffered cuts and broken bones , but none of the injuries were life-threatening . railway operator sncf said there was no indication of any criminal damage to the rail network on corsica . initial reports suggested that an engineer had made a mistake which caused the collision .

20 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ancient sea scorpion is the biggest known bug the 46-centimeter -lrb- 18-inch -rrb- claw probably came from an animal around 2.5 meters -lrb- eight feet , two inches -rrb- in length - half a meter longer than any previously found . " this is an amazing discovery , " said simon braddy from the department of earth sciences at the university of bristol in england , in a press release . braddy , along with poschmann from the general department of cultural heritage in rhineland-palatinate and erik tetlie from yale university , co-authored the report . scientists surprised at size of find " we have known for some time that the fossil record yields monster millipedes , super-sized scorpions , colossal cockroaches , and jumbo dragonflies , but we never realized , until now , just how big some of these ancient creepy-crawlies were , " braddy added . poschmann described finding the claw in an area that probably had once been an ancient estuary or swamp . " i was loosening pieces of rock with a hammer and chisel when i suddenly realized there was a dark patch of organic matter on a freshly removed slab .
after some cleaning i could identify this as a small part of a large claw , " poschmann said . " although i did n't know if it was complete or not , i decided to try and get it out .
the pieces had to be cleaned separately , dried , and then glued back together .
it was then put into a white plaster jacket to stabilize it , " he said . theories vary on reason for monstrous size bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paleontologists are at work all over germany the article said the discovery of the 390-million-year-old giant fossil claw proved that arthropods -lrb- spiders , insects and crabs with segmented bodies , jointed limbs and a hard external skeleton -rrb- were much larger in the past than previously thought . biologists delving into the earth 's distant past are divided as to how some arthropods were able to develop to such monstrous sizes .
some suggest that they benefited from an oxygen-rich atmosphere , while others argue that they had to get bigger in order to keep up with the supersizing of their likely prey , the early armored fish . " there is no simple single explanation , " braddy said . " it is more likely that some ancient arthropods were big because there was little competition from the vertebrates , as we see today .
if the amount of oxygen in the atmosphere suddenly increased , it does n't mean all the bugs would get bigger .

" today we have presented another case of successful , functional autonomy , it is the case of aland islands within finland , " said slobodan samardzic , serbia 's minister for kosovo .
the proposal follows previous serbian proposals inspired by east germany and hong kong designed to dissuade kosovo from declaring independence from serbia .
aland is an archipelago of more than 6,000 islands in the baltic sea , about half way between sweden and finland .
its population of nearly 27,000 speaks swedish .
in 1917 , its residents asked to join sweden , but their bid was blocked by the league of nations , which decided that the archipelago should remain finnish but be granted greater autonomy .
" once again belgrade has come up with a fresh idea on the table , " said serbian foreign minister vuk jeremic , who also urged his kosovo counterparts to stop talking about independence and show " an open mind " during the negotiations .
earlier tuesday , kosovo 's prime minister-in-waiting , hashim thaci , had said he was willing to consult with the united states and the european union before proclaiming his province 's independence from serbia .
" we will take a decision on kosovo -lsb- independence -rsb- after december 10 , together with the us and the eu , " thaci said .
the united nations set a deadline for dec .
10 which would see the conclusion of diplomatic efforts led by the us-eu-russia troika .
the troika is struggling to negotiate a solution on the final status of the predominantly ethnic-albanian province , which is aspiring to become an independent state .
thaci indicates a softening tone after eu talks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kostunica , left , with eu commission president barroso tuesday 's talks in brussels mark the first time that thaci will have met face-to-face with serbian prime minister vojislav kostunica since he won the elections held in kosovo on saturday .
his latest comment appeared to suggest that the kosovo leadership was willing to soften its stance after coming under pressure from the eu not to be too hasty about declaring unilateral independence after dec .
10 .
his position was mirrored by similar remarks made by kosovo 's president , fatmir sejdiu .
" we will coordinate each and every step that we take with the international community , " said sejdiu , adding that kosovo had a strong interest in having its state of independence recognized by the world 's main powers .
kosovo 's plans for independence are strongly opposed by serbia , which enjoys the backing of russia in the un security council .
so far , both parties have made little progress on proposals put forward by the troika 's leader , german diplomat wolfgang ischinger .
russia has also already threatened to veto a deal granting kosovo independence put forward by un mediator martti ahtisaari .
troika 's leader more optimistic of success bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ischinger hopes to have an agreement by the dec .
10 deadline despite widespread pessimism about the outcome of tuesday 's talks , ischinger said he was in " good spirits " as he arrived in brussels .

such comments contrasted with remarks made by ischinger on monday , when he appeared to concede that no settlement was likely to be agreed by the dec .
10 deadline .
kosovo , whose population of about 2 million is 90 percent ethnic albanian , has been under un administration since 1999 , when nato bombing raids drove serbian troops out of the province .
while the us has said it is ready to recognize an independent kosovo , russia is opposed .
the eu is split on the matter , with all but a handful of its 27 member states willing to side with the us .

" today we have presented another case of successful , functional autonomy , it is the case of aland islands within finland , " said slobodan samardzic , serbia 's minister for kosovo .
the proposal follows previous serbian proposals inspired by east germany and hong kong designed to dissuade kosovo from declaring independence from serbia .
aland is an archipelago of more than 6,000 islands in the baltic sea , about half way between sweden and finland .
its population of nearly 27,000 speaks swedish .
in 1917 , its residents asked to join sweden , but their bid was blocked by the league of nations , which decided that the archipelago should remain finnish but be granted greater autonomy .
" once again belgrade has come up with a fresh idea on the table , " said serbian foreign minister vuk jeremic , who also urged his kosovo counterparts to stop talking about independence and show " an open mind " during the negotiations .
earlier tuesday , kosovo 's prime minister-in-waiting , hashim thaci , had said he was willing to consult with the united states and the european union before proclaiming his province 's independence from serbia .
" we will take a decision on kosovo -lsb- independence -rsb- after december 10 , together with the us and the eu , " thaci said .
the united nations set a deadline for dec .
10 which would see the conclusion of diplomatic efforts led by the us-eu-russia troika .
the troika is struggling to negotiate a solution on the final status of the predominantly ethnic-albanian province , which is aspiring to become an independent state .
thaci indicates a softening tone after eu talks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kostunica , left , with eu commission president barroso tuesday 's talks in brussels mark the first time that thaci will have met face-to-face with serbian prime minister vojislav kostunica since he won the elections held in kosovo on saturday .
his latest comment appeared to suggest that the kosovo leadership was willing to soften its stance after coming under pressure from the eu not to be too hasty about declaring unilateral independence after dec .
10 .
his position was mirrored by similar remarks made by kosovo 's president , fatmir sejdiu .
" we will coordinate each and every step that we take with the international community , " said sejdiu , adding that kosovo had a strong interest in having its state of independence recognized by the world 's main powers .
kosovo 's plans for independence are strongly opposed by serbia , which enjoys the backing of russia in the un security council .
so far , both parties have made little progress on proposals put forward by the troika 's leader , german diplomat wolfgang ischinger .
russia has also already threatened to veto a deal granting kosovo independence put forward by un mediator martti ahtisaari .
troika 's leader more optimistic of success bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ischinger hopes to have an agreement by the dec .
10 deadline despite widespread pessimism about the outcome of tuesday 's talks , ischinger said he was in " good spirits " as he arrived in brussels .
" we will have a good troika session today and i am quite confident it will be a productive one , " he added .
such comments contrasted with remarks made by ischinger on monday , when he appeared to concede that no settlement was likely to be agreed by the dec .
10 deadline .
kosovo , whose population of about 2 million is 90 percent ethnic albanian , has been under un administration since 1999 , when nato bombing raids drove serbian troops out of the province .
while the us has said it is ready to recognize an independent kosovo , russia is opposed .
the eu is split on the matter , with all but a handful of its 27 member states willing to side with the us .
the troika is expected to hold a new , and probably final , round of talks in vienna on nov .

" one of the most important tasks remains raising the combat readiness of the strategic nuclear forces .

20 , president putin warned that moscow would not remain indifferent to nato 's recent activities on its borders . " in violation of previous agreements , certain member countries in the nato alliance are increasing their military resources next to our borders , " he said in an obvious reference to us plans to set up missile defense sites in poland and the czech republic . " of course , we can not allow ourselves to remain indifferent to this obvious muscle-flexing , " he added and ordered military officials to raise the combat readiness of the country 's nuclear forces as a response . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato 's secretary general has said the western alliance and russia face " difficult work " the speech , which came less than two weeks before the dec .
2 parliamentary elections and was broadcast on state television , reflects putin 's increasingly assertive posture amid the growing tensions between russia and the west . more than just angry rhetoric ? the kremlin leader , who earlier this year threatened to target nuclear missiles at europe , said he wanted russia 's nuclear arsenal put on a higher level of readiness . " one of the most important tasks remains raising the combat readiness of the strategic nuclear forces .
they should be ready to deliver a quick and adequate reply to any aggressor , " russian news agency interfax quoted putin as saying . russia would also consider pulling out of a key arms control accord with nato countries , if the alliance continued to push forward with its military activities in eastern europe . signed by western and former warsaw pact states in 1990 , the conventional forces in europe -lrb- cfe -rrb- treaty limits the deployment of tanks , aircraft and other heavy military weaponry .

russia has said it can not adhere to the cfe rules until members of the north atlantic treaty organization approve them . " we wo n't observe any obligations unilaterally , " putin said .
" our partners did not ratify the treaty and some did not even sign it , " he added . earlier in the year , putin threatened to suspend adherence to the cfe following a heated row over us plans for the anti-missile defense shield in eastern europe .
although washington has said the initiative is designed to guard against attacks from " rogue states , " moscow views it as an attempt by the us to expand its military influence into russia 's backyard . putin also pointed out that russian proposals to install a single missile defense system under joint control have received no response from the west . dw staff -lrb- ktz , als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the accident happened in badong county , a hilly area next to the dam 's 660km -lrb- 410 mile -rrb- reservoir , where the group were working on a railway tunnel .
the cause of the accident was not known , xinhua said , but it comes amid growing warnings the dam is threatening its surrounding environment .
experts have warned of an increased risk of landslides around the dam .
the three gorges dam is the world 's largest hydro-electric project .
it crosses china 's biggest river , the yangtze , and is due to be completed by the end of 2008 .
' long way to go ' the landslide happened on tuesday morning .
earth and rocks engulfed four men and severed a nearby road , xinhua said .
one of the men was later rescued .
the area had suffered from heavy rain in recent days , the agency said .

it stems from a fundamental change in the way mortgages are funded .
traditionally , banks have financed their mortgage lending through the deposits they receive from their customers .
this has limited the amount of mortgage lending they could do .
in recent years , banks have moved to a new model where they sell on the mortgages to the bond markets .
this has made it much easier to fund additional borrowing , but it has also led to abuses as banks no longer have the incentive to check carefully the mortgages they issue .
the rise of the mortgage bond market in the past five years , the private sector has dramatically expanded its role in the mortgage bond market , which had previously been dominated by government-sponsored agencies like freddie mac .
they specialised in new types of mortgages , such as sub-prime lending to borrowers with poor credit histories and weak documentation of income , who were shunned by the " prime " lenders like freddie mac .
they also included " jumbo " mortgages for properties over freddie mac 's $ 417,000 -lrb- £ 202,000 -rrb- mortgage limit .
the business proved extremely profitable for the banks , which earned a fee for each mortgage they sold on .
they urged mortgage brokers to sell more and more of these mortgages .
now the mortgage bond market is worth $ 6 trillion , and is the largest single part of the whole $ 27 trillion us bond market , bigger even than treasury bonds .
how sub-prime lending affected one city the sub-prime crisis in cleveland sub-prime lending black areas foreclosures -lrb- repossessions -rrb- deutsche bank properties for many years , cleveland was the sub-prime capital of america .
it was a poor , working class city , hit hard by the decline of manufacturing and sharply divided along racial lines .
mortgage brokers focused their efforts by selling sub-prime mortgages in working class black areas where many people had achieved home ownership .
they told them that they could get cash by refinancing their homes , but often neglected to properly explain that the new sub-prime mortgages would " reset " after 2 years at double the interest rate .
the result was a wave of repossessions that blighted neighbourhoods across the city and the inner suburbs .
by late 2007 , one in ten homes in cleveland had been repossessed and deutsche bank trust , acting on behalf of bondholders , was the largest property owner in the city .
the crisis goes nationwide sub-prime lending had spread from inner-city areas right across america by 2005 .
by then , one in five mortgages were sub-prime , and they were particularly popular among recent immigrants trying to buy a home for the first time in the " hot " housing markets of southern california , arizona , nevada , and the suburbs of washington , dc and new york city .
house prices were high , and it was difficult to become an owner-occupier without moving to the very edge of the metropolitan area .
but these mortgages had a much higher rate of repossession than conventional mortgages because they were adjustable rate mortgages -lrb- arms -rrb- .
the payments were fixed for two years , and then became both higher and dependent on the level of fed intereset rates , which also rose substantially .
consequently , a wave of repossessions is sweeping america as many of these mortgages reset to higher rates in the next two years .
and it is likely that as many as two million families will be evicted from their homes as their cases make their way through the courts .
the bush administration is pushing the industry to renegotiate rather than repossess where possible , but mortgage companies are being overwhelmed by a tidal wave of cases .
the housing price crash the wave of repossessions is having a dramatic effect on house prices , reversing the housing boom of the last few years and causing the first national decline in house prices since the 1930s .
there is a glut of four million unsold homes that is depressing prices , as builders have also been forced to lower prices to get rid of unsold properties .
and house prices , which are currently declining at an annual rate of 4.5 % , are expected to fall by at least 10 % by next year - and more in areas like california and florida which had the biggest boom .
housing and the economy the property crash is also affecting the broader economy , with the building industry expected to cut its output by half , with the loss of between one and two million jobs .
many smaller builders will go out of business , and the larger firms are all suffering huge losses .
the building industry makes up 15 % of the us economy , but a slowdown in the property market also hits many other industries , for instance makers of durable goods , such as washing machines , and diy stores , such as home depot .
economists expect the us economy to slow in the last three months of 2007 to an annual rate of 1 % to 1.5 % , compared with growth of 3.9 % now .
but no one is sure how long the slowdown will last .
many us consumers have spent beyond their current income by borrowing on credit , and the fall in the value of their homes may make them reluctant to continue this pattern in the future .
credit crunch one reason the economic slowdown could get worse is that banks and other lenders are cutting back on how much credit they will make available .
they are rejecting more people who apply for credit cards , insisting on bigger deposits for house purchase , and looking more closely at applications for personal loans .
the mortgage market has been particularly badly affected , with individuals finding it very difficult to get non-traditional mortgages , both sub-prime and " jumbo " -lrb- over the limit guaranteed by government-sponsored agencies -rrb- .
the banks have been forced to do this by the drying up of the wholesale bond markets and by the effect of the crisis on their own balance sheets .
bank losses the banking industry is facing huge losses as a result of the sub-prime crisis .
already banks have announced $ 60bn worth of losses as many of the mortgage bonds backed by sub-prime mortgages have fallen in value .
the losses could be much greater , as many banks have concealed their holdings of sub-prime mortgages in exotic , off-balance sheet instruments such as " structured investment vehicles " or sivs .
although the banks say they do not own these sivs , and therefore are not liable for their losses , they may be forced to cover any bad debts that they accrue .
bond market collapse also suffering huge losses are the bondholders , such as pension funds , who bought sub-prime mortgage bonds .
these have fallen sharply in value in the last few months , and are now worth between 20 % and 40 % of their original value for most asset classes , even those considered safe by the ratings agencies .
if the banks are forced to reveal their losses based on current prices , they will be even bigger .
it is estimated that ultimately losses suffered by financial institutions could be between $ 220bn and $ 450bn , as the $ 1 trillion in sub-prime mortgage bonds is revalued .

the mortgage market has been particularly badly affected , with individuals finding it very difficult to get non-traditional mortgages , both sub-prime and " jumbo " -lrb- over the limit guaranteed by government-sponsored agencies -rrb- .
the banks have been forced to do this by the drying up of the wholesale bond markets and by the effect of the crisis on their own balance sheets .
bank losses the banking industry is facing huge losses as a result of the sub-prime crisis .
already banks have announced $ 60bn worth of losses as many of the mortgage bonds backed by sub-prime mortgages have fallen in value .
the losses could be much greater , as many banks have concealed their holdings of sub-prime mortgages in exotic , off-balance sheet instruments such as " structured investment vehicles " or sivs .
although the banks say they do not own these sivs , and therefore are not liable for their losses , they may be forced to cover any bad debts that they accrue .
bond market collapse also suffering huge losses are the bondholders , such as pension funds , who bought sub-prime mortgage bonds .
these have fallen sharply in value in the last few months , and are now worth between 20 % and 40 % of their original value for most asset classes , even those considered safe by the ratings agencies .
if the banks are forced to reveal their losses based on current prices , they will be even bigger .
it is estimated that ultimately losses suffered by financial institutions could be between $ 220bn and $ 450bn , as the $ 1 trillion in sub-prime mortgage bonds is revalued .

it stems from a fundamental change in the way mortgages are funded .
traditionally , banks have financed their mortgage lending through the deposits they receive from their customers .
this has limited the amount of mortgage lending they could do .
in recent years , banks have moved to a new model where they sell on the mortgages to the bond markets .
this has made it much easier to fund additional borrowing , but it has also led to abuses as banks no longer have the incentive to check carefully the mortgages they issue .
the rise of the mortgage bond market in the past five years , the private sector has dramatically expanded its role in the mortgage bond market , which had previously been dominated by government-sponsored agencies like freddie mac .
they specialised in new types of mortgages , such as sub-prime lending to borrowers with poor credit histories and weak documentation of income , who were shunned by the " prime " lenders like freddie mac .
they also included " jumbo " mortgages for properties over freddie mac 's $ 417,000 -lrb- £ 202,000 -rrb- mortgage limit .
the business proved extremely profitable for the banks , which earned a fee for each mortgage they sold on .
they urged mortgage brokers to sell more and more of these mortgages .
now the mortgage bond market is worth $ 6 trillion , and is the largest single part of the whole $ 27 trillion us bond market , bigger even than treasury bonds .
how sub-prime lending affected one city the sub-prime crisis in cleveland sub-prime lending black areas foreclosures -lrb- repossessions -rrb- deutsche bank properties for many years , cleveland was the sub-prime capital of america .
it was a poor , working class city , hit hard by the decline of manufacturing and sharply divided along racial lines .
mortgage brokers focused their efforts by selling sub-prime mortgages in working class black areas where many people had achieved home ownership .
they told them that they could get cash by refinancing their homes , but often neglected to properly explain that the new sub-prime mortgages would " reset " after 2 years at double the interest rate .
the result was a wave of repossessions that blighted neighbourhoods across the city and the inner suburbs .
by late 2007 , one in ten homes in cleveland had been repossessed and deutsche bank trust , acting on behalf of bondholders , was the largest property owner in the city .
the crisis goes nationwide sub-prime lending had spread from inner-city areas right across america by 2005 .
by then , one in five mortgages were sub-prime , and they were particularly popular among recent immigrants trying to buy a home for the first time in the " hot " housing markets of southern california , arizona , nevada , and the suburbs of washington , dc and new york city .
house prices were high , and it was difficult to become an owner-occupier without moving to the very edge of the metropolitan area .
but these mortgages had a much higher rate of repossession than conventional mortgages because they were adjustable rate mortgages -lrb- arms -rrb- .
the payments were fixed for two years , and then became both higher and dependent on the level of fed intereset rates , which also rose substantially .
consequently , a wave of repossessions is sweeping america as many of these mortgages reset to higher rates in the next two years .
and it is likely that as many as two million families will be evicted from their homes as their cases make their way through the courts .
the bush administration is pushing the industry to renegotiate rather than repossess where possible , but mortgage companies are being overwhelmed by a tidal wave of cases .
the housing price crash the wave of repossessions is having a dramatic effect on house prices , reversing the housing boom of the last few years and causing the first national decline in house prices since the 1930s .
there is a glut of four million unsold homes that is depressing prices , as builders have also been forced to lower prices to get rid of unsold properties .
and house prices , which are currently declining at an annual rate of 4.5 % , are expected to fall by at least 10 % by next year - and more in areas like california and florida which had the biggest boom .
housing and the economy the property crash is also affecting the broader economy , with the building industry expected to cut its output by half , with the loss of between one and two million jobs .
many smaller builders will go out of business , and the larger firms are all suffering huge losses .
the building industry makes up 15 % of the us economy , but a slowdown in the property market also hits many other industries , for instance makers of durable goods , such as washing machines , and diy stores , such as home depot .
economists expect the us economy to slow in the last three months of 2007 to an annual rate of 1 % to 1.5 % , compared with growth of 3.9 % now .
but no one is sure how long the slowdown will last .
many us consumers have spent beyond their current income by borrowing on credit , and the fall in the value of their homes may make them reluctant to continue this pattern in the future .
credit crunch one reason the economic slowdown could get worse is that banks and other lenders are cutting back on how much credit they will make available .
they are rejecting more people who apply for credit cards , insisting on bigger deposits for house purchase , and looking more closely at applications for personal loans .
the mortgage market has been particularly badly affected , with individuals finding it very difficult to get non-traditional mortgages , both sub-prime and " jumbo " -lrb- over the limit guaranteed by government-sponsored agencies -rrb- .

the financial times describes it as " a bleak day for the chancellor , already under pressure over his handling of the northern rock crisis and besieged by business for his proposed capital gains tax reforms . "
the paper 's political correspondent george parker says up until now mr darling has exhibited " quiet confidence " as a minister .
but after just five months as chancellor " the government 's leading firefighter appears in danger of being consumed by the political flames . "
in the times , crime correspondent adam fresco says that the personal information on the discs is enough for criminals to steal goods and money worth " hundreds of millions of pounds . "
it quotes a security consultant who says that all the information a fraudster would need to hack into people 's bank accounts will be contained on the discs .
" having a national insurance number is as good as having a passport , " says the consultant .
in the same paper , alice miles , sums up the outrage and disbelief over the security breach at revenue and customs .
" someone gave a disc containing confidential information about 25 million people to a bloke on a bike ?
and he lost it ? " she says .
the guardian says that the government was forced yesterday to admit " the most fundamental breach of faith between the state and the citizen " when it lost the data discs .
it discloses that the information commissioner richard thomas is now seeking new powers to enter government offices without warning for spot-checks .
the paper says mr thomas wants new criminal penalties for " reckless disregard of procedures " .
the paper 's parliamentary sketch writer simon hoggart describes the scenes in the house of commons when mr darling told mps the discs had been lost .
the tories had an easy target - and made the most of it , he says .
" this was n't just shooting fish in a barrel - it was harpooning a porpoise that 's got into the bath . "
the daily telegraph devotes nearly four pages of the paper to what it dubs the " lost records fiasco " .
children 's charities , it says , fear that the lost information will be " extremely useful " to paedophiles who might target children and pose as their parents .
its parliamentary sketch describes mr darling as looking " paralysed " in the commons .
his role , says sketch writer andrew grimson , is to act as " curator " , looking after the legacy of former chancellor gordon brown .
" as a mere curator , he can not do anything serious when water starts to pour through the roof , but can only rush around with his bucket and mop , doing his best to clear up the mess . "
the independent says seven million families are having to make urgent checks on their bank accounts .
the prime minister and his " embattled " chancellor were counting the cost to their reputations , the paper adds .
the sun 's headline is " skip to the loo my darling " .
and it says that the chancellor saw his reputation " going down the pan " .
in its editorial the paper says the " eye-popping scale " of the government 's latest fiasco " beggars belief " .
" who will trust an incompetent regime which casually allows the confidential records of half the population to be lost in the post ? " it asks .
the daily mirror is a little more charitable , fingering " blundering officials " as the main culprits behind the loss of the information .
but kevin maguire in the same paper predicts that gordon brown is poised to " shake up his downing street operation , creating a more professional no 10 machine " .
the daily mail says it is a case of " sheer , mind-blowing incompetence and stupidity ... in a class of its own " .
two fleet street papers - the daily express and daily star - do not lead on the data loss story .
but the express asks on its inside pages : " how could anyone be so incompetent ? " - next to a large picture of the embattled chancellor .

the financial times describes it as " a bleak day for the chancellor , already under pressure over his handling of the northern rock crisis and besieged by business for his proposed capital gains tax reforms . "
the paper 's political correspondent george parker says up until now mr darling has exhibited " quiet confidence " as a minister .
but after just five months as chancellor " the government 's leading firefighter appears in danger of being consumed by the political flames . "
in the times , crime correspondent adam fresco says that the personal information on the discs is enough for criminals to steal goods and money worth " hundreds of millions of pounds . "
it quotes a security consultant who says that all the information a fraudster would need to hack into people 's bank accounts will be contained on the discs .
" having a national insurance number is as good as having a passport , " says the consultant .
in the same paper , alice miles , sums up the outrage and disbelief over the security breach at revenue and customs .
" someone gave a disc containing confidential information about 25 million people to a bloke on a bike ?
and he lost it ? " she says .
the guardian says that the government was forced yesterday to admit " the most fundamental breach of faith between the state and the citizen " when it lost the data discs .
it discloses that the information commissioner richard thomas is now seeking new powers to enter government offices without warning for spot-checks .
the paper says mr thomas wants new criminal penalties for " reckless disregard of procedures " .
the paper 's parliamentary sketch writer simon hoggart describes the scenes in the house of commons when mr darling told mps the discs had been lost .
the tories had an easy target - and made the most of it , he says .
" this was n't just shooting fish in a barrel - it was harpooning a porpoise that 's got into the bath . "
the daily telegraph devotes nearly four pages of the paper to what it dubs the " lost records fiasco " .
children 's charities , it says , fear that the lost information will be " extremely useful " to paedophiles who might target children and pose as their parents .
its parliamentary sketch describes mr darling as looking " paralysed " in the commons .
his role , says sketch writer andrew grimson , is to act as " curator " , looking after the legacy of former chancellor gordon brown .
" as a mere curator , he can not do anything serious when water starts to pour through the roof , but can only rush around with his bucket and mop , doing his best to clear up the mess . "
the independent says seven million families are having to make urgent checks on their bank accounts .
the prime minister and his " embattled " chancellor were counting the cost to their reputations , the paper adds .
the sun 's headline is " skip to the loo my darling " .
and it says that the chancellor saw his reputation " going down the pan " .
in its editorial the paper says the " eye-popping scale " of the government 's latest fiasco " beggars belief " .
" who will trust an incompetent regime which casually allows the confidential records of half the population to be lost in the post ? " it asks .
the daily mirror is a little more charitable , fingering " blundering officials " as the main culprits behind the loss of the information .
but kevin maguire in the same paper predicts that gordon brown is poised to " shake up his downing street operation , creating a more professional no 10 machine " .
the daily mail says it is a case of " sheer , mind-blowing incompetence and stupidity ... in a class of its own " .

bbc news -pipe- uk -pipe- how papers see records data loss bbc news / uk graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- uk contents : england -pipe- northern ireland -pipe- scotland -pipe- wales -pipe- uk politics -pipe- education -pipe- magazine wednesday , 21 november 2007 , 09:11 gmt how papers see records data loss as might be expected , the papers devote a huge amount of their coverage to the news that the government has managed to lose the personal information of millions of families .
the financial times describes it as " a bleak day for the chancellor , already under pressure over his handling of the northern rock crisis and besieged by business for his proposed capital gains tax reforms . "
the paper 's political correspondent george parker says up until now mr darling has exhibited " quiet confidence " as a minister .
but after just five months as chancellor " the government 's leading firefighter appears in danger of being consumed by the political flames . "
in the times , crime correspondent adam fresco says that the personal information on the discs is enough for criminals to steal goods and money worth " hundreds of millions of pounds . "
it quotes a security consultant who says that all the information a fraudster would need to hack into people 's bank accounts will be contained on the discs .
" having a national insurance number is as good as having a passport , " says the consultant .
in the same paper , alice miles , sums up the outrage and disbelief over the security breach at revenue and customs .
" someone gave a disc containing confidential information about 25 million people to a bloke on a bike ?
and he lost it ? " she says .
the guardian says that the government was forced yesterday to admit " the most fundamental breach of faith between the state and the citizen " when it lost the data discs .
it discloses that the information commissioner richard thomas is now seeking new powers to enter government offices without warning for spot-checks .
the paper says mr thomas wants new criminal penalties for " reckless disregard of procedures " .
the paper 's parliamentary sketch writer simon hoggart describes the scenes in the house of commons when mr darling told mps the discs had been lost .
the tories had an easy target - and made the most of it , he says .
" this was n't just shooting fish in a barrel - it was harpooning a porpoise that 's got into the bath . "
the daily telegraph devotes nearly four pages of the paper to what it dubs the " lost records fiasco " .
children 's charities , it says , fear that the lost information will be " extremely useful " to paedophiles who might target children and pose as their parents .
its parliamentary sketch describes mr darling as looking " paralysed " in the commons .
his role , says sketch writer andrew grimson , is to act as " curator " , looking after the legacy of former chancellor gordon brown .
" as a mere curator , he can not do anything serious when water starts to pour through the roof , but can only rush around with his bucket and mop , doing his best to clear up the mess . "
the independent says seven million families are having to make urgent checks on their bank accounts .
the prime minister and his " embattled " chancellor were counting the cost to their reputations , the paper adds .
the sun 's headline is " skip to the loo my darling " .
and it says that the chancellor saw his reputation " going down the pan " .
in its editorial the paper says the " eye-popping scale " of the government 's latest fiasco " beggars belief " .
" who will trust an incompetent regime which casually allows the confidential records of half the population to be lost in the post ? " it asks .
the daily mirror is a little more charitable , fingering " blundering officials " as the main culprits behind the loss of the information .
but kevin maguire in the same paper predicts that gordon brown is poised to " shake up his downing street operation , creating a more professional no 10 machine " .
the daily mail says it is a case of " sheer , mind-blowing incompetence and stupidity ... in a class of its own " .
two fleet street papers - the daily express and daily star - do not lead on the data loss story .
but the express asks on its inside pages : " how could anyone be so incompetent ? " - next to a large picture of the embattled chancellor .

the controversial proposals cleared their first hurdle on tuesday night when they were granted outline planning approval by aberdeenshire councillors .
mr trump described the decision as a " tremendous victory " .
opponents said they would continue their fight to block the development at the menie estate .
the proposals involve two championship golf courses , 950 holiday homes , 36 golf villas and 500 private homes .
those behind the plans said they would bring thousands of jobs and a huge economic boost for the north east .
the issues here are far too important to be decided at a local level mickey foote sustainable aberdeenshire however , campaigners have warned about the impact on an environmentally sensitive site .
more than 100 people packed into balmedie primary school 's gymnasium to see councillors on the formartine area committee discuss the application .
after two-and-a-half hours of debate they voted by seven to four in favour of the plans .
the application will now be considered by aberdeenshire council 's infrastructure services committee next week .
it may also be examined by scottish ministers .
opponents have fears about the environmental impact of the plans mickey foote , of campaign group sustainable aberdeenshire , said he felt " let down " by the councillors .
he said : " this is not the end .
we will take this all the way to a public inquiry .
" the issues here are far too important to be decided at a local level . "
the scottish wildlife trust , which also opposed the resort plans , said its advice had been ignored .
national planning co-ordinator paul gallagher said : " the developers could have sited the proposal away from the designated and sensitive dune habitat but they failed to consider how the environmental impact could be diminished .
" if the plan proceeds in its current form , this development will destroy one of the top five dune habitats in the whole of britain . "
it 's very important that i do something that 's environmentally sensitive and that really is very expensive donald trump he urged opponents to write to local msps and the scottish government to voice their concerns .
however , the committee 's decision was welcomed by aberdeen and grampian chamber of commerce , which said the development would bring a range of new jobs to the area .
mr trump said would create jobs and bring in tourism .
he also explained why the development needed to include a housing element .
" it 's very important that i do something that 's environmentally sensitive and that really is very expensive , " he said .
" and for us to do the job the way everybody wants it , that seemed to be the minimal programme that we needed in order to pay for all of this .
" when you take care of the land the way we are going to take care of the land you need some income coming in on the other side . "

the controversial proposals cleared their first hurdle on tuesday night when they were granted outline planning approval by aberdeenshire councillors .
mr trump described the decision as a " tremendous victory " .
opponents said they would continue their fight to block the development at the menie estate .
the proposals involve two championship golf courses , 950 holiday homes , 36 golf villas and 500 private homes .
those behind the plans said they would bring thousands of jobs and a huge economic boost for the north east .
the issues here are far too important to be decided at a local level mickey foote sustainable aberdeenshire however , campaigners have warned about the impact on an environmentally sensitive site .
more than 100 people packed into balmedie primary school 's gymnasium to see councillors on the formartine area committee discuss the application .
after two-and-a-half hours of debate they voted by seven to four in favour of the plans .
the application will now be considered by aberdeenshire council 's infrastructure services committee next week .
it may also be examined by scottish ministers .
opponents have fears about the environmental impact of the plans mickey foote , of campaign group sustainable aberdeenshire , said he felt " let down " by the councillors .
he said : " this is not the end .
we will take this all the way to a public inquiry .
" the issues here are far too important to be decided at a local level . "
the scottish wildlife trust , which also opposed the resort plans , said its advice had been ignored .
national planning co-ordinator paul gallagher said : " the developers could have sited the proposal away from the designated and sensitive dune habitat but they failed to consider how the environmental impact could be diminished .
" if the plan proceeds in its current form , this development will destroy one of the top five dune habitats in the whole of britain . "
it 's very important that i do something that 's environmentally sensitive and that really is very expensive donald trump he urged opponents to write to local msps and the scottish government to voice their concerns .
however , the committee 's decision was welcomed by aberdeen and grampian chamber of commerce , which said the development would bring a range of new jobs to the area .
mr trump said would create jobs and bring in tourism .
he also explained why the development needed to include a housing element .
" it 's very important that i do something that 's environmentally sensitive and that really is very expensive , " he said .
" and for us to do the job the way everybody wants it , that seemed to be the minimal programme that we needed in order to pay for all of this .

more than 10,000 properties were affected when heavy rains overwhelmed the city 's drainage system on 25 june .
an independent review says that if the water company had heeded warnings about a pumping station " some properties in hull would have not been flooded " .
yorkshire water said no drainage system could have coped with the deluge .
" it is wrong to say that homes would have escaped flooding if we simply had bigger pumps , " the company said in a statement .
" we are not complacent , however , and will act immediately to make further significant investment to upgrade and improve the resilience of our infrastructure . "
" until a permanent solution is built , hull is served by an under-capacity , sub-standard system " independent review body report hull city council commissioned the report from an independent body chaired by tom coulthard , professor of physical geography at hull university .
it concluded that more than 8,600 homes , 1,300 businesses and 90 schools suffered flood damage as a result of june 's heavy rain .
" using evidence from a series of reports commissioned by yorkshire water , we have noted that over a period of 11 years , a series of clear recommendations relating to the condition , design and operation of the drainage and pumping systems of hull were made to yorkshire water , " it said .
" for some of these recommendations yorkshire water was unable to produce any records of , or confirm action taken , in respect of this advice .
" we believe that had these recommendations been implemented the impacts of the floods in june 2007 would not have been as severe . "
the report added that : " until a permanent solution is built , hull is served by an under-capacity , sub-standard system helped out by two 40-year-old pumping stations . "
much of the criticism relates to a pumping station at bransholme which broke down after it was flooded .
because it was unable to pump away water , homes and businesses nearby remained flooded longer than those in other areas and 1,000 households suffered extensive damage .
capacity ' overestimated ' the report recommends the pumping station be modernised and its capacity increased .
three reports dating back to 1996 had recommended the station be improved and there were suggestions that a second should be built .
the water company is also accused of repeatedly overestimating the capacity of its equipment to deal with heavy rain , a failing which the report said had probably contributed to thousands of pounds worth of damage to properties which could have been protected from flooding .
yorkshire water said : " the issue is not about building bigger pumps , but of the capacity of the drains and the sewers to cope with the intensity and concentration of the rainfall in these extreme weather events .
" we can not pump water if the water can not get to the pumps because the drains and sewers are full to capacity .
" this report should have been a catalyst for change and better co-operation and we are disappointed that it has chosen to focus instead on the shortcomings of our pumping infrastructure rather than the bigger picture of protecting hull from future flooding and the effects of climate change . "

houses are being repaired -lrb- slowly -rrb- , but i 'm not confident of this not happening again .
i do n't know if yorkshire water should have done more .
i just hope that enough investment goes into the infrastructure , it will probably have to come from yorkshire water , as the government wo n't invest as it 's only hull , and it 's in the north .
karl , hull , east yorkshire yw should have spent more money on maintenance and increasing capacity , and less money on huge bonus payments for senior staff .

they live in lundwood and were flooded by the emergency services being advised to pump water from one side of grange lane -lrb- near the mill of the black monks pub to save the bridge there from collapsing .
apparently the water board told them to do this regardless of the fact that both sides of the bank of the river was overflowing .
it compounded things on my sister 's side where there is a water treatment facility also .
this action meant that all the houses that flooded on lang ave were flooded with contaminated sewage water .
and lo and behold afterward no -one wanted to take the blame for the situation they made .

stephen johns , cottingham " the council could clean the drains more often " leigh boynton , hull , england i was affected by the floods around the willerby road area .
moorhouse road to be precise .
the floods have meant we have had to move house so work can be completed .
i think that the council could clean the drains more often because in the 5 years we lived there , they were n't cleaned once .
leigh boynton , hull , england i worked for yorkshire water for 11 years until march this year .
all i can say is that the company is clearly one of the best utilities in this country .
it has programmes of preventative maintenance and spends hundreds of millions of pounds every year maintaining and upgrading the infrastructure .
to come out with bland statements like a pumping station was at fault because it had n't been repaired is misleading and naive on the part of the review .
blocked drains are the main issue and they are the council 's responsibility .
mick , leeds i think it 's disgusting that yorkshire water chose to ignore this report and in doing so , effectively condemn hull to this fate .
i can not see how they can consciously gamble with people 's homes , businesses and ultimately lives .
another case of big businesses cutting corners to save money whilst the fat cats give themselves million pound bonuses .
will i receive a bonus for being out of my house for a year , losing my car , paying more in car insurance as well as house insurance ?
no , the people of hull will have to suffer the consequences of yorkshire water 's incompetence .

more than 10,000 properties were affected when heavy rains overwhelmed the city 's drainage system on 25 june .
an independent review says that if the water company had heeded warnings about a pumping station " some properties in hull would have not been flooded " .
yorkshire water said no drainage system could have coped with the deluge .
" it is wrong to say that homes would have escaped flooding if we simply had bigger pumps , " the company said in a statement .
" we are not complacent , however , and will act immediately to make further significant investment to upgrade and improve the resilience of our infrastructure . "
until a permanent solution is built , hull is served by an under-capacity , sub-standard system independent review body report hull city council commissioned the report from an independent body chaired by tom coulthard , professor of physical geography at hull university .
it concluded that more than 8,600 homes , 1,300 businesses and 90 schools suffered flood damage as a result of june 's heavy rain .
" using evidence from a series of reports commissioned by yorkshire water , we have noted that over a period of 11 years , a series of clear recommendations relating to the condition , design and operation of the drainage and pumping systems of hull were made to yorkshire water , " it said .
" for some of these recommendations yorkshire water was unable to produce any records of , or confirm action taken , in respect of this advice .
" we believe that had these recommendations been implemented the impacts of the floods in june 2007 would not have been as severe . "
the report added that : " until a permanent solution is built , hull is served by an under-capacity , sub-standard system helped out by two 40-year-old pumping stations . "
much of the criticism relates to a pumping station at bransholme which broke down after it was flooded .
because it was unable to pump away water , homes and businesses nearby remained flooded longer than those in other areas and 1,000 households suffered extensive damage .
capacity ' overestimated ' the report recommends the pumping station be modernised and its capacity increased .
three reports dating back to 1996 had recommended the station be improved and there were suggestions that a second should be built .
the water company is also accused of repeatedly overestimating the capacity of its equipment to deal with heavy rain , a failing which the report said had probably contributed to thousands of pounds worth of damage to properties which could have been protected from flooding .
yorkshire water said : " the issue is not about building bigger pumps , but of the capacity of the drains and the sewers to cope with the intensity and concentration of the rainfall in these extreme weather events .
" we can not pump water if the water can not get to the pumps because the drains and sewers are full to capacity .
" this report should have been a catalyst for change and better co-operation and we are disappointed that it has chosen to focus instead on the shortcomings of our pumping infrastructure rather than the bigger picture of protecting hull from future flooding and the effects of climate change . "

more than 10,000 properties were affected when heavy rains overwhelmed the city 's drainage system on 25 june .
an independent review says that if the water company had heeded warnings about a pumping station " some properties in hull would have not been flooded " .
yorkshire water said no drainage system could have coped with the deluge .
" it is wrong to say that homes would have escaped flooding if we simply had bigger pumps , " the company said in a statement .
" we are not complacent , however , and will act immediately to make further significant investment to upgrade and improve the resilience of our infrastructure . "
until a permanent solution is built , hull is served by an under-capacity , sub-standard system independent review body report hull city council commissioned the report from an independent body chaired by tom coulthard , professor of physical geography at hull university .
it concluded that more than 8,600 homes , 1,300 businesses and 90 schools suffered flood damage as a result of june 's heavy rain .
" using evidence from a series of reports commissioned by yorkshire water , we have noted that over a period of 11 years , a series of clear recommendations relating to the condition , design and operation of the drainage and pumping systems of hull were made to yorkshire water , " it said .
" for some of these recommendations yorkshire water was unable to produce any records of , or confirm action taken , in respect of this advice .
" we believe that had these recommendations been implemented the impacts of the floods in june 2007 would not have been as severe . "
the report added that : " until a permanent solution is built , hull is served by an under-capacity , sub-standard system helped out by two 40-year-old pumping stations . "
much of the criticism relates to a pumping station at bransholme which broke down after it was flooded .
because it was unable to pump away water , homes and businesses nearby remained flooded longer than those in other areas and 1,000 households suffered extensive damage .
capacity ' overestimated ' the report recommends the pumping station be modernised and its capacity increased .
three reports dating back to 1996 had recommended the station be improved and there were suggestions that a second should be built .
the water company is also accused of repeatedly overestimating the capacity of its equipment to deal with heavy rain , a failing which the report said had probably contributed to thousands of pounds worth of damage to properties which could have been protected from flooding .
yorkshire water said : " the issue is not about building bigger pumps , but of the capacity of the drains and the sewers to cope with the intensity and concentration of the rainfall in these extreme weather events .
" we can not pump water if the water can not get to the pumps because the drains and sewers are full to capacity .
" this report should have been a catalyst for change and better co-operation and we are disappointed that it has chosen to focus instead on the shortcomings of our pumping infrastructure rather than the bigger picture of protecting hull from future flooding and the effects of climate change . "

this action meant that all the houses that flooded on lang ave were flooded with contaminated sewage water .
and lo and behold afterward no -one wanted to take the blame for the situation they made .
julie dudas , barnsley south yorshire what a refreshing take on a solution which is obvious and well thought out .
why does yorkshire water not pick up he bill for the recovery programme .
or be fined an equivalent as an incentive to update and protect resources to ensure the pumping stations can cope with extraordinary natural events and infrastructure changes .
stephen johns , cottingham the council could clean the drains more often leigh boynton , hull , england i was affected by the floods around the willerby road area .
moorhouse road to be precise .
the floods have meant we have had to move house so work can be completed .
i think that the council could clean the drains more often because in the 5 years we lived there , they were n't cleaned once .
leigh boynton , hull , england i worked for yorkshire water for 11 years until march this year .
all i can say is that the company is clearly one of the best utilities in this country .
it has programmes of preventative maintenance and spends hundreds of millions of pounds every year maintaining and upgrading the infrastructure .
to come out with bland statements like a pumping station was at fault because it had n't been repaired is misleading and naive on the part of the review .
blocked drains are the main issue and they are the council 's responsibility .
mick , leeds i think it 's disgusting that yorkshire water chose to ignore this report and in doing so , effectively condemn hull to this fate .
i can not see how they can consciously gamble with people 's homes , businesses and ultimately lives .
another case of big businesses cutting corners to save money whilst the fat cats give themselves million pound bonuses .
will i receive a bonus for being out of my house for a year , losing my car , paying more in car insurance as well as house insurance ?
no , the people of hull will have to suffer the consequences of yorkshire water 's incompetence .

the two policymakers who did not vote to hold rates were david blanchflower as well as deputy governor john gieve .
the pair wanted a cut in interest rates after " continuing turmoil in financial markets " and the ongoing credit crunch .
but most of the monetary policy committee -lrb- mpc -rrb- members said they had seen little sign of the credit crunch hitting uk consumers and firms so far .
and they were still worried about inflation risks posed by rising oil and other commodity prices .
" moreover , since a reduction in bank rate was not widely expected this month , there was a danger that an immediate cut would be misinterpreted , precipitating an unwarranted further fall in the market yield curve , " the minutes said .
' uncertainty ' remains the last increase in uk interest rates came in july , when they rose to 5.75 % from 5.5 % .
at the time , many analysts expected rates to hit 6 % by the end of the year .
however , the recent credit crunch on the world 's financial markets , which led to the crisis at northern rock , has led many economists to amend their forecasts , with some now predicting a rate cut before too long .
in its latest economic forecast , the bank of england itself now says that there is likely to be a " sharp slowdown " in uk growth next year .
martin slaney of gft global markets said : " the minutes do little to dispel uncertainty over the timing of when a rate cut will come . "
he said it suggested rates " will be kept on hold for a few more months " as the bank monitored whether the negative effects of the credit crisis on growth was outweighing inflationary concerns over food and energy prices .
and ian kernohan , economist at rlam , said the minutes raised the prospect that an interest rate cut " could come as early as next month " .

the £ 400m plant with 150 jobs in port talbot will have the capacity to power half the homes in wales .
when completed it will produce about 70 % of the welsh assembly government 's 2010 renewable energy target .
but critics are worried about the impact the plant would have on health and the local environment .
london-based prenergy power ltd will build the plant in the town 's docks area after being given the go-ahead by business secretary john hutton of the department for business , enterprise and regulatory reform , formerly the department of trade and industry .
the station will burn about 3m tonnes of chippings shipped in each year .
prenergy said the use of wood chip as a fuel for electricity generation was recognised as being carbon-free .
it said the carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- released was equal to that absorbed during the growth of the tree , and replanting the trees ensured sustainability . "
port talbot is the most polluted area in wales and is already exceeding eu pollution levels on an all too-regular basis " councillor ted latham the power station would also create around 150 permanent jobs .
but there has been a local campaign against the proposal , with public meetings , 7,000 signatures in a petition , and protesters marched through the town centre .
campaigners have also called for a public inquiry .
councillor ted latham , whose ward overlooks the power station site , said campaigners were " extremely disappointed " at the decision and would meet later in the week to discuss their next move .
" ever since the application was lodged , we have had severe reservations in terms of the impact that it would have on health and the local environment for people here , " he said .
" port talbot is the most polluted area in wales and is already exceeding eu pollution levels on an all too-regular basis .
" in this particular case , we believe that enough is enough and that there are still too many questions that need answering . "
balancing act a council report which went before a port talbot planning meeting in march predicted emissions from the plant " would not have a significant effect on air quality " for surrounding areas and the visual impact was in keeping with the surrounding industrial area .
kevin mowbray from the welsh energy research centre said running a biomass plant was a balancing act .
" if you burn wood you are still producing carbon , but what we have got to do is balance that out by actually growing the wood that will suck the carbon back in , " he said .
" i am sure that the plant will be putting in a robust filtering system to keep the ash down but the health issues will be local . "
in announcing the plant , mr hutton also indicated support for the severn barrage at a select committee hearing on tuesday .
this was despite concerns from conservation and environmental groups of the impact on the eco-system in the severn estuary .
mr hutton said the low carbon benefits of the barrage , which could provide 5 % of the uk 's electricity , were enormous .

the £ 400m plant with 150 jobs in port talbot will have the capacity to power half the homes in wales .
when completed it will produce about 70 % of the welsh assembly government 's 2010 renewable energy target .
but critics are worried about the impact the plant would have on health and the local environment .
london-based prenergy power ltd will build the plant in the town 's docks area after being given the go-ahead by business secretary john hutton of the department for business , enterprise and regulatory reform , formerly the department of trade and industry .
the station will burn about 3m tonnes of chippings shipped in each year .
prenergy said the use of wood chip as a fuel for electricity generation was recognised as being carbon-free .
it said the carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- released was equal to that absorbed during the growth of the tree , and replanting the trees ensured sustainability .
port talbot is the most polluted area in wales and is already exceeding eu pollution levels on an all too-regular basis councillor ted latham the power station would also create around 150 permanent jobs .
but there has been a local campaign against the proposal , with public meetings , 7,000 signatures in a petition , and protesters marched through the town centre .
campaigners have also called for a public inquiry .
councillor ted latham , whose ward overlooks the power station site , said campaigners were " extremely disappointed " at the decision and would meet later in the week to discuss their next move .
" ever since the application was lodged , we have had severe reservations in terms of the impact that it would have on health and the local environment for people here , " he said .
" port talbot is the most polluted area in wales and is already exceeding eu pollution levels on an all too-regular basis .
" in this particular case , we believe that enough is enough and that there are still too many questions that need answering . "
balancing act a council report which went before a port talbot planning meeting in march predicted emissions from the plant " would not have a significant effect on air quality " for surrounding areas and the visual impact was in keeping with the surrounding industrial area .
kevin mowbray from the welsh energy research centre said running a biomass plant was a balancing act .
" if you burn wood you are still producing carbon , but what we have got to do is balance that out by actually growing the wood that will suck the carbon back in , " he said .
" i am sure that the plant will be putting in a robust filtering system to keep the ash down but the health issues will be local . "
in announcing the plant , mr hutton also indicated support for the severn barrage at a select committee hearing on tuesday .
this was despite concerns from conservation and environmental groups of the impact on the eco-system in the severn estuary .
mr hutton said the low carbon benefits of the barrage , which could provide 5 % of the uk 's electricity , were enormous .

moses lekalau , 35 , was walking home in the maralal safari area north-east of nairobi when the lion leapt out at him .
exhausted by his struggle , he lacked the strength to fight off a subsequent attack by hyenas .
mr lekalau was eventually rescued by a passing motorist who drove him to hospital .
he was airlifted to nairobi for surgery but died of blood loss .
terrible injuries mr lekalau told doctors that it took him half an hour to spear and bludgeon the lion to death .
as a samburu , he came from a community where it is traditional for boys to kill a lion as a rite of passage on entering manhood .
he spent seven hours in the operating theatre where doctors treating his extensive injuries were at first hopeful he would survive , but he had lost too much blood .
" hyenas are cowardly animals that usually feed on leftovers , " kenyan wildlife service spokesman paul udot told reporters .
" they must have been very hungry and realised the victim was vulnerable after the lion attack . "
national parks in kenya are not fenced off and the wildlife roam freely so animal attacks are quite common in rural areas .

amsterdam city council ruled in march that the rotting 150-year-old tree must be felled as a danger to the public .
the tree won a first reprieve in october but the council issued an order last week for the tree to be chopped down on wednesday morning .
a number of conservationists filed a legal claim to save the tree .
judge jurjen bade ruled on tuesday that the tree posed no immediate danger and called for alternative measures to be explored .
he said that felling the tree should be a " last resort " and told the council to meet with conservationists to find a solution .
they have until mid-january to come up with a plan .
symbol of freedom a utrecht-based firm , trees institute , has suggested a salvage plan involving treatment and support for the trunk and limbs , such as anchoring the tree with cables .
spokesman edwin koot told associated press : " we finally get the possibility to have time to look into the alternatives and that is exactly what we have asked for so long already .
" this is a monumental tree of unusual cultural and historical value .
it 's a symbol of freedom all over the world and it summons forth a lot of emotion , " he said .
the tree was a ray of hope for anne frank , the famous jewish diary writer , as she hid in the attic of a canal-side warehouse .
as a teenager she remained indoors with her family for 25 months until they were arrested in august 1944 .
she died of typhus in the bergen-belsen camp in march 1945 .
the attic window from which anne frank could see the tree was the only one that had not been blacked out .
in an entry dated february 23 , 1944 , she wrote : " from my favourite spot on the floor i look up at the blue sky and the bare chestnut tree , on whose branches little raindrops shine , appearing like silver , and at the seagulls and other birds as they glide on the wind ...
" as long as this exists , i thought , and i may live to see it , this sunshine , the cloudless skies , while this lasts i can not be unhappy . "
the 27-tonne tree is diseased with fungi and the owner wants it cut down as he would be liable for any damage caused should it fall .
the tree is adjacent to the building that now houses the anne frank museum .
the anne frank house told judge bade it was in favour of felling the tree , out of concern for the safety of the building and the hundreds of thousands of visitors it receives each year .
the museum has taken grafts and wants to replace the tree with a sapling from the original .

amsterdam city council ruled in march that the rotting 150-year-old tree must be felled as a danger to the public .
the tree won a first reprieve in october but the council issued an order last week for the tree to be chopped down on wednesday morning .
a number of conservationists filed a legal claim to save the tree .
judge jurjen bade ruled on tuesday that the tree posed no immediate danger and called for alternative measures to be explored .
he said that felling the tree should be a " last resort " and told the council to meet with conservationists to find a solution .
they have until mid-january to come up with a plan .
symbol of freedom a utrecht-based firm , trees institute , has suggested a salvage plan involving treatment and support for the trunk and limbs , such as anchoring the tree with cables .
spokesman edwin koot told associated press : " we finally get the possibility to have time to look into the alternatives and that is exactly what we have asked for so long already .
" this is a monumental tree of unusual cultural and historical value .
it 's a symbol of freedom all over the world and it summons forth a lot of emotion , " he said .
anne frank died in a nazi concentration camp in 1945 the tree was a ray of hope for anne frank , the famous jewish diary writer , as she hid in the attic of a canal-side warehouse .
as a teenager she remained indoors with her family for 25 months until they were arrested in august 1944 .
she died of typhus in the bergen-belsen camp in march 1945 .
the attic window from which anne frank could see the tree was the only one that had not been blacked out .
in an entry dated february 23 , 1944 , she wrote : " from my favourite spot on the floor i look up at the blue sky and the bare chestnut tree , on whose branches little raindrops shine , appearing like silver , and at the seagulls and other birds as they glide on the wind ...
" as long as this exists , i thought , and i may live to see it , this sunshine , the cloudless skies , while this lasts i can not be unhappy . "
the 27-tonne tree is diseased with fungi and the owner wants it cut down as he would be liable for any damage caused should it fall .
the tree is adjacent to the building that now houses the anne frank museum .
the anne frank house told judge bade it was in favour of felling the tree , out of concern for the safety of the building and the hundreds of thousands of visitors it receives each year .
the museum has taken grafts and wants to replace the tree with a sapling from the original .
