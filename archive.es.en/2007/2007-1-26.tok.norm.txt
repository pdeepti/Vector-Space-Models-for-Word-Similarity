he was released without being charged in 2006 . steinmeier not considering resignation in a report issued to a parliamentary control committee , deputy interior and foreign ministers reached the conclusion kurnaz could be denied a visa " by means of legally permissible material , " despite additional notes that the interior ministry " hoped to receive more information against k. from the us , " the daily reported . in addition to saying his resignation was " not open to debate , " steinmeier also rejected the newspapers ' claims that he or anyone in the schröder administration was responsible for extending kurnaz ' detention . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier has received support from chancellor angela merkel and said he wo n't quit " the alternatives were not germany or guantanamo , " he told the mass-circulation bild-zeitung on friday .
" what would be wrong with releasing him to turkey , where his wife and other family members live ? " steinmeier also hinted that conditions set for a release , possibly including using kurnaz to infiltrate radical islamist groups , were unacceptable .
berlin 's tagesspiegel newspaper reported that the german reluctance to use kurnaz as a spy may have convinced the americans to keep him in prison . protecting german national security steinmeier added that the german government was focused on protecting the country 's national security after the sept .
11 , 2001 terror attacks in the united states . " guaranteeing the safety of 82 million people in germany was our highest priority , " he told bild .
" leading members of the attacks in new york and washington came from hamburg and there were additional groups and networks of islamists ready to use violence in other german cities .
we had to expect the possibility of violence here and do everything we could to prevent it . " the european parliament also concluded this week that germany had turned down a us offer to release kurnaz .
a german parliamentary committee is investigating the matter . opposition demands answers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier testified in front of a second german investigation in december max stadler , a member of the free-market liberal free democratic party and a member of the inquiry panel , said steinmeier will have to explain why the previous government did not think it appropriate to take kurnaz back after he was no longer though to be a terror suspect . " this opportunity to secure kurnaz ' release should have been taken , no doubt about that , " he said .
" i ca n't really see any sound reasons why the previous german government did n't do this . " for his part , steinmeier said he was also interested in clearing up the issue as soon as possible , though he is unlikely to testify before march . " what is showing up in newspapers does not provide a complete picture , " he told bild .
" i am going to do my part so that at the end everything is clear . " petra pau of the opposition left party said steinmeier 's silence indicates that he has something to hide , pointing to the chances he 's had to clear up the situation in the past . " the foreign minister had every opportunity to testify before the european union 's inquiry panel , " she said .
" but steinmeier chose not to appear , which is a real scandal .

the family is thinking of taking the case to court . members of germany 's commission on returning art stolen by the nazis said the poster collection 's former owner , hans sachs , had made it clear that he felt he had already received adequate compensation for the loss of the collection which was originally made up of around 12,500 posters and 18,000 small drawings and stolen by the nazis in 1938 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernd neumann " the commission has reached a fair and just decision , " said german culture secretary bernd neumann . sachs emigrated to the us with his family in 1938 after the nazis imprisoned him at sachsenhausen concentration camp for two weeks . in 1961 , the west german government paid 225,000 deutsche marks -lrb- about 112,500 euros or $ 146,000 -rrb- in compensation .
at the time , sachs believed that his collection had been lost in the war . protecting treasures five years later , he found out that parts of his collection had resurfaced in an east berlin museum .

in 1966 , sachs also was said to have written to a west german friend indicating that he had no further claims . but on thursday , sachs 's son told the commission that he would certainly have wanted to see the collection return to the family .
it includes ad posters for goods , concerts , exhibitions and plays as well as political propaganda posters , and is estimated to have a value of up to $ 50 million -lrb- 38.5 million euros . -rrb- decision " morally unacceptable " ? " anyone who believes that my father was happy that an east german museum acquired his stolen collection , or that he would have wanted it kept from his own family , can not truly understand the moral implications of those words , " said peter sachs , 69 , adding that he was " inexpressibly saddened " by the commission 's decision . peter sachs ' lawyer called the commission 's ruling " morally unacceptable " and added that he was considering the possibility of taking legal steps against it . doing justice to the collection bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goethe institute president jutta limbach heads the advisory panel commission members meanwhile called on the german historical museum to " do justice " to sachs ' achievements as a collector and pioneer of poster art by caring for and exhibiting the collection .

he was released without being charged in 2006 . steinmeier not considering resignation in a report issued to a parliamentary control committee , deputy interior and foreign ministers reached the conclusion kurnaz could be denied a visa " by means of legally permissible material , " despite additional notes that the interior ministry " hoped to receive more information against k. from the us , " the daily reported . in addition to saying his resignation was " not open to debate , " steinmeier also rejected the newspapers ' claims that he or anyone in the schröder administration was responsible for extending kurnaz ' detention . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier has received support from chancellor angela merkel and said he wo n't quit " the alternatives were not germany or guantanamo , " he told the mass-circulation bild-zeitung on friday .
" what would be wrong with releasing him to turkey , where his wife and other family members live ? " steinmeier also hinted that conditions set for a release , possibly including using kurnaz to infiltrate radical islamist groups , were unacceptable .
berlin 's tagesspiegel newspaper reported that the german reluctance to use kurnaz as a spy may have convinced the americans to keep him in prison . protecting german national security steinmeier added that the german government was focused on protecting the country 's national security after the sept .
11 , 2001 terror attacks in the united states . " guaranteeing the safety of 82 million people in germany was our highest priority , " he told bild .
" leading members of the attacks in new york and washington came from hamburg and there were additional groups and networks of islamists ready to use violence in other german cities .
we had to expect the possibility of violence here and do everything we could to prevent it . " the european parliament also concluded this week that germany had turned down a us offer to release kurnaz .
a german parliamentary committee is investigating the matter . opposition demands answers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier testified in front of a second german investigation in december max stadler , a member of the free-market liberal free democratic party and a member of the inquiry panel , said steinmeier will have to explain why the previous government did not think it appropriate to take kurnaz back after he was no longer though to be a terror suspect . " this opportunity to secure kurnaz ' release should have been taken , no doubt about that , " he said .
" i ca n't really see any sound reasons why the previous german government did n't do this . " for his part , steinmeier said he was also interested in clearing up the issue as soon as possible , though he is unlikely to testify before march . " what is showing up in newspapers does not provide a complete picture , " he told bild .
" i am going to do my part so that at the end everything is clear . " petra pau of the opposition left party said steinmeier 's silence indicates that he has something to hide , pointing to the chances he 's had to clear up the situation in the past . " the foreign minister had every opportunity to testify before the european union 's inquiry panel , " she said .
" but steinmeier chose not to appear , which is a real scandal .
steinmeier is free to tell the public in more detail what he did - or did not do - to secure kurnaz ' release without revealing any classified information .

he ousted lennart johansson of sweden after 17 years in office . johansson had actually planned to leave his seat at the top of the union of european football associations to german soccer great franz beckenbauer , who was elected by uefa officials as the european representative on the executive committee of world soccer body fifa on friday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beckenbauer was elected to fifa 's executive committee on friday but the kaiser 's decision not to run for uefa 's top job set off a bitter race between platini and johansson , who felt compelled to keep the position he 's had since 1990 out of the frenchman 's hands . a former world soccer star and three-time european player of the year , platini made his intentions to lead the european federation years ago , but johansson 's hold on the job had kept him out of the post . the uefa presidency feud was decided in düsseldorf with a secret vote on friday .
platini won 27 votes , while 23 chose johansson .
two votes were invalid . " it 's the start of an adventure , " said an emotional platini after winning the vote .
" i want to thank everyone who have stayed loyal to me .
i 'm delighted to be able to represent european soccer . " years of ill will bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : platini captained the french team the election race was the most recent example of years worth of bad blood between the two men .
platini was quick to take sides against johansson in a 1998 dispute , complete with scandals and bribery allegations , over who should head fifa , world soccer 's governing body , and threw his support behind germany 's sepp blatter , who went on to win the position . " i would flee to a monastery so i did n't have to watch the massacre , " platini said of what he would do if johansson won the fifa job . not to be outdone , johansson also did his part to keep blatter from rewarding his supporter with a job as fifa 's technical director , saying there were " 200 people in the world " who met the job description , but that platini was n't one of them . " he is a nice person , but i do n't see him as qualified , " johansson said .
" but maybe he has talents i do n't know about . " all countries created equal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : johansson has run the federation since 1990 prior to the election , platini had been doling out uefa cash for development programs in smaller member states such as andorra and moldova , which have as much say as large nations like france and germany . " i 'm one of soccer 's romantics , " platini has often said , explaining why he chooses to focus on expressions like the " soccer family , " " solidarity " and " equal chances for everyone . " blatter has also shown that he has not forgotten his former adviser . " i would rather have a player , " he said .
" as a player , i know when my time is finished . " the power of money and exposure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the champions league tournament is a uefa cash cow johansson , on the other hand , was generally regarded as honest , faithful and upright .
he turned a shabby uefa into a rich , business-like federation leading to billions of euros of income from the champions league and european championships .
the influx of money allowed johansson to give each member country , large and small alike , about 370,000 euros -lrb- $ 480,722 -rrb- , a third more than expected . johansson also tried to sway smaller countries by promising to increase the number of teams in the european championship finals from 16 to 24 in 2012 .
that would allow nearly half of the federation 's 52 members to participate .
the expansion gamble has paid off in the past : former fifa president joao havelange won the job in 1974 after upping the number of world cup participants from 16 to 24 and used the same trick to keep his post in 1994 with another increase to 32 teams . past vs. future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : platini is uefa 's seventh president and the second frenchman to hold the post platini , 51 , however , had indirectly called johansson 's promises for the future into doubt by questioning what kinds of promises a 77-year-old should really be making . " it is up to the federations to decide if they want to vote for someone who is for the future or someone who represents the past , " said platini , who has also come out for age restrictions on federation officials and told johansson to concentrate on his hobby of fishing . the german federation had made its intention to support johansson clear , partly as a sign of thanks since johansson 's support was an important part of fifa 's decision to let germany host the 2006 world cup . " there has never been a better uefa president , " beckenbauer said .

the family is thinking of taking the case to court . members of germany 's commission on returning art stolen by the nazis said the poster collection 's former owner , hans sachs , had made it clear that he felt he had already received adequate compensation for the loss of the collection which was originally made up of around 12,500 posters and 18,000 small drawings and stolen by the nazis in 1938 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernd neumann " the commission has reached a fair and just decision , " said german culture secretary bernd neumann . sachs emigrated to the us with his family in 1938 after the nazis imprisoned him at sachsenhausen concentration camp for two weeks . in 1961 , the west german government paid 225,000 deutsche marks -lrb- about 112,500 euros or $ 146,000 -rrb- in compensation .
at the time , sachs believed that his collection had been lost in the war . protecting treasures five years later , he found out that parts of his collection had resurfaced in an east berlin museum .
he tried to get permission to view it , but east german officials did not grant him that wish before he died in 1974 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the collection is stored at the museum along with busts of lenin and hitler " i 'm certain that west and east germany will know to protect their treasures , " he allegedly wrote in the early 1970s .
in 1966 , sachs also was said to have written to a west german friend indicating that he had no further claims . but on thursday , sachs 's son told the commission that he would certainly have wanted to see the collection return to the family .
it includes ad posters for goods , concerts , exhibitions and plays as well as political propaganda posters , and is estimated to have a value of up to $ 50 million -lrb- 38.5 million euros . -rrb- decision " morally unacceptable " ? " anyone who believes that my father was happy that an east german museum acquired his stolen collection , or that he would have wanted it kept from his own family , can not truly understand the moral implications of those words , " said peter sachs , 69 , adding that he was " inexpressibly saddened " by the commission 's decision . peter sachs ' lawyer called the commission 's ruling " morally unacceptable " and added that he was considering the possibility of taking legal steps against it . doing justice to the collection bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goethe institute president jutta limbach heads the advisory panel commission members meanwhile called on the german historical museum to " do justice " to sachs ' achievements as a collector and pioneer of poster art by caring for and exhibiting the collection .
they also said that the posters should be presented as " collection hans sachs " and documented in a catalogue that includes the collection 's history . " this is in line with the intentions of the son and heir , peter sachs , not to let this unique collection fade from memory , " commission members wrote in a statement . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany aims for better restitution process for nazi-looted art the german government has invited museum directors and legal experts to berlin on monday to discuss claims for art bought or seized by the nazis .

he ousted lennart johansson of sweden after 17 years in office . johansson had actually planned to leave his seat at the top of the union of european football associations to german soccer great franz beckenbauer , who was elected by uefa officials as the european representative on the executive committee of world soccer body fifa on friday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beckenbauer was elected to fifa 's executive committee on friday but the kaiser 's decision not to run for uefa 's top job set off a bitter race between platini and johansson , who felt compelled to keep the position he 's had since 1990 out of the frenchman 's hands . a former world soccer star and three-time european player of the year , platini made his intentions to lead the european federation years ago , but johansson 's hold on the job had kept him out of the post . the uefa presidency feud was decided in düsseldorf with a secret vote on friday .
platini won 27 votes , while 23 chose johansson .
two votes were invalid . " it 's the start of an adventure , " said an emotional platini after winning the vote .
" i want to thank everyone who have stayed loyal to me .
i 'm delighted to be able to represent european soccer . " years of ill will bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : platini captained the french team the election race was the most recent example of years worth of bad blood between the two men .
platini was quick to take sides against johansson in a 1998 dispute , complete with scandals and bribery allegations , over who should head fifa , world soccer 's governing body , and threw his support behind germany 's sepp blatter , who went on to win the position . " i would flee to a monastery so i did n't have to watch the massacre , " platini said of what he would do if johansson won the fifa job . not to be outdone , johansson also did his part to keep blatter from rewarding his supporter with a job as fifa 's technical director , saying there were " 200 people in the world " who met the job description , but that platini was n't one of them . " he is a nice person , but i do n't see him as qualified , " johansson said .
" but maybe he has talents i do n't know about . " all countries created equal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : johansson has run the federation since 1990 prior to the election , platini had been doling out uefa cash for development programs in smaller member states such as andorra and moldova , which have as much say as large nations like france and germany . " i 'm one of soccer 's romantics , " platini has often said , explaining why he chooses to focus on expressions like the " soccer family , " " solidarity " and " equal chances for everyone . " blatter has also shown that he has not forgotten his former adviser . " i would rather have a player , " he said .
" as a player , i know when my time is finished . " the power of money and exposure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the champions league tournament is a uefa cash cow johansson , on the other hand , was generally regarded as honest , faithful and upright .
he turned a shabby uefa into a rich , business-like federation leading to billions of euros of income from the champions league and european championships .
the influx of money allowed johansson to give each member country , large and small alike , about 370,000 euros -lrb- $ 480,722 -rrb- , a third more than expected . johansson also tried to sway smaller countries by promising to increase the number of teams in the european championship finals from 16 to 24 in 2012 .
that would allow nearly half of the federation 's 52 members to participate .
the expansion gamble has paid off in the past : former fifa president joao havelange won the job in 1974 after upping the number of world cup participants from 16 to 24 and used the same trick to keep his post in 1994 with another increase to 32 teams . past vs. future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : platini is uefa 's seventh president and the second frenchman to hold the post platini , 51 , however , had indirectly called johansson 's promises for the future into doubt by questioning what kinds of promises a 77-year-old should really be making . " it is up to the federations to decide if they want to vote for someone who is for the future or someone who represents the past , " said platini , who has also come out for age restrictions on federation officials and told johansson to concentrate on his hobby of fishing . the german federation had made its intention to support johansson clear , partly as a sign of thanks since johansson 's support was an important part of fifa 's decision to let germany host the 2006 world cup . " there has never been a better uefa president , " beckenbauer said .

the family is thinking of taking the case to court . members of germany 's commission on returning art stolen by the nazis said the poster collection 's former owner , hans sachs , had made it clear that he felt he had already received adequate compensation for the loss of the collection which was originally made up of around 12,500 posters and 18,000 small drawings and stolen by the nazis in 1938 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernd neumann " the commission has reached a fair and just decision , " said german culture secretary bernd neumann . sachs emigrated to the us with his family in 1938 after the nazis imprisoned him at sachsenhausen concentration camp for two weeks . in 1961 , the west german government paid 225,000 deutsche marks -lrb- about 112,500 euros or $ 146,000 -rrb- in compensation .
at the time , sachs believed that his collection had been lost in the war . protecting treasures five years later , he found out that parts of his collection had resurfaced in an east berlin museum .
he tried to get permission to view it , but east german officials did not grant him that wish before he died in 1974 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the collection is stored at the museum along with busts of lenin and hitler " i 'm certain that west and east germany will know to protect their treasures , " he allegedly wrote in the early 1970s .
in 1966 , sachs also was said to have written to a west german friend indicating that he had no further claims . but on thursday , sachs 's son told the commission that he would certainly have wanted to see the collection return to the family .
it includes ad posters for goods , concerts , exhibitions and plays as well as political propaganda posters , and is estimated to have a value of up to $ 50 million -lrb- 38.5 million euros . -rrb- decision " morally unacceptable " ? " anyone who believes that my father was happy that an east german museum acquired his stolen collection , or that he would have wanted it kept from his own family , can not truly understand the moral implications of those words , " said peter sachs , 69 , adding that he was " inexpressibly saddened " by the commission 's decision . peter sachs ' lawyer called the commission 's ruling " morally unacceptable " and added that he was considering the possibility of taking legal steps against it . doing justice to the collection bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goethe institute president jutta limbach heads the advisory panel commission members meanwhile called on the german historical museum to " do justice " to sachs ' achievements as a collector and pioneer of poster art by caring for and exhibiting the collection .
they also said that the posters should be presented as " collection hans sachs " and documented in a catalogue that includes the collection 's history . " this is in line with the intentions of the son and heir , peter sachs , not to let this unique collection fade from memory , " commission members wrote in a statement . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany aims for better restitution process for nazi-looted art the german government has invited museum directors and legal experts to berlin on monday to discuss claims for art bought or seized by the nazis .

but some say that is not going to happen . resurrecting the half-buried european constitution is " a near-impossible task , " a spanish diplomat acknowledged ahead of a friday meeting at which 18 european union countries attempted to breathe new life into the controversial document . despite official optimism , the 18 were well aware of the difficulties faced by the german eu presidency , which has set rescuing the constitution among its top priorities . the 18 " friends of the european constitution , " all of which have ratified it , were called together by spain and luxembourg to press the other nine countries into relaunching the constitutional process . the charter has been on ice since french and dutch voters rejected it in 2005 referendums . huge challenges ahead countries present in madrid stressed the importance of a politically-committed " real " constitution rather than a scaled-down " mini-treaty . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french and the dutch remain skeptical " we can not resign ourselves to europe being no more than a huge market , " spanish secretary of state alberto navarro and luxembourg delegate foreign affairs minister nicolas schmit wrote in a letter published by the european press . europe had huge challenges to face , ranging from climate change and globalization to immigration , organized crime and social inequality , spanish foreign minister miguel angel moratinos stressed . proponents of a strong charter also say a shift towards more qualified majority voting would help the eu absorb new members , and that the creation of an elected european council president and a eu foreign minister would make it easier to intervene in international crises . reform is unnecessary the german eu presidency wants to salvage the " substance " of the treaty as it stands now , but it will have to deal with people like czech prime minister mirek topolanek , who has dismissed the constitution as a ' pile of crap . ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many are worried the issue will split the eu critics , which also include poland and britain , feel the reform is unnecessary , cumbersome and expensive .
british sources have argued that the eu works well within its current framework . among the other countries , euro-enthusiasts such as portugal and ireland are virtually certain to ratify the constitution , but france and the netherlands can not expect their citizens to change their minds if asked to vote on the same document a second time . dutch and french voters rejected the charter over several reasons including the eu 's anonymous bureaucracy and rapid enlargement . increasing talk of a mini-treaty it is clear the constitution will have to be modified , but the question of how much remains . there is increasing talk about a " mini-treaty , " which would reduce the institutional reforms - as proposed by french presidential candidate nicolas sarkozy - or focus on practicalities rather than a political project , an option favored by many in britain . a radical slimming down of the text , however , would lead to a new impasse , as it would require new ratifications by the countries which already approved the current document . the danger is , that the eu could become polarized into two camps , and critics felt that it had already started happening in madrid . none of the countries critical of the constitution were invited , causing considerable unease in the no-camp and reportedly also in germany . dw staff / dpa -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de should christianity be mentioned in the eu constitution ?

" he shared his proposal with the contact group -lrb- britain , france , germany , italy , russia and the united states -rrb- and there was a very brief discussion about the way forward , " ahtisaari 's spokeswoman hua jiang said . under the plan , kosovo would be autonomous from serbia but have an " international civilian representative " overseeing the government , and nato troops would remain at first in the province , ahtisaari told the parliamentary assembly of the council of europe on wednesday in strasbourg . the plan comes amid a diplomatic tug of war between russia , which would like serbia to maintain control of kosovo , and the united states and its european allies which back the province moving towards independence . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said that he expected russia to back down on its desire for serbia to hold on kosovo . " russia knows how narrow the room for manoeuvre is , " steinmeier told the financial times .
" if their preferred solution proves unworkable , the option of confirming kosovo 's future status in the un security council must be possible and i hope for a constructive russian role . " a key step ahtisaari 's presentation friday in a 90-minute closed-door meeting in vienna , where european union and nato representatives were also present , was seen as a key step towards a solution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : martti ahtisaari says the plan will protect minorities on february 2 , ahtisaari , a former finnish president , will travel to belgrade and pristina to present the proposal to the serbian and kosovo sides , who will then discuss it further before a final plan eventually goes to the un security council , jiang said . ahtisaari said his plan would focus on " the protection of minority rights , in particular of the kosovo serbs " and " a strong international civilian and military presence within a broader future international engagement in kosovo . " he said his plan " provides the foundations for a democratic and multi-ethnic kosovo in which the rights and interests of all members of its communities are firmly guaranteed and protected by institutions based on the rule of law . " nato supportive in brussels meanwhile , nato foreign ministers met friday to look at ways to better coordinate security and civilian operations in the military alliance 's two biggest missions , afghanistan and kosovo . nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer said the ministers would " discuss how nato can best continue to play its crucial role in underpinning the political process " in kosovo .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the economic situation in kosovo is dire the ministers said it will stay the course in kosovo with the nato-led kosovo force maintaining its 17,000 troops . in limbo fears have grown that any major delay in announcing how much autonomy kosovo should be granted could inflame tensions and spill over into violence . kosovo has been in limbo for nearly eight years , since nato intervened to halt a crackdown by serbian forces against the ethnic albanian population during a 1998-1999 war with separatist guerrillas . ahead of the status resolution , many argue that kosovo can not count on a viable future as an independent state because of its economy . in bad shape the province 's economy is , if anything , in a worse state than in the post-war period when foreign donors opened their coffers for reconstruction .
but this has dried up in the past two years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbia wants to hold on to kosovo unemployment in kosovo stands at 40-45 percent and is rising ; around half its people live below the poverty line and annual per capita income is the lowest in the region at around 1,250 euros -lrb- $ 1,615 -rrb- .

he left germany for canada at the age of 19 but was deported in march 2005 on a german arrest warrant . denying the holocaust is a crime in germany and if convicted , zündel faces up to five years in jail . the trial began almost a year ago but has run into several legal hurdles .
it follows a high-profile case in which controversial british historian david irving spent 13 months in jail in austria for questioning the holocaust before being released last month . germany 's special mission germany , which holds the rotating european union presidency until july , announced plans this month to promote making holocaust denial punishable by law in every member state of the bloc . already , the european commission on friday threw its weight behind a german proposal to push through new rules which would make denying the holocaust a crime in the european union . eu justice commissioner franco frattini said he " very much welcomes and fully supports " the plan drawn up by germany , which currently runs the agenda-setting presidency of the 27-member bloc . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany wants an eu wide ban on denial the commissioner made his comments ahead of the international day of commemoration of the victims of the holocaust on january 27 .

the aim of the plan is to harmonize national legal systems in their approach to combating racism and xenophobia . but while being unanimous in their condemnation of those who deny the holocaust , eu leaders are split over whether to criminalize such acts . germany views a common eu law as a moral obligation but countries like britain , italy and denmark have resisted common rules as a violation of civil liberties .

" he shared his proposal with the contact group -lrb- britain , france , germany , italy , russia and the united states -rrb- and there was a very brief discussion about the way forward , " ahtisaari 's spokeswoman hua jiang said . under the plan , kosovo would be autonomous from serbia but have an " international civilian representative " overseeing the government , and nato troops would remain at first in the province , ahtisaari told the parliamentary assembly of the council of europe on wednesday in strasbourg . the plan comes amid a diplomatic tug of war between russia , which would like serbia to maintain control of kosovo , and the united states and its european allies which back the province moving towards independence . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said that he expected russia to back down on its desire for serbia to hold on kosovo . " russia knows how narrow the room for manoeuvre is , " steinmeier told the financial times .
" if their preferred solution proves unworkable , the option of confirming kosovo 's future status in the un security council must be possible and i hope for a constructive russian role . " a key step ahtisaari 's presentation friday in a 90-minute closed-door meeting in vienna , where european union and nato representatives were also present , was seen as a key step towards a solution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : martti ahtisaari says the plan will protect minorities on february 2 , ahtisaari , a former finnish president , will travel to belgrade and pristina to present the proposal to the serbian and kosovo sides , who will then discuss it further before a final plan eventually goes to the un security council , jiang said . ahtisaari said his plan would focus on " the protection of minority rights , in particular of the kosovo serbs " and " a strong international civilian and military presence within a broader future international engagement in kosovo . " he said his plan " provides the foundations for a democratic and multi-ethnic kosovo in which the rights and interests of all members of its communities are firmly guaranteed and protected by institutions based on the rule of law . " nato supportive in brussels meanwhile , nato foreign ministers met friday to look at ways to better coordinate security and civilian operations in the military alliance 's two biggest missions , afghanistan and kosovo . nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer said the ministers would " discuss how nato can best continue to play its crucial role in underpinning the political process " in kosovo .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the economic situation in kosovo is dire the ministers said it will stay the course in kosovo with the nato-led kosovo force maintaining its 17,000 troops . in limbo fears have grown that any major delay in announcing how much autonomy kosovo should be granted could inflame tensions and spill over into violence . kosovo has been in limbo for nearly eight years , since nato intervened to halt a crackdown by serbian forces against the ethnic albanian population during a 1998-1999 war with separatist guerrillas . ahead of the status resolution , many argue that kosovo can not count on a viable future as an independent state because of its economy . in bad shape the province 's economy is , if anything , in a worse state than in the post-war period when foreign donors opened their coffers for reconstruction .
but this has dried up in the past two years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbia wants to hold on to kosovo unemployment in kosovo stands at 40-45 percent and is rising ; around half its people live below the poverty line and annual per capita income is the lowest in the region at around 1,250 euros -lrb- $ 1,615 -rrb- . " real problems can emerge when the people start to think with their stomachs , " journalist and economic analyst ibrahim rexhepi told afp .
" a social explosion is possible because leaders will no longer be in a position to give promises on independence to placate and pacify the tense province 's two million people . " political leaders in pristina are convinced the economy will improve significantly when kosovo becomes independent . " independence will help us , " kosovo prime minister agim ceku told afp in an interview last week .
" the undefined status was a big obstacle to tackling the economic challenges and issues .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world war ii -pipe- 26.01.2007 german holocaust denial case proceeds as eu moves on a ban großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : remembrance not denial , eu says as one of the most famous holocaust deniers goes on trial in germany , the eu takes steps to criminalize denying the shoah . german prosecutors in mannheim demanded a five-year jail sentence friday for one of the most high-profile figures in the holocaust denial movement , ernst zündel , in closing arguments at his trial . zündel , a 67-year-old german citizen , stands accused of inciting racial hatred for disputing the historical fact that nazi germany systematically slaughtered six million european jews during world war ii . german authorities say zündel operated a website from canada on which he expressed anti-semitic and neo-nazi views and presented " revisionist " history .
he left germany for canada at the age of 19 but was deported in march 2005 on a german arrest warrant . denying the holocaust is a crime in germany and if convicted , zündel faces up to five years in jail . the trial began almost a year ago but has run into several legal hurdles .
it follows a high-profile case in which controversial british historian david irving spent 13 months in jail in austria for questioning the holocaust before being released last month . germany 's special mission germany , which holds the rotating european union presidency until july , announced plans this month to promote making holocaust denial punishable by law in every member state of the bloc . already , the european commission on friday threw its weight behind a german proposal to push through new rules which would make denying the holocaust a crime in the european union . eu justice commissioner franco frattini said he " very much welcomes and fully supports " the plan drawn up by germany , which currently runs the agenda-setting presidency of the 27-member bloc . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany wants an eu wide ban on denial the commissioner made his comments ahead of the international day of commemoration of the victims of the holocaust on january 27 . " the commission firmly condemns and rejects all manifestations of anti-semitism , racism and xenophobia , " frattini said in a statement . fighting racist speech while freedom of expression is part of europe 's values and traditions , its democratic societies also allowed to fight racist speech through penal law , the commissioner added . however , frattini said earlier this month that it should be up to national governments to decide on the length of jail sentences for people inciting racism and xenophobia . germany has said that it wants the bloc 's member states to adopt the proposed legislation as soon as possible . violation of civil liberties the german proposal also seeks to criminalize racist declarations that are an incitement to violence against a specific person or group .
the aim of the plan is to harmonize national legal systems in their approach to combating racism and xenophobia . but while being unanimous in their condemnation of those who deny the holocaust , eu leaders are split over whether to criminalize such acts . germany views a common eu law as a moral obligation but countries like britain , italy and denmark have resisted common rules as a violation of civil liberties .
still , italy voted to ban it thursday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zuendel could get five years if convicted two years ago , luxembourg tried to use its eu presidency to push through legislation to unify legal standards for holocaust denial , but was blocked by italy on the grounds that the proposed rules breached freedom of speech . the luxembourg blueprint , which germany is studying with a view toward copying it , says that racist declarations or holocaust denial will not be prosecuted if they are expressed in a way that does not incite hatred against an individual or group of people . laws against denying the holocaust already exist in austria , belgium , france , germany and spain .
the un general assembly is also expected to vote on a resolution condemning such speech soon . dw staff / afp / dpa -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de should the eu make holocaust denial a crime ?
german politicians recently said they want to make holocaust denial a crime across the eu during their country 's six-month term as head of the bloc .
the issue stirred many dw-world.de readers to share their thoughts .
-lrb- 22.01.2007 -rrb- germany moves to silence holocaust deniers across europe germany is using its six-month european union presidency to push for eu-wide criminalization of holocaust denial .
but where does that leave freedom of speech ? -lrb- 19.01.2007 -rrb- convicted holocaust denier irving expelled from austria convicted british holocaust denier david irving arrived in britain after austria expelled him and banned him from ever returning .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world war ii -pipe- 26.01.2007 german holocaust denial case proceeds as eu moves on a ban großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : remembrance not denial , eu says as one of the most famous holocaust deniers goes on trial in germany , the eu takes steps to criminalize denying the shoah . german prosecutors in mannheim demanded a five-year jail sentence friday for one of the most high-profile figures in the holocaust denial movement , ernst zündel , in closing arguments at his trial . zündel , a 67-year-old german citizen , stands accused of inciting racial hatred for disputing the historical fact that nazi germany systematically slaughtered six million european jews during world war ii . german authorities say zündel operated a website from canada on which he expressed anti-semitic and neo-nazi views and presented " revisionist " history .
he left germany for canada at the age of 19 but was deported in march 2005 on a german arrest warrant . denying the holocaust is a crime in germany and if convicted , zündel faces up to five years in jail . the trial began almost a year ago but has run into several legal hurdles .
it follows a high-profile case in which controversial british historian david irving spent 13 months in jail in austria for questioning the holocaust before being released last month . germany 's special mission germany , which holds the rotating european union presidency until july , announced plans this month to promote making holocaust denial punishable by law in every member state of the bloc . already , the european commission on friday threw its weight behind a german proposal to push through new rules which would make denying the holocaust a crime in the european union . eu justice commissioner franco frattini said he " very much welcomes and fully supports " the plan drawn up by germany , which currently runs the agenda-setting presidency of the 27-member bloc . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany wants an eu wide ban on denial the commissioner made his comments ahead of the international day of commemoration of the victims of the holocaust on january 27 . " the commission firmly condemns and rejects all manifestations of anti-semitism , racism and xenophobia , " frattini said in a statement . fighting racist speech while freedom of expression is part of europe 's values and traditions , its democratic societies also allowed to fight racist speech through penal law , the commissioner added . however , frattini said earlier this month that it should be up to national governments to decide on the length of jail sentences for people inciting racism and xenophobia . germany has said that it wants the bloc 's member states to adopt the proposed legislation as soon as possible . violation of civil liberties the german proposal also seeks to criminalize racist declarations that are an incitement to violence against a specific person or group .
the aim of the plan is to harmonize national legal systems in their approach to combating racism and xenophobia . but while being unanimous in their condemnation of those who deny the holocaust , eu leaders are split over whether to criminalize such acts . germany views a common eu law as a moral obligation but countries like britain , italy and denmark have resisted common rules as a violation of civil liberties .
still , italy voted to ban it thursday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zuendel could get five years if convicted two years ago , luxembourg tried to use its eu presidency to push through legislation to unify legal standards for holocaust denial , but was blocked by italy on the grounds that the proposed rules breached freedom of speech . the luxembourg blueprint , which germany is studying with a view toward copying it , says that racist declarations or holocaust denial will not be prosecuted if they are expressed in a way that does not incite hatred against an individual or group of people . laws against denying the holocaust already exist in austria , belgium , france , germany and spain .
the un general assembly is also expected to vote on a resolution condemning such speech soon . dw staff / afp / dpa -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de should the eu make holocaust denial a crime ?

" he shared his proposal with the contact group -lrb- britain , france , germany , italy , russia and the united states -rrb- and there was a very brief discussion about the way forward , " ahtisaari 's spokeswoman hua jiang said . under the plan , kosovo would be autonomous from serbia but have an " international civilian representative " overseeing the government , and nato troops would remain at first in the province , ahtisaari told the parliamentary assembly of the council of europe on wednesday in strasbourg . the plan comes amid a diplomatic tug of war between russia , which would like serbia to maintain control of kosovo , and the united states and its european allies which back the province moving towards independence . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said that he expected russia to back down on its desire for serbia to hold on kosovo . " russia knows how narrow the room for manoeuvre is , " steinmeier told the financial times .
" if their preferred solution proves unworkable , the option of confirming kosovo 's future status in the un security council must be possible and i hope for a constructive russian role . " a key step ahtisaari 's presentation friday in a 90-minute closed-door meeting in vienna , where european union and nato representatives were also present , was seen as a key step towards a solution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : martti ahtisaari says the plan will protect minorities on february 2 , ahtisaari , a former finnish president , will travel to belgrade and pristina to present the proposal to the serbian and kosovo sides , who will then discuss it further before a final plan eventually goes to the un security council , jiang said . ahtisaari said his plan would focus on " the protection of minority rights , in particular of the kosovo serbs " and " a strong international civilian and military presence within a broader future international engagement in kosovo . " he said his plan " provides the foundations for a democratic and multi-ethnic kosovo in which the rights and interests of all members of its communities are firmly guaranteed and protected by institutions based on the rule of law . " nato supportive in brussels meanwhile , nato foreign ministers met friday to look at ways to better coordinate security and civilian operations in the military alliance 's two biggest missions , afghanistan and kosovo . nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer said the ministers would " discuss how nato can best continue to play its crucial role in underpinning the political process " in kosovo .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the economic situation in kosovo is dire the ministers said it will stay the course in kosovo with the nato-led kosovo force maintaining its 17,000 troops . in limbo fears have grown that any major delay in announcing how much autonomy kosovo should be granted could inflame tensions and spill over into violence . kosovo has been in limbo for nearly eight years , since nato intervened to halt a crackdown by serbian forces against the ethnic albanian population during a 1998-1999 war with separatist guerrillas . ahead of the status resolution , many argue that kosovo can not count on a viable future as an independent state because of its economy . in bad shape the province 's economy is , if anything , in a worse state than in the post-war period when foreign donors opened their coffers for reconstruction .
but this has dried up in the past two years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbia wants to hold on to kosovo unemployment in kosovo stands at 40-45 percent and is rising ; around half its people live below the poverty line and annual per capita income is the lowest in the region at around 1,250 euros -lrb- $ 1,615 -rrb- . " real problems can emerge when the people start to think with their stomachs , " journalist and economic analyst ibrahim rexhepi told afp .
" a social explosion is possible because leaders will no longer be in a position to give promises on independence to placate and pacify the tense province 's two million people . " political leaders in pristina are convinced the economy will improve significantly when kosovo becomes independent . " independence will help us , " kosovo prime minister agim ceku told afp in an interview last week .

" he shared his proposal with the contact group -lrb- britain , france , germany , italy , russia and the united states -rrb- and there was a very brief discussion about the way forward , " ahtisaari 's spokeswoman hua jiang said . under the plan , kosovo would be autonomous from serbia but have an " international civilian representative " overseeing the government , and nato troops would remain at first in the province , ahtisaari told the parliamentary assembly of the council of europe on wednesday in strasbourg . the plan comes amid a diplomatic tug of war between russia , which would like serbia to maintain control of kosovo , and the united states and its european allies which back the province moving towards independence . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said that he expected russia to back down on its desire for serbia to hold on kosovo . " russia knows how narrow the room for manoeuvre is , " steinmeier told the financial times .
" if their preferred solution proves unworkable , the option of confirming kosovo 's future status in the un security council must be possible and i hope for a constructive russian role . " a key step ahtisaari 's presentation friday in a 90-minute closed-door meeting in vienna , where european union and nato representatives were also present , was seen as a key step towards a solution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : martti ahtisaari says the plan will protect minorities on february 2 , ahtisaari , a former finnish president , will travel to belgrade and pristina to present the proposal to the serbian and kosovo sides , who will then discuss it further before a final plan eventually goes to the un security council , jiang said . ahtisaari said his plan would focus on " the protection of minority rights , in particular of the kosovo serbs " and " a strong international civilian and military presence within a broader future international engagement in kosovo . " he said his plan " provides the foundations for a democratic and multi-ethnic kosovo in which the rights and interests of all members of its communities are firmly guaranteed and protected by institutions based on the rule of law . " nato supportive in brussels meanwhile , nato foreign ministers met friday to look at ways to better coordinate security and civilian operations in the military alliance 's two biggest missions , afghanistan and kosovo . nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer said the ministers would " discuss how nato can best continue to play its crucial role in underpinning the political process " in kosovo .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the economic situation in kosovo is dire the ministers said it will stay the course in kosovo with the nato-led kosovo force maintaining its 17,000 troops . in limbo fears have grown that any major delay in announcing how much autonomy kosovo should be granted could inflame tensions and spill over into violence . kosovo has been in limbo for nearly eight years , since nato intervened to halt a crackdown by serbian forces against the ethnic albanian population during a 1998-1999 war with separatist guerrillas . ahead of the status resolution , many argue that kosovo can not count on a viable future as an independent state because of its economy . in bad shape the province 's economy is , if anything , in a worse state than in the post-war period when foreign donors opened their coffers for reconstruction .
but this has dried up in the past two years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbia wants to hold on to kosovo unemployment in kosovo stands at 40-45 percent and is rising ; around half its people live below the poverty line and annual per capita income is the lowest in the region at around 1,250 euros -lrb- $ 1,615 -rrb- . " real problems can emerge when the people start to think with their stomachs , " journalist and economic analyst ibrahim rexhepi told afp .
" a social explosion is possible because leaders will no longer be in a position to give promises on independence to placate and pacify the tense province 's two million people . " political leaders in pristina are convinced the economy will improve significantly when kosovo becomes independent . " independence will help us , " kosovo prime minister agim ceku told afp in an interview last week .

the family is thinking of taking the case to court . members of germany 's commission on returning art stolen by the nazis said the poster collection 's former owner , hans sachs , had made it clear that he felt he had already received adequate compensation for the loss of the collection which was originally made up of around 12,500 posters and 18,000 small drawings and stolen by the nazis in 1938 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernd neumann " the commission has reached a fair and just decision , " said german culture secretary bernd neumann . sachs emigrated to the us with his family in 1938 after the nazis imprisoned him at sachsenhausen concentration camp for two weeks . in 1961 , the west german government paid 225,000 deutsche marks -lrb- about 112,500 euros or $ 146,000 -rrb- in compensation .
at the time , sachs believed that his collection had been lost in the war . protecting treasures five years later , he found out that parts of his collection had resurfaced in an east berlin museum .
he tried to get permission to view it , but east german officials did not grant him that wish before he died in 1974 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the collection is stored at the museum along with busts of lenin and hitler " i 'm certain that west and east germany will know to protect their treasures , " he allegedly wrote in the early 1970s .
in 1966 , sachs also was said to have written to a west german friend indicating that he had no further claims . but on thursday , sachs 's son told the commission that he would certainly have wanted to see the collection return to the family .
it includes ad posters for goods , concerts , exhibitions and plays as well as political propaganda posters , and is estimated to have a value of up to $ 50 million -lrb- 38.5 million euros . -rrb- decision " morally unacceptable " ? " anyone who believes that my father was happy that an east german museum acquired his stolen collection , or that he would have wanted it kept from his own family , can not truly understand the moral implications of those words , " said peter sachs , 69 , adding that he was " inexpressibly saddened " by the commission 's decision . peter sachs ' lawyer called the commission 's ruling " morally unacceptable " and added that he was considering the possibility of taking legal steps against it . doing justice to the collection bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goethe institute president jutta limbach heads the advisory panel commission members meanwhile called on the german historical museum to " do justice " to sachs ' achievements as a collector and pioneer of poster art by caring for and exhibiting the collection .
they also said that the posters should be presented as " collection hans sachs " and documented in a catalogue that includes the collection 's history . " this is in line with the intentions of the son and heir , peter sachs , not to let this unique collection fade from memory , " commission members wrote in a statement . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany aims for better restitution process for nazi-looted art the german government has invited museum directors and legal experts to berlin on monday to discuss claims for art bought or seized by the nazis .

while the two countries seem to be getting along just fine , it 's europe that might cause controversy . following her election as german chancellor on nov .
22 , 2005 , it took angela merkel a mere 10 days to visit poland .
when she comes to prague on friday , she will have been germany 's head of government for 430 days .
while some might rush to interpret this as a sign of indifference towards germany 's other eastern neighbor , merkel herself has made it quite clear that she has a soft spot for the " golden city . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel -lrb- third from right -rrb- with czechoslovak colleagues in prague in 1982 " i almost have a bit of a yearning for prague , " merkel , who spent many months as a guest physicist at prague 's charles university , said during a meeting with then czech premier jiri paroubek in berlin shortly after she became chancellor . " i did get the impression that she has a more personal and emotional relationship with prague than with other european capitals , " said stefan gehrold , the head of the prague office of the konrad adenauer foundation , which is associated with merkel 's christian democratic union .
" she probably would have come earlier if the political situation had been different . " more than seven months after elections and the resulting political stalemate between the left and the right as both camps had an equal amount of seats , a new government led by conservative premier mirek topolanek and backed by the greens only received parliamentary approval a week ago . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czech premier mirek topolanek is a conservative like merkel " before that , we were still in the middle of a virtual election campaign , " gehrold said , adding that a visit by the head of germany 's conservatives might have been misconstrued as campaign support . now that the question of government has been settled , merkel will be able to meet her czech counterpart and have dinner with president vaclav klaus during her three-hour visit .
the main topic of the talks will be the goals of germany 's current eu presidency . european disagreements those goals include reviving the adoption of the eu constitution - an issue that 's bound to trigger heated discussion between merkel and her czech conversation partners , according to some in prague . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czech president vaclav klaus , a euroskeptic , has also voiced his opposition to the eu constitution " i see a problem concerning eu policy , " said zuzana kleknerova , a journalist with online newspaper aktualne.cz , adding that the largest government party ods has clear euroskeptic tendencies and criticizes the constitution . " the constitution is something that frau merkel considers to be very important and that 's an issue she and our prime minister do n't agree on , " kleknerova said , adding that the two countries were doing great as far as bilateral issues were concerned . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sudeten german women at their annual meeting that includes the ongoing dispute over the expulsion of sudeten germans from their homes in czechoslovakia following world war ii . " it 's a chapter that 's been closed , " she said , adding that reparation claims by sudeten germans had been rejected by the courts and had not received the backing of either merkel or her predecessor , gerhard schröder . robust relationship the two countries also just celebrated the 10th anniversary of the signing of the so-called german-czech declaration on mutual relations and their future development on jan .
21 , 1997 .
the document obliges both sides to advance relations while setting aside any political and legal issues stemming from the past , particularly the years of nazi occupation and the expulsion of sudeten germans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : completion of a new highway between dresden and prague will also help strengthen ties " people have learned to deal with these things and the controversies based in history are fading , " said kai-olaf lang , an expert on czech foreign policy with the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- in berlin .

" he shared his proposal with the contact group -lrb- britain , france , germany , italy , russia and the united states -rrb- and there was a very brief discussion about the way forward , " ahtisaari 's spokeswoman hua jiang said . under the plan , kosovo would be autonomous from serbia but have an " international civilian representative " overseeing the government , and nato troops would remain at first in the province , ahtisaari told the parliamentary assembly of the council of europe on wednesday in strasbourg . the plan comes amid a diplomatic tug of war between russia , which would like serbia to maintain control of kosovo , and the united states and its european allies which back the province moving towards independence . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said that he expected russia to back down on its desire for serbia to hold on kosovo . " russia knows how narrow the room for manoeuvre is , " steinmeier told the financial times .
" if their preferred solution proves unworkable , the option of confirming kosovo 's future status in the un security council must be possible and i hope for a constructive russian role . " a key step ahtisaari 's presentation friday in a 90-minute closed-door meeting in vienna , where european union and nato representatives were also present , was seen as a key step towards a solution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : martti ahtisaari says the plan will protect minorities on february 2 , ahtisaari , a former finnish president , will travel to belgrade and pristina to present the proposal to the serbian and kosovo sides , who will then discuss it further before a final plan eventually goes to the un security council , jiang said . ahtisaari said his plan would focus on " the protection of minority rights , in particular of the kosovo serbs " and " a strong international civilian and military presence within a broader future international engagement in kosovo . " he said his plan " provides the foundations for a democratic and multi-ethnic kosovo in which the rights and interests of all members of its communities are firmly guaranteed and protected by institutions based on the rule of law . " nato supportive in brussels meanwhile , nato foreign ministers met friday to look at ways to better coordinate security and civilian operations in the military alliance 's two biggest missions , afghanistan and kosovo . nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer said the ministers would " discuss how nato can best continue to play its crucial role in underpinning the political process " in kosovo .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the economic situation in kosovo is dire the ministers said it will stay the course in kosovo with the nato-led kosovo force maintaining its 17,000 troops . in limbo fears have grown that any major delay in announcing how much autonomy kosovo should be granted could inflame tensions and spill over into violence . kosovo has been in limbo for nearly eight years , since nato intervened to halt a crackdown by serbian forces against the ethnic albanian population during a 1998-1999 war with separatist guerrillas . ahead of the status resolution , many argue that kosovo can not count on a viable future as an independent state because of its economy . in bad shape the province 's economy is , if anything , in a worse state than in the post-war period when foreign donors opened their coffers for reconstruction .
but this has dried up in the past two years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbia wants to hold on to kosovo unemployment in kosovo stands at 40-45 percent and is rising ; around half its people live below the poverty line and annual per capita income is the lowest in the region at around 1,250 euros -lrb- $ 1,615 -rrb- . " real problems can emerge when the people start to think with their stomachs , " journalist and economic analyst ibrahim rexhepi told afp .
" a social explosion is possible because leaders will no longer be in a position to give promises on independence to placate and pacify the tense province 's two million people . " political leaders in pristina are convinced the economy will improve significantly when kosovo becomes independent . " independence will help us , " kosovo prime minister agim ceku told afp in an interview last week .

he ousted lennart johansson of sweden after 17 years in office . johansson had actually planned to leave his seat at the top of the union of european football associations to german soccer great franz beckenbauer , who was elected by uefa officials as the european representative on the executive committee of world soccer body fifa on friday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beckenbauer was elected to fifa 's executive committee on friday but the kaiser 's decision not to run for uefa 's top job set off a bitter race between platini and johansson , who felt compelled to keep the position he 's had since 1990 out of the frenchman 's hands . a former world soccer star and three-time european player of the year , platini made his intentions to lead the european federation years ago , but johansson 's hold on the job had kept him out of the post . the uefa presidency feud was decided in düsseldorf with a secret vote on friday .
platini won 27 votes , while 23 chose johansson .
two votes were invalid . " it 's the start of an adventure , " said an emotional platini after winning the vote .
" i want to thank everyone who have stayed loyal to me .
i 'm delighted to be able to represent european soccer . " years of ill will bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : platini captained the french team the election race was the most recent example of years worth of bad blood between the two men .
platini was quick to take sides against johansson in a 1998 dispute , complete with scandals and bribery allegations , over who should head fifa , world soccer 's governing body , and threw his support behind germany 's sepp blatter , who went on to win the position . " i would flee to a monastery so i did n't have to watch the massacre , " platini said of what he would do if johansson won the fifa job . not to be outdone , johansson also did his part to keep blatter from rewarding his supporter with a job as fifa 's technical director , saying there were " 200 people in the world " who met the job description , but that platini was n't one of them . " he is a nice person , but i do n't see him as qualified , " johansson said .

he left germany for canada at the age of 19 but was deported in march 2005 on a german arrest warrant . denying the holocaust is a crime in germany and if convicted , zündel faces up to five years in jail . the trial began almost a year ago but has run into several legal hurdles .
it follows a high-profile case in which controversial british historian david irving spent 13 months in jail in austria for questioning the holocaust before being released last month . germany 's special mission germany , which holds the rotating european union presidency until july , announced plans this month to promote making holocaust denial punishable by law in every member state of the bloc . already , the european commission on friday threw its weight behind a german proposal to push through new rules which would make denying the holocaust a crime in the european union . eu justice commissioner franco frattini said he " very much welcomes and fully supports " the plan drawn up by germany , which currently runs the agenda-setting presidency of the 27-member bloc . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany wants an eu wide ban on denial the commissioner made his comments ahead of the international day of commemoration of the victims of the holocaust on january 27 . " the commission firmly condemns and rejects all manifestations of anti-semitism , racism and xenophobia , " frattini said in a statement . fighting racist speech while freedom of expression is part of europe 's values and traditions , its democratic societies also allowed to fight racist speech through penal law , the commissioner added . however , frattini said earlier this month that it should be up to national governments to decide on the length of jail sentences for people inciting racism and xenophobia . germany has said that it wants the bloc 's member states to adopt the proposed legislation as soon as possible . violation of civil liberties the german proposal also seeks to criminalize racist declarations that are an incitement to violence against a specific person or group .
the aim of the plan is to harmonize national legal systems in their approach to combating racism and xenophobia . but while being unanimous in their condemnation of those who deny the holocaust , eu leaders are split over whether to criminalize such acts . germany views a common eu law as a moral obligation but countries like britain , italy and denmark have resisted common rules as a violation of civil liberties .
still , italy voted to ban it thursday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zuendel could get five years if convicted two years ago , luxembourg tried to use its eu presidency to push through legislation to unify legal standards for holocaust denial , but was blocked by italy on the grounds that the proposed rules breached freedom of speech . the luxembourg blueprint , which germany is studying with a view toward copying it , says that racist declarations or holocaust denial will not be prosecuted if they are expressed in a way that does not incite hatred against an individual or group of people . laws against denying the holocaust already exist in austria , belgium , france , germany and spain .

he ousted lennart johansson of sweden after 17 years in office . johansson had actually planned to leave his seat at the top of the union of european football associations to german soccer great franz beckenbauer , who was elected by uefa officials as the european representative on the executive committee of world soccer body fifa on friday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beckenbauer was elected to fifa 's executive committee on friday but the kaiser 's decision not to run for uefa 's top job set off a bitter race between platini and johansson , who felt compelled to keep the position he 's had since 1990 out of the frenchman 's hands . a former world soccer star and three-time european player of the year , platini made his intentions to lead the european federation years ago , but johansson 's hold on the job had kept him out of the post . the uefa presidency feud was decided in düsseldorf with a secret vote on friday .
platini won 27 votes , while 23 chose johansson .
two votes were invalid . " it 's the start of an adventure , " said an emotional platini after winning the vote .
" i want to thank everyone who have stayed loyal to me .
i 'm delighted to be able to represent european soccer . " years of ill will bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : platini captained the french team the election race was the most recent example of years worth of bad blood between the two men .
platini was quick to take sides against johansson in a 1998 dispute , complete with scandals and bribery allegations , over who should head fifa , world soccer 's governing body , and threw his support behind germany 's sepp blatter , who went on to win the position . " i would flee to a monastery so i did n't have to watch the massacre , " platini said of what he would do if johansson won the fifa job . not to be outdone , johansson also did his part to keep blatter from rewarding his supporter with a job as fifa 's technical director , saying there were " 200 people in the world " who met the job description , but that platini was n't one of them . " he is a nice person , but i do n't see him as qualified , " johansson said .
" but maybe he has talents i do n't know about . " all countries created equal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : johansson has run the federation since 1990 prior to the election , platini had been doling out uefa cash for development programs in smaller member states such as andorra and moldova , which have as much say as large nations like france and germany . " i 'm one of soccer 's romantics , " platini has often said , explaining why he chooses to focus on expressions like the " soccer family , " " solidarity " and " equal chances for everyone . " blatter has also shown that he has not forgotten his former adviser . " i would rather have a player , " he said .
" as a player , i know when my time is finished . " the power of money and exposure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the champions league tournament is a uefa cash cow johansson , on the other hand , was generally regarded as honest , faithful and upright .
he turned a shabby uefa into a rich , business-like federation leading to billions of euros of income from the champions league and european championships .
the influx of money allowed johansson to give each member country , large and small alike , about 370,000 euros -lrb- $ 480,722 -rrb- , a third more than expected . johansson also tried to sway smaller countries by promising to increase the number of teams in the european championship finals from 16 to 24 in 2012 .
that would allow nearly half of the federation 's 52 members to participate .
the expansion gamble has paid off in the past : former fifa president joao havelange won the job in 1974 after upping the number of world cup participants from 16 to 24 and used the same trick to keep his post in 1994 with another increase to 32 teams . past vs. future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : platini is uefa 's seventh president and the second frenchman to hold the post platini , 51 , however , had indirectly called johansson 's promises for the future into doubt by questioning what kinds of promises a 77-year-old should really be making . " it is up to the federations to decide if they want to vote for someone who is for the future or someone who represents the past , " said platini , who has also come out for age restrictions on federation officials and told johansson to concentrate on his hobby of fishing . the german federation had made its intention to support johansson clear , partly as a sign of thanks since johansson 's support was an important part of fifa 's decision to let germany host the 2006 world cup . " there has never been a better uefa president , " beckenbauer said .
" we have a lot to thank lennart johansson for .

while the two countries seem to be getting along just fine , it 's europe that might cause controversy . following her election as german chancellor on nov .
22 , 2005 , it took angela merkel a mere 10 days to visit poland .
when she comes to prague on friday , she will have been germany 's head of government for 430 days .
while some might rush to interpret this as a sign of indifference towards germany 's other eastern neighbor , merkel herself has made it quite clear that she has a soft spot for the " golden city . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel -lrb- third from right -rrb- with czechoslovak colleagues in prague in 1982 " i almost have a bit of a yearning for prague , " merkel , who spent many months as a guest physicist at prague 's charles university , said during a meeting with then czech premier jiri paroubek in berlin shortly after she became chancellor . " i did get the impression that she has a more personal and emotional relationship with prague than with other european capitals , " said stefan gehrold , the head of the prague office of the konrad adenauer foundation , which is associated with merkel 's christian democratic union .
" she probably would have come earlier if the political situation had been different . " more than seven months after elections and the resulting political stalemate between the left and the right as both camps had an equal amount of seats , a new government led by conservative premier mirek topolanek and backed by the greens only received parliamentary approval a week ago . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czech premier mirek topolanek is a conservative like merkel " before that , we were still in the middle of a virtual election campaign , " gehrold said , adding that a visit by the head of germany 's conservatives might have been misconstrued as campaign support . now that the question of government has been settled , merkel will be able to meet her czech counterpart and have dinner with president vaclav klaus during her three-hour visit .
the main topic of the talks will be the goals of germany 's current eu presidency . european disagreements those goals include reviving the adoption of the eu constitution - an issue that 's bound to trigger heated discussion between merkel and her czech conversation partners , according to some in prague . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czech president vaclav klaus , a euroskeptic , has also voiced his opposition to the eu constitution " i see a problem concerning eu policy , " said zuzana kleknerova , a journalist with online newspaper aktualne.cz , adding that the largest government party ods has clear euroskeptic tendencies and criticizes the constitution . " the constitution is something that frau merkel considers to be very important and that 's an issue she and our prime minister do n't agree on , " kleknerova said , adding that the two countries were doing great as far as bilateral issues were concerned . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sudeten german women at their annual meeting that includes the ongoing dispute over the expulsion of sudeten germans from their homes in czechoslovakia following world war ii . " it 's a chapter that 's been closed , " she said , adding that reparation claims by sudeten germans had been rejected by the courts and had not received the backing of either merkel or her predecessor , gerhard schröder . robust relationship the two countries also just celebrated the 10th anniversary of the signing of the so-called german-czech declaration on mutual relations and their future development on jan .
21 , 1997 .
the document obliges both sides to advance relations while setting aside any political and legal issues stemming from the past , particularly the years of nazi occupation and the expulsion of sudeten germans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : completion of a new highway between dresden and prague will also help strengthen ties " people have learned to deal with these things and the controversies based in history are fading , " said kai-olaf lang , an expert on czech foreign policy with the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- in berlin .
he added that germany 's new-found self-confidence did not cause as much alarm in the czech republic as it currently does in poland , for example .

the family is thinking of taking the case to court . members of germany 's commission on returning art stolen by the nazis said the poster collection 's former owner , hans sachs , had made it clear that he felt he had already received adequate compensation for the loss of the collection which was originally made up of around 12,500 posters and 18,000 small drawings and stolen by the nazis in 1938 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernd neumann " the commission has reached a fair and just decision , " said german culture secretary bernd neumann . sachs emigrated to the us with his family in 1938 after the nazis imprisoned him at sachsenhausen concentration camp for two weeks . in 1961 , the west german government paid 225,000 deutsche marks -lrb- about 112,500 euros or $ 146,000 -rrb- in compensation .
at the time , sachs believed that his collection had been lost in the war . protecting treasures five years later , he found out that parts of his collection had resurfaced in an east berlin museum .
he tried to get permission to view it , but east german officials did not grant him that wish before he died in 1974 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the collection is stored at the museum along with busts of lenin and hitler " i 'm certain that west and east germany will know to protect their treasures , " he allegedly wrote in the early 1970s .
in 1966 , sachs also was said to have written to a west german friend indicating that he had no further claims . but on thursday , sachs 's son told the commission that he would certainly have wanted to see the collection return to the family .
it includes ad posters for goods , concerts , exhibitions and plays as well as political propaganda posters , and is estimated to have a value of up to $ 50 million -lrb- 38.5 million euros . -rrb- decision " morally unacceptable " ? " anyone who believes that my father was happy that an east german museum acquired his stolen collection , or that he would have wanted it kept from his own family , can not truly understand the moral implications of those words , " said peter sachs , 69 , adding that he was " inexpressibly saddened " by the commission 's decision . peter sachs ' lawyer called the commission 's ruling " morally unacceptable " and added that he was considering the possibility of taking legal steps against it . doing justice to the collection bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goethe institute president jutta limbach heads the advisory panel commission members meanwhile called on the german historical museum to " do justice " to sachs ' achievements as a collector and pioneer of poster art by caring for and exhibiting the collection .
they also said that the posters should be presented as " collection hans sachs " and documented in a catalogue that includes the collection 's history .

platini won 27 votes , while 23 chose johansson .

while the two countries seem to be getting along just fine , it 's europe that might cause controversy . following her election as german chancellor on nov .
22 , 2005 , it took angela merkel a mere 10 days to visit poland .
when she comes to prague on friday , she will have been germany 's head of government for 430 days .
while some might rush to interpret this as a sign of indifference towards germany 's other eastern neighbor , merkel herself has made it quite clear that she has a soft spot for the " golden city . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel -lrb- third from right -rrb- with czechoslovak colleagues in prague in 1982 " i almost have a bit of a yearning for prague , " merkel , who spent many months as a guest physicist at prague 's charles university , said during a meeting with then czech premier jiri paroubek in berlin shortly after she became chancellor . " i did get the impression that she has a more personal and emotional relationship with prague than with other european capitals , " said stefan gehrold , the head of the prague office of the konrad adenauer foundation , which is associated with merkel 's christian democratic union .
" she probably would have come earlier if the political situation had been different . " more than seven months after elections and the resulting political stalemate between the left and the right as both camps had an equal amount of seats , a new government led by conservative premier mirek topolanek and backed by the greens only received parliamentary approval a week ago . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czech premier mirek topolanek is a conservative like merkel " before that , we were still in the middle of a virtual election campaign , " gehrold said , adding that a visit by the head of germany 's conservatives might have been misconstrued as campaign support . now that the question of government has been settled , merkel will be able to meet her czech counterpart and have dinner with president vaclav klaus during her three-hour visit .
the main topic of the talks will be the goals of germany 's current eu presidency . european disagreements those goals include reviving the adoption of the eu constitution - an issue that 's bound to trigger heated discussion between merkel and her czech conversation partners , according to some in prague . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czech president vaclav klaus , a euroskeptic , has also voiced his opposition to the eu constitution " i see a problem concerning eu policy , " said zuzana kleknerova , a journalist with online newspaper aktualne.cz , adding that the largest government party ods has clear euroskeptic tendencies and criticizes the constitution . " the constitution is something that frau merkel considers to be very important and that 's an issue she and our prime minister do n't agree on , " kleknerova said , adding that the two countries were doing great as far as bilateral issues were concerned . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sudeten german women at their annual meeting that includes the ongoing dispute over the expulsion of sudeten germans from their homes in czechoslovakia following world war ii . " it 's a chapter that 's been closed , " she said , adding that reparation claims by sudeten germans had been rejected by the courts and had not received the backing of either merkel or her predecessor , gerhard schröder . robust relationship the two countries also just celebrated the 10th anniversary of the signing of the so-called german-czech declaration on mutual relations and their future development on jan .
21 , 1997 .
the document obliges both sides to advance relations while setting aside any political and legal issues stemming from the past , particularly the years of nazi occupation and the expulsion of sudeten germans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : completion of a new highway between dresden and prague will also help strengthen ties " people have learned to deal with these things and the controversies based in history are fading , " said kai-olaf lang , an expert on czech foreign policy with the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- in berlin .
he added that germany 's new-found self-confidence did not cause as much alarm in the czech republic as it currently does in poland , for example .

the family is thinking of taking the case to court . members of germany 's commission on returning art stolen by the nazis said the poster collection 's former owner , hans sachs , had made it clear that he felt he had already received adequate compensation for the loss of the collection which was originally made up of around 12,500 posters and 18,000 small drawings and stolen by the nazis in 1938 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernd neumann " the commission has reached a fair and just decision , " said german culture secretary bernd neumann . sachs emigrated to the us with his family in 1938 after the nazis imprisoned him at sachsenhausen concentration camp for two weeks . in 1961 , the west german government paid 225,000 deutsche marks -lrb- about 112,500 euros or $ 146,000 -rrb- in compensation .
at the time , sachs believed that his collection had been lost in the war . protecting treasures five years later , he found out that parts of his collection had resurfaced in an east berlin museum .
he tried to get permission to view it , but east german officials did not grant him that wish before he died in 1974 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the collection is stored at the museum along with busts of lenin and hitler " i 'm certain that west and east germany will know to protect their treasures , " he allegedly wrote in the early 1970s .
in 1966 , sachs also was said to have written to a west german friend indicating that he had no further claims . but on thursday , sachs 's son told the commission that he would certainly have wanted to see the collection return to the family .
it includes ad posters for goods , concerts , exhibitions and plays as well as political propaganda posters , and is estimated to have a value of up to $ 50 million -lrb- 38.5 million euros . -rrb- decision " morally unacceptable " ? " anyone who believes that my father was happy that an east german museum acquired his stolen collection , or that he would have wanted it kept from his own family , can not truly understand the moral implications of those words , " said peter sachs , 69 , adding that he was " inexpressibly saddened " by the commission 's decision . peter sachs ' lawyer called the commission 's ruling " morally unacceptable " and added that he was considering the possibility of taking legal steps against it . doing justice to the collection bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goethe institute president jutta limbach heads the advisory panel commission members meanwhile called on the german historical museum to " do justice " to sachs ' achievements as a collector and pioneer of poster art by caring for and exhibiting the collection .
they also said that the posters should be presented as " collection hans sachs " and documented in a catalogue that includes the collection 's history .

he was released without being charged in 2006 . steinmeier not considering resignation in a report issued to a parliamentary control committee , deputy interior and foreign ministers reached the conclusion kurnaz could be denied a visa " by means of legally permissible material , " despite additional notes that the interior ministry " hoped to receive more information against k. from the us , " the daily reported . in addition to saying his resignation was " not open to debate , " steinmeier also rejected the newspapers ' claims that he or anyone in the schröder administration was responsible for extending kurnaz ' detention . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier has received support from chancellor angela merkel and said he wo n't quit " the alternatives were not germany or guantanamo , " he told the mass-circulation bild-zeitung on friday .
" what would be wrong with releasing him to turkey , where his wife and other family members live ? " steinmeier also hinted that conditions set for a release , possibly including using kurnaz to infiltrate radical islamist groups , were unacceptable .
berlin 's tagesspiegel newspaper reported that the german reluctance to use kurnaz as a spy may have convinced the americans to keep him in prison . protecting german national security steinmeier added that the german government was focused on protecting the country 's national security after the sept .

" leading members of the attacks in new york and washington came from hamburg and there were additional groups and networks of islamists ready to use violence in other german cities .
we had to expect the possibility of violence here and do everything we could to prevent it . " the european parliament also concluded this week that germany had turned down a us offer to release kurnaz .

" this opportunity to secure kurnaz ' release should have been taken , no doubt about that , " he said .
" i ca n't really see any sound reasons why the previous german government did n't do this . " for his part , steinmeier said he was also interested in clearing up the issue as soon as possible , though he is unlikely to testify before march . " what is showing up in newspapers does not provide a complete picture , " he told bild .
" i am going to do my part so that at the end everything is clear . " petra pau of the opposition left party said steinmeier 's silence indicates that he has something to hide , pointing to the chances he 's had to clear up the situation in the past . " the foreign minister had every opportunity to testify before the european union 's inquiry panel , " she said .

he left germany for canada at the age of 19 but was deported in march 2005 on a german arrest warrant . denying the holocaust is a crime in germany and if convicted , zündel faces up to five years in jail . the trial began almost a year ago but has run into several legal hurdles .
it follows a high-profile case in which controversial british historian david irving spent 13 months in jail in austria for questioning the holocaust before being released last month . germany 's special mission germany , which holds the rotating european union presidency until july , announced plans this month to promote making holocaust denial punishable by law in every member state of the bloc . already , the european commission on friday threw its weight behind a german proposal to push through new rules which would make denying the holocaust a crime in the european union . eu justice commissioner franco frattini said he " very much welcomes and fully supports " the plan drawn up by germany , which currently runs the agenda-setting presidency of the 27-member bloc . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany wants an eu wide ban on denial the commissioner made his comments ahead of the international day of commemoration of the victims of the holocaust on january 27 . " the commission firmly condemns and rejects all manifestations of anti-semitism , racism and xenophobia , " frattini said in a statement . fighting racist speech while freedom of expression is part of europe 's values and traditions , its democratic societies also allowed to fight racist speech through penal law , the commissioner added . however , frattini said earlier this month that it should be up to national governments to decide on the length of jail sentences for people inciting racism and xenophobia . germany has said that it wants the bloc 's member states to adopt the proposed legislation as soon as possible . violation of civil liberties the german proposal also seeks to criminalize racist declarations that are an incitement to violence against a specific person or group .

" he shared his proposal with the contact group -lrb- britain , france , germany , italy , russia and the united states -rrb- and there was a very brief discussion about the way forward , " ahtisaari 's spokeswoman hua jiang said . under the plan , kosovo would be autonomous from serbia but have an " international civilian representative " overseeing the government , and nato troops would remain at first in the province , ahtisaari told the parliamentary assembly of the council of europe on wednesday in strasbourg . the plan comes amid a diplomatic tug of war between russia , which would like serbia to maintain control of kosovo , and the united states and its european allies which back the province moving towards independence . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said that he expected russia to back down on its desire for serbia to hold on kosovo . " russia knows how narrow the room for manoeuvre is , " steinmeier told the financial times .
" if their preferred solution proves unworkable , the option of confirming kosovo 's future status in the un security council must be possible and i hope for a constructive russian role . " a key step ahtisaari 's presentation friday in a 90-minute closed-door meeting in vienna , where european union and nato representatives were also present , was seen as a key step towards a solution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : martti ahtisaari says the plan will protect minorities on february 2 , ahtisaari , a former finnish president , will travel to belgrade and pristina to present the proposal to the serbian and kosovo sides , who will then discuss it further before a final plan eventually goes to the un security council , jiang said . ahtisaari said his plan would focus on " the protection of minority rights , in particular of the kosovo serbs " and " a strong international civilian and military presence within a broader future international engagement in kosovo . " he said his plan " provides the foundations for a democratic and multi-ethnic kosovo in which the rights and interests of all members of its communities are firmly guaranteed and protected by institutions based on the rule of law . " nato supportive in brussels meanwhile , nato foreign ministers met friday to look at ways to better coordinate security and civilian operations in the military alliance 's two biggest missions , afghanistan and kosovo . nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer said the ministers would " discuss how nato can best continue to play its crucial role in underpinning the political process " in kosovo .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the economic situation in kosovo is dire the ministers said it will stay the course in kosovo with the nato-led kosovo force maintaining its 17,000 troops . in limbo fears have grown that any major delay in announcing how much autonomy kosovo should be granted could inflame tensions and spill over into violence . kosovo has been in limbo for nearly eight years , since nato intervened to halt a crackdown by serbian forces against the ethnic albanian population during a 1998-1999 war with separatist guerrillas . ahead of the status resolution , many argue that kosovo can not count on a viable future as an independent state because of its economy . in bad shape the province 's economy is , if anything , in a worse state than in the post-war period when foreign donors opened their coffers for reconstruction .
but this has dried up in the past two years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbia wants to hold on to kosovo unemployment in kosovo stands at 40-45 percent and is rising ; around half its people live below the poverty line and annual per capita income is the lowest in the region at around 1,250 euros -lrb- $ 1,615 -rrb- . " real problems can emerge when the people start to think with their stomachs , " journalist and economic analyst ibrahim rexhepi told afp .
" a social explosion is possible because leaders will no longer be in a position to give promises on independence to placate and pacify the tense province 's two million people . " political leaders in pristina are convinced the economy will improve significantly when kosovo becomes independent . " independence will help us , " kosovo prime minister agim ceku told afp in an interview last week .
" the undefined status was a big obstacle to tackling the economic challenges and issues .

he left germany for canada at the age of 19 but was deported in march 2005 on a german arrest warrant . denying the holocaust is a crime in germany and if convicted , zündel faces up to five years in jail . the trial began almost a year ago but has run into several legal hurdles .
it follows a high-profile case in which controversial british historian david irving spent 13 months in jail in austria for questioning the holocaust before being released last month . germany 's special mission germany , which holds the rotating european union presidency until july , announced plans this month to promote making holocaust denial punishable by law in every member state of the bloc . already , the european commission on friday threw its weight behind a german proposal to push through new rules which would make denying the holocaust a crime in the european union . eu justice commissioner franco frattini said he " very much welcomes and fully supports " the plan drawn up by germany , which currently runs the agenda-setting presidency of the 27-member bloc . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany wants an eu wide ban on denial the commissioner made his comments ahead of the international day of commemoration of the victims of the holocaust on january 27 . " the commission firmly condemns and rejects all manifestations of anti-semitism , racism and xenophobia , " frattini said in a statement . fighting racist speech while freedom of expression is part of europe 's values and traditions , its democratic societies also allowed to fight racist speech through penal law , the commissioner added . however , frattini said earlier this month that it should be up to national governments to decide on the length of jail sentences for people inciting racism and xenophobia . germany has said that it wants the bloc 's member states to adopt the proposed legislation as soon as possible . violation of civil liberties the german proposal also seeks to criminalize racist declarations that are an incitement to violence against a specific person or group .
the aim of the plan is to harmonize national legal systems in their approach to combating racism and xenophobia . but while being unanimous in their condemnation of those who deny the holocaust , eu leaders are split over whether to criminalize such acts . germany views a common eu law as a moral obligation but countries like britain , italy and denmark have resisted common rules as a violation of civil liberties .
still , italy voted to ban it thursday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zuendel could get five years if convicted two years ago , luxembourg tried to use its eu presidency to push through legislation to unify legal standards for holocaust denial , but was blocked by italy on the grounds that the proposed rules breached freedom of speech . the luxembourg blueprint , which germany is studying with a view toward copying it , says that racist declarations or holocaust denial will not be prosecuted if they are expressed in a way that does not incite hatred against an individual or group of people . laws against denying the holocaust already exist in austria , belgium , france , germany and spain .
the un general assembly is also expected to vote on a resolution condemning such speech soon . dw staff / afp / dpa -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de should the eu make holocaust denial a crime ?

he left germany for canada at the age of 19 but was deported in march 2005 on a german arrest warrant . denying the holocaust is a crime in germany and if convicted , zündel faces up to five years in jail . the trial began almost a year ago but has run into several legal hurdles .
it follows a high-profile case in which controversial british historian david irving spent 13 months in jail in austria for questioning the holocaust before being released last month . germany 's special mission germany , which holds the rotating european union presidency until july , announced plans this month to promote making holocaust denial punishable by law in every member state of the bloc . already , the european commission on friday threw its weight behind a german proposal to push through new rules which would make denying the holocaust a crime in the european union . eu justice commissioner franco frattini said he " very much welcomes and fully supports " the plan drawn up by germany , which currently runs the agenda-setting presidency of the 27-member bloc . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany wants an eu wide ban on denial the commissioner made his comments ahead of the international day of commemoration of the victims of the holocaust on january 27 . " the commission firmly condemns and rejects all manifestations of anti-semitism , racism and xenophobia , " frattini said in a statement . fighting racist speech while freedom of expression is part of europe 's values and traditions , its democratic societies also allowed to fight racist speech through penal law , the commissioner added . however , frattini said earlier this month that it should be up to national governments to decide on the length of jail sentences for people inciting racism and xenophobia . germany has said that it wants the bloc 's member states to adopt the proposed legislation as soon as possible . violation of civil liberties the german proposal also seeks to criminalize racist declarations that are an incitement to violence against a specific person or group .
the aim of the plan is to harmonize national legal systems in their approach to combating racism and xenophobia . but while being unanimous in their condemnation of those who deny the holocaust , eu leaders are split over whether to criminalize such acts . germany views a common eu law as a moral obligation but countries like britain , italy and denmark have resisted common rules as a violation of civil liberties .
still , italy voted to ban it thursday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zuendel could get five years if convicted two years ago , luxembourg tried to use its eu presidency to push through legislation to unify legal standards for holocaust denial , but was blocked by italy on the grounds that the proposed rules breached freedom of speech . the luxembourg blueprint , which germany is studying with a view toward copying it , says that racist declarations or holocaust denial will not be prosecuted if they are expressed in a way that does not incite hatred against an individual or group of people . laws against denying the holocaust already exist in austria , belgium , france , germany and spain .
the un general assembly is also expected to vote on a resolution condemning such speech soon . dw staff / afp / dpa -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de should the eu make holocaust denial a crime ?
german politicians recently said they want to make holocaust denial a crime across the eu during their country 's six-month term as head of the bloc .

he ousted lennart johansson of sweden after 17 years in office . johansson had actually planned to leave his seat at the top of the union of european football associations to german soccer great franz beckenbauer , who was elected by uefa officials as the european representative on the executive committee of world soccer body fifa on friday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beckenbauer was elected to fifa 's executive committee on friday but the kaiser 's decision not to run for uefa 's top job set off a bitter race between platini and johansson , who felt compelled to keep the position he 's had since 1990 out of the frenchman 's hands . a former world soccer star and three-time european player of the year , platini made his intentions to lead the european federation years ago , but johansson 's hold on the job had kept him out of the post . the uefa presidency feud was decided in düsseldorf with a secret vote on friday .
platini won 27 votes , while 23 chose johansson .
two votes were invalid . " it 's the start of an adventure , " said an emotional platini after winning the vote .
" i want to thank everyone who have stayed loyal to me .
i 'm delighted to be able to represent european soccer . " years of ill will bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : platini captained the french team the election race was the most recent example of years worth of bad blood between the two men .
platini was quick to take sides against johansson in a 1998 dispute , complete with scandals and bribery allegations , over who should head fifa , world soccer 's governing body , and threw his support behind germany 's sepp blatter , who went on to win the position . " i would flee to a monastery so i did n't have to watch the massacre , " platini said of what he would do if johansson won the fifa job . not to be outdone , johansson also did his part to keep blatter from rewarding his supporter with a job as fifa 's technical director , saying there were " 200 people in the world " who met the job description , but that platini was n't one of them . " he is a nice person , but i do n't see him as qualified , " johansson said .

he turned a shabby uefa into a rich , business-like federation leading to billions of euros of income from the champions league and european championships .
the influx of money allowed johansson to give each member country , large and small alike , about 370,000 euros -lrb- $ 480,722 -rrb- , a third more than expected . johansson also tried to sway smaller countries by promising to increase the number of teams in the european championship finals from 16 to 24 in 2012 .
that would allow nearly half of the federation 's 52 members to participate .
the expansion gamble has paid off in the past : former fifa president joao havelange won the job in 1974 after upping the number of world cup participants from 16 to 24 and used the same trick to keep his post in 1994 with another increase to 32 teams . past vs. future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : platini is uefa 's seventh president and the second frenchman to hold the post platini , 51 , however , had indirectly called johansson 's promises for the future into doubt by questioning what kinds of promises a 77-year-old should really be making . " it is up to the federations to decide if they want to vote for someone who is for the future or someone who represents the past , " said platini , who has also come out for age restrictions on federation officials and told johansson to concentrate on his hobby of fishing . the german federation had made its intention to support johansson clear , partly as a sign of thanks since johansson 's support was an important part of fifa 's decision to let germany host the 2006 world cup .

he ousted lennart johansson of sweden after 17 years in office . johansson had actually planned to leave his seat at the top of the union of european football associations to german soccer great franz beckenbauer , who was elected by uefa officials as the european representative on the executive committee of world soccer body fifa on friday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beckenbauer was elected to fifa 's executive committee on friday but the kaiser 's decision not to run for uefa 's top job set off a bitter race between platini and johansson , who felt compelled to keep the position he 's had since 1990 out of the frenchman 's hands . a former world soccer star and three-time european player of the year , platini made his intentions to lead the european federation years ago , but johansson 's hold on the job had kept him out of the post . the uefa presidency feud was decided in düsseldorf with a secret vote on friday .
platini won 27 votes , while 23 chose johansson .
two votes were invalid . " it 's the start of an adventure , " said an emotional platini after winning the vote .
" i want to thank everyone who have stayed loyal to me .
i 'm delighted to be able to represent european soccer . " years of ill will bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : platini captained the french team the election race was the most recent example of years worth of bad blood between the two men .
platini was quick to take sides against johansson in a 1998 dispute , complete with scandals and bribery allegations , over who should head fifa , world soccer 's governing body , and threw his support behind germany 's sepp blatter , who went on to win the position . " i would flee to a monastery so i did n't have to watch the massacre , " platini said of what he would do if johansson won the fifa job . not to be outdone , johansson also did his part to keep blatter from rewarding his supporter with a job as fifa 's technical director , saying there were " 200 people in the world " who met the job description , but that platini was n't one of them . " he is a nice person , but i do n't see him as qualified , " johansson said .
" but maybe he has talents i do n't know about . " all countries created equal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : johansson has run the federation since 1990 prior to the election , platini had been doling out uefa cash for development programs in smaller member states such as andorra and moldova , which have as much say as large nations like france and germany . " i 'm one of soccer 's romantics , " platini has often said , explaining why he chooses to focus on expressions like the " soccer family , " " solidarity " and " equal chances for everyone . " blatter has also shown that he has not forgotten his former adviser . " i would rather have a player , " he said .
" as a player , i know when my time is finished . " the power of money and exposure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the champions league tournament is a uefa cash cow johansson , on the other hand , was generally regarded as honest , faithful and upright .

the family is thinking of taking the case to court . members of germany 's commission on returning art stolen by the nazis said the poster collection 's former owner , hans sachs , had made it clear that he felt he had already received adequate compensation for the loss of the collection which was originally made up of around 12,500 posters and 18,000 small drawings and stolen by the nazis in 1938 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernd neumann " the commission has reached a fair and just decision , " said german culture secretary bernd neumann . sachs emigrated to the us with his family in 1938 after the nazis imprisoned him at sachsenhausen concentration camp for two weeks . in 1961 , the west german government paid 225,000 deutsche marks -lrb- about 112,500 euros or $ 146,000 -rrb- in compensation .
at the time , sachs believed that his collection had been lost in the war . protecting treasures five years later , he found out that parts of his collection had resurfaced in an east berlin museum .
he tried to get permission to view it , but east german officials did not grant him that wish before he died in 1974 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the collection is stored at the museum along with busts of lenin and hitler " i 'm certain that west and east germany will know to protect their treasures , " he allegedly wrote in the early 1970s .
in 1966 , sachs also was said to have written to a west german friend indicating that he had no further claims . but on thursday , sachs 's son told the commission that he would certainly have wanted to see the collection return to the family .
it includes ad posters for goods , concerts , exhibitions and plays as well as political propaganda posters , and is estimated to have a value of up to $ 50 million -lrb- 38.5 million euros . -rrb- decision " morally unacceptable " ? " anyone who believes that my father was happy that an east german museum acquired his stolen collection , or that he would have wanted it kept from his own family , can not truly understand the moral implications of those words , " said peter sachs , 69 , adding that he was " inexpressibly saddened " by the commission 's decision . peter sachs ' lawyer called the commission 's ruling " morally unacceptable " and added that he was considering the possibility of taking legal steps against it . doing justice to the collection bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goethe institute president jutta limbach heads the advisory panel commission members meanwhile called on the german historical museum to " do justice " to sachs ' achievements as a collector and pioneer of poster art by caring for and exhibiting the collection .
they also said that the posters should be presented as " collection hans sachs " and documented in a catalogue that includes the collection 's history . " this is in line with the intentions of the son and heir , peter sachs , not to let this unique collection fade from memory , " commission members wrote in a statement . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany aims for better restitution process for nazi-looted art the german government has invited museum directors and legal experts to berlin on monday to discuss claims for art bought or seized by the nazis .

but some say that is not going to happen . resurrecting the half-buried european constitution is " a near-impossible task , " a spanish diplomat acknowledged ahead of a friday meeting at which 18 european union countries attempted to breathe new life into the controversial document . despite official optimism , the 18 were well aware of the difficulties faced by the german eu presidency , which has set rescuing the constitution among its top priorities . the 18 " friends of the european constitution , " all of which have ratified it , were called together by spain and luxembourg to press the other nine countries into relaunching the constitutional process . the charter has been on ice since french and dutch voters rejected it in 2005 referendums . huge challenges ahead countries present in madrid stressed the importance of a politically-committed " real " constitution rather than a scaled-down " mini-treaty . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french and the dutch remain skeptical " we can not resign ourselves to europe being no more than a huge market , " spanish secretary of state alberto navarro and luxembourg delegate foreign affairs minister nicolas schmit wrote in a letter published by the european press . europe had huge challenges to face , ranging from climate change and globalization to immigration , organized crime and social inequality , spanish foreign minister miguel angel moratinos stressed . proponents of a strong charter also say a shift towards more qualified majority voting would help the eu absorb new members , and that the creation of an elected european council president and a eu foreign minister would make it easier to intervene in international crises . reform is unnecessary the german eu presidency wants to salvage the " substance " of the treaty as it stands now , but it will have to deal with people like czech prime minister mirek topolanek , who has dismissed the constitution as a ' pile of crap . ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many are worried the issue will split the eu critics , which also include poland and britain , feel the reform is unnecessary , cumbersome and expensive .
british sources have argued that the eu works well within its current framework . among the other countries , euro-enthusiasts such as portugal and ireland are virtually certain to ratify the constitution , but france and the netherlands can not expect their citizens to change their minds if asked to vote on the same document a second time . dutch and french voters rejected the charter over several reasons including the eu 's anonymous bureaucracy and rapid enlargement . increasing talk of a mini-treaty it is clear the constitution will have to be modified , but the question of how much remains . there is increasing talk about a " mini-treaty , " which would reduce the institutional reforms - as proposed by french presidential candidate nicolas sarkozy - or focus on practicalities rather than a political project , an option favored by many in britain . a radical slimming down of the text , however , would lead to a new impasse , as it would require new ratifications by the countries which already approved the current document . the danger is , that the eu could become polarized into two camps , and critics felt that it had already started happening in madrid . none of the countries critical of the constitution were invited , causing considerable unease in the no-camp and reportedly also in germany . dw staff / dpa -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de should christianity be mentioned in the eu constitution ?

he left germany for canada at the age of 19 but was deported in march 2005 on a german arrest warrant . denying the holocaust is a crime in germany and if convicted , zündel faces up to five years in jail . the trial began almost a year ago but has run into several legal hurdles .
it follows a high-profile case in which controversial british historian david irving spent 13 months in jail in austria for questioning the holocaust before being released last month . germany 's special mission germany , which holds the rotating european union presidency until july , announced plans this month to promote making holocaust denial punishable by law in every member state of the bloc . already , the european commission on friday threw its weight behind a german proposal to push through new rules which would make denying the holocaust a crime in the european union . eu justice commissioner franco frattini said he " very much welcomes and fully supports " the plan drawn up by germany , which currently runs the agenda-setting presidency of the 27-member bloc . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany wants an eu wide ban on denial the commissioner made his comments ahead of the international day of commemoration of the victims of the holocaust on january 27 .

the aim of the plan is to harmonize national legal systems in their approach to combating racism and xenophobia . but while being unanimous in their condemnation of those who deny the holocaust , eu leaders are split over whether to criminalize such acts . germany views a common eu law as a moral obligation but countries like britain , italy and denmark have resisted common rules as a violation of civil liberties .

the family is thinking of taking the case to court . members of germany 's commission on returning art stolen by the nazis said the poster collection 's former owner , hans sachs , had made it clear that he felt he had already received adequate compensation for the loss of the collection which was originally made up of around 12,500 posters and 18,000 small drawings and stolen by the nazis in 1938 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernd neumann " the commission has reached a fair and just decision , " said german culture secretary bernd neumann . sachs emigrated to the us with his family in 1938 after the nazis imprisoned him at sachsenhausen concentration camp for two weeks . in 1961 , the west german government paid 225,000 deutsche marks -lrb- about 112,500 euros or $ 146,000 -rrb- in compensation .
at the time , sachs believed that his collection had been lost in the war . protecting treasures five years later , he found out that parts of his collection had resurfaced in an east berlin museum .

in 1966 , sachs also was said to have written to a west german friend indicating that he had no further claims . but on thursday , sachs 's son told the commission that he would certainly have wanted to see the collection return to the family .
it includes ad posters for goods , concerts , exhibitions and plays as well as political propaganda posters , and is estimated to have a value of up to $ 50 million -lrb- 38.5 million euros . -rrb- decision " morally unacceptable " ?

they also said that the posters should be presented as " collection hans sachs " and documented in a catalogue that includes the collection 's history .

the family is thinking of taking the case to court . members of germany 's commission on returning art stolen by the nazis said the poster collection 's former owner , hans sachs , had made it clear that he felt he had already received adequate compensation for the loss of the collection which was originally made up of around 12,500 posters and 18,000 small drawings and stolen by the nazis in 1938 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernd neumann " the commission has reached a fair and just decision , " said german culture secretary bernd neumann . sachs emigrated to the us with his family in 1938 after the nazis imprisoned him at sachsenhausen concentration camp for two weeks . in 1961 , the west german government paid 225,000 deutsche marks -lrb- about 112,500 euros or $ 146,000 -rrb- in compensation .
at the time , sachs believed that his collection had been lost in the war . protecting treasures five years later , he found out that parts of his collection had resurfaced in an east berlin museum .
he tried to get permission to view it , but east german officials did not grant him that wish before he died in 1974 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the collection is stored at the museum along with busts of lenin and hitler " i 'm certain that west and east germany will know to protect their treasures , " he allegedly wrote in the early 1970s .
in 1966 , sachs also was said to have written to a west german friend indicating that he had no further claims . but on thursday , sachs 's son told the commission that he would certainly have wanted to see the collection return to the family .
it includes ad posters for goods , concerts , exhibitions and plays as well as political propaganda posters , and is estimated to have a value of up to $ 50 million -lrb- 38.5 million euros . -rrb- decision " morally unacceptable " ? " anyone who believes that my father was happy that an east german museum acquired his stolen collection , or that he would have wanted it kept from his own family , can not truly understand the moral implications of those words , " said peter sachs , 69 , adding that he was " inexpressibly saddened " by the commission 's decision . peter sachs ' lawyer called the commission 's ruling " morally unacceptable " and added that he was considering the possibility of taking legal steps against it . doing justice to the collection bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goethe institute president jutta limbach heads the advisory panel commission members meanwhile called on the german historical museum to " do justice " to sachs ' achievements as a collector and pioneer of poster art by caring for and exhibiting the collection .
they also said that the posters should be presented as " collection hans sachs " and documented in a catalogue that includes the collection 's history .

" he shared his proposal with the contact group -lrb- britain , france , germany , italy , russia and the united states -rrb- and there was a very brief discussion about the way forward , " ahtisaari 's spokeswoman hua jiang said . under the plan , kosovo would be autonomous from serbia but have an " international civilian representative " overseeing the government , and nato troops would remain at first in the province , ahtisaari told the parliamentary assembly of the council of europe on wednesday in strasbourg . the plan comes amid a diplomatic tug of war between russia , which would like serbia to maintain control of kosovo , and the united states and its european allies which back the province moving towards independence . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said that he expected russia to back down on its desire for serbia to hold on kosovo . " russia knows how narrow the room for manoeuvre is , " steinmeier told the financial times .
" if their preferred solution proves unworkable , the option of confirming kosovo 's future status in the un security council must be possible and i hope for a constructive russian role . " a key step ahtisaari 's presentation friday in a 90-minute closed-door meeting in vienna , where european union and nato representatives were also present , was seen as a key step towards a solution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : martti ahtisaari says the plan will protect minorities on february 2 , ahtisaari , a former finnish president , will travel to belgrade and pristina to present the proposal to the serbian and kosovo sides , who will then discuss it further before a final plan eventually goes to the un security council , jiang said . ahtisaari said his plan would focus on " the protection of minority rights , in particular of the kosovo serbs " and " a strong international civilian and military presence within a broader future international engagement in kosovo . " he said his plan " provides the foundations for a democratic and multi-ethnic kosovo in which the rights and interests of all members of its communities are firmly guaranteed and protected by institutions based on the rule of law . " nato supportive in brussels meanwhile , nato foreign ministers met friday to look at ways to better coordinate security and civilian operations in the military alliance 's two biggest missions , afghanistan and kosovo . nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer said the ministers would " discuss how nato can best continue to play its crucial role in underpinning the political process " in kosovo .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the economic situation in kosovo is dire the ministers said it will stay the course in kosovo with the nato-led kosovo force maintaining its 17,000 troops . in limbo fears have grown that any major delay in announcing how much autonomy kosovo should be granted could inflame tensions and spill over into violence . kosovo has been in limbo for nearly eight years , since nato intervened to halt a crackdown by serbian forces against the ethnic albanian population during a 1998-1999 war with separatist guerrillas . ahead of the status resolution , many argue that kosovo can not count on a viable future as an independent state because of its economy . in bad shape the province 's economy is , if anything , in a worse state than in the post-war period when foreign donors opened their coffers for reconstruction .
but this has dried up in the past two years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbia wants to hold on to kosovo unemployment in kosovo stands at 40-45 percent and is rising ; around half its people live below the poverty line and annual per capita income is the lowest in the region at around 1,250 euros -lrb- $ 1,615 -rrb- . " real problems can emerge when the people start to think with their stomachs , " journalist and economic analyst ibrahim rexhepi told afp .
" a social explosion is possible because leaders will no longer be in a position to give promises on independence to placate and pacify the tense province 's two million people . " political leaders in pristina are convinced the economy will improve significantly when kosovo becomes independent . " independence will help us , " kosovo prime minister agim ceku told afp in an interview last week .

" he shared his proposal with the contact group -lrb- britain , france , germany , italy , russia and the united states -rrb- and there was a very brief discussion about the way forward , " ahtisaari 's spokeswoman hua jiang said . under the plan , kosovo would be autonomous from serbia but have an " international civilian representative " overseeing the government , and nato troops would remain at first in the province , ahtisaari told the parliamentary assembly of the council of europe on wednesday in strasbourg . the plan comes amid a diplomatic tug of war between russia , which would like serbia to maintain control of kosovo , and the united states and its european allies which back the province moving towards independence . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said that he expected russia to back down on its desire for serbia to hold on kosovo . " russia knows how narrow the room for manoeuvre is , " steinmeier told the financial times .
" if their preferred solution proves unworkable , the option of confirming kosovo 's future status in the un security council must be possible and i hope for a constructive russian role . " a key step ahtisaari 's presentation friday in a 90-minute closed-door meeting in vienna , where european union and nato representatives were also present , was seen as a key step towards a solution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : martti ahtisaari says the plan will protect minorities on february 2 , ahtisaari , a former finnish president , will travel to belgrade and pristina to present the proposal to the serbian and kosovo sides , who will then discuss it further before a final plan eventually goes to the un security council , jiang said . ahtisaari said his plan would focus on " the protection of minority rights , in particular of the kosovo serbs " and " a strong international civilian and military presence within a broader future international engagement in kosovo . " he said his plan " provides the foundations for a democratic and multi-ethnic kosovo in which the rights and interests of all members of its communities are firmly guaranteed and protected by institutions based on the rule of law . " nato supportive in brussels meanwhile , nato foreign ministers met friday to look at ways to better coordinate security and civilian operations in the military alliance 's two biggest missions , afghanistan and kosovo . nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer said the ministers would " discuss how nato can best continue to play its crucial role in underpinning the political process " in kosovo .

" a social explosion is possible because leaders will no longer be in a position to give promises on independence to placate and pacify the tense province 's two million people . " political leaders in pristina are convinced the economy will improve significantly when kosovo becomes independent . " independence will help us , " kosovo prime minister agim ceku told afp in an interview last week .

two votes were invalid . " it 's the start of an adventure , " said an emotional platini after winning the vote .
" i want to thank everyone who have stayed loyal to me .
i 'm delighted to be able to represent european soccer . " years of ill will bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : platini captained the french team the election race was the most recent example of years worth of bad blood between the two men .
platini was quick to take sides against johansson in a 1998 dispute , complete with scandals and bribery allegations , over who should head fifa , world soccer 's governing body , and threw his support behind germany 's sepp blatter , who went on to win the position . " i would flee to a monastery so i did n't have to watch the massacre , " platini said of what he would do if johansson won the fifa job . not to be outdone , johansson also did his part to keep blatter from rewarding his supporter with a job as fifa 's technical director , saying there were " 200 people in the world " who met the job description , but that platini was n't one of them . " he is a nice person , but i do n't see him as qualified , " johansson said .
" but maybe he has talents i do n't know about . " all countries created equal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : johansson has run the federation since 1990 prior to the election , platini had been doling out uefa cash for development programs in smaller member states such as andorra and moldova , which have as much say as large nations like france and germany . " i 'm one of soccer 's romantics , " platini has often said , explaining why he chooses to focus on expressions like the " soccer family , " " solidarity " and " equal chances for everyone . " blatter has also shown that he has not forgotten his former adviser . " i would rather have a player , " he said .
" as a player , i know when my time is finished . " the power of money and exposure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the champions league tournament is a uefa cash cow johansson , on the other hand , was generally regarded as honest , faithful and upright .
he turned a shabby uefa into a rich , business-like federation leading to billions of euros of income from the champions league and european championships .
the influx of money allowed johansson to give each member country , large and small alike , about 370,000 euros -lrb- $ 480,722 -rrb- , a third more than expected . johansson also tried to sway smaller countries by promising to increase the number of teams in the european championship finals from 16 to 24 in 2012 .
that would allow nearly half of the federation 's 52 members to participate .
the expansion gamble has paid off in the past : former fifa president joao havelange won the job in 1974 after upping the number of world cup participants from 16 to 24 and used the same trick to keep his post in 1994 with another increase to 32 teams . past vs. future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : platini is uefa 's seventh president and the second frenchman to hold the post platini , 51 , however , had indirectly called johansson 's promises for the future into doubt by questioning what kinds of promises a 77-year-old should really be making . " it is up to the federations to decide if they want to vote for someone who is for the future or someone who represents the past , " said platini , who has also come out for age restrictions on federation officials and told johansson to concentrate on his hobby of fishing . the german federation had made its intention to support johansson clear , partly as a sign of thanks since johansson 's support was an important part of fifa 's decision to let germany host the 2006 world cup . " there has never been a better uefa president , " beckenbauer said .
" we have a lot to thank lennart johansson for .

he left germany for canada at the age of 19 but was deported in march 2005 on a german arrest warrant . denying the holocaust is a crime in germany and if convicted , zündel faces up to five years in jail . the trial began almost a year ago but has run into several legal hurdles .
it follows a high-profile case in which controversial british historian david irving spent 13 months in jail in austria for questioning the holocaust before being released last month . germany 's special mission germany , which holds the rotating european union presidency until july , announced plans this month to promote making holocaust denial punishable by law in every member state of the bloc . already , the european commission on friday threw its weight behind a german proposal to push through new rules which would make denying the holocaust a crime in the european union . eu justice commissioner franco frattini said he " very much welcomes and fully supports " the plan drawn up by germany , which currently runs the agenda-setting presidency of the 27-member bloc . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany wants an eu wide ban on denial the commissioner made his comments ahead of the international day of commemoration of the victims of the holocaust on january 27 . " the commission firmly condemns and rejects all manifestations of anti-semitism , racism and xenophobia , " frattini said in a statement . fighting racist speech while freedom of expression is part of europe 's values and traditions , its democratic societies also allowed to fight racist speech through penal law , the commissioner added . however , frattini said earlier this month that it should be up to national governments to decide on the length of jail sentences for people inciting racism and xenophobia . germany has said that it wants the bloc 's member states to adopt the proposed legislation as soon as possible . violation of civil liberties the german proposal also seeks to criminalize racist declarations that are an incitement to violence against a specific person or group .
the aim of the plan is to harmonize national legal systems in their approach to combating racism and xenophobia . but while being unanimous in their condemnation of those who deny the holocaust , eu leaders are split over whether to criminalize such acts . germany views a common eu law as a moral obligation but countries like britain , italy and denmark have resisted common rules as a violation of civil liberties .

" he shared his proposal with the contact group -lrb- britain , france , germany , italy , russia and the united states -rrb- and there was a very brief discussion about the way forward , " ahtisaari 's spokeswoman hua jiang said . under the plan , kosovo would be autonomous from serbia but have an " international civilian representative " overseeing the government , and nato troops would remain at first in the province , ahtisaari told the parliamentary assembly of the council of europe on wednesday in strasbourg . the plan comes amid a diplomatic tug of war between russia , which would like serbia to maintain control of kosovo , and the united states and its european allies which back the province moving towards independence . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said that he expected russia to back down on its desire for serbia to hold on kosovo . " russia knows how narrow the room for manoeuvre is , " steinmeier told the financial times .
" if their preferred solution proves unworkable , the option of confirming kosovo 's future status in the un security council must be possible and i hope for a constructive russian role . " a key step ahtisaari 's presentation friday in a 90-minute closed-door meeting in vienna , where european union and nato representatives were also present , was seen as a key step towards a solution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : martti ahtisaari says the plan will protect minorities on february 2 , ahtisaari , a former finnish president , will travel to belgrade and pristina to present the proposal to the serbian and kosovo sides , who will then discuss it further before a final plan eventually goes to the un security council , jiang said . ahtisaari said his plan would focus on " the protection of minority rights , in particular of the kosovo serbs " and " a strong international civilian and military presence within a broader future international engagement in kosovo . " he said his plan " provides the foundations for a democratic and multi-ethnic kosovo in which the rights and interests of all members of its communities are firmly guaranteed and protected by institutions based on the rule of law . " nato supportive in brussels meanwhile , nato foreign ministers met friday to look at ways to better coordinate security and civilian operations in the military alliance 's two biggest missions , afghanistan and kosovo . nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer said the ministers would " discuss how nato can best continue to play its crucial role in underpinning the political process " in kosovo .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the economic situation in kosovo is dire the ministers said it will stay the course in kosovo with the nato-led kosovo force maintaining its 17,000 troops . in limbo fears have grown that any major delay in announcing how much autonomy kosovo should be granted could inflame tensions and spill over into violence . kosovo has been in limbo for nearly eight years , since nato intervened to halt a crackdown by serbian forces against the ethnic albanian population during a 1998-1999 war with separatist guerrillas . ahead of the status resolution , many argue that kosovo can not count on a viable future as an independent state because of its economy . in bad shape the province 's economy is , if anything , in a worse state than in the post-war period when foreign donors opened their coffers for reconstruction .
but this has dried up in the past two years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbia wants to hold on to kosovo unemployment in kosovo stands at 40-45 percent and is rising ; around half its people live below the poverty line and annual per capita income is the lowest in the region at around 1,250 euros -lrb- $ 1,615 -rrb- . " real problems can emerge when the people start to think with their stomachs , " journalist and economic analyst ibrahim rexhepi told afp .
" a social explosion is possible because leaders will no longer be in a position to give promises on independence to placate and pacify the tense province 's two million people . " political leaders in pristina are convinced the economy will improve significantly when kosovo becomes independent . " independence will help us , " kosovo prime minister agim ceku told afp in an interview last week .
" the undefined status was a big obstacle to tackling the economic challenges and issues .

he was released without being charged in 2006 . steinmeier not considering resignation in a report issued to a parliamentary control committee , deputy interior and foreign ministers reached the conclusion kurnaz could be denied a visa " by means of legally permissible material , " despite additional notes that the interior ministry " hoped to receive more information against k. from the us , " the daily reported . in addition to saying his resignation was " not open to debate , " steinmeier also rejected the newspapers ' claims that he or anyone in the schröder administration was responsible for extending kurnaz ' detention . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier has received support from chancellor angela merkel and said he wo n't quit " the alternatives were not germany or guantanamo , " he told the mass-circulation bild-zeitung on friday .
" what would be wrong with releasing him to turkey , where his wife and other family members live ? " steinmeier also hinted that conditions set for a release , possibly including using kurnaz to infiltrate radical islamist groups , were unacceptable .
berlin 's tagesspiegel newspaper reported that the german reluctance to use kurnaz as a spy may have convinced the americans to keep him in prison . protecting german national security steinmeier added that the german government was focused on protecting the country 's national security after the sept .
11 , 2001 terror attacks in the united states . " guaranteeing the safety of 82 million people in germany was our highest priority , " he told bild .
" leading members of the attacks in new york and washington came from hamburg and there were additional groups and networks of islamists ready to use violence in other german cities .
we had to expect the possibility of violence here and do everything we could to prevent it . " the european parliament also concluded this week that germany had turned down a us offer to release kurnaz .
a german parliamentary committee is investigating the matter . opposition demands answers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier testified in front of a second german investigation in december max stadler , a member of the free-market liberal free democratic party and a member of the inquiry panel , said steinmeier will have to explain why the previous government did not think it appropriate to take kurnaz back after he was no longer though to be a terror suspect . " this opportunity to secure kurnaz ' release should have been taken , no doubt about that , " he said .
" i ca n't really see any sound reasons why the previous german government did n't do this . " for his part , steinmeier said he was also interested in clearing up the issue as soon as possible , though he is unlikely to testify before march . " what is showing up in newspapers does not provide a complete picture , " he told bild .
" i am going to do my part so that at the end everything is clear . " petra pau of the opposition left party said steinmeier 's silence indicates that he has something to hide , pointing to the chances he 's had to clear up the situation in the past . " the foreign minister had every opportunity to testify before the european union 's inquiry panel , " she said .
" but steinmeier chose not to appear , which is a real scandal .
steinmeier is free to tell the public in more detail what he did - or did not do - to secure kurnaz ' release without revealing any classified information .

the national institute for health and clinical excellence accepts the idea for england and wales is controversial .
but evidence from international trials shows modest financial incentives can cut drug abuse by hardened addicts .
users could get vouchers worth up to £ 10 at nhs treatment programmes - if tests show they are free of drugs .
i do n't think it 's bribery - i think it 's an effective treatment that brings real benefit mr stephen pilling consultant clinical psychologist nice says the idea would be cost-effective , and there would be a public health benefit because addicts could also be screened for infectious diseases - such as hiv and tuberculosis .
the proposal for an incentive scheme is contained in draft guidance on how the nhs in england and wales should handle drug misuse .
debates about how nhs money should be spent have intensified in recent years .
nice will soon face its first legal challenge when groups angry about restrictions on drugs for alzheimer 's disease challenge its processes .
could help many mr stephen pilling , a consultant clinical psychologist from university college london , who advised the nice group , estimates 50,000 addicts in england and wales could take part in the scheme .
he believes it could help up to half of them stay off drugs .
the cost of a few sandwiches is a small price to pay if it keeps more drug users on the path of recovery and off illegal drugs richard phillips , phoenix futures he said : " i think the group , having thought it through carefully , have firmly come to the view that it provides a much better and positive way to relate to drug users than sometimes we have done in the past .
" i do n't think it 's bribery - i think it 's an effective treatment that brings real benefit .
we are convinced it is a proper way to deal with people . "
mr pilling said the key was that the system provided an incentive for people to present a clean drug test .
" there will be some big challenges in spelling out the benefits to nhs staff and monitoring the implementation of this .
" but the evidence shows small incentives can have a marked impact . "
cost effective the nice group looked at evidence from more than 20 trials , mainly done in the us .
the results convinced the group that incentive schemes worked and were cost-effective .
studies have shown many people with drug problems respond much better to positive incentives than to programmes which focus on punishment and make them feel guilty .
some of the american trials involved giving drug addicts vouchers for burger chains , but mr pilling said that would n't be the case in the nhs .
i 'd rather money was spent on drug treatment centres linda , whose son neil was an addict for 15 years he said : " a clear purpose of the use of vouchers would be to promote a healthy lifestyle - we would want to encourage them to buy appropriate food or improve their leisure activities . "
richard phillips , director of services at phoenix futures - drug and alcohol treatment specialists - said providing incentives to people receiving treatments could be controversial .
but he said : " if it works to keep people in treatment there would be considerable benefits to the public .

"
linda , whose son neil used heroin and crack cocaine for 15 years , said faster access to treatment is more important than vouchers .
" i 'd rather money was spent on drug treatment centres , where people could be helped immediately .
" these young people have deep-seated problems - that 's what needs to be addressed .
" that 's where the money should go - not giving them vouchers for food , clothes or shopping . "
professor peter littlejohns , nice 's clinical and public health director , said the aim of the new guidance would be to offer a package of interventions to provide support for people trying to beat their addiction .
the draft guidelines also consider how to give addicts information about self-help groups , such as narcotics anonymous , and how to best support families and carers .
a consultation on the proposals is open until early march , with full guidance due to be issued to the nhs in the summer .
the department of health said its drug treatment budget was to increase from £ 375m to £ 388m for 2007/8 .
it will also input £ 10m of capital funding .
a spokesman said it would be responding to the nice consultation .

but evidence from international trials shows modest financial incentives can cut drug abuse by hardened addicts .
users could get vouchers worth up to £ 10 at nhs treatment programmes - if tests show they are free of drugs .
i do n't think it 's bribery - i think it 's an effective treatment that brings real benefit mr stephen pilling consultant clinical psychologist nice says the idea would be cost-effective , and there would be a public health benefit because addicts could also be screened for infectious diseases - such as hiv and tuberculosis .
the proposal for an incentive scheme is contained in draft guidance on how the nhs in england and wales should handle drug misuse .
debates about how nhs money should be spent have intensified in recent years .
nice will soon face its first legal challenge when groups angry about restrictions on drugs for alzheimer 's disease challenge its processes .
could help many mr stephen pilling , a consultant clinical psychologist from university college london , who advised the nice group , estimates 50,000 addicts in england and wales could take part in the scheme .
he believes it could help up to half of them stay off drugs .
the cost of a few sandwiches is a small price to pay if it keeps more drug users on the path of recovery and off illegal drugs richard phillips , phoenix futures he said : " i think the group , having thought it through carefully , have firmly come to the view that it provides a much better and positive way to relate to drug users than sometimes we have done in the past .
" i do n't think it 's bribery - i think it 's an effective treatment that brings real benefit .
we are convinced it is a proper way to deal with people . "
mr pilling said the key was that the system provided an incentive for people to present a clean drug test .
" there will be some big challenges in spelling out the benefits to nhs staff and monitoring the implementation of this .
" but the evidence shows small incentives can have a marked impact . "
cost effective the nice group looked at evidence from more than 20 trials , mainly done in the us .
the results convinced the group that incentive schemes worked and were cost-effective .
studies have shown many people with drug problems respond much better to positive incentives than to programmes which focus on punishment and make them feel guilty .
some of the american trials involved giving drug addicts vouchers for burger chains , but mr pilling said that would n't be the case in the nhs .
i 'd rather money was spent on drug treatment centres linda , whose son neil was an addict for 15 years he said : " a clear purpose of the use of vouchers would be to promote a healthy lifestyle - we would want to encourage them to buy appropriate food or improve their leisure activities . "
richard phillips , director of services at phoenix futures - drug and alcohol treatment specialists - said providing incentives to people receiving treatments could be controversial .
but he said : " if it works to keep people in treatment there would be considerable benefits to the public .
" the cost of a few sandwiches is a small price to pay if it keeps more drug users on the path of recovery and off illegal drugs . "
' deep-seated problems ' but mike trace , chief executive of the rehabilitation of addicted prisoners trust cast doubt on whether the concept would work .
have your say giving addicts incentives to stay clean does not get to the core of the problem of their addiction recovering drug user , kent send us your comments he told the bbc radio four today programme : " if you just rely on rewards for abstinence and you 're not treating people 's complex problems , you 're not going to change the behaviour . "
linda , whose son neil used heroin and crack cocaine for 15 years , said faster access to treatment is more important than vouchers .
" i 'd rather money was spent on drug treatment centres , where people could be helped immediately .
" these young people have deep-seated problems - that 's what needs to be addressed .
" that 's where the money should go - not giving them vouchers for food , clothes or shopping . "
professor peter littlejohns , nice 's clinical and public health director , said the aim of the new guidance would be to offer a package of interventions to provide support for people trying to beat their addiction .
the draft guidelines also consider how to give addicts information about self-help groups , such as narcotics anonymous , and how to best support families and carers .
a consultation on the proposals is open until early march , with full guidance due to be issued to the nhs in the summer .
the department of health said its drug treatment budget was to increase from £ 375m to £ 388m for 2007/8 .
it will also input £ 10m of capital funding .
a spokesman said it would be responding to the nice consultation .
he added : " nice 's current draft guideline makes a number of recommendations on the use of suitable privileges or rewards to encourage compliance with treatment regimes .
" this is one of a range of approaches that may support better outcomes . "

it just about sums up the enormous goodie bag russia 's president is offering india .
moscow has long been india 's main provider of weapons .
but there is far more at work now than a simple sales pitch for more contracts .
the dynamic between these two nations is changing .
india and russia had a long friendship throughout the cold war .
when the soviet union collapsed both sides became more preoccupied with internal economic issues , russia with its chaotic decline , india with pursuing reforms to stimulate much needed growth by releasing some of the shackles that had bound its own economy .
now both nations have emerged from those transformations stronger and more confident than they have been for years .
they share a sense that they are rising on the tide of history .
both have dynamic , fast-growing economies and they have needs that should be compatible .
so they are coming together to lay the groundwork for their future ties .
at present trade between the two is a paltry $ 2bn a year .
they want to increase it many times over to build a broad economic and investment relationship .
' power politics ' first and foremost for india is the urgent need to secure energy supplies .
india has relatively few energy sources of its own .
already it can not keep up with demand from its power-hungry economy .
in 15 years ' time it will consume three times much oil as it uses today .
if it does not get new energy supplies india 's remarkable economic rise could come to a spluttering halt .
moscow is already building two nuclear reactors at kundankulam in tamil nadu .
it is now offering india four more for civilian use .
to build them india needs special approval from the 45-nation nuclear suppliers group -lrb- nsg -rrb- because it has not signed the nuclear non-proliferation treaty .
president putin has promised to push india 's case at the nsg .
the reward for russia in sales of reactors and uranium could be rich indeed .
india has also been trying hard to get more access to russia 's huge deposits of oil and gas .
it is already a partner in the sakhalin 1 oilfield in russia 's pacific waters .
but moscow has seemed to favour china in its recent deals .
now mr putin may offer india a chance to invest in the sakhalin 3 oil and gas exploration blocks and maybe other fields too .
that would be a big prize for delhi .
' arms and the man from moscow ' the quid pro quo may be major arms deals .
india is looking to spend around $ 10bn in the next five years .
it wants to buy 120 new fighter jets in one of the biggest orders of its kind in recent years .
russia is pitching its mig-35 .
but delhi is also considering diversifying its suppliers , which would mark a significant change of direction .
sweden 's jas-39 gripen , france rafale fighter , and the american f / a18 super hornet or f-16 planes are all contenders for the contract .
so part of president putin 's agenda is to defend russia 's position as india 's main arms supplier from growing competition .
to do that he is offering more than just weapons sales .
russia is willing to transfer technology too , and bring india in as a partner in new projects .
the russian defence minister sergei ivanov has already said india may be allowed to build and maintain the engines for the mig-35 itself if it signs up for russia 's plane .
india may also participate in the production of a new stealth fighter being planned by russia .
the two sides are discussing developing a new military helicopter together .
they already work together to make the brahmos missile system and ahead of president putin 's arrival they signed a deal giving india the blueprints to make engines for its existing mig-29 fighters , and a memorandum on the joint development of a new military transport aircraft .
before leaving moscow president putin was keen to point out " the very specific feature of our interaction has to do with the fact that we have moved from the simple paradigm of seller-buyer relationship to jointly work on products " .
russia is trying to tie in india 's lucrative arms and energy contracts .
' india 's new friends ' moscow has reason to act .
india has just begun building a new strategic partnership with the united states .
the spur for this was president bush 's landmark deal offering co-operation in civilian nuclear energy programmes .
washington wants to make common cause with india as the world 's biggest democracy and a counterweight to rising china .
it wants to sell its own nuclear reactors to india and weapons too .
so india 's rise means it is being courted on both sides .
delhi 's ultimate aim is probably to secure what it calls " strategic balance " to avoid becoming too closely tied to either moscow or washington .
that will mean some hard-nosed bargaining .
but it is india that is buying , whether it is energy or arms , and so it finds itself in an unaccustomed but increasingly powerful role as a major economic player , with both moscow and washington vying for its business .

it just about sums up the enormous goodie bag russia 's president is offering india .
president putin has a lot to talk about with indian pm manmohan singh moscow has long been india 's main provider of weapons .
but there is far more at work now than a simple sales pitch for more contracts .
the dynamic between these two nations is changing .
india and russia had a long friendship throughout the cold war .
when the soviet union collapsed both sides became more preoccupied with internal economic issues , russia with its chaotic decline , india with pursuing reforms to stimulate much needed growth by releasing some of the shackles that had bound its own economy .
now both nations have emerged from those transformations stronger and more confident than they have been for years .
they share a sense that they are rising on the tide of history .
both have dynamic , fast-growing economies and they have needs that should be compatible .
so they are coming together to lay the groundwork for their future ties .
at present trade between the two is a paltry $ 2bn a year .
they want to increase it many times over to build a broad economic and investment relationship .
' power politics ' first and foremost for india is the urgent need to secure energy supplies .
india has relatively few energy sources of its own .
already it can not keep up with demand from its power-hungry economy .
in 15 years ' time it will consume three times much oil as it uses today .
if it does not get new energy supplies india 's remarkable economic rise could come to a spluttering halt .
moscow is already building two nuclear reactors at kundankulam in tamil nadu .
it is now offering india four more for civilian use .
to build them india needs special approval from the 45-nation nuclear suppliers group -lrb- nsg -rrb- because it has not signed the nuclear non-proliferation treaty .
president putin has promised to push india 's case at the nsg .
the reward for russia in sales of reactors and uranium could be rich indeed .
india has also been trying hard to get more access to russia 's huge deposits of oil and gas .
it is already a partner in the sakhalin 1 oilfield in russia 's pacific waters .
but moscow has seemed to favour china in its recent deals .
now mr putin may offer india a chance to invest in the sakhalin 3 oil and gas exploration blocks and maybe other fields too .
that would be a big prize for delhi .
' arms and the man from moscow ' the quid pro quo may be major arms deals .
india is looking to spend around $ 10bn in the next five years .
it wants to buy 120 new fighter jets in one of the biggest orders of its kind in recent years .
india 's defence minister ak anthony is set for talks with russia 's sergei ivanov russia is pitching its mig-35 .
but delhi is also considering diversifying its suppliers , which would mark a significant change of direction .
sweden 's jas-39 gripen , france rafale fighter , and the american f / a18 super hornet or f-16 planes are all contenders for the contract .
so part of president putin 's agenda is to defend russia 's position as india 's main arms supplier from growing competition .
to do that he is offering more than just weapons sales .
russia is willing to transfer technology too , and bring india in as a partner in new projects .
the russian defence minister sergei ivanov has already said india may be allowed to build and maintain the engines for the mig-35 itself if it signs up for russia 's plane .
india may also participate in the production of a new stealth fighter being planned by russia .
the two sides are discussing developing a new military helicopter together .
they already work together to make the brahmos missile system and ahead of president putin 's arrival they signed a deal giving india the blueprints to make engines for its existing mig-29 fighters , and a memorandum on the joint development of a new military transport aircraft .
before leaving moscow president putin was keen to point out " the very specific feature of our interaction has to do with the fact that we have moved from the simple paradigm of seller-buyer relationship to jointly work on products " .
russia is trying to tie in india 's lucrative arms and energy contracts .
' india 's new friends ' moscow has reason to act .
india has just begun building a new strategic partnership with the united states .
the spur for this was president bush 's landmark deal offering co-operation in civilian nuclear energy programmes .
washington wants to make common cause with india as the world 's biggest democracy and a counterweight to rising china .
it wants to sell its own nuclear reactors to india and weapons too .
so india 's rise means it is being courted on both sides .
delhi 's ultimate aim is probably to secure what it calls " strategic balance " to avoid becoming too closely tied to either moscow or washington .
that will mean some hard-nosed bargaining .
but it is india that is buying , whether it is energy or arms , and so it finds itself in an unaccustomed but increasingly powerful role as a major economic player , with both moscow and washington vying for its business .

spokeswoman tamsin davies said : " the response this year has been fabulous and people have been coming up with innovative ways to take part while raising valuable funds which will all go towards the training of our volunteer crews .
" training is the essential ingredient which turns rnli volunteers into lifesavers , and enables them to rescue an average of 22 people every day .

chinese auditors said the money was misappropriated from funds allocated in 2004 and 2005 , and warned the total figure could be even higher .
corrupt local officials have long been rumoured to have pocketed money meant for the resettlement of residents .
some 1.4 million people have been displaced by the massive dam project .
the national audit office said it believed 272m yuan -lrb- $ 34.8m -rrb- of 9.6bn yuan allocated in 2004 and 2005 had been misappropriated by local authorities , xinhua news agency reports .
' inferior land ' the money should have been used for housing , construction and other services such as job training related to the resettlement of displaced residents .
instead , it went to pay off the debts of other departments , staff salaries , build more offices and homes for people outside of the resettlement project , the audit office said .
auditors also found cases of salaries for workers who did not exist and the unnecessary raising of building project costs .
they also warned that , since their process did not cover certain regions or take into account the 2006 funds , the final figure of misappropriated funds could be higher .
work on the dam , set to be the world 's largest hydro-electric project , began in 1993 .
it is due to become fully operational by 2009 .
china says it is necessary to provide electricity for its booming economy and help control flooding on the yangtze river .
but campaigners say it comes at the expense of villagers , who in many cases have been resettled on inferior land and been deprived of compensation by corrupt local officials .

bbc news -pipe- health -pipe- ' how mondays help me live with ms ' bbc news / health graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- health contents : medical notes friday , 26 january 2007 , 08:10 gmt ' how mondays help me live with ms ' by alistair hignell bbc five live commentator for most sports commentators , the most important day of the week is saturday .
or perhaps , given the way that kick-off times have been rescheduled for the benefit of television , sunday .
or friday .
for me , it 's monday .
every week is dictated by what 's happening at the end of it .
i know , for instance , that i will be commentating on england against scotland at twickenham next weekend for radio five live and that there are five more internationals , three cup finals and a dozen or so premiership games before the world cup starts in september .
but the progression of multiple sclerosis -lrb- ms -rrb- has dictated that for me what happens on monday is equally important .
while ms - an incurable disease that afflicts 85,000 people in the uk - takes different forms for different people , one symptom that appears to be common to all is extreme fatigue .
energy at times is like water in the desert - a precious commodity that must be conserved closely and used sparingly .

my problems can therefore be managed ; by using an electric buggy , by living in an apartment with no stairs and no garden , by a support worker who drives me around the country , by a speech recognition programme on my computer , by a further session of physio at kinetic fitness studios in bristol every thursday and by my monday re-charge at the treatment centre in nailsea .

while ms - an incurable disease that afflicts 85,000 people in the uk - takes different forms for different people , one symptom that appears to be common to all is extreme fatigue .
energy at times is like water in the desert - a precious commodity that must be conserved closely and used sparingly .
people with ms find that tasks that in the past that they would have taken in their stride are now fraught with difficulty .
calculations constantly have to be made ; every expenditure of energy is a trade-off .
if i do this action now - drive my car , put my rubbish out , mow my lawn , go for a walk , climb those stairs - how much energy will i have left to do my job ?
no complaints mondays have become my re-charging day .
every expenditure of energy is a trade-off every week , when i am in the country , i am driven - i had to give up driving myself two years ago because of fatigue - to the ms treatment centre in nailsea , near bristol .
over the next four-and-a-half hours , i have physiotherapy , an aromatherapy massage and a spell in the hyperbaric oxygen chamber .
this combination of treatments i believe sets me up for what is to come .
next week , for instance , i will be travelling to and from media briefings on tuesday , wednesday and thursday , preparing from home on friday , and commentating at twickenham on saturday .
the following week is identical - except that italy will be england 's opponents at the weekend .
i 'm not complaining .
i have a fantastic job , and i have incredible support from my wife , jeannie , while my colleagues and friends constantly amaze me with their willingness to help .
strategies i am lucky that , of all the incurable diseases to get , ms is one of the best .
all i need now , especially in world cup year , is an upturn in england 's fortunes !
it is very rarely life-threatening .
i am lucky also that , while my ms affects my limbs - my right leg does not do half the things i want it to do , and my right arm appears to be on go-slow - it does not , as it does for some people , affect the voice or the eyes .
my problems can therefore be managed ; by using an electric buggy , by living in an apartment with no stairs and no garden , by a support worker who drives me around the country , by a speech recognition programme on my computer , by a further session of physio at kinetic fitness studios in bristol every thursday and by my monday re-charge at the treatment centre in nailsea .
all these strategies are designed to make it physically possible to get to where i need to be .
as long as i can get into the commentary box , i can do my job .
all i need now , especially in world cup year , is an upturn in england 's fortunes !
alastair 's story will be featured in a documentary , inside out west , 26/01/07 at 7.30pm on bbc one in the bbc west region .
digital satellite viewers can see the programme on channel 986 .

rage against the machine will headline the coachella festival in the past few days , the reunion news has come thick and fast .
antipodean favourites crowded house , us rockers rage against the machine and van halen and uk indie heroes james and the jesus and mary chain are all planning live comebacks .
genesis - with phil collins but without peter gabriel - have already announced summer dates , while sting is widely expected to bring back the police .
other bands who have buried their various hatchets to return in 2007 include the smashing pumpkins , the sugarcubes , dinosaur jr and my bloody valentine .
according to mark sutherland , london bureau chief of billboard magazine , there is one big reason why many bands get back together .
" it 's called money , " he says .
" essentially that 's what a reunion boils down to .
phil collins said he " missed the camaraderie " of being in a band " in most cases , these people can make more money in their old band than they can doing whatever they 're doing now . "
if the police do make a comeback , it will be " the biggest tour of the summer " , mr sutherland says .
" they will play massive venues to huge amounts of people and genesis have already sold out stadium dates all around the world . "
when genesis announced their plans last year , collins denied being motivated by money .
" we 're all loaded enough not to worry about where the next million or two is coming from , " he said .
" if money was the issue , we 'd be playing more than 20 shows .
i just felt now was the right time to have a go at it , " he said , adding that he " missed the camaraderie " .
the sex pistols ' 1996 comeback was named the filthy lucre tour crowded house 's neil finn has explained their decision by saying it felt " right to us that the band should re-emerge " and they looked forward to " reconnecting with the audience " .
james bassist jim glennie said band members started jamming together again and " things just clicked " .
" i 've never been as excited by a period in james ' musical history as now , " he said .
but when the sex pistols reformed for a world tour in 1996 , john lydon - formerly johnny rotten - made it clear that his band had buried their differences in filthy lucre .
" we have found a common cause , and it 's your money , " he sneered .
fresh start the sex pistols earned their pensions , but for some bands a comeback can mean a whole new lease of life .
british boy band take that , who scored eight uk number one singles from 1993-96 , have achieved one of the most impressive comebacks .
when they planned a tour for 2006 , singer mark owen said they were " worried about how it would sell initially " .
take that scored one of the most spectacular comebacks they went on to play more than 30 sold-out shows to half a million people , with gary barlow describing the response as " fascinating " .
" our tour was bigger than any of the tours we 've done , " he said .
" we 've been amazed by that .
and if there 's a bit of nostalgia in there , then great . "
the tour was followed by new material , which gave them the uk 's second biggest-selling album of 2006 .
they now have the chance to break america after signing a record deal there .
but that kind of reception is reserved for a select few bands with the largest , most loyal fanbases .
in contrast , fellow 1990s pop stars all saints have seen their new album flop , while east 17 's attempted comeback was met largely with indifference .
there are still a few more legendary line-ups , though , who could command huge attention - and fees - if they decided to give it one more shot .
pink floyd buried the hatched for live 8 - but not a full tour pink floyd , including david gilmour and roger waters , shared a stage at live 8 in 2005 - but have resisted all offers for a full comeback .
" the biggest deal in terms of touring around the world would definitely be pink floyd , " mr sutherland says .
" but those guys are billionaires or something - do they really need another castle ? "
abba reportedly turned down a $ 1bn -lrb- £ 690m -rrb- offer in 2000 , with benny andersson telling a swedish newspaper : " it is a hell of a lot of money to say no to , but we decided it was n't for us . "
the return of the smiths , the stone roses or the jam would cause a frenzy in the uk , mr sutherland adds .
frosty relations " that 's the holy trinity right there if you could get those three bands to reform .
" but they 're probably three of the most unlikely reformations out there because there does seem to be a genuine degree of antipathy between the members . "
their frontmen - morrissey , ian brown and paul weller - have also enjoyed successful solo careers and so are less likely to need the windfall .
the chances of a reunion go up as the fortunes of the band 's members go down and their egos and wallets long once more for the glory days .

antipodean favourites crowded house , us rockers rage against the machine and van halen and uk indie heroes james and the jesus and mary chain are all planning live comebacks .
genesis - with phil collins but without peter gabriel - have already announced summer dates , while sting is widely expected to bring back the police .
other bands who have buried their various hatchets to return in 2007 include the smashing pumpkins , the sugarcubes , dinosaur jr and my bloody valentine .
according to mark sutherland , london bureau chief of billboard magazine , there is one big reason why many bands get back together .
" it 's called money , " he says .
" essentially that 's what a reunion boils down to .
phil collins said he " missed the camaraderie " of being in a band " in most cases , these people can make more money in their old band than they can doing whatever they 're doing now . "
if the police do make a comeback , it will be " the biggest tour of the summer " , mr sutherland says .
" they will play massive venues to huge amounts of people and genesis have already sold out stadium dates all around the world . "
when genesis announced their plans last year , collins denied being motivated by money .
" we 're all loaded enough not to worry about where the next million or two is coming from , " he said .

they now have the chance to break america after signing a record deal there .

the middlesbrough institute of modern art -lrb- mima -rrb- was proposed following the success of gateshead 's baltic complex .

" feel , think , do " aims to encourage primary six and seven pupils to judge risks and act on gut feeling .
nhs forth valley , which is behind the programme , pointed to nspcc research indicating children did not get enough information on sexual abuse at school .
it is hoped the initiative will eventually go scotland-wide .
the programme , two years in the making , encourages children to talk about personal safety issues , through drama and group work .
understanding emotions a key part involves children picking five adults who they can go to if they need help .
nhs forth valley health promotion officer pamela vannan said children understanding their emotions was an important part of keeping safe .
" discussing how to recognise when they are scared can help them decide whether a situation is safe , or whether they should try to call a stop to it , " she said .
" it 's also essential they know where to seek help and that nothing is too awful or too small that they ca n't tell anyone . "
the programme is to be introduced into stirling and clackmannanshire schools in february , and in falkirk in august .
in june 2006 , 1,820 children responded to an nspcc survey on the issue , with 93 % saying sex education classes at school did not cover information about sexual abuse .

insurance firm swiss re said that the cost of the storms could be as high as £ 2.3bn -lrb- $ 4.5bn ; 3.5bn euros -rrb- .
winter storm kyrill - which hit europe on 18 january , lashing the region with hurricane force winds - led to 47 deaths across europe , 13 in the uk .
the two-day storm caused widespread damage , flooding and power disruptions as far away as the ukraine .
travellers also faced chaos as flights and rail services were cancelled across the uk and europe .
severe weather during the two-day storm , meteorologists said the winds reached severe gale force in britain and were the strongest there since january 1990 .
they hit hurricane force in germany , the worst in nearly a decade .
swiss re added that despite kyrill covering a wider area than the last major storm to hit the area in 1999 , fatalities were limited thanks to advance warnings of severe weather conditions .
the 1999 storm eventually cost the insurance industry 5.5bn euros , swiss re added .

the plan called for better monitoring and co-ordination across regions , as well as action against illegal fishing .
delegates from the world 's five tuna bodies called the plan a first step towards arresting a decline in stocks .
but conservationists said the measures were not enough , blaming illegal and unregulated fishing and unsustainable quotas for tuna 's dramatic decline .
japan called the five-day meeting in the western city of kobe .
the country consumes a quarter of the world 's tuna and a rise in the popularity of japanese food has had a further affect on stocks .
' big step ' the plan , agreed by delegates from 60 countries , recognised " the critical need to arrest further stock decline in the case of depleted stocks -lrb- and -rrb- maintain and rebuild tuna stocks to sustainable levels . "
it called for a coordinated effort to monitor the tuna trade , including tagging fish to assess catch sizes , and broader sharing of information about vessels fishing illegally .
participants also committed to cooperation through regional fisheries management organisations .
" maybe the steps we made this week seem small , but this is a big step , a historical step , i think , " masanori miyahara of japan 's fisheries agency said .
but conservation groups were less positive .
' inaction ' world wildlife fund international said the delegates failed to agree on " concrete action " .
" their only agreement was to gather more data and talk more often , " it said in a statement on its website .
" wwf believes this inaction will result in further depletion of tuna populations , degradation of the oceans , loss of tuna to eat , and ultimately to a loss of livelihoods across the world . "
but david balton , the us deputy assistant secretary of state for oceans and fisheries , said that just having the meeting of the five regulatory bodies was a " very significant development " .
" the true test will come not at this meeting but the way these commitments made here in kobe are actually translated into actions , " he told the french news agency afp .
campaigners have been warning that tuna species face a high risk of what they call " commercial extinction " due to weak management of the industry .
at the start of the meeting , wwf warned that atlantic bluefin tuna stocks were at a dangerously low level .
campaigners also say that the capacity of the world 's tuna fleet is now far greater than required .
the meeting highlighted differences on this issue .
richer countries want to limit fishing capacity while poorer island nations are seeking to expand their fleets .

' big step ' the plan , agreed by delegates from 60 countries , recognised " the critical need to arrest further stock decline in the case of depleted stocks -lrb- and -rrb- maintain and rebuild tuna stocks to sustainable levels . "
bluefin tuna is a delicacy prized in japan 's sushi restaurants it called for a coordinated effort to monitor the tuna trade , including tagging fish to assess catch sizes , and broader sharing of information about vessels fishing illegally .
participants also committed to cooperation through regional fisheries management organisations .
" maybe the steps we made this week seem small , but this is a big step , a historical step , i think , " masanori miyahara of japan 's fisheries agency said .
but conservation groups were less positive .
' inaction ' world wildlife fund international said the delegates failed to agree on " concrete action " .
" their only agreement was to gather more data and talk more often , " it said in a statement on its website .
" wwf believes this inaction will result in further depletion of tuna populations , degradation of the oceans , loss of tuna to eat , and ultimately to a loss of livelihoods across the world . "
but david balton , the us deputy assistant secretary of state for oceans and fisheries , said that just having the meeting of the five regulatory bodies was a " very significant development " .
" the true test will come not at this meeting but the way these commitments made here in kobe are actually translated into actions , " he told the french news agency afp .
campaigners have been warning that tuna species face a high risk of what they call " commercial extinction " due to weak management of the industry .
at the start of the meeting , wwf warned that atlantic bluefin tuna stocks were at a dangerously low level .
campaigners also say that the capacity of the world 's tuna fleet is now far greater than required .
the meeting highlighted differences on this issue .
richer countries want to limit fishing capacity while poorer island nations are seeking to expand their fleets .

at the end of last year a hacker claimed he had defeated the protection on a number of hd-dvd titles , leading to fears the entire system was broken .
but the advanced access content system -lrb- aacs -rrb- licensing authority has said the breach is limited .
" it does not represent an attack on the aacs system itself , " the group said .
the aacs group has admitted that a hacker had managed to decrypt some discs and other people were now able to make copies of certain titles .
i 'm just an upset customer hacker muslix64 the hacker , known as muslix64 , has been able to access the encryption keys which pass between certain discs and the player .
once those keys have been obtained the disc can be stripped of its encryption enabling the digital content to be played on any machine .
a spokesman for the aacs group said the large size of the files and the high cost of writable hi-def discs made widespread copying of the movies impractical .
the attacks on the new format echo the early days of illegal trafficking in music files , aacs spokesman michael ayers said .
security aacs copy protection is used on both hd-dvd and blu-ray titles , giving rise to concern from the entire movie industry about the security of its content .
a large-scale breach of aacs could be a threat to the $ 24bn dvd industry and dent hopes that high-definition discs would invigorate the market .
there are fears that piracy could harm the industry the hacker obtained the keys from " one or more " pieces of software which plays high-definition dvds , said mr ayers .
but the aacs group would not identify them or say whether their aacs licensing would be revoked .
" we certainly have not ruled out any particular response and we will take whatever action is appropriate , " mr ayers said .
in a recent interview with digital media website slyck , hacker muslix64 , said his motivation for defeating the protection system was frustration .
' fair use ' " i 'm just an upset customer .
my efforts can be called ' fair use enforcement ' , " he said .
he said he had grown angry when a hd-dvd movie he had bought would not play on his monitor because it did not have the compliant connector demanded by the movie industry .
as part of the copy protection system on high-definition dvd , content providers can insist that movies will only play correctly if there are hdmi - or in some specific cases , compliant dvi - ports on the player and screen as these two connectors can handle the hdcp copy protection system .

once those keys have been obtained the disc can be stripped of its encryption enabling the digital content to be played on any machine .
a spokesman for the aacs group said the large size of the files and the high cost of writable hi-def discs made widespread copying of the movies impractical .
the attacks on the new format echo the early days of illegal trafficking in music files , aacs spokesman michael ayers said .
security aacs copy protection is used on both hd-dvd and blu-ray titles , giving rise to concern from the entire movie industry about the security of its content .
a large-scale breach of aacs could be a threat to the $ 24bn dvd industry and dent hopes that high-definition discs would invigorate the market .
there are fears that piracy could harm the industry the hacker obtained the keys from " one or more " pieces of software which plays high-definition dvds , said mr ayers .

my efforts can be called ' fair use enforcement ' , " he said .
he said he had grown angry when a hd-dvd movie he had bought would not play on his monitor because it did not have the compliant connector demanded by the movie industry .
as part of the copy protection system on high-definition dvd , content providers can insist that movies will only play correctly if there are hdmi - or in some specific cases , compliant dvi - ports on the player and screen as these two connectors can handle the hdcp copy protection system .
" not being able to play a movie that i have paid for , because some executive in hollywood decided i can not , made me mad , " said the hacker .

rod morgan had previously warned of a crisis as the number of young people under 18 in custody in england and wales reached a record high .
what is the youth justice board ?
the youth justice board is an executive non-departmental public body that oversees the youth justice system in england and wales .
its responsibilities include placing juveniles in secure custodial accommodation .
when will a young person be held in custody ?
young people convicted of a criminal offence will be sentenced to custody if no alternative is thought appropriate because of the serious nature of the offence or history of the defendant .
young people can also be remanded in custody by a magistrates ' court ahead of a trial once they are charged with an offence .
in recent years , a number have been sentenced for breaches of anti-social behaviour orders .
where will a young person be held ?
young people can be held at young offender institutions , secure training centres or secure children 's homes .
young offender institutions accommodate 15 to 21-year-olds on individual sites run by the prison service .
those under 18 are held in separate wings .
secure training centres are purpose-built centres run by private operators under contracts .
there are four stcs , all located in england : oakhill in milton keynes ; hassockfield in county durham ; rainsbrook in rugby , and medway in kent .
they provide a secure environment where young people can be formally educated and rehabilitated .
differences from young offender institutions include the smaller size and a higher staff to offender ratio .
secure children 's homes range in size from six to 40 beds .
they are run by local authority social services departments , overseen by the department of health and the department for education and skills .
they are mainly designed for the accommodation of young offenders aged 12 to 14 , girls up to the age of 16 , and boys aged 15 to 16-year-old who are assessed as vulnerable .
the youth justice board works towards a target that most individuals will be placed within 50 miles of their home addresses .
what custodial sentences can young people face ?
young people face either detention and training orders or custody .
the length of a detention and training order ranges between four months and two years .
the first half of the sentence is spent in custody and the remainder in the community under supervision .
young people found guilty of serious offences may be sentenced by a crown court under section 90 or 91 of the powers of criminal courts -lrb- sentencing -rrb- act -lrb- 2000 -rrb- to a period of custody .
section 90 deals with murder and section 91 deals with crimes including rape and robbery .
the length of the sentence can be up to the adult maximum for the same offence .
if offenders are sentenced to less then four years , they will leave custody at the halfway point of their sentence under supervision .
who decides where young people are held ?
the yjb 's placement team , based at its london headquarters , decides on the most appropriate sites to house under-18s .
the placement team consults youth offending teams based in every local authority in england and wales when making its decision .
yots , which include representatives from the police , probation service , social services , health and education officials , are also involved in the supervision of young offenders on their release .
how many young people are being held in custody ?
according to a youth justice board assessment , about 3,350 youngsters are now in custody .
the figure , which fluctuates daily , includes a small number who were sentenced as juveniles but have recently turned 18 .
yjb figures tracking the number of under 18s held in custody are published every month .
information for september showed 3,036 individuals were in the system .
the figures comprised 2,815 boys and 212 girls .
some 2,537 were being held in young offenders ' institutions , 269 in secure training centres and 230 in secure children 's homes .
of the total , 654 individuals were on remand .
what are some of the alternatives to custody ?
supervision , community punishment or rehabilitation orders are among the alternatives to custody .
conditions can be placed on offenders subject to such orders including tagging and drug treatment .
programmes designed specifically for more serious crimes and prolific offenders are funded and supported by the youth justice board .
the intensive supervision and surveillance programme consists of up to 25 hours of supervision per week .
it can be part of a supervision order , the community part of a custodial sentence or a bail condition .

rod morgan had previously warned of a crisis as the number of young people under 18 in custody in england and wales reached a record high .
what is the youth justice board ?
the youth justice board is an executive non-departmental public body that oversees the youth justice system in england and wales .
its responsibilities include placing juveniles in secure custodial accommodation .
when will a young person be held in custody ?
young people convicted of a criminal offence will be sentenced to custody if no alternative is thought appropriate because of the serious nature of the offence or history of the defendant .
young people can also be remanded in custody by a magistrates ' court ahead of a trial once they are charged with an offence .
in recent years , a number have been sentenced for breaches of anti-social behaviour orders .
where will a young person be held ?
young people can be held at young offender institutions , secure training centres or secure children 's homes .
young offender institutions accommodate 15 to 21-year-olds on individual sites run by the prison service .
those under 18 are held in separate wings .
secure training centres are purpose-built centres run by private operators under contracts .
there are four stcs , all located in england : oakhill in milton keynes ; hassockfield in county durham ; rainsbrook in rugby , and medway in kent .
they provide a secure environment where young people can be formally educated and rehabilitated .
differences from young offender institutions include the smaller size and a higher staff to offender ratio .
secure children 's homes range in size from six to 40 beds .
they are run by local authority social services departments , overseen by the department of health and the department for education and skills .
they are mainly designed for the accommodation of young offenders aged 12 to 14 , girls up to the age of 16 , and boys aged 15 to 16-year-old who are assessed as vulnerable .
the youth justice board works towards a target that most individuals will be placed within 50 miles of their home addresses .
what custodial sentences can young people face ?
young people face either detention and training orders or custody .
the length of a detention and training order ranges between four months and two years .
the first half of the sentence is spent in custody and the remainder in the community under supervision .
young people found guilty of serious offences may be sentenced by a crown court under section 90 or 91 of the powers of criminal courts -lrb- sentencing -rrb- act -lrb- 2000 -rrb- to a period of custody .
section 90 deals with murder and section 91 deals with crimes including rape and robbery .
the length of the sentence can be up to the adult maximum for the same offence .
if offenders are sentenced to less then four years , they will leave custody at the halfway point of their sentence under supervision .
who decides where young people are held ?
the yjb 's placement team , based at its london headquarters , decides on the most appropriate sites to house under-18s .
the placement team consults youth offending teams based in every local authority in england and wales when making its decision .
yots , which include representatives from the police , probation service , social services , health and education officials , are also involved in the supervision of young offenders on their release .
how many young people are being held in custody ?
according to a youth justice board assessment , about 3,350 youngsters are now in custody .
the figure , which fluctuates daily , includes a small number who were sentenced as juveniles but have recently turned 18 .
yjb figures tracking the number of under 18s held in custody are published every month .
information for september showed 3,036 individuals were in the system .
the figures comprised 2,815 boys and 212 girls .
some 2,537 were being held in young offenders ' institutions , 269 in secure training centres and 230 in secure children 's homes .
of the total , 654 individuals were on remand .
what are some of the alternatives to custody ?
supervision , community punishment or rehabilitation orders are among the alternatives to custody .
conditions can be placed on offenders subject to such orders including tagging and drug treatment .
programmes designed specifically for more serious crimes and prolific offenders are funded and supported by the youth justice board .
the intensive supervision and surveillance programme consists of up to 25 hours of supervision per week .
it can be part of a supervision order , the community part of a custodial sentence or a bail condition .
based on a us initiative , intensive fostering is currently being piloted in 10 areas of london and hampshire and staffordshire .
it is for those whose home life is felt to have contributed significantly to their behaviour , and provides care for up to 12 months and support for their family .
