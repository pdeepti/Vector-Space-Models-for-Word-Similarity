bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a border guard depicted in a 1981 book published in east germany " do not hesitate to use your firearm , not even when the border is breached in the company of women and children , which is a tactic the traitors have often used , " it said .
the director of the government office that manages the thousands of stasi files still in existence said the document offered iron-clad evidence that the top echelon of the regime expected that anyone trying to escape to the west should be killed .
" the document is so important because the political leaders of the time continue to deny there was an order to shoot , " marianne birthler told the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung .

its job was to stop escape attempts by guards , who sometimes tried to flee with their families .
it is believed that more than 2,800 east german soldiers crossed the border into the west .
the unit was disbanded in 1985 , four years before the berlin wall fell .
several border guards were tried in the years after the east german government collapsed in 1990 but most received only suspended sentences .
anniversary monday is the 46th anniversary of the start of construction of the berlin wall , which cleaved the city in half and symbolized the cold war until it was toppled amid joyous scenes on november 9 , 1989 .
some 133 people were killed trying to cross it into west berlin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : construction of the famous barrier began on august 13 , 1961 estimates vary , but it is thought that more than 1,000 people lost their lives on the eastern side of the highly fortified border that ran along the entire frontier between the two germanys .

the total length of the berlin wall was 155 kilometers -lrb- about 97 miles -rrb- , of which 43 kilometers ran roughly north-south , cutting the city in two , while another 112 kilometers isolated the enclave of west berlin from the surrounding east german state . article compiled from news reports -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

politicians , however , say the troop deployment must continue in the face of a resurgent taliban . the german military must stay in afghanistan until the taliban has been defeated , the leader of the germany 's conservative christian democratic parliamentary party said in an interview made available saturday .
the german mission was not just about the people in afghanistan but also " about ourselves , " volker kauder told berlin-based weekly tagesspiegel am sonntag in a statement to be published sunday .
those asking for a withdrawal of german troops " seriously threaten our security , " kauder said .
the taliban were closely following current discussions in germany and drawing new courage from them , he added .
" but if we say clearly : we 'll stay until the taliban have been defeated , it will weaken their position .
the people in afghanistan also have to be reassured that they can rely on us , " kauder said .
support falling support has plunged in the german population for the country 's military presence in afghanistan , where more than 3,000 german troops and other personnel are helping the nato mission to combat the taliban insurgents .
an extension to the mandates for german forces to be in afghanistan must be renewed parliament by oct .
12 .
an opinion poll conducted after two german engineers were taken hostage showed heightened disapproval of germany 's participation in the nato-led mission .
support for the country 's continued military presence in afghanistan dropped 11 percentage points to 33 percent within the last two months , according to the infratest survey for ard television conducted on july 30-31 .
the number of germans calling for a withdrawal jumped 10 points to 64 percent , the poll of 1,000 german adults showed .
the mood has helped the new left party lead by politician oskar lafontaine , who has called for the withdrawal of all 7,700 german troops serving in foreign missions .
the far-left party 's position is attracting some disgruntled social democrats , unhappy with their party 's more centrist stance .
call for an international increase despite the falling public support , a former social democratic minister , egon bahr , has called for an increase of the international forces in afghanistan from their current 40,000 to " no less than 200,000 men . "
the troops should not stay for one year only , " but for five or ten years , " bahr told the sunday paper welt am sonntag .
the german military should also send more troops , bahr said , although exact numbers had to be decided on after a detailed nato analysis of the situation .
bahr was the brain behind germany 's ostpolitik -lrb- policy aimed at improving relations with east germany , poland , and the soviet union -rrb- in chancellor willy brandt 's social-liberal government coalition during the late 1960s and early 70s .
german forces are not on the front line of combat in afghanistan , but are based in the kunduz province in the relatively quiet northern part of the country .
still , suicide bombers in may killed three german soldiers who were on foot patrol .
while nato would like german troops to join dutch , british and canadian soldiers fighting a resurgent taliban in the south , chancellor angela merkel has refused to authorize such a deployment , saying germany is doing its part in the north .
fate uncertain the fate of the german engineer kidnapped in afghanistan three and a half weeks ago , meanwhile , remained uncertain on saturday .

an engineer identified in german media reports as rudolf b. , 62 , was abducted together with a colleague on july 18 - one day before the group of south koreans .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a border guard depicted in a 1981 book published in east germany " do not hesitate to use your firearm , not even when the border is breached in the company of women and children , which is a tactic the traitors have often used , " it said .
the director of the government office that manages the thousands of stasi files still in existence said the document offered iron-clad evidence that the top echelon of the regime expected that anyone trying to escape to the west should be killed .
" the document is so important because the political leaders of the time continue to deny there was an order to shoot , " marianne birthler told the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wall cut berlin in two the orders were issued to a special stasi unit which was posted alongside regular east german border guards in the magdeburg region .
its job was to stop escape attempts by guards , who sometimes tried to flee with their families .
it is believed that more than 2,800 east german soldiers crossed the border into the west .
the unit was disbanded in 1985 , four years before the berlin wall fell .
several border guards were tried in the years after the east german government collapsed in 1990 but most received only suspended sentences .
anniversary monday is the 46th anniversary of the start of construction of the berlin wall , which cleaved the city in half and symbolized the cold war until it was toppled amid joyous scenes on november 9 , 1989 .
some 133 people were killed trying to cross it into west berlin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : construction of the famous barrier began on august 13 , 1961 estimates vary , but it is thought that more than 1,000 people lost their lives on the eastern side of the highly fortified border that ran along the entire frontier between the two germanys .
" on the eve of the anniversary of the construction of the wall , it is a lesson to all of those who want to let the barbarity of the communist regime be consigned to the annals of history , " ronald pofalla , general secretary of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic party , told berlin 's bz newspaper .
the total length of the berlin wall was 155 kilometers -lrb- about 97 miles -rrb- , of which 43 kilometers ran roughly north-south , cutting the city in two , while another 112 kilometers isolated the enclave of west berlin from the surrounding east german state . article compiled from news reports -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

politicians , however , say the troop deployment must continue in the face of a resurgent taliban . the german military must stay in afghanistan until the taliban has been defeated , the leader of the germany 's conservative christian democratic parliamentary party said in an interview made available saturday .
the german mission was not just about the people in afghanistan but also " about ourselves , " volker kauder told berlin-based weekly tagesspiegel am sonntag in a statement to be published sunday .
those asking for a withdrawal of german troops " seriously threaten our security , " kauder said .
the taliban were closely following current discussions in germany and drawing new courage from them , he added .
" but if we say clearly : we 'll stay until the taliban have been defeated , it will weaken their position .
the people in afghanistan also have to be reassured that they can rely on us , " kauder said .
support falling support has plunged in the german population for the country 's military presence in afghanistan , where more than 3,000 german troops and other personnel are helping the nato mission to combat the taliban insurgents .

an opinion poll conducted after two german engineers were taken hostage showed heightened disapproval of germany 's participation in the nato-led mission .
support for the country 's continued military presence in afghanistan dropped 11 percentage points to 33 percent within the last two months , according to the infratest survey for ard television conducted on july 30-31 .
the number of germans calling for a withdrawal jumped 10 points to 64 percent , the poll of 1,000 german adults showed .
the mood has helped the new left party lead by politician oskar lafontaine , who has called for the withdrawal of all 7,700 german troops serving in foreign missions .
the far-left party 's position is attracting some disgruntled social democrats , unhappy with their party 's more centrist stance .
call for an international increase despite the falling public support , a former social democratic minister , egon bahr , has called for an increase of the international forces in afghanistan from their current 40,000 to " no less than 200,000 men . "
the troops should not stay for one year only , " but for five or ten years , " bahr told the sunday paper welt am sonntag .
the german military should also send more troops , bahr said , although exact numbers had to be decided on after a detailed nato analysis of the situation .
bahr was the brain behind germany 's ostpolitik -lrb- policy aimed at improving relations with east germany , poland , and the soviet union -rrb- in chancellor willy brandt 's social-liberal government coalition during the late 1960s and early 70s .
german forces are not on the front line of combat in afghanistan , but are based in the kunduz province in the relatively quiet northern part of the country .

while nato would like german troops to join dutch , british and canadian soldiers fighting a resurgent taliban in the south , chancellor angela merkel has refused to authorize such a deployment , saying germany is doing its part in the north .

the mediterranean island of mallorca has come to symbolize everything bad about cheap , mass tourism : crowded beaches full of drunken louts and cheapskates .
bulgaria 's black sea coast wants to avoid the same fate . bulgarian vacation spots along the black sea are in a quandary .
they are drawn to the short-term money mass tourism brings , but do n't want to make the same mistakes as the spanish . yet without a significant change in direction , that seems to be the way the country 's coastline is headed . investors have built gigantic hotel complexes , significantly increasing the number of beds along the black sea coast .
this has caused a price war .
a night in a holiday apartment costs on average 25 euros -lrb- $ 34.50 -rrb- while a night in a single room can be as little as 2 euros .
hotels without a water view sit nearly empty .
too little infrastructure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tourist ghettos on bulgaria 's gold coast empty beds are only one of the bulgarian tourism industry 's problems .
during the recent building spree , the accompanying infrastructure never materialized , said marin neschkow , head of the tourism board and a tourism expert at the university in varna , the largest city on bulgaria 's black sea coast .
businesses have invested millions of euros to build beautiful hotel grounds , bars and other amenities .
but the corresponding transportation and communication networks are lacking .
there 's also insufficient water supply and sewage treatment , neschkow said .
hotels are built so quickly that skilled workers can not be trained quickly enough .
their apprenticeships take several years .
but the problem , according to neschkow is not the dearth of places in bulgarian training programs , it 's the fact that many students no longer stick around in the summers to work in the bulgarian tourism industry .
instead , they go abroad . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not much elbow room on many of europe 's most popular beaches " tourism pays the lowest average wage in bulgaria .
it is not logical , when one thinks about it , that international tourism amounts to 14 percent of the country 's gross national product , " neschkow said .
tourism provides two billion euros each year , approximately half of bulgaria 's trade deficit .
responsible tourism ?
the tourism industry represents the biggest hope for an economic boom in bulgaria .
the number of tourists continues to rise and bulgaria has managed to build modern hotels , which provide quality similar to that guests would expect to find in central europe .
that contrasts with nearby romania , neschkow said .
but bulgaria needs to be careful not to rely solely on black sea mass tourism , neschkow said .
in the long term , the country will need to increase not only the overall revenue from tourism but also how much each tourist spends .
it seems the bulgarian government is considering a change in its tourism strategy . bildunterschrift : there 's still hope for bulgaria " we 're trying to market bulgaria as a year-round tourism destination , " said stanislaw nowakow of the state tourism agency .

the mediterranean island of mallorca has come to symbolize everything bad about cheap , mass tourism : crowded beaches full of drunken louts and cheapskates .
bulgaria 's black sea coast wants to avoid the same fate . bulgarian vacation spots along the black sea are in a quandary .
they are drawn to the short-term money mass tourism brings , but do n't want to make the same mistakes as the spanish . yet without a significant change in direction , that seems to be the way the country 's coastline is headed . investors have built gigantic hotel complexes , significantly increasing the number of beds along the black sea coast .
this has caused a price war .
a night in a holiday apartment costs on average 25 euros -lrb- $ 34.50 -rrb- while a night in a single room can be as little as 2 euros .
hotels without a water view sit nearly empty .
too little infrastructure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tourist ghettos on bulgaria 's gold coast empty beds are only one of the bulgarian tourism industry 's problems .
during the recent building spree , the accompanying infrastructure never materialized , said marin neschkow , head of the tourism board and a tourism expert at the university in varna , the largest city on bulgaria 's black sea coast .
businesses have invested millions of euros to build beautiful hotel grounds , bars and other amenities .
but the corresponding transportation and communication networks are lacking .
there 's also insufficient water supply and sewage treatment , neschkow said .
hotels are built so quickly that skilled workers can not be trained quickly enough .
their apprenticeships take several years .
but the problem , according to neschkow is not the dearth of places in bulgarian training programs , it 's the fact that many students no longer stick around in the summers to work in the bulgarian tourism industry .
instead , they go abroad . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not much elbow room on many of europe 's most popular beaches " tourism pays the lowest average wage in bulgaria .
it is not logical , when one thinks about it , that international tourism amounts to 14 percent of the country 's gross national product , " neschkow said .
tourism provides two billion euros each year , approximately half of bulgaria 's trade deficit .
responsible tourism ?
the tourism industry represents the biggest hope for an economic boom in bulgaria .
the number of tourists continues to rise and bulgaria has managed to build modern hotels , which provide quality similar to that guests would expect to find in central europe .
that contrasts with nearby romania , neschkow said .
but bulgaria needs to be careful not to rely solely on black sea mass tourism , neschkow said .
in the long term , the country will need to increase not only the overall revenue from tourism but also how much each tourist spends .

politicians , however , say the troop deployment must continue in the face of a resurgent taliban . the german military must stay in afghanistan until the taliban has been defeated , the leader of the germany 's conservative christian democratic parliamentary party said in an interview made available saturday .
the german mission was not just about the people in afghanistan but also " about ourselves , " volker kauder told berlin-based weekly tagesspiegel am sonntag in a statement to be published sunday .
those asking for a withdrawal of german troops " seriously threaten our security , " kauder said .
the taliban were closely following current discussions in germany and drawing new courage from them , he added .
" but if we say clearly : we 'll stay until the taliban have been defeated , it will weaken their position .
the people in afghanistan also have to be reassured that they can rely on us , " kauder said .
support falling support has plunged in the german population for the country 's military presence in afghanistan , where more than 3,000 german troops and other personnel are helping the nato mission to combat the taliban insurgents .
an extension to the mandates for german forces to be in afghanistan must be renewed parliament by oct .
12 .
an opinion poll conducted after two german engineers were taken hostage showed heightened disapproval of germany 's participation in the nato-led mission .
support for the country 's continued military presence in afghanistan dropped 11 percentage points to 33 percent within the last two months , according to the infratest survey for ard television conducted on july 30-31 .
the number of germans calling for a withdrawal jumped 10 points to 64 percent , the poll of 1,000 german adults showed .
the mood has helped the new left party lead by politician oskar lafontaine , who has called for the withdrawal of all 7,700 german troops serving in foreign missions .
the far-left party 's position is attracting some disgruntled social democrats , unhappy with their party 's more centrist stance .
call for an international increase despite the falling public support , a former social democratic minister , egon bahr , has called for an increase of the international forces in afghanistan from their current 40,000 to " no less than 200,000 men . "
the troops should not stay for one year only , " but for five or ten years , " bahr told the sunday paper welt am sonntag .
the german military should also send more troops , bahr said , although exact numbers had to be decided on after a detailed nato analysis of the situation .
bahr was the brain behind germany 's ostpolitik -lrb- policy aimed at improving relations with east germany , poland , and the soviet union -rrb- in chancellor willy brandt 's social-liberal government coalition during the late 1960s and early 70s .
german forces are not on the front line of combat in afghanistan , but are based in the kunduz province in the relatively quiet northern part of the country .
still , suicide bombers in may killed three german soldiers who were on foot patrol .
while nato would like german troops to join dutch , british and canadian soldiers fighting a resurgent taliban in the south , chancellor angela merkel has refused to authorize such a deployment , saying germany is doing its part in the north .
fate uncertain the fate of the german engineer kidnapped in afghanistan three and a half weeks ago , meanwhile , remained uncertain on saturday .
" the crisis staff is working around the clock to free the german hostage , " a spokeswoman for the foreign ministry said in berlin without giving any further details .
an engineer identified in german media reports as rudolf b. , 62 , was abducted together with a colleague on july 18 - one day before the group of south koreans .
the colleague , 44-year-old rüdiger d. from the state of mecklenburg-western pomerania , was killed by his kidnappers .
according to the post-mortem report , he was shot dead after collapsing from a dizzy spell . article compiled from news reports -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he was one of the first west german film historians to write about film policy during the nazi regime .
dw-world.de : your book " national socialist film policy " appeared in 1969 .
why was it so long after the war before anyone tackled the topic ?
gerd albrecht : in 1945 , the allies banned the showing of films made during the nazi era .
they also confiscated important documents .
harmless films were soon released to the public , but in the 1950s they still had some 250 politically dubious films under lock and key .
the western allies only relinquished their privileges as an occupation force in 1955 .
the german government , which had inherited the nationalized german film industry , was quick to attend to the business of ensuring the industry 's survival .
the assignment to research national socialist film policy was commissioned in 1959 .
it only became clear over time that the propagandistic aims that found expression in some 1,100 films needed to be examined more carefully .
my research took 10 years despite substantial support from the german government because both the documents and the films were widely scattered .
what characterized nazi film policy ?
was it largely shaped by propaganda minister goebbels ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joseph goebbels was in charge of film policy in the third reich the first and foremost aim of national socialist films was to entertain .
they were intended to be escapist and offer reassurance in the face of everyday hardships .
the further that these films were removed from reality , the better they functioned in national socialist terms .
almost all references to political life and the everyday life of the viewers were missing .
any critical reference to contemporary reality was forbidden .
only a fraction of the films had direct propagandistic aims .
in these , national socialist ideology was presented as an ideal and impressively staged .
goebbels initially wanted 50 percent of the entire film output to be propaganda , but in the end , only 15 percent were .
in accordance with the beloved slogan of the time " ein volk — ein reich — ein führer " -lrb- one people — one empire — one leader -rrb- the propaganda films emphasize either the superiority of the " aryan race " -lrb- " wunschkonzert , " 1940 -rrb- , the superiority of the german reich over its enemies -lrb- " kadetten , " 1941 -rrb- or , of course , the superiority of the " greatest generals of all time " -lrb- " der grosse könig , " 1942 -rrb- .
goebbels decisively shaped contemporary film production .
he could almost always be sure he had the backing of adolf hitler .
both of them were not only enthusiastic film viewers , but they also had a firm grasp of this medium .
goebbels watched the majority of feature films before they were premiered .
he made changes in many cases .
according to your research , less than 15 percent of films produced under the nazis were war and propaganda films .
who went to see what ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : famous stars like zarah leander lured people to the cinemas the small group of propaganda films was , on average , seen by many more people than the apolitical films were .
these films were in more cinemas because of tax breaks and political pressure .
secondly , viewers liked going to see these films .
they were better made and were cast with more prominent actors .
since you could also be sure to encounter nazi propaganda , people would learn what they should say about political issues in general .
as a result , box office figures for these films were , on average , 50 percent higher than the proportion of film production given over to them .
they accounted for one in four or one in five cinema visits .
during the war years , in particular , they reached 15 to 25 million paying viewers .
were there nazi directors and nazi actors ?
would people like leni riefenstahl and zarah leander have become well known without the nazis ?
of course , some of the directors and actors were national socialists , along with other film people .
as in the population at large , some were passionate nazis , the others more half-hearted .
some were opportunists and while some were critical , they did n't voice criticism openly .
people like leni riefenstahl , zarah leander and veit harlan would have become famous in the industry without the nazis .
but in the case of karl ritter it 's questionable whether he would have been able to shoot his 14 films considering how wooden they were .
what happened to the directors and actors who worked for hitler after the war ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the director of a virulently anti-semitic film was acquitted and able to resume work the directors and actors who worked during the third reich on behalf of the regime were quickly able to resume their work after the war although there were differences between east and west germany .
while allied-german de-nazification courts did impose professional bans of various lengths and , in some cases , financial penalties , it was n't long before filmmakers were back behind the camera — veit harlan was the only one to appear before a proper court on charges of crimes against humanity in " jud süss " -lrb- the jew süss -rrb- in 1940 .
he was acquitted both times – under the jurisdiction of the occupying forces .
it was ruled that " jud süss " did represent a crime against humanity , but it was found that he was acting under pressure .
in 1950 he was able to resume filming in germany .
how do you see the current discussion surrounding tom cruise 's controversial film valkyrie ?
i hope the film " valkyrie " will be good and provide a worthy memorial to the german resistance and not only the officers .
tom cruise will hopefully contribute to the success of the film .
given his previous performances , he is obviously up to the role of playing stauffenberg , but we should n't forget the significance of the scriptwriter and director .
the fact that cruise is a scientologist is a personal matter for him , just as it is my personal business that i reject scientology .
the film and those who go to see it will neither be harmed nor will it profit from the fact that cruise is a scientologist .
for that reason , i think the current debate around his scientology membership to be superfluous and wrong .
besides , the nazis quickly realized that what was important about filmmakers was not their beliefs , but their talent and reliability .

while allied-german de-nazification courts did impose professional bans of various lengths and , in some cases , financial penalties , it was n't long before filmmakers were back behind the camera — veit harlan was the only one to appear before a proper court on charges of crimes against humanity in " jud süss " -lrb- the jew süss -rrb- in 1940 .
he was acquitted both times – under the jurisdiction of the occupying forces .
it was ruled that " jud süss " did represent a crime against humanity , but it was found that he was acting under pressure .
in 1950 he was able to resume filming in germany .
how do you see the current discussion surrounding tom cruise 's controversial film valkyrie ?
i hope the film " valkyrie " will be good and provide a worthy memorial to the german resistance and not only the officers .
tom cruise will hopefully contribute to the success of the film .
given his previous performances , he is obviously up to the role of playing stauffenberg , but we should n't forget the significance of the scriptwriter and director .
the fact that cruise is a scientologist is a personal matter for him , just as it is my personal business that i reject scientology .
the film and those who go to see it will neither be harmed nor will it profit from the fact that cruise is a scientologist .
for that reason , i think the current debate around his scientology membership to be superfluous and wrong .
besides , the nazis quickly realized that what was important about filmmakers was not their beliefs , but their talent and reliability .

he was one of the first west german film historians to write about film policy during the nazi regime .
dw-world.de : your book " national socialist film policy " appeared in 1969 .
why was it so long after the war before anyone tackled the topic ?
gerd albrecht : in 1945 , the allies banned the showing of films made during the nazi era .
they also confiscated important documents .
harmless films were soon released to the public , but in the 1950s they still had some 250 politically dubious films under lock and key .
the western allies only relinquished their privileges as an occupation force in 1955 .
the german government , which had inherited the nationalized german film industry , was quick to attend to the business of ensuring the industry 's survival .
the assignment to research national socialist film policy was commissioned in 1959 .
it only became clear over time that the propagandistic aims that found expression in some 1,100 films needed to be examined more carefully .
my research took 10 years despite substantial support from the german government because both the documents and the films were widely scattered .
what characterized nazi film policy ?
was it largely shaped by propaganda minister goebbels ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joseph goebbels was in charge of film policy in the third reich the first and foremost aim of national socialist films was to entertain .
they were intended to be escapist and offer reassurance in the face of everyday hardships .
the further that these films were removed from reality , the better they functioned in national socialist terms .
almost all references to political life and the everyday life of the viewers were missing .
any critical reference to contemporary reality was forbidden .
only a fraction of the films had direct propagandistic aims .
in these , national socialist ideology was presented as an ideal and impressively staged .
goebbels initially wanted 50 percent of the entire film output to be propaganda , but in the end , only 15 percent were .
in accordance with the beloved slogan of the time " ein volk — ein reich — ein führer " -lrb- one people — one empire — one leader -rrb- the propaganda films emphasize either the superiority of the " aryan race " -lrb- " wunschkonzert , " 1940 -rrb- , the superiority of the german reich over its enemies -lrb- " kadetten , " 1941 -rrb- or , of course , the superiority of the " greatest generals of all time " -lrb- " der grosse könig , " 1942 -rrb- .
goebbels decisively shaped contemporary film production .
he could almost always be sure he had the backing of adolf hitler .
both of them were not only enthusiastic film viewers , but they also had a firm grasp of this medium .
goebbels watched the majority of feature films before they were premiered .
he made changes in many cases .
according to your research , less than 15 percent of films produced under the nazis were war and propaganda films .
who went to see what ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : famous stars like zarah leander lured people to the cinemas the small group of propaganda films was , on average , seen by many more people than the apolitical films were .
these films were in more cinemas because of tax breaks and political pressure .
secondly , viewers liked going to see these films .
they were better made and were cast with more prominent actors .
since you could also be sure to encounter nazi propaganda , people would learn what they should say about political issues in general .
as a result , box office figures for these films were , on average , 50 percent higher than the proportion of film production given over to them .
they accounted for one in four or one in five cinema visits .
during the war years , in particular , they reached 15 to 25 million paying viewers .
were there nazi directors and nazi actors ?
would people like leni riefenstahl and zarah leander have become well known without the nazis ?
of course , some of the directors and actors were national socialists , along with other film people .
as in the population at large , some were passionate nazis , the others more half-hearted .
some were opportunists and while some were critical , they did n't voice criticism openly .
people like leni riefenstahl , zarah leander and veit harlan would have become famous in the industry without the nazis .
but in the case of karl ritter it 's questionable whether he would have been able to shoot his 14 films considering how wooden they were .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the director of a virulently anti-semitic film was acquitted and able to resume work the directors and actors who worked during the third reich on behalf of the regime were quickly able to resume their work after the war although there were differences between east and west germany .

politicians , however , say the troop deployment must continue in the face of a resurgent taliban . the german military must stay in afghanistan until the taliban has been defeated , the leader of the germany 's conservative christian democratic parliamentary party said in an interview made available saturday .
the german mission was not just about the people in afghanistan but also " about ourselves , " volker kauder told berlin-based weekly tagesspiegel am sonntag in a statement to be published sunday .
those asking for a withdrawal of german troops " seriously threaten our security , " kauder said .
the taliban were closely following current discussions in germany and drawing new courage from them , he added .
" but if we say clearly : we 'll stay until the taliban have been defeated , it will weaken their position .
the people in afghanistan also have to be reassured that they can rely on us , " kauder said .
support falling support has plunged in the german population for the country 's military presence in afghanistan , where more than 3,000 german troops and other personnel are helping the nato mission to combat the taliban insurgents .

an opinion poll conducted after two german engineers were taken hostage showed heightened disapproval of germany 's participation in the nato-led mission .
support for the country 's continued military presence in afghanistan dropped 11 percentage points to 33 percent within the last two months , according to the infratest survey for ard television conducted on july 30-31 .
the number of germans calling for a withdrawal jumped 10 points to 64 percent , the poll of 1,000 german adults showed .
the mood has helped the new left party lead by politician oskar lafontaine , who has called for the withdrawal of all 7,700 german troops serving in foreign missions .
the far-left party 's position is attracting some disgruntled social democrats , unhappy with their party 's more centrist stance .
call for an international increase despite the falling public support , a former social democratic minister , egon bahr , has called for an increase of the international forces in afghanistan from their current 40,000 to " no less than 200,000 men . "
the troops should not stay for one year only , " but for five or ten years , " bahr told the sunday paper welt am sonntag .
the german military should also send more troops , bahr said , although exact numbers had to be decided on after a detailed nato analysis of the situation .
bahr was the brain behind germany 's ostpolitik -lrb- policy aimed at improving relations with east germany , poland , and the soviet union -rrb- in chancellor willy brandt 's social-liberal government coalition during the late 1960s and early 70s .
german forces are not on the front line of combat in afghanistan , but are based in the kunduz province in the relatively quiet northern part of the country .

while nato would like german troops to join dutch , british and canadian soldiers fighting a resurgent taliban in the south , chancellor angela merkel has refused to authorize such a deployment , saying germany is doing its part in the north .

politicians , however , say the troop deployment must continue in the face of a resurgent taliban . the german military must stay in afghanistan until the taliban has been defeated , the leader of the germany 's conservative christian democratic parliamentary party said in an interview made available saturday .
the german mission was not just about the people in afghanistan but also " about ourselves , " volker kauder told berlin-based weekly tagesspiegel am sonntag in a statement to be published sunday .
those asking for a withdrawal of german troops " seriously threaten our security , " kauder said .
the taliban were closely following current discussions in germany and drawing new courage from them , he added .
" but if we say clearly : we 'll stay until the taliban have been defeated , it will weaken their position .
the people in afghanistan also have to be reassured that they can rely on us , " kauder said .
support falling support has plunged in the german population for the country 's military presence in afghanistan , where more than 3,000 german troops and other personnel are helping the nato mission to combat the taliban insurgents .
an extension to the mandates for german forces to be in afghanistan must be renewed parliament by oct .
12 .
an opinion poll conducted after two german engineers were taken hostage showed heightened disapproval of germany 's participation in the nato-led mission .
support for the country 's continued military presence in afghanistan dropped 11 percentage points to 33 percent within the last two months , according to the infratest survey for ard television conducted on july 30-31 .
the number of germans calling for a withdrawal jumped 10 points to 64 percent , the poll of 1,000 german adults showed .
the mood has helped the new left party lead by politician oskar lafontaine , who has called for the withdrawal of all 7,700 german troops serving in foreign missions .
the far-left party 's position is attracting some disgruntled social democrats , unhappy with their party 's more centrist stance .
call for an international increase despite the falling public support , a former social democratic minister , egon bahr , has called for an increase of the international forces in afghanistan from their current 40,000 to " no less than 200,000 men . "
the troops should not stay for one year only , " but for five or ten years , " bahr told the sunday paper welt am sonntag .
the german military should also send more troops , bahr said , although exact numbers had to be decided on after a detailed nato analysis of the situation .
bahr was the brain behind germany 's ostpolitik -lrb- policy aimed at improving relations with east germany , poland , and the soviet union -rrb- in chancellor willy brandt 's social-liberal government coalition during the late 1960s and early 70s .
german forces are not on the front line of combat in afghanistan , but are based in the kunduz province in the relatively quiet northern part of the country .
still , suicide bombers in may killed three german soldiers who were on foot patrol .
while nato would like german troops to join dutch , british and canadian soldiers fighting a resurgent taliban in the south , chancellor angela merkel has refused to authorize such a deployment , saying germany is doing its part in the north .
fate uncertain the fate of the german engineer kidnapped in afghanistan three and a half weeks ago , meanwhile , remained uncertain on saturday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de film -pipe- 12.08.2007 german expert on nazi films and propaganda großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leni riefenstahl used her considerable talents to make films for the nazis dw-world.de spoke film expert gerd albrecht about movies in the third reich and the fate of party-loyal filmmakers after world war ii . gerd albrecht has been studying film and cinema since the early 1950s .
he was one of the first west german film historians to write about film policy during the nazi regime .
dw-world.de : your book " national socialist film policy " appeared in 1969 .
why was it so long after the war before anyone tackled the topic ?
gerd albrecht : in 1945 , the allies banned the showing of films made during the nazi era .
they also confiscated important documents .
harmless films were soon released to the public , but in the 1950s they still had some 250 politically dubious films under lock and key .
the western allies only relinquished their privileges as an occupation force in 1955 .
the german government , which had inherited the nationalized german film industry , was quick to attend to the business of ensuring the industry 's survival .
the assignment to research national socialist film policy was commissioned in 1959 .
it only became clear over time that the propagandistic aims that found expression in some 1,100 films needed to be examined more carefully .
my research took 10 years despite substantial support from the german government because both the documents and the films were widely scattered .
what characterized nazi film policy ?
was it largely shaped by propaganda minister goebbels ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joseph goebbels was in charge of film policy in the third reich the first and foremost aim of national socialist films was to entertain .
they were intended to be escapist and offer reassurance in the face of everyday hardships .
the further that these films were removed from reality , the better they functioned in national socialist terms .
almost all references to political life and the everyday life of the viewers were missing .
any critical reference to contemporary reality was forbidden .
only a fraction of the films had direct propagandistic aims .
in these , national socialist ideology was presented as an ideal and impressively staged .
goebbels initially wanted 50 percent of the entire film output to be propaganda , but in the end , only 15 percent were .
in accordance with the beloved slogan of the time " ein volk — ein reich — ein führer " -lrb- one people — one empire — one leader -rrb- the propaganda films emphasize either the superiority of the " aryan race " -lrb- " wunschkonzert , " 1940 -rrb- , the superiority of the german reich over its enemies -lrb- " kadetten , " 1941 -rrb- or , of course , the superiority of the " greatest generals of all time " -lrb- " der grosse könig , " 1942 -rrb- .
goebbels decisively shaped contemporary film production .
he could almost always be sure he had the backing of adolf hitler .
both of them were not only enthusiastic film viewers , but they also had a firm grasp of this medium .
goebbels watched the majority of feature films before they were premiered .
he made changes in many cases .
according to your research , less than 15 percent of films produced under the nazis were war and propaganda films .
who went to see what ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : famous stars like zarah leander lured people to the cinemas the small group of propaganda films was , on average , seen by many more people than the apolitical films were .
these films were in more cinemas because of tax breaks and political pressure .
secondly , viewers liked going to see these films .
they were better made and were cast with more prominent actors .
since you could also be sure to encounter nazi propaganda , people would learn what they should say about political issues in general .
as a result , box office figures for these films were , on average , 50 percent higher than the proportion of film production given over to them .
they accounted for one in four or one in five cinema visits .
during the war years , in particular , they reached 15 to 25 million paying viewers .
were there nazi directors and nazi actors ?
would people like leni riefenstahl and zarah leander have become well known without the nazis ?
of course , some of the directors and actors were national socialists , along with other film people .
as in the population at large , some were passionate nazis , the others more half-hearted .
some were opportunists and while some were critical , they did n't voice criticism openly .
people like leni riefenstahl , zarah leander and veit harlan would have become famous in the industry without the nazis .
but in the case of karl ritter it 's questionable whether he would have been able to shoot his 14 films considering how wooden they were .
what happened to the directors and actors who worked for hitler after the war ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the director of a virulently anti-semitic film was acquitted and able to resume work the directors and actors who worked during the third reich on behalf of the regime were quickly able to resume their work after the war although there were differences between east and west germany .
while allied-german de-nazification courts did impose professional bans of various lengths and , in some cases , financial penalties , it was n't long before filmmakers were back behind the camera — veit harlan was the only one to appear before a proper court on charges of crimes against humanity in " jud süss " -lrb- the jew süss -rrb- in 1940 .
he was acquitted both times – under the jurisdiction of the occupying forces .
it was ruled that " jud süss " did represent a crime against humanity , but it was found that he was acting under pressure .
in 1950 he was able to resume filming in germany .
how do you see the current discussion surrounding tom cruise 's controversial film valkyrie ?
i hope the film " valkyrie " will be good and provide a worthy memorial to the german resistance and not only the officers .
tom cruise will hopefully contribute to the success of the film .
given his previous performances , he is obviously up to the role of playing stauffenberg , but we should n't forget the significance of the scriptwriter and director .
the fact that cruise is a scientologist is a personal matter for him , just as it is my personal business that i reject scientology .
the film and those who go to see it will neither be harmed nor will it profit from the fact that cruise is a scientologist .
for that reason , i think the current debate around his scientology membership to be superfluous and wrong .
besides , the nazis quickly realized that what was important about filmmakers was not their beliefs , but their talent and reliability .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a border guard depicted in a 1981 book published in east germany " do not hesitate to use your firearm , not even when the border is breached in the company of women and children , which is a tactic the traitors have often used , " it said .
the director of the government office that manages the thousands of stasi files still in existence said the document offered iron-clad evidence that the top echelon of the regime expected that anyone trying to escape to the west should be killed .
" the document is so important because the political leaders of the time continue to deny there was an order to shoot , " marianne birthler told the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wall cut berlin in two the orders were issued to a special stasi unit which was posted alongside regular east german border guards in the magdeburg region .
its job was to stop escape attempts by guards , who sometimes tried to flee with their families .
it is believed that more than 2,800 east german soldiers crossed the border into the west .
the unit was disbanded in 1985 , four years before the berlin wall fell .
several border guards were tried in the years after the east german government collapsed in 1990 but most received only suspended sentences .
anniversary monday is the 46th anniversary of the start of construction of the berlin wall , which cleaved the city in half and symbolized the cold war until it was toppled amid joyous scenes on november 9 , 1989 .
some 133 people were killed trying to cross it into west berlin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : construction of the famous barrier began on august 13 , 1961 estimates vary , but it is thought that more than 1,000 people lost their lives on the eastern side of the highly fortified border that ran along the entire frontier between the two germanys .
" on the eve of the anniversary of the construction of the wall , it is a lesson to all of those who want to let the barbarity of the communist regime be consigned to the annals of history , " ronald pofalla , general secretary of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic party , told berlin 's bz newspaper .
the total length of the berlin wall was 155 kilometers -lrb- about 97 miles -rrb- , of which 43 kilometers ran roughly north-south , cutting the city in two , while another 112 kilometers isolated the enclave of west berlin from the surrounding east german state . article compiled from news reports -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the mediterranean island of mallorca has come to symbolize everything bad about cheap , mass tourism : crowded beaches full of drunken louts and cheapskates .
bulgaria 's black sea coast wants to avoid the same fate . bulgarian vacation spots along the black sea are in a quandary .
they are drawn to the short-term money mass tourism brings , but do n't want to make the same mistakes as the spanish . yet without a significant change in direction , that seems to be the way the country 's coastline is headed . investors have built gigantic hotel complexes , significantly increasing the number of beds along the black sea coast .
this has caused a price war .
a night in a holiday apartment costs on average 25 euros -lrb- $ 34.50 -rrb- while a night in a single room can be as little as 2 euros .
hotels without a water view sit nearly empty .
too little infrastructure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tourist ghettos on bulgaria 's gold coast empty beds are only one of the bulgarian tourism industry 's problems .
during the recent building spree , the accompanying infrastructure never materialized , said marin neschkow , head of the tourism board and a tourism expert at the university in varna , the largest city on bulgaria 's black sea coast .
businesses have invested millions of euros to build beautiful hotel grounds , bars and other amenities .
but the corresponding transportation and communication networks are lacking .
there 's also insufficient water supply and sewage treatment , neschkow said .
hotels are built so quickly that skilled workers can not be trained quickly enough .
their apprenticeships take several years .
but the problem , according to neschkow is not the dearth of places in bulgarian training programs , it 's the fact that many students no longer stick around in the summers to work in the bulgarian tourism industry .
instead , they go abroad . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not much elbow room on many of europe 's most popular beaches " tourism pays the lowest average wage in bulgaria .
it is not logical , when one thinks about it , that international tourism amounts to 14 percent of the country 's gross national product , " neschkow said .
tourism provides two billion euros each year , approximately half of bulgaria 's trade deficit .
responsible tourism ?
the tourism industry represents the biggest hope for an economic boom in bulgaria .
the number of tourists continues to rise and bulgaria has managed to build modern hotels , which provide quality similar to that guests would expect to find in central europe .
that contrasts with nearby romania , neschkow said .
but bulgaria needs to be careful not to rely solely on black sea mass tourism , neschkow said .
in the long term , the country will need to increase not only the overall revenue from tourism but also how much each tourist spends .
it seems the bulgarian government is considering a change in its tourism strategy . bildunterschrift : there 's still hope for bulgaria " we 're trying to market bulgaria as a year-round tourism destination , " said stanislaw nowakow of the state tourism agency .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de film -pipe- 12.08.2007 german expert on nazi films and propaganda großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leni riefenstahl used her considerable talents to make films for the nazis dw-world.de spoke film expert gerd albrecht about movies in the third reich and the fate of party-loyal filmmakers after world war ii . gerd albrecht has been studying film and cinema since the early 1950s .
he was one of the first west german film historians to write about film policy during the nazi regime .
dw-world.de : your book " national socialist film policy " appeared in 1969 .
why was it so long after the war before anyone tackled the topic ?
gerd albrecht : in 1945 , the allies banned the showing of films made during the nazi era .
they also confiscated important documents .
harmless films were soon released to the public , but in the 1950s they still had some 250 politically dubious films under lock and key .
the western allies only relinquished their privileges as an occupation force in 1955 .
the german government , which had inherited the nationalized german film industry , was quick to attend to the business of ensuring the industry 's survival .
the assignment to research national socialist film policy was commissioned in 1959 .
it only became clear over time that the propagandistic aims that found expression in some 1,100 films needed to be examined more carefully .
my research took 10 years despite substantial support from the german government because both the documents and the films were widely scattered .
what characterized nazi film policy ?
was it largely shaped by propaganda minister goebbels ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joseph goebbels was in charge of film policy in the third reich the first and foremost aim of national socialist films was to entertain .
they were intended to be escapist and offer reassurance in the face of everyday hardships .
the further that these films were removed from reality , the better they functioned in national socialist terms .
almost all references to political life and the everyday life of the viewers were missing .
any critical reference to contemporary reality was forbidden .
only a fraction of the films had direct propagandistic aims .
in these , national socialist ideology was presented as an ideal and impressively staged .
goebbels initially wanted 50 percent of the entire film output to be propaganda , but in the end , only 15 percent were .
in accordance with the beloved slogan of the time " ein volk — ein reich — ein führer " -lrb- one people — one empire — one leader -rrb- the propaganda films emphasize either the superiority of the " aryan race " -lrb- " wunschkonzert , " 1940 -rrb- , the superiority of the german reich over its enemies -lrb- " kadetten , " 1941 -rrb- or , of course , the superiority of the " greatest generals of all time " -lrb- " der grosse könig , " 1942 -rrb- .
goebbels decisively shaped contemporary film production .
he could almost always be sure he had the backing of adolf hitler .
both of them were not only enthusiastic film viewers , but they also had a firm grasp of this medium .
goebbels watched the majority of feature films before they were premiered .
he made changes in many cases .
according to your research , less than 15 percent of films produced under the nazis were war and propaganda films .
who went to see what ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : famous stars like zarah leander lured people to the cinemas the small group of propaganda films was , on average , seen by many more people than the apolitical films were .
these films were in more cinemas because of tax breaks and political pressure .
secondly , viewers liked going to see these films .
they were better made and were cast with more prominent actors .
since you could also be sure to encounter nazi propaganda , people would learn what they should say about political issues in general .
as a result , box office figures for these films were , on average , 50 percent higher than the proportion of film production given over to them .
they accounted for one in four or one in five cinema visits .
during the war years , in particular , they reached 15 to 25 million paying viewers .
were there nazi directors and nazi actors ?
would people like leni riefenstahl and zarah leander have become well known without the nazis ?
of course , some of the directors and actors were national socialists , along with other film people .
as in the population at large , some were passionate nazis , the others more half-hearted .
some were opportunists and while some were critical , they did n't voice criticism openly .
people like leni riefenstahl , zarah leander and veit harlan would have become famous in the industry without the nazis .
but in the case of karl ritter it 's questionable whether he would have been able to shoot his 14 films considering how wooden they were .
what happened to the directors and actors who worked for hitler after the war ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the director of a virulently anti-semitic film was acquitted and able to resume work the directors and actors who worked during the third reich on behalf of the regime were quickly able to resume their work after the war although there were differences between east and west germany .
while allied-german de-nazification courts did impose professional bans of various lengths and , in some cases , financial penalties , it was n't long before filmmakers were back behind the camera — veit harlan was the only one to appear before a proper court on charges of crimes against humanity in " jud süss " -lrb- the jew süss -rrb- in 1940 .
he was acquitted both times – under the jurisdiction of the occupying forces .
it was ruled that " jud süss " did represent a crime against humanity , but it was found that he was acting under pressure .
in 1950 he was able to resume filming in germany .
how do you see the current discussion surrounding tom cruise 's controversial film valkyrie ?
i hope the film " valkyrie " will be good and provide a worthy memorial to the german resistance and not only the officers .
tom cruise will hopefully contribute to the success of the film .
given his previous performances , he is obviously up to the role of playing stauffenberg , but we should n't forget the significance of the scriptwriter and director .
the fact that cruise is a scientologist is a personal matter for him , just as it is my personal business that i reject scientology .
the film and those who go to see it will neither be harmed nor will it profit from the fact that cruise is a scientologist .
for that reason , i think the current debate around his scientology membership to be superfluous and wrong .
besides , the nazis quickly realized that what was important about filmmakers was not their beliefs , but their talent and reliability .

the mediterranean island of mallorca has come to symbolize everything bad about cheap , mass tourism : crowded beaches full of drunken louts and cheapskates .
bulgaria 's black sea coast wants to avoid the same fate . bulgarian vacation spots along the black sea are in a quandary .
they are drawn to the short-term money mass tourism brings , but do n't want to make the same mistakes as the spanish . yet without a significant change in direction , that seems to be the way the country 's coastline is headed . investors have built gigantic hotel complexes , significantly increasing the number of beds along the black sea coast .
this has caused a price war .
a night in a holiday apartment costs on average 25 euros -lrb- $ 34.50 -rrb- while a night in a single room can be as little as 2 euros .
hotels without a water view sit nearly empty .
too little infrastructure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tourist ghettos on bulgaria 's gold coast empty beds are only one of the bulgarian tourism industry 's problems .
during the recent building spree , the accompanying infrastructure never materialized , said marin neschkow , head of the tourism board and a tourism expert at the university in varna , the largest city on bulgaria 's black sea coast .
businesses have invested millions of euros to build beautiful hotel grounds , bars and other amenities .
but the corresponding transportation and communication networks are lacking .
there 's also insufficient water supply and sewage treatment , neschkow said .
hotels are built so quickly that skilled workers can not be trained quickly enough .
their apprenticeships take several years .
but the problem , according to neschkow is not the dearth of places in bulgarian training programs , it 's the fact that many students no longer stick around in the summers to work in the bulgarian tourism industry .
instead , they go abroad . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not much elbow room on many of europe 's most popular beaches " tourism pays the lowest average wage in bulgaria .
it is not logical , when one thinks about it , that international tourism amounts to 14 percent of the country 's gross national product , " neschkow said .
tourism provides two billion euros each year , approximately half of bulgaria 's trade deficit .
responsible tourism ?
the tourism industry represents the biggest hope for an economic boom in bulgaria .
the number of tourists continues to rise and bulgaria has managed to build modern hotels , which provide quality similar to that guests would expect to find in central europe .
that contrasts with nearby romania , neschkow said .
but bulgaria needs to be careful not to rely solely on black sea mass tourism , neschkow said .
in the long term , the country will need to increase not only the overall revenue from tourism but also how much each tourist spends .
it seems the bulgarian government is considering a change in its tourism strategy . bildunterschrift : there 's still hope for bulgaria " we 're trying to market bulgaria as a year-round tourism destination , " said stanislaw nowakow of the state tourism agency . " we 're actively promoting the possibilities in health and wellness tourism , since there are a lot of mineral springs in bulgaria .
in the upcoming year we will highlight our cultural monuments and promote bulgaria as a country with a multifaceted cultural past . " dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

today , german youngsters dress up as manga-characters and idolize japanese music bands . " i 'm queen esther , " said a young woman , whose might be compared to a futuristic disco-snow queen , if something like that existed .
she 's wearing a fairytale dress of silk with a hoop skirt , puffy shoulders and a corset - everything covered with pearls and rhinestones .
her large collar is turned up , making looking to the left or right difficult , but works well with the crown .
fashion 's not easy . her coat is faux leopard skin , completing the look . in reality , queen esther is stefanie wittman , and has a somewhat less elegant real-world vocation - she 's an employee at a car manufacturer .
but to fulfil her queenly duties , she recently drove over five hours to the city of bonn to participate in a fan fair for the japanese manga series called " animagic . " manga is a japanese word for comics and print cartoons .
to non-japanese , it refers specifically to comics originally published in japan . cosplay : the new way of dressing up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are few limits when it comes to cosplay queen esther is a character from the japanese television show " trinity blood . "
the costume play , that stefanie and many more revel in , is called " cosplay . "
dressing up as a cartoon character started in japan in the early 80s , when young people masqueraded as their favorite manga characters to pose in tokyo 's entertainment districts . now the trend has caught on in europe .
but it 's not just limited to manga characters .
anything from japanese bands , to disney figures , to hollywood movie characters such as " the pirates of the carribean " is allowed . plastic hair bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a visual kei fan , dressed up as her favorite band member according to jens nave , who works for the manga magazine " animania , " cosplay has its biggest following in germany , followed by france .
about 13,000 fans from germany and neighboring countries participated in the " animagic 2007 " gathering , most of them in full regalia . a good portion of the " cosplayers " are women between 15 and 25 years of age .
cat ears made out of plush are the simplest accessories .
most costumes are sexy and a little trashy .
plastic hair in pink or purple , sometimes falling down to one 's ankles , is a favorite .
short tops , mini skirts and high-heeled boots are popular as well . it is an expensive and time-consuming hobby .
the costumes are usually hand-made , but worn rarely , such as at events like this one at local meetings of fan clubs . visual kei bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an identifying feature of the visual kei followers : a black bag with pictures and buttons another form of cosplay is the co called " visual kei . "
instead of dressing up as anime-characters , youngsters dress up as their favorite bands .
fans of this are usually recognizable by a black bag they carry that 's accessorized with safety pins , buttons and pictures of japanese band members on it .
their hair is usually dyed black with neon-colored highlights .
the look often has an androgynous aesthetic . inspired by glam-rockers such as david bowie and kiss , youngsters consciously try to blur the lines between male and the female . outsiders assume that followers of the visual kei movement are also fans of the german band tokio hotel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german band tokio hotel is no favorite of visual kei fans " i hate it when people connect visual kei to tokio hotel , those two have nothing in common ! " said antje eggers .
the music antje really likes is quite harder and takes longer to get into than the german band .
and , the fact that it 's sung in japanese plays a role as well . according to nave , visual kei as a subculture that is slowly becoming mainstream .
the first visual kei concert in germany of a band named " dir en grey " sold out in berlin quickly although there was little advertising about it .
fans communicate through internet forums and exchange information about events . nave is sure that the fan base will continue to grow and says do n't be surprised if you see life-size clones of japanese cartoon characters on german streets before too long . dw staff -lrb- tip -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he was one of the first west german film historians to write about film policy during the nazi regime .
dw-world.de : your book " national socialist film policy " appeared in 1969 .
why was it so long after the war before anyone tackled the topic ?
gerd albrecht : in 1945 , the allies banned the showing of films made during the nazi era .
they also confiscated important documents .
harmless films were soon released to the public , but in the 1950s they still had some 250 politically dubious films under lock and key .
the western allies only relinquished their privileges as an occupation force in 1955 .
the german government , which had inherited the nationalized german film industry , was quick to attend to the business of ensuring the industry 's survival .
the assignment to research national socialist film policy was commissioned in 1959 .
it only became clear over time that the propagandistic aims that found expression in some 1,100 films needed to be examined more carefully .
my research took 10 years despite substantial support from the german government because both the documents and the films were widely scattered .
what characterized nazi film policy ?
was it largely shaped by propaganda minister goebbels ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joseph goebbels was in charge of film policy in the third reich the first and foremost aim of national socialist films was to entertain .
they were intended to be escapist and offer reassurance in the face of everyday hardships .
the further that these films were removed from reality , the better they functioned in national socialist terms .
almost all references to political life and the everyday life of the viewers were missing .
any critical reference to contemporary reality was forbidden .
only a fraction of the films had direct propagandistic aims .
in these , national socialist ideology was presented as an ideal and impressively staged .
goebbels initially wanted 50 percent of the entire film output to be propaganda , but in the end , only 15 percent were .
in accordance with the beloved slogan of the time " ein volk — ein reich — ein führer " -lrb- one people — one empire — one leader -rrb- the propaganda films emphasize either the superiority of the " aryan race " -lrb- " wunschkonzert , " 1940 -rrb- , the superiority of the german reich over its enemies -lrb- " kadetten , " 1941 -rrb- or , of course , the superiority of the " greatest generals of all time " -lrb- " der grosse könig , " 1942 -rrb- .
goebbels decisively shaped contemporary film production .
he could almost always be sure he had the backing of adolf hitler .
both of them were not only enthusiastic film viewers , but they also had a firm grasp of this medium .
goebbels watched the majority of feature films before they were premiered .
he made changes in many cases .
according to your research , less than 15 percent of films produced under the nazis were war and propaganda films .
who went to see what ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : famous stars like zarah leander lured people to the cinemas the small group of propaganda films was , on average , seen by many more people than the apolitical films were .
these films were in more cinemas because of tax breaks and political pressure .
secondly , viewers liked going to see these films .
they were better made and were cast with more prominent actors .
since you could also be sure to encounter nazi propaganda , people would learn what they should say about political issues in general .
as a result , box office figures for these films were , on average , 50 percent higher than the proportion of film production given over to them .
they accounted for one in four or one in five cinema visits .
during the war years , in particular , they reached 15 to 25 million paying viewers .
were there nazi directors and nazi actors ?
would people like leni riefenstahl and zarah leander have become well known without the nazis ?
of course , some of the directors and actors were national socialists , along with other film people .
as in the population at large , some were passionate nazis , the others more half-hearted .
some were opportunists and while some were critical , they did n't voice criticism openly .
people like leni riefenstahl , zarah leander and veit harlan would have become famous in the industry without the nazis .
but in the case of karl ritter it 's questionable whether he would have been able to shoot his 14 films considering how wooden they were .
what happened to the directors and actors who worked for hitler after the war ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the director of a virulently anti-semitic film was acquitted and able to resume work the directors and actors who worked during the third reich on behalf of the regime were quickly able to resume their work after the war although there were differences between east and west germany .
while allied-german de-nazification courts did impose professional bans of various lengths and , in some cases , financial penalties , it was n't long before filmmakers were back behind the camera — veit harlan was the only one to appear before a proper court on charges of crimes against humanity in " jud süss " -lrb- the jew süss -rrb- in 1940 .
he was acquitted both times – under the jurisdiction of the occupying forces .
it was ruled that " jud süss " did represent a crime against humanity , but it was found that he was acting under pressure .
in 1950 he was able to resume filming in germany .
how do you see the current discussion surrounding tom cruise 's controversial film valkyrie ?
i hope the film " valkyrie " will be good and provide a worthy memorial to the german resistance and not only the officers .
tom cruise will hopefully contribute to the success of the film .
given his previous performances , he is obviously up to the role of playing stauffenberg , but we should n't forget the significance of the scriptwriter and director .
the fact that cruise is a scientologist is a personal matter for him , just as it is my personal business that i reject scientology .
the film and those who go to see it will neither be harmed nor will it profit from the fact that cruise is a scientologist .
for that reason , i think the current debate around his scientology membership to be superfluous and wrong .
besides , the nazis quickly realized that what was important about filmmakers was not their beliefs , but their talent and reliability .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de film -pipe- 12.08.2007 german expert on nazi films and propaganda großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leni riefenstahl used her considerable talents to make films for the nazis dw-world.de spoke film expert gerd albrecht about movies in the third reich and the fate of party-loyal filmmakers after world war ii . gerd albrecht has been studying film and cinema since the early 1950s .
he was one of the first west german film historians to write about film policy during the nazi regime .
dw-world.de : your book " national socialist film policy " appeared in 1969 .
why was it so long after the war before anyone tackled the topic ?
gerd albrecht : in 1945 , the allies banned the showing of films made during the nazi era .
they also confiscated important documents .
harmless films were soon released to the public , but in the 1950s they still had some 250 politically dubious films under lock and key .
the western allies only relinquished their privileges as an occupation force in 1955 .
the german government , which had inherited the nationalized german film industry , was quick to attend to the business of ensuring the industry 's survival .
the assignment to research national socialist film policy was commissioned in 1959 .
it only became clear over time that the propagandistic aims that found expression in some 1,100 films needed to be examined more carefully .
my research took 10 years despite substantial support from the german government because both the documents and the films were widely scattered .
what characterized nazi film policy ?
was it largely shaped by propaganda minister goebbels ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joseph goebbels was in charge of film policy in the third reich the first and foremost aim of national socialist films was to entertain .
they were intended to be escapist and offer reassurance in the face of everyday hardships .
the further that these films were removed from reality , the better they functioned in national socialist terms .
almost all references to political life and the everyday life of the viewers were missing .
any critical reference to contemporary reality was forbidden .
only a fraction of the films had direct propagandistic aims .
in these , national socialist ideology was presented as an ideal and impressively staged .
goebbels initially wanted 50 percent of the entire film output to be propaganda , but in the end , only 15 percent were .
in accordance with the beloved slogan of the time " ein volk — ein reich — ein führer " -lrb- one people — one empire — one leader -rrb- the propaganda films emphasize either the superiority of the " aryan race " -lrb- " wunschkonzert , " 1940 -rrb- , the superiority of the german reich over its enemies -lrb- " kadetten , " 1941 -rrb- or , of course , the superiority of the " greatest generals of all time " -lrb- " der grosse könig , " 1942 -rrb- .
goebbels decisively shaped contemporary film production .
he could almost always be sure he had the backing of adolf hitler .
both of them were not only enthusiastic film viewers , but they also had a firm grasp of this medium .
goebbels watched the majority of feature films before they were premiered .
he made changes in many cases .
according to your research , less than 15 percent of films produced under the nazis were war and propaganda films .
who went to see what ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : famous stars like zarah leander lured people to the cinemas the small group of propaganda films was , on average , seen by many more people than the apolitical films were .
these films were in more cinemas because of tax breaks and political pressure .
secondly , viewers liked going to see these films .
they were better made and were cast with more prominent actors .
since you could also be sure to encounter nazi propaganda , people would learn what they should say about political issues in general .
as a result , box office figures for these films were , on average , 50 percent higher than the proportion of film production given over to them .
they accounted for one in four or one in five cinema visits .
during the war years , in particular , they reached 15 to 25 million paying viewers .
were there nazi directors and nazi actors ?
would people like leni riefenstahl and zarah leander have become well known without the nazis ?
of course , some of the directors and actors were national socialists , along with other film people .
as in the population at large , some were passionate nazis , the others more half-hearted .
some were opportunists and while some were critical , they did n't voice criticism openly .
people like leni riefenstahl , zarah leander and veit harlan would have become famous in the industry without the nazis .
but in the case of karl ritter it 's questionable whether he would have been able to shoot his 14 films considering how wooden they were .
what happened to the directors and actors who worked for hitler after the war ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the director of a virulently anti-semitic film was acquitted and able to resume work the directors and actors who worked during the third reich on behalf of the regime were quickly able to resume their work after the war although there were differences between east and west germany .
while allied-german de-nazification courts did impose professional bans of various lengths and , in some cases , financial penalties , it was n't long before filmmakers were back behind the camera — veit harlan was the only one to appear before a proper court on charges of crimes against humanity in " jud süss " -lrb- the jew süss -rrb- in 1940 .
he was acquitted both times – under the jurisdiction of the occupying forces .
it was ruled that " jud süss " did represent a crime against humanity , but it was found that he was acting under pressure .
in 1950 he was able to resume filming in germany .
how do you see the current discussion surrounding tom cruise 's controversial film valkyrie ?
i hope the film " valkyrie " will be good and provide a worthy memorial to the german resistance and not only the officers .
tom cruise will hopefully contribute to the success of the film .
given his previous performances , he is obviously up to the role of playing stauffenberg , but we should n't forget the significance of the scriptwriter and director .
the fact that cruise is a scientologist is a personal matter for him , just as it is my personal business that i reject scientology .
the film and those who go to see it will neither be harmed nor will it profit from the fact that cruise is a scientologist .
for that reason , i think the current debate around his scientology membership to be superfluous and wrong .
besides , the nazis quickly realized that what was important about filmmakers was not their beliefs , but their talent and reliability .

he was one of the first west german film historians to write about film policy during the nazi regime .
dw-world.de : your book " national socialist film policy " appeared in 1969 .
why was it so long after the war before anyone tackled the topic ?
gerd albrecht : in 1945 , the allies banned the showing of films made during the nazi era .
they also confiscated important documents .
harmless films were soon released to the public , but in the 1950s they still had some 250 politically dubious films under lock and key .
the western allies only relinquished their privileges as an occupation force in 1955 .
the german government , which had inherited the nationalized german film industry , was quick to attend to the business of ensuring the industry 's survival .
the assignment to research national socialist film policy was commissioned in 1959 .
it only became clear over time that the propagandistic aims that found expression in some 1,100 films needed to be examined more carefully .
my research took 10 years despite substantial support from the german government because both the documents and the films were widely scattered .
what characterized nazi film policy ?
was it largely shaped by propaganda minister goebbels ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joseph goebbels was in charge of film policy in the third reich the first and foremost aim of national socialist films was to entertain .
they were intended to be escapist and offer reassurance in the face of everyday hardships .
the further that these films were removed from reality , the better they functioned in national socialist terms .
almost all references to political life and the everyday life of the viewers were missing .
any critical reference to contemporary reality was forbidden .
only a fraction of the films had direct propagandistic aims .
in these , national socialist ideology was presented as an ideal and impressively staged .
goebbels initially wanted 50 percent of the entire film output to be propaganda , but in the end , only 15 percent were .
in accordance with the beloved slogan of the time " ein volk — ein reich — ein führer " -lrb- one people — one empire — one leader -rrb- the propaganda films emphasize either the superiority of the " aryan race " -lrb- " wunschkonzert , " 1940 -rrb- , the superiority of the german reich over its enemies -lrb- " kadetten , " 1941 -rrb- or , of course , the superiority of the " greatest generals of all time " -lrb- " der grosse könig , " 1942 -rrb- .
goebbels decisively shaped contemporary film production .
he could almost always be sure he had the backing of adolf hitler .
both of them were not only enthusiastic film viewers , but they also had a firm grasp of this medium .
goebbels watched the majority of feature films before they were premiered .
he made changes in many cases .
according to your research , less than 15 percent of films produced under the nazis were war and propaganda films .
who went to see what ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : famous stars like zarah leander lured people to the cinemas the small group of propaganda films was , on average , seen by many more people than the apolitical films were .
these films were in more cinemas because of tax breaks and political pressure .
secondly , viewers liked going to see these films .
they were better made and were cast with more prominent actors .
since you could also be sure to encounter nazi propaganda , people would learn what they should say about political issues in general .
as a result , box office figures for these films were , on average , 50 percent higher than the proportion of film production given over to them .
they accounted for one in four or one in five cinema visits .
during the war years , in particular , they reached 15 to 25 million paying viewers .
were there nazi directors and nazi actors ?
would people like leni riefenstahl and zarah leander have become well known without the nazis ?
of course , some of the directors and actors were national socialists , along with other film people .
as in the population at large , some were passionate nazis , the others more half-hearted .
some were opportunists and while some were critical , they did n't voice criticism openly .
people like leni riefenstahl , zarah leander and veit harlan would have become famous in the industry without the nazis .
but in the case of karl ritter it 's questionable whether he would have been able to shoot his 14 films considering how wooden they were .
what happened to the directors and actors who worked for hitler after the war ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the director of a virulently anti-semitic film was acquitted and able to resume work the directors and actors who worked during the third reich on behalf of the regime were quickly able to resume their work after the war although there were differences between east and west germany .
while allied-german de-nazification courts did impose professional bans of various lengths and , in some cases , financial penalties , it was n't long before filmmakers were back behind the camera — veit harlan was the only one to appear before a proper court on charges of crimes against humanity in " jud süss " -lrb- the jew süss -rrb- in 1940 .
he was acquitted both times – under the jurisdiction of the occupying forces .
it was ruled that " jud süss " did represent a crime against humanity , but it was found that he was acting under pressure .
in 1950 he was able to resume filming in germany .
how do you see the current discussion surrounding tom cruise 's controversial film valkyrie ?
i hope the film " valkyrie " will be good and provide a worthy memorial to the german resistance and not only the officers .
tom cruise will hopefully contribute to the success of the film .
given his previous performances , he is obviously up to the role of playing stauffenberg , but we should n't forget the significance of the scriptwriter and director .
the fact that cruise is a scientologist is a personal matter for him , just as it is my personal business that i reject scientology .
the film and those who go to see it will neither be harmed nor will it profit from the fact that cruise is a scientologist .
for that reason , i think the current debate around his scientology membership to be superfluous and wrong .
besides , the nazis quickly realized that what was important about filmmakers was not their beliefs , but their talent and reliability .

today , german youngsters dress up as manga-characters and idolize japanese music bands . " i 'm queen esther , " said a young woman , whose might be compared to a futuristic disco-snow queen , if something like that existed .
she 's wearing a fairytale dress of silk with a hoop skirt , puffy shoulders and a corset - everything covered with pearls and rhinestones .
her large collar is turned up , making looking to the left or right difficult , but works well with the crown .
fashion 's not easy . her coat is faux leopard skin , completing the look . in reality , queen esther is stefanie wittman , and has a somewhat less elegant real-world vocation - she 's an employee at a car manufacturer .
but to fulfil her queenly duties , she recently drove over five hours to the city of bonn to participate in a fan fair for the japanese manga series called " animagic . " manga is a japanese word for comics and print cartoons .
to non-japanese , it refers specifically to comics originally published in japan . cosplay : the new way of dressing up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are few limits when it comes to cosplay queen esther is a character from the japanese television show " trinity blood . "
the costume play , that stefanie and many more revel in , is called " cosplay . "
dressing up as a cartoon character started in japan in the early 80s , when young people masqueraded as their favorite manga characters to pose in tokyo 's entertainment districts . now the trend has caught on in europe .

cat ears made out of plush are the simplest accessories .
most costumes are sexy and a little trashy .
plastic hair in pink or purple , sometimes falling down to one 's ankles , is a favorite .
short tops , mini skirts and high-heeled boots are popular as well . it is an expensive and time-consuming hobby .
the costumes are usually hand-made , but worn rarely , such as at events like this one at local meetings of fan clubs . visual kei bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an identifying feature of the visual kei followers : a black bag with pictures and buttons another form of cosplay is the co called " visual kei .

fans of this are usually recognizable by a black bag they carry that 's accessorized with safety pins , buttons and pictures of japanese band members on it .
their hair is usually dyed black with neon-colored highlights .
the look often has an androgynous aesthetic . inspired by glam-rockers such as david bowie and kiss , youngsters consciously try to blur the lines between male and the female . outsiders assume that followers of the visual kei movement are also fans of the german band tokio hotel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german band tokio hotel is no favorite of visual kei fans " i hate it when people connect visual kei to tokio hotel , those two have nothing in common !

today , german youngsters dress up as manga-characters and idolize japanese music bands . " i 'm queen esther , " said a young woman , whose might be compared to a futuristic disco-snow queen , if something like that existed .
she 's wearing a fairytale dress of silk with a hoop skirt , puffy shoulders and a corset - everything covered with pearls and rhinestones .
her large collar is turned up , making looking to the left or right difficult , but works well with the crown .
fashion 's not easy . her coat is faux leopard skin , completing the look . in reality , queen esther is stefanie wittman , and has a somewhat less elegant real-world vocation - she 's an employee at a car manufacturer .
but to fulfil her queenly duties , she recently drove over five hours to the city of bonn to participate in a fan fair for the japanese manga series called " animagic . " manga is a japanese word for comics and print cartoons .

"
the costume play , that stefanie and many more revel in , is called " cosplay . "
dressing up as a cartoon character started in japan in the early 80s , when young people masqueraded as their favorite manga characters to pose in tokyo 's entertainment districts . now the trend has caught on in europe .

about 13,000 fans from germany and neighboring countries participated in the " animagic 2007 " gathering , most of them in full regalia . a good portion of the " cosplayers " are women between 15 and 25 years of age .
cat ears made out of plush are the simplest accessories .
most costumes are sexy and a little trashy .
plastic hair in pink or purple , sometimes falling down to one 's ankles , is a favorite .
short tops , mini skirts and high-heeled boots are popular as well . it is an expensive and time-consuming hobby .

instead of dressing up as anime-characters , youngsters dress up as their favorite bands .
fans of this are usually recognizable by a black bag they carry that 's accessorized with safety pins , buttons and pictures of japanese band members on it .
their hair is usually dyed black with neon-colored highlights .
the look often has an androgynous aesthetic . inspired by glam-rockers such as david bowie and kiss , youngsters consciously try to blur the lines between male and the female . outsiders assume that followers of the visual kei movement are also fans of the german band tokio hotel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german band tokio hotel is no favorite of visual kei fans " i hate it when people connect visual kei to tokio hotel , those two have nothing in common !

and , the fact that it 's sung in japanese plays a role as well . according to nave , visual kei as a subculture that is slowly becoming mainstream .
the first visual kei concert in germany of a band named " dir en grey " sold out in berlin quickly although there was little advertising about it .

the mediterranean island of mallorca has come to symbolize everything bad about cheap , mass tourism : crowded beaches full of drunken louts and cheapskates .
bulgaria 's black sea coast wants to avoid the same fate . bulgarian vacation spots along the black sea are in a quandary .
they are drawn to the short-term money mass tourism brings , but do n't want to make the same mistakes as the spanish . yet without a significant change in direction , that seems to be the way the country 's coastline is headed . investors have built gigantic hotel complexes , significantly increasing the number of beds along the black sea coast .
this has caused a price war .
a night in a holiday apartment costs on average 25 euros -lrb- $ 34.50 -rrb- while a night in a single room can be as little as 2 euros .
hotels without a water view sit nearly empty .
too little infrastructure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tourist ghettos on bulgaria 's gold coast empty beds are only one of the bulgarian tourism industry 's problems .
during the recent building spree , the accompanying infrastructure never materialized , said marin neschkow , head of the tourism board and a tourism expert at the university in varna , the largest city on bulgaria 's black sea coast .
businesses have invested millions of euros to build beautiful hotel grounds , bars and other amenities .
but the corresponding transportation and communication networks are lacking .
there 's also insufficient water supply and sewage treatment , neschkow said .
hotels are built so quickly that skilled workers can not be trained quickly enough .
their apprenticeships take several years .
but the problem , according to neschkow is not the dearth of places in bulgarian training programs , it 's the fact that many students no longer stick around in the summers to work in the bulgarian tourism industry .
instead , they go abroad . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not much elbow room on many of europe 's most popular beaches " tourism pays the lowest average wage in bulgaria .
it is not logical , when one thinks about it , that international tourism amounts to 14 percent of the country 's gross national product , " neschkow said .
tourism provides two billion euros each year , approximately half of bulgaria 's trade deficit .
responsible tourism ?
the tourism industry represents the biggest hope for an economic boom in bulgaria .
the number of tourists continues to rise and bulgaria has managed to build modern hotels , which provide quality similar to that guests would expect to find in central europe .
that contrasts with nearby romania , neschkow said .
but bulgaria needs to be careful not to rely solely on black sea mass tourism , neschkow said .
in the long term , the country will need to increase not only the overall revenue from tourism but also how much each tourist spends .
it seems the bulgarian government is considering a change in its tourism strategy . bildunterschrift : there 's still hope for bulgaria " we 're trying to market bulgaria as a year-round tourism destination , " said stanislaw nowakow of the state tourism agency . " we 're actively promoting the possibilities in health and wellness tourism , since there are a lot of mineral springs in bulgaria .

the mediterranean island of mallorca has come to symbolize everything bad about cheap , mass tourism : crowded beaches full of drunken louts and cheapskates .
bulgaria 's black sea coast wants to avoid the same fate . bulgarian vacation spots along the black sea are in a quandary .
they are drawn to the short-term money mass tourism brings , but do n't want to make the same mistakes as the spanish . yet without a significant change in direction , that seems to be the way the country 's coastline is headed . investors have built gigantic hotel complexes , significantly increasing the number of beds along the black sea coast .
this has caused a price war .
a night in a holiday apartment costs on average 25 euros -lrb- $ 34.50 -rrb- while a night in a single room can be as little as 2 euros .
hotels without a water view sit nearly empty .
too little infrastructure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tourist ghettos on bulgaria 's gold coast empty beds are only one of the bulgarian tourism industry 's problems .
during the recent building spree , the accompanying infrastructure never materialized , said marin neschkow , head of the tourism board and a tourism expert at the university in varna , the largest city on bulgaria 's black sea coast .
businesses have invested millions of euros to build beautiful hotel grounds , bars and other amenities .
but the corresponding transportation and communication networks are lacking .
there 's also insufficient water supply and sewage treatment , neschkow said .
hotels are built so quickly that skilled workers can not be trained quickly enough .
their apprenticeships take several years .
but the problem , according to neschkow is not the dearth of places in bulgarian training programs , it 's the fact that many students no longer stick around in the summers to work in the bulgarian tourism industry .
instead , they go abroad . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not much elbow room on many of europe 's most popular beaches " tourism pays the lowest average wage in bulgaria .
it is not logical , when one thinks about it , that international tourism amounts to 14 percent of the country 's gross national product , " neschkow said .
tourism provides two billion euros each year , approximately half of bulgaria 's trade deficit .
responsible tourism ?
the tourism industry represents the biggest hope for an economic boom in bulgaria .
the number of tourists continues to rise and bulgaria has managed to build modern hotels , which provide quality similar to that guests would expect to find in central europe .
that contrasts with nearby romania , neschkow said .
but bulgaria needs to be careful not to rely solely on black sea mass tourism , neschkow said .
in the long term , the country will need to increase not only the overall revenue from tourism but also how much each tourist spends .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a border guard depicted in a 1981 book published in east germany " do not hesitate to use your firearm , not even when the border is breached in the company of women and children , which is a tactic the traitors have often used , " it said .
the director of the government office that manages the thousands of stasi files still in existence said the document offered iron-clad evidence that the top echelon of the regime expected that anyone trying to escape to the west should be killed .
" the document is so important because the political leaders of the time continue to deny there was an order to shoot , " marianne birthler told the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wall cut berlin in two the orders were issued to a special stasi unit which was posted alongside regular east german border guards in the magdeburg region .
its job was to stop escape attempts by guards , who sometimes tried to flee with their families .
it is believed that more than 2,800 east german soldiers crossed the border into the west .

politicians , however , say the troop deployment must continue in the face of a resurgent taliban . the german military must stay in afghanistan until the taliban has been defeated , the leader of the germany 's conservative christian democratic parliamentary party said in an interview made available saturday .
the german mission was not just about the people in afghanistan but also " about ourselves , " volker kauder told berlin-based weekly tagesspiegel am sonntag in a statement to be published sunday .
those asking for a withdrawal of german troops " seriously threaten our security , " kauder said .
the taliban were closely following current discussions in germany and drawing new courage from them , he added .
" but if we say clearly : we 'll stay until the taliban have been defeated , it will weaken their position .
the people in afghanistan also have to be reassured that they can rely on us , " kauder said .
support falling support has plunged in the german population for the country 's military presence in afghanistan , where more than 3,000 german troops and other personnel are helping the nato mission to combat the taliban insurgents .

support for the country 's continued military presence in afghanistan dropped 11 percentage points to 33 percent within the last two months , according to the infratest survey for ard television conducted on july 30-31 .
the number of germans calling for a withdrawal jumped 10 points to 64 percent , the poll of 1,000 german adults showed .
the mood has helped the new left party lead by politician oskar lafontaine , who has called for the withdrawal of all 7,700 german troops serving in foreign missions .
the far-left party 's position is attracting some disgruntled social democrats , unhappy with their party 's more centrist stance .
call for an international increase despite the falling public support , a former social democratic minister , egon bahr , has called for an increase of the international forces in afghanistan from their current 40,000 to " no less than 200,000 men . "
the troops should not stay for one year only , " but for five or ten years , " bahr told the sunday paper welt am sonntag .
the german military should also send more troops , bahr said , although exact numbers had to be decided on after a detailed nato analysis of the situation .
bahr was the brain behind germany 's ostpolitik -lrb- policy aimed at improving relations with east germany , poland , and the soviet union -rrb- in chancellor willy brandt 's social-liberal government coalition during the late 1960s and early 70s .
german forces are not on the front line of combat in afghanistan , but are based in the kunduz province in the relatively quiet northern part of the country .
still , suicide bombers in may killed three german soldiers who were on foot patrol .
while nato would like german troops to join dutch , british and canadian soldiers fighting a resurgent taliban in the south , chancellor angela merkel has refused to authorize such a deployment , saying germany is doing its part in the north .
fate uncertain the fate of the german engineer kidnapped in afghanistan three and a half weeks ago , meanwhile , remained uncertain on saturday .

politicians , however , say the troop deployment must continue in the face of a resurgent taliban . the german military must stay in afghanistan until the taliban has been defeated , the leader of the germany 's conservative christian democratic parliamentary party said in an interview made available saturday .
the german mission was not just about the people in afghanistan but also " about ourselves , " volker kauder told berlin-based weekly tagesspiegel am sonntag in a statement to be published sunday .
those asking for a withdrawal of german troops " seriously threaten our security , " kauder said .
the taliban were closely following current discussions in germany and drawing new courage from them , he added .
" but if we say clearly : we 'll stay until the taliban have been defeated , it will weaken their position .
the people in afghanistan also have to be reassured that they can rely on us , " kauder said .
support falling support has plunged in the german population for the country 's military presence in afghanistan , where more than 3,000 german troops and other personnel are helping the nato mission to combat the taliban insurgents .

an opinion poll conducted after two german engineers were taken hostage showed heightened disapproval of germany 's participation in the nato-led mission .
support for the country 's continued military presence in afghanistan dropped 11 percentage points to 33 percent within the last two months , according to the infratest survey for ard television conducted on july 30-31 .
the number of germans calling for a withdrawal jumped 10 points to 64 percent , the poll of 1,000 german adults showed .
the mood has helped the new left party lead by politician oskar lafontaine , who has called for the withdrawal of all 7,700 german troops serving in foreign missions .
the far-left party 's position is attracting some disgruntled social democrats , unhappy with their party 's more centrist stance .
call for an international increase despite the falling public support , a former social democratic minister , egon bahr , has called for an increase of the international forces in afghanistan from their current 40,000 to " no less than 200,000 men . "
the troops should not stay for one year only , " but for five or ten years , " bahr told the sunday paper welt am sonntag .
the german military should also send more troops , bahr said , although exact numbers had to be decided on after a detailed nato analysis of the situation .
bahr was the brain behind germany 's ostpolitik -lrb- policy aimed at improving relations with east germany , poland , and the soviet union -rrb- in chancellor willy brandt 's social-liberal government coalition during the late 1960s and early 70s .
german forces are not on the front line of combat in afghanistan , but are based in the kunduz province in the relatively quiet northern part of the country .

while nato would like german troops to join dutch , british and canadian soldiers fighting a resurgent taliban in the south , chancellor angela merkel has refused to authorize such a deployment , saying germany is doing its part in the north .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a border guard depicted in a 1981 book published in east germany " do not hesitate to use your firearm , not even when the border is breached in the company of women and children , which is a tactic the traitors have often used , " it said .
the director of the government office that manages the thousands of stasi files still in existence said the document offered iron-clad evidence that the top echelon of the regime expected that anyone trying to escape to the west should be killed .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wall cut berlin in two the orders were issued to a special stasi unit which was posted alongside regular east german border guards in the magdeburg region .
its job was to stop escape attempts by guards , who sometimes tried to flee with their families .
it is believed that more than 2,800 east german soldiers crossed the border into the west .
the unit was disbanded in 1985 , four years before the berlin wall fell .
several border guards were tried in the years after the east german government collapsed in 1990 but most received only suspended sentences .
anniversary monday is the 46th anniversary of the start of construction of the berlin wall , which cleaved the city in half and symbolized the cold war until it was toppled amid joyous scenes on november 9 , 1989 .
some 133 people were killed trying to cross it into west berlin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : construction of the famous barrier began on august 13 , 1961 estimates vary , but it is thought that more than 1,000 people lost their lives on the eastern side of the highly fortified border that ran along the entire frontier between the two germanys .
" on the eve of the anniversary of the construction of the wall , it is a lesson to all of those who want to let the barbarity of the communist regime be consigned to the annals of history , " ronald pofalla , general secretary of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic party , told berlin 's bz newspaper .
the total length of the berlin wall was 155 kilometers -lrb- about 97 miles -rrb- , of which 43 kilometers ran roughly north-south , cutting the city in two , while another 112 kilometers isolated the enclave of west berlin from the surrounding east german state . article compiled from news reports -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de film -pipe- 12.08.2007 german expert on nazi films and propaganda großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leni riefenstahl used her considerable talents to make films for the nazis dw-world.de spoke film expert gerd albrecht about movies in the third reich and the fate of party-loyal filmmakers after world war ii . gerd albrecht has been studying film and cinema since the early 1950s .
he was one of the first west german film historians to write about film policy during the nazi regime .
dw-world.de : your book " national socialist film policy " appeared in 1969 .
why was it so long after the war before anyone tackled the topic ?
gerd albrecht : in 1945 , the allies banned the showing of films made during the nazi era .
they also confiscated important documents .
harmless films were soon released to the public , but in the 1950s they still had some 250 politically dubious films under lock and key .
the western allies only relinquished their privileges as an occupation force in 1955 .
the german government , which had inherited the nationalized german film industry , was quick to attend to the business of ensuring the industry 's survival .
the assignment to research national socialist film policy was commissioned in 1959 .
it only became clear over time that the propagandistic aims that found expression in some 1,100 films needed to be examined more carefully .
my research took 10 years despite substantial support from the german government because both the documents and the films were widely scattered .
what characterized nazi film policy ?
was it largely shaped by propaganda minister goebbels ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joseph goebbels was in charge of film policy in the third reich the first and foremost aim of national socialist films was to entertain .
they were intended to be escapist and offer reassurance in the face of everyday hardships .
the further that these films were removed from reality , the better they functioned in national socialist terms .
almost all references to political life and the everyday life of the viewers were missing .
any critical reference to contemporary reality was forbidden .
only a fraction of the films had direct propagandistic aims .
in these , national socialist ideology was presented as an ideal and impressively staged .
goebbels initially wanted 50 percent of the entire film output to be propaganda , but in the end , only 15 percent were .
in accordance with the beloved slogan of the time " ein volk — ein reich — ein führer " -lrb- one people — one empire — one leader -rrb- the propaganda films emphasize either the superiority of the " aryan race " -lrb- " wunschkonzert , " 1940 -rrb- , the superiority of the german reich over its enemies -lrb- " kadetten , " 1941 -rrb- or , of course , the superiority of the " greatest generals of all time " -lrb- " der grosse könig , " 1942 -rrb- .
goebbels decisively shaped contemporary film production .
he could almost always be sure he had the backing of adolf hitler .
both of them were not only enthusiastic film viewers , but they also had a firm grasp of this medium .
goebbels watched the majority of feature films before they were premiered .
he made changes in many cases .
according to your research , less than 15 percent of films produced under the nazis were war and propaganda films .
who went to see what ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : famous stars like zarah leander lured people to the cinemas the small group of propaganda films was , on average , seen by many more people than the apolitical films were .
these films were in more cinemas because of tax breaks and political pressure .
secondly , viewers liked going to see these films .
they were better made and were cast with more prominent actors .
since you could also be sure to encounter nazi propaganda , people would learn what they should say about political issues in general .
as a result , box office figures for these films were , on average , 50 percent higher than the proportion of film production given over to them .
they accounted for one in four or one in five cinema visits .
during the war years , in particular , they reached 15 to 25 million paying viewers .
were there nazi directors and nazi actors ?
would people like leni riefenstahl and zarah leander have become well known without the nazis ?
of course , some of the directors and actors were national socialists , along with other film people .
as in the population at large , some were passionate nazis , the others more half-hearted .
some were opportunists and while some were critical , they did n't voice criticism openly .
people like leni riefenstahl , zarah leander and veit harlan would have become famous in the industry without the nazis .
but in the case of karl ritter it 's questionable whether he would have been able to shoot his 14 films considering how wooden they were .
what happened to the directors and actors who worked for hitler after the war ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the director of a virulently anti-semitic film was acquitted and able to resume work the directors and actors who worked during the third reich on behalf of the regime were quickly able to resume their work after the war although there were differences between east and west germany .
while allied-german de-nazification courts did impose professional bans of various lengths and , in some cases , financial penalties , it was n't long before filmmakers were back behind the camera — veit harlan was the only one to appear before a proper court on charges of crimes against humanity in " jud süss " -lrb- the jew süss -rrb- in 1940 .
he was acquitted both times – under the jurisdiction of the occupying forces .
it was ruled that " jud süss " did represent a crime against humanity , but it was found that he was acting under pressure .
in 1950 he was able to resume filming in germany .
how do you see the current discussion surrounding tom cruise 's controversial film valkyrie ?
i hope the film " valkyrie " will be good and provide a worthy memorial to the german resistance and not only the officers .
tom cruise will hopefully contribute to the success of the film .
given his previous performances , he is obviously up to the role of playing stauffenberg , but we should n't forget the significance of the scriptwriter and director .
the fact that cruise is a scientologist is a personal matter for him , just as it is my personal business that i reject scientology .
the film and those who go to see it will neither be harmed nor will it profit from the fact that cruise is a scientologist .
for that reason , i think the current debate around his scientology membership to be superfluous and wrong .
besides , the nazis quickly realized that what was important about filmmakers was not their beliefs , but their talent and reliability .

he was one of the first west german film historians to write about film policy during the nazi regime .
dw-world.de : your book " national socialist film policy " appeared in 1969 .
why was it so long after the war before anyone tackled the topic ?
gerd albrecht : in 1945 , the allies banned the showing of films made during the nazi era .
they also confiscated important documents .
harmless films were soon released to the public , but in the 1950s they still had some 250 politically dubious films under lock and key .
the western allies only relinquished their privileges as an occupation force in 1955 .
the german government , which had inherited the nationalized german film industry , was quick to attend to the business of ensuring the industry 's survival .
the assignment to research national socialist film policy was commissioned in 1959 .
it only became clear over time that the propagandistic aims that found expression in some 1,100 films needed to be examined more carefully .
my research took 10 years despite substantial support from the german government because both the documents and the films were widely scattered .
what characterized nazi film policy ?
was it largely shaped by propaganda minister goebbels ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joseph goebbels was in charge of film policy in the third reich the first and foremost aim of national socialist films was to entertain .
they were intended to be escapist and offer reassurance in the face of everyday hardships .
the further that these films were removed from reality , the better they functioned in national socialist terms .
almost all references to political life and the everyday life of the viewers were missing .
any critical reference to contemporary reality was forbidden .
only a fraction of the films had direct propagandistic aims .
in these , national socialist ideology was presented as an ideal and impressively staged .
goebbels initially wanted 50 percent of the entire film output to be propaganda , but in the end , only 15 percent were .
in accordance with the beloved slogan of the time " ein volk — ein reich — ein führer " -lrb- one people — one empire — one leader -rrb- the propaganda films emphasize either the superiority of the " aryan race " -lrb- " wunschkonzert , " 1940 -rrb- , the superiority of the german reich over its enemies -lrb- " kadetten , " 1941 -rrb- or , of course , the superiority of the " greatest generals of all time " -lrb- " der grosse könig , " 1942 -rrb- .
goebbels decisively shaped contemporary film production .
he could almost always be sure he had the backing of adolf hitler .
both of them were not only enthusiastic film viewers , but they also had a firm grasp of this medium .
goebbels watched the majority of feature films before they were premiered .
he made changes in many cases .
according to your research , less than 15 percent of films produced under the nazis were war and propaganda films .
who went to see what ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : famous stars like zarah leander lured people to the cinemas the small group of propaganda films was , on average , seen by many more people than the apolitical films were .
these films were in more cinemas because of tax breaks and political pressure .
secondly , viewers liked going to see these films .
they were better made and were cast with more prominent actors .
since you could also be sure to encounter nazi propaganda , people would learn what they should say about political issues in general .
as a result , box office figures for these films were , on average , 50 percent higher than the proportion of film production given over to them .
they accounted for one in four or one in five cinema visits .
during the war years , in particular , they reached 15 to 25 million paying viewers .
were there nazi directors and nazi actors ?
would people like leni riefenstahl and zarah leander have become well known without the nazis ?
of course , some of the directors and actors were national socialists , along with other film people .
as in the population at large , some were passionate nazis , the others more half-hearted .
some were opportunists and while some were critical , they did n't voice criticism openly .
people like leni riefenstahl , zarah leander and veit harlan would have become famous in the industry without the nazis .
but in the case of karl ritter it 's questionable whether he would have been able to shoot his 14 films considering how wooden they were .
what happened to the directors and actors who worked for hitler after the war ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the director of a virulently anti-semitic film was acquitted and able to resume work the directors and actors who worked during the third reich on behalf of the regime were quickly able to resume their work after the war although there were differences between east and west germany .
while allied-german de-nazification courts did impose professional bans of various lengths and , in some cases , financial penalties , it was n't long before filmmakers were back behind the camera — veit harlan was the only one to appear before a proper court on charges of crimes against humanity in " jud süss " -lrb- the jew süss -rrb- in 1940 .
he was acquitted both times – under the jurisdiction of the occupying forces .
it was ruled that " jud süss " did represent a crime against humanity , but it was found that he was acting under pressure .
in 1950 he was able to resume filming in germany .
how do you see the current discussion surrounding tom cruise 's controversial film valkyrie ?
i hope the film " valkyrie " will be good and provide a worthy memorial to the german resistance and not only the officers .
tom cruise will hopefully contribute to the success of the film .
given his previous performances , he is obviously up to the role of playing stauffenberg , but we should n't forget the significance of the scriptwriter and director .
the fact that cruise is a scientologist is a personal matter for him , just as it is my personal business that i reject scientology .
the film and those who go to see it will neither be harmed nor will it profit from the fact that cruise is a scientologist .
for that reason , i think the current debate around his scientology membership to be superfluous and wrong .
besides , the nazis quickly realized that what was important about filmmakers was not their beliefs , but their talent and reliability .

gerd albrecht : in 1945 , the allies banned the showing of films made during the nazi era .
they also confiscated important documents .
harmless films were soon released to the public , but in the 1950s they still had some 250 politically dubious films under lock and key .
the western allies only relinquished their privileges as an occupation force in 1955 .
the german government , which had inherited the nationalized german film industry , was quick to attend to the business of ensuring the industry 's survival .
the assignment to research national socialist film policy was commissioned in 1959 .
it only became clear over time that the propagandistic aims that found expression in some 1,100 films needed to be examined more carefully .
my research took 10 years despite substantial support from the german government because both the documents and the films were widely scattered .
what characterized nazi film policy ?
was it largely shaped by propaganda minister goebbels ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joseph goebbels was in charge of film policy in the third reich the first and foremost aim of national socialist films was to entertain .
they were intended to be escapist and offer reassurance in the face of everyday hardships .
the further that these films were removed from reality , the better they functioned in national socialist terms .
almost all references to political life and the everyday life of the viewers were missing .
any critical reference to contemporary reality was forbidden .
only a fraction of the films had direct propagandistic aims .
in these , national socialist ideology was presented as an ideal and impressively staged .
goebbels initially wanted 50 percent of the entire film output to be propaganda , but in the end , only 15 percent were .
in accordance with the beloved slogan of the time " ein volk — ein reich — ein führer " -lrb- one people — one empire — one leader -rrb- the propaganda films emphasize either the superiority of the " aryan race " -lrb- " wunschkonzert , " 1940 -rrb- , the superiority of the german reich over its enemies -lrb- " kadetten , " 1941 -rrb- or , of course , the superiority of the " greatest generals of all time " -lrb- " der grosse könig , " 1942 -rrb- .
goebbels decisively shaped contemporary film production .
he could almost always be sure he had the backing of adolf hitler .
both of them were not only enthusiastic film viewers , but they also had a firm grasp of this medium .
goebbels watched the majority of feature films before they were premiered .
he made changes in many cases .
according to your research , less than 15 percent of films produced under the nazis were war and propaganda films .
who went to see what ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : famous stars like zarah leander lured people to the cinemas the small group of propaganda films was , on average , seen by many more people than the apolitical films were .
these films were in more cinemas because of tax breaks and political pressure .
secondly , viewers liked going to see these films .
they were better made and were cast with more prominent actors .
since you could also be sure to encounter nazi propaganda , people would learn what they should say about political issues in general .
as a result , box office figures for these films were , on average , 50 percent higher than the proportion of film production given over to them .
they accounted for one in four or one in five cinema visits .
during the war years , in particular , they reached 15 to 25 million paying viewers .
were there nazi directors and nazi actors ?
would people like leni riefenstahl and zarah leander have become well known without the nazis ?
of course , some of the directors and actors were national socialists , along with other film people .
as in the population at large , some were passionate nazis , the others more half-hearted .
some were opportunists and while some were critical , they did n't voice criticism openly .
people like leni riefenstahl , zarah leander and veit harlan would have become famous in the industry without the nazis .
but in the case of karl ritter it 's questionable whether he would have been able to shoot his 14 films considering how wooden they were .
what happened to the directors and actors who worked for hitler after the war ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the director of a virulently anti-semitic film was acquitted and able to resume work the directors and actors who worked during the third reich on behalf of the regime were quickly able to resume their work after the war although there were differences between east and west germany .
while allied-german de-nazification courts did impose professional bans of various lengths and , in some cases , financial penalties , it was n't long before filmmakers were back behind the camera — veit harlan was the only one to appear before a proper court on charges of crimes against humanity in " jud süss " -lrb- the jew süss -rrb- in 1940 .
he was acquitted both times – under the jurisdiction of the occupying forces .
it was ruled that " jud süss " did represent a crime against humanity , but it was found that he was acting under pressure .
in 1950 he was able to resume filming in germany .
how do you see the current discussion surrounding tom cruise 's controversial film valkyrie ?
i hope the film " valkyrie " will be good and provide a worthy memorial to the german resistance and not only the officers .
tom cruise will hopefully contribute to the success of the film .
given his previous performances , he is obviously up to the role of playing stauffenberg , but we should n't forget the significance of the scriptwriter and director .
the fact that cruise is a scientologist is a personal matter for him , just as it is my personal business that i reject scientology .
the film and those who go to see it will neither be harmed nor will it profit from the fact that cruise is a scientologist .
for that reason , i think the current debate around his scientology membership to be superfluous and wrong .
besides , the nazis quickly realized that what was important about filmmakers was not their beliefs , but their talent and reliability .

fans of this are usually recognizable by a black bag they carry that 's accessorized with safety pins , buttons and pictures of japanese band members on it .
their hair is usually dyed black with neon-colored highlights .
the look often has an androgynous aesthetic . inspired by glam-rockers such as david bowie and kiss , youngsters consciously try to blur the lines between male and the female . outsiders assume that followers of the visual kei movement are also fans of the german band tokio hotel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german band tokio hotel is no favorite of visual kei fans " i hate it when people connect visual kei to tokio hotel , those two have nothing in common !

the mediterranean island of mallorca has come to symbolize everything bad about cheap , mass tourism : crowded beaches full of drunken louts and cheapskates .
bulgaria 's black sea coast wants to avoid the same fate . bulgarian vacation spots along the black sea are in a quandary .
they are drawn to the short-term money mass tourism brings , but do n't want to make the same mistakes as the spanish . yet without a significant change in direction , that seems to be the way the country 's coastline is headed . investors have built gigantic hotel complexes , significantly increasing the number of beds along the black sea coast .
this has caused a price war .
a night in a holiday apartment costs on average 25 euros -lrb- $ 34.50 -rrb- while a night in a single room can be as little as 2 euros .
hotels without a water view sit nearly empty .
too little infrastructure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tourist ghettos on bulgaria 's gold coast empty beds are only one of the bulgarian tourism industry 's problems .
during the recent building spree , the accompanying infrastructure never materialized , said marin neschkow , head of the tourism board and a tourism expert at the university in varna , the largest city on bulgaria 's black sea coast .
businesses have invested millions of euros to build beautiful hotel grounds , bars and other amenities .
but the corresponding transportation and communication networks are lacking .
there 's also insufficient water supply and sewage treatment , neschkow said .
hotels are built so quickly that skilled workers can not be trained quickly enough .
their apprenticeships take several years .
but the problem , according to neschkow is not the dearth of places in bulgarian training programs , it 's the fact that many students no longer stick around in the summers to work in the bulgarian tourism industry .
instead , they go abroad . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not much elbow room on many of europe 's most popular beaches " tourism pays the lowest average wage in bulgaria .
it is not logical , when one thinks about it , that international tourism amounts to 14 percent of the country 's gross national product , " neschkow said .
tourism provides two billion euros each year , approximately half of bulgaria 's trade deficit .
responsible tourism ?
the tourism industry represents the biggest hope for an economic boom in bulgaria .
the number of tourists continues to rise and bulgaria has managed to build modern hotels , which provide quality similar to that guests would expect to find in central europe .
that contrasts with nearby romania , neschkow said .
but bulgaria needs to be careful not to rely solely on black sea mass tourism , neschkow said .
in the long term , the country will need to increase not only the overall revenue from tourism but also how much each tourist spends .
it seems the bulgarian government is considering a change in its tourism strategy . bildunterschrift : there 's still hope for bulgaria " we 're trying to market bulgaria as a year-round tourism destination , " said stanislaw nowakow of the state tourism agency . " we 're actively promoting the possibilities in health and wellness tourism , since there are a lot of mineral springs in bulgaria .

the mediterranean island of mallorca has come to symbolize everything bad about cheap , mass tourism : crowded beaches full of drunken louts and cheapskates .
bulgaria 's black sea coast wants to avoid the same fate . bulgarian vacation spots along the black sea are in a quandary .
they are drawn to the short-term money mass tourism brings , but do n't want to make the same mistakes as the spanish . yet without a significant change in direction , that seems to be the way the country 's coastline is headed . investors have built gigantic hotel complexes , significantly increasing the number of beds along the black sea coast .
this has caused a price war .
a night in a holiday apartment costs on average 25 euros -lrb- $ 34.50 -rrb- while a night in a single room can be as little as 2 euros .
hotels without a water view sit nearly empty .
too little infrastructure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tourist ghettos on bulgaria 's gold coast empty beds are only one of the bulgarian tourism industry 's problems .
during the recent building spree , the accompanying infrastructure never materialized , said marin neschkow , head of the tourism board and a tourism expert at the university in varna , the largest city on bulgaria 's black sea coast .
businesses have invested millions of euros to build beautiful hotel grounds , bars and other amenities .
but the corresponding transportation and communication networks are lacking .
there 's also insufficient water supply and sewage treatment , neschkow said .
hotels are built so quickly that skilled workers can not be trained quickly enough .
their apprenticeships take several years .
but the problem , according to neschkow is not the dearth of places in bulgarian training programs , it 's the fact that many students no longer stick around in the summers to work in the bulgarian tourism industry .
instead , they go abroad . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not much elbow room on many of europe 's most popular beaches " tourism pays the lowest average wage in bulgaria .
it is not logical , when one thinks about it , that international tourism amounts to 14 percent of the country 's gross national product , " neschkow said .
tourism provides two billion euros each year , approximately half of bulgaria 's trade deficit .
responsible tourism ?
the tourism industry represents the biggest hope for an economic boom in bulgaria .
the number of tourists continues to rise and bulgaria has managed to build modern hotels , which provide quality similar to that guests would expect to find in central europe .
that contrasts with nearby romania , neschkow said .

he was one of the first west german film historians to write about film policy during the nazi regime .
dw-world.de : your book " national socialist film policy " appeared in 1969 .
why was it so long after the war before anyone tackled the topic ?
gerd albrecht : in 1945 , the allies banned the showing of films made during the nazi era .
they also confiscated important documents .
harmless films were soon released to the public , but in the 1950s they still had some 250 politically dubious films under lock and key .
the western allies only relinquished their privileges as an occupation force in 1955 .
the german government , which had inherited the nationalized german film industry , was quick to attend to the business of ensuring the industry 's survival .
the assignment to research national socialist film policy was commissioned in 1959 .
it only became clear over time that the propagandistic aims that found expression in some 1,100 films needed to be examined more carefully .
my research took 10 years despite substantial support from the german government because both the documents and the films were widely scattered .
what characterized nazi film policy ?
was it largely shaped by propaganda minister goebbels ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joseph goebbels was in charge of film policy in the third reich the first and foremost aim of national socialist films was to entertain .
they were intended to be escapist and offer reassurance in the face of everyday hardships .
the further that these films were removed from reality , the better they functioned in national socialist terms .
almost all references to political life and the everyday life of the viewers were missing .
any critical reference to contemporary reality was forbidden .
only a fraction of the films had direct propagandistic aims .
in these , national socialist ideology was presented as an ideal and impressively staged .
goebbels initially wanted 50 percent of the entire film output to be propaganda , but in the end , only 15 percent were .
in accordance with the beloved slogan of the time " ein volk — ein reich — ein führer " -lrb- one people — one empire — one leader -rrb- the propaganda films emphasize either the superiority of the " aryan race " -lrb- " wunschkonzert , " 1940 -rrb- , the superiority of the german reich over its enemies -lrb- " kadetten , " 1941 -rrb- or , of course , the superiority of the " greatest generals of all time " -lrb- " der grosse könig , " 1942 -rrb- .
goebbels decisively shaped contemporary film production .
he could almost always be sure he had the backing of adolf hitler .
both of them were not only enthusiastic film viewers , but they also had a firm grasp of this medium .
goebbels watched the majority of feature films before they were premiered .
he made changes in many cases .
according to your research , less than 15 percent of films produced under the nazis were war and propaganda films .
who went to see what ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : famous stars like zarah leander lured people to the cinemas the small group of propaganda films was , on average , seen by many more people than the apolitical films were .
these films were in more cinemas because of tax breaks and political pressure .
secondly , viewers liked going to see these films .
they were better made and were cast with more prominent actors .
since you could also be sure to encounter nazi propaganda , people would learn what they should say about political issues in general .
as a result , box office figures for these films were , on average , 50 percent higher than the proportion of film production given over to them .
they accounted for one in four or one in five cinema visits .
during the war years , in particular , they reached 15 to 25 million paying viewers .
were there nazi directors and nazi actors ?
would people like leni riefenstahl and zarah leander have become well known without the nazis ?
of course , some of the directors and actors were national socialists , along with other film people .
as in the population at large , some were passionate nazis , the others more half-hearted .
some were opportunists and while some were critical , they did n't voice criticism openly .
people like leni riefenstahl , zarah leander and veit harlan would have become famous in the industry without the nazis .
but in the case of karl ritter it 's questionable whether he would have been able to shoot his 14 films considering how wooden they were .
what happened to the directors and actors who worked for hitler after the war ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the director of a virulently anti-semitic film was acquitted and able to resume work the directors and actors who worked during the third reich on behalf of the regime were quickly able to resume their work after the war although there were differences between east and west germany .
while allied-german de-nazification courts did impose professional bans of various lengths and , in some cases , financial penalties , it was n't long before filmmakers were back behind the camera — veit harlan was the only one to appear before a proper court on charges of crimes against humanity in " jud süss " -lrb- the jew süss -rrb- in 1940 .
he was acquitted both times – under the jurisdiction of the occupying forces .
it was ruled that " jud süss " did represent a crime against humanity , but it was found that he was acting under pressure .
in 1950 he was able to resume filming in germany .
how do you see the current discussion surrounding tom cruise 's controversial film valkyrie ?
i hope the film " valkyrie " will be good and provide a worthy memorial to the german resistance and not only the officers .
tom cruise will hopefully contribute to the success of the film .
given his previous performances , he is obviously up to the role of playing stauffenberg , but we should n't forget the significance of the scriptwriter and director .
the fact that cruise is a scientologist is a personal matter for him , just as it is my personal business that i reject scientology .
the film and those who go to see it will neither be harmed nor will it profit from the fact that cruise is a scientologist .
for that reason , i think the current debate around his scientology membership to be superfluous and wrong .
besides , the nazis quickly realized that what was important about filmmakers was not their beliefs , but their talent and reliability .

politicians , however , say the troop deployment must continue in the face of a resurgent taliban . the german military must stay in afghanistan until the taliban has been defeated , the leader of the germany 's conservative christian democratic parliamentary party said in an interview made available saturday .
the german mission was not just about the people in afghanistan but also " about ourselves , " volker kauder told berlin-based weekly tagesspiegel am sonntag in a statement to be published sunday .
those asking for a withdrawal of german troops " seriously threaten our security , " kauder said .
the taliban were closely following current discussions in germany and drawing new courage from them , he added .
" but if we say clearly : we 'll stay until the taliban have been defeated , it will weaken their position .
the people in afghanistan also have to be reassured that they can rely on us , " kauder said .
support falling support has plunged in the german population for the country 's military presence in afghanistan , where more than 3,000 german troops and other personnel are helping the nato mission to combat the taliban insurgents .
an extension to the mandates for german forces to be in afghanistan must be renewed parliament by oct .
12 .
an opinion poll conducted after two german engineers were taken hostage showed heightened disapproval of germany 's participation in the nato-led mission .
support for the country 's continued military presence in afghanistan dropped 11 percentage points to 33 percent within the last two months , according to the infratest survey for ard television conducted on july 30-31 .
the number of germans calling for a withdrawal jumped 10 points to 64 percent , the poll of 1,000 german adults showed .
the mood has helped the new left party lead by politician oskar lafontaine , who has called for the withdrawal of all 7,700 german troops serving in foreign missions .
the far-left party 's position is attracting some disgruntled social democrats , unhappy with their party 's more centrist stance .
call for an international increase despite the falling public support , a former social democratic minister , egon bahr , has called for an increase of the international forces in afghanistan from their current 40,000 to " no less than 200,000 men . "
the troops should not stay for one year only , " but for five or ten years , " bahr told the sunday paper welt am sonntag .
the german military should also send more troops , bahr said , although exact numbers had to be decided on after a detailed nato analysis of the situation .
bahr was the brain behind germany 's ostpolitik -lrb- policy aimed at improving relations with east germany , poland , and the soviet union -rrb- in chancellor willy brandt 's social-liberal government coalition during the late 1960s and early 70s .
german forces are not on the front line of combat in afghanistan , but are based in the kunduz province in the relatively quiet northern part of the country .
still , suicide bombers in may killed three german soldiers who were on foot patrol .
while nato would like german troops to join dutch , british and canadian soldiers fighting a resurgent taliban in the south , chancellor angela merkel has refused to authorize such a deployment , saying germany is doing its part in the north .
fate uncertain the fate of the german engineer kidnapped in afghanistan three and a half weeks ago , meanwhile , remained uncertain on saturday .
" the crisis staff is working around the clock to free the german hostage , " a spokeswoman for the foreign ministry said in berlin without giving any further details .
an engineer identified in german media reports as rudolf b. , 62 , was abducted together with a colleague on july 18 - one day before the group of south koreans .
the colleague , 44-year-old rüdiger d. from the state of mecklenburg-western pomerania , was killed by his kidnappers .

politicians , however , say the troop deployment must continue in the face of a resurgent taliban . the german military must stay in afghanistan until the taliban has been defeated , the leader of the germany 's conservative christian democratic parliamentary party said in an interview made available saturday .
the german mission was not just about the people in afghanistan but also " about ourselves , " volker kauder told berlin-based weekly tagesspiegel am sonntag in a statement to be published sunday .
those asking for a withdrawal of german troops " seriously threaten our security , " kauder said .
the taliban were closely following current discussions in germany and drawing new courage from them , he added .
" but if we say clearly : we 'll stay until the taliban have been defeated , it will weaken their position .
the people in afghanistan also have to be reassured that they can rely on us , " kauder said .
support falling support has plunged in the german population for the country 's military presence in afghanistan , where more than 3,000 german troops and other personnel are helping the nato mission to combat the taliban insurgents .

call for an international increase despite the falling public support , a former social democratic minister , egon bahr , has called for an increase of the international forces in afghanistan from their current 40,000 to " no less than 200,000 men . "
the troops should not stay for one year only , " but for five or ten years , " bahr told the sunday paper welt am sonntag .
the german military should also send more troops , bahr said , although exact numbers had to be decided on after a detailed nato analysis of the situation .
bahr was the brain behind germany 's ostpolitik -lrb- policy aimed at improving relations with east germany , poland , and the soviet union -rrb- in chancellor willy brandt 's social-liberal government coalition during the late 1960s and early 70s .

they want to experience the richness of the world 's cultures and help out where they can . two german aviators of advancing years but with childhood dreams intact wrapped up a visit to cambodia sunday , after making humanitarian jaunts to help the country 's children .
it was part of a round-the-world trip the two have embarked upon to see the world and do a bit of good at the same time .
uwe thomas carstensen , 60 , and co-pilot hans christian albertsen , 59 , first met as schoolboys in their native state of schlesweig-holstein .
more than half a century later , the windmill engineer and the builder decided that they had put aside their childish dreams for long enough , and hatched a plan to fly around the world in 80 days in a tiny cessna 206 , stopping at 30 destinations .
" we both enjoy life and love flying around germany and europe .
we worked out that when you break this journey up into legs of 1,200 nautical miles , it is possible to fly around the entire world , " carstensen said in an interview shortly after arriving from malaysia .
" we thought it was a fantastic idea .
a great chance to taste all the different cultures and experiences the world has to offer , " he said .
love of flying the flying bug bit carstensen when he first tried hang-gliding back in 1987 .
since then , he said , flying has n't left his mind .
" " when looking at the earth i 'm fascinated to see how everything suddenly seems closer together.in the air i find peace . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the plane set off from hanover unlike carstensen , his wife marie does not like flying , so to ease the separation he named his single-engine cessna after her and painted the plane with red and green roses .
the round-the-world trip has been broken up into two legs .
carstensen was accompanied by sebatian rothammel for the first part , before childhood buddy albertsen got on board for leg number two .
" eye opener " the pair 's trip to cambodia , which ended sunday when they departed for hong kong and later taiwan , was " a real eye opener , " according to carstensen .
they traveled outside the capital to meet school children and talk with them about the dangers of drug use and hiv / aids .
cambodia still has one of the highest rates of hiv / aids infections in the region .
" when we dreamed this up , we knew we wanted to do something that was fun and challenging for us , but also helped other people and helped us to understand the places we were traveling through a little bit better , " carstensen explained .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : albertsen -lrb- left -rrb- and carstensen push their plane at phnom penh international airport their landing at phnom penh international airport last friday created much merriment among locals , who watched in amazement as the pilots , both grandfathers , leapt from the tiny plane and effortlessly pushed it across the tarmac themselves .
although exotic destinations such as turkey , dubai , pakistan , burma and australia are behind them , countries including japan , alaska and greenland still lie ahead before their scheduled return to germany on september 13 .
on the way , carstensen will visit his 88-year-old father , who emigrated from germany in 1953 and now lives in western canada .
" this has been a wonderful experience , but it will also be very nice for both of us when we get home and we can be with our families again , " carstensen said . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the mediterranean island of mallorca has come to symbolize everything bad about cheap , mass tourism : crowded beaches full of drunken louts and cheapskates .
bulgaria 's black sea coast wants to avoid the same fate . bulgarian vacation spots along the black sea are in a quandary .
they are drawn to the short-term money mass tourism brings , but do n't want to make the same mistakes as the spanish . yet without a significant change in direction , that seems to be the way the country 's coastline is headed . investors have built gigantic hotel complexes , significantly increasing the number of beds along the black sea coast .
this has caused a price war .
a night in a holiday apartment costs on average 25 euros -lrb- $ 34.50 -rrb- while a night in a single room can be as little as 2 euros .
hotels without a water view sit nearly empty .
too little infrastructure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tourist ghettos on bulgaria 's gold coast empty beds are only one of the bulgarian tourism industry 's problems .
during the recent building spree , the accompanying infrastructure never materialized , said marin neschkow , head of the tourism board and a tourism expert at the university in varna , the largest city on bulgaria 's black sea coast .
businesses have invested millions of euros to build beautiful hotel grounds , bars and other amenities .
but the corresponding transportation and communication networks are lacking .
there 's also insufficient water supply and sewage treatment , neschkow said .
hotels are built so quickly that skilled workers can not be trained quickly enough .
their apprenticeships take several years .
but the problem , according to neschkow is not the dearth of places in bulgarian training programs , it 's the fact that many students no longer stick around in the summers to work in the bulgarian tourism industry .
instead , they go abroad . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not much elbow room on many of europe 's most popular beaches " tourism pays the lowest average wage in bulgaria .
it is not logical , when one thinks about it , that international tourism amounts to 14 percent of the country 's gross national product , " neschkow said .
tourism provides two billion euros each year , approximately half of bulgaria 's trade deficit .
responsible tourism ?
the tourism industry represents the biggest hope for an economic boom in bulgaria .
the number of tourists continues to rise and bulgaria has managed to build modern hotels , which provide quality similar to that guests would expect to find in central europe .
that contrasts with nearby romania , neschkow said .
but bulgaria needs to be careful not to rely solely on black sea mass tourism , neschkow said .
in the long term , the country will need to increase not only the overall revenue from tourism but also how much each tourist spends .
it seems the bulgarian government is considering a change in its tourism strategy . bildunterschrift : there 's still hope for bulgaria " we 're trying to market bulgaria as a year-round tourism destination , " said stanislaw nowakow of the state tourism agency . " we 're actively promoting the possibilities in health and wellness tourism , since there are a lot of mineral springs in bulgaria .
in the upcoming year we will highlight our cultural monuments and promote bulgaria as a country with a multifaceted cultural past . " dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

politicians , however , say the troop deployment must continue in the face of a resurgent taliban . the german military must stay in afghanistan until the taliban has been defeated , the leader of the germany 's conservative christian democratic parliamentary party said in an interview made available saturday .
the german mission was not just about the people in afghanistan but also " about ourselves , " volker kauder told berlin-based weekly tagesspiegel am sonntag in a statement to be published sunday .
those asking for a withdrawal of german troops " seriously threaten our security , " kauder said .
the taliban were closely following current discussions in germany and drawing new courage from them , he added .
" but if we say clearly : we 'll stay until the taliban have been defeated , it will weaken their position .
the people in afghanistan also have to be reassured that they can rely on us , " kauder said .
support falling support has plunged in the german population for the country 's military presence in afghanistan , where more than 3,000 german troops and other personnel are helping the nato mission to combat the taliban insurgents .
an extension to the mandates for german forces to be in afghanistan must be renewed parliament by oct .
12 .
an opinion poll conducted after two german engineers were taken hostage showed heightened disapproval of germany 's participation in the nato-led mission .
support for the country 's continued military presence in afghanistan dropped 11 percentage points to 33 percent within the last two months , according to the infratest survey for ard television conducted on july 30-31 .
the number of germans calling for a withdrawal jumped 10 points to 64 percent , the poll of 1,000 german adults showed .
the mood has helped the new left party lead by politician oskar lafontaine , who has called for the withdrawal of all 7,700 german troops serving in foreign missions .
the far-left party 's position is attracting some disgruntled social democrats , unhappy with their party 's more centrist stance .
call for an international increase despite the falling public support , a former social democratic minister , egon bahr , has called for an increase of the international forces in afghanistan from their current 40,000 to " no less than 200,000 men . "
the troops should not stay for one year only , " but for five or ten years , " bahr told the sunday paper welt am sonntag .
the german military should also send more troops , bahr said , although exact numbers had to be decided on after a detailed nato analysis of the situation .
bahr was the brain behind germany 's ostpolitik -lrb- policy aimed at improving relations with east germany , poland , and the soviet union -rrb- in chancellor willy brandt 's social-liberal government coalition during the late 1960s and early 70s .
german forces are not on the front line of combat in afghanistan , but are based in the kunduz province in the relatively quiet northern part of the country .
still , suicide bombers in may killed three german soldiers who were on foot patrol .
while nato would like german troops to join dutch , british and canadian soldiers fighting a resurgent taliban in the south , chancellor angela merkel has refused to authorize such a deployment , saying germany is doing its part in the north .
fate uncertain the fate of the german engineer kidnapped in afghanistan three and a half weeks ago , meanwhile , remained uncertain on saturday .
" the crisis staff is working around the clock to free the german hostage , " a spokeswoman for the foreign ministry said in berlin without giving any further details .
an engineer identified in german media reports as rudolf b. , 62 , was abducted together with a colleague on july 18 - one day before the group of south koreans .
the colleague , 44-year-old rüdiger d. from the state of mecklenburg-western pomerania , was killed by his kidnappers .

he was one of the first west german film historians to write about film policy during the nazi regime .
dw-world.de : your book " national socialist film policy " appeared in 1969 .
why was it so long after the war before anyone tackled the topic ?
gerd albrecht : in 1945 , the allies banned the showing of films made during the nazi era .
they also confiscated important documents .
harmless films were soon released to the public , but in the 1950s they still had some 250 politically dubious films under lock and key .
the western allies only relinquished their privileges as an occupation force in 1955 .
the german government , which had inherited the nationalized german film industry , was quick to attend to the business of ensuring the industry 's survival .
the assignment to research national socialist film policy was commissioned in 1959 .
it only became clear over time that the propagandistic aims that found expression in some 1,100 films needed to be examined more carefully .
my research took 10 years despite substantial support from the german government because both the documents and the films were widely scattered .
what characterized nazi film policy ?
was it largely shaped by propaganda minister goebbels ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joseph goebbels was in charge of film policy in the third reich the first and foremost aim of national socialist films was to entertain .
they were intended to be escapist and offer reassurance in the face of everyday hardships .
the further that these films were removed from reality , the better they functioned in national socialist terms .
almost all references to political life and the everyday life of the viewers were missing .
any critical reference to contemporary reality was forbidden .
only a fraction of the films had direct propagandistic aims .
in these , national socialist ideology was presented as an ideal and impressively staged .
goebbels initially wanted 50 percent of the entire film output to be propaganda , but in the end , only 15 percent were .
in accordance with the beloved slogan of the time " ein volk — ein reich — ein führer " -lrb- one people — one empire — one leader -rrb- the propaganda films emphasize either the superiority of the " aryan race " -lrb- " wunschkonzert , " 1940 -rrb- , the superiority of the german reich over its enemies -lrb- " kadetten , " 1941 -rrb- or , of course , the superiority of the " greatest generals of all time " -lrb- " der grosse könig , " 1942 -rrb- .
goebbels decisively shaped contemporary film production .
he could almost always be sure he had the backing of adolf hitler .
both of them were not only enthusiastic film viewers , but they also had a firm grasp of this medium .
goebbels watched the majority of feature films before they were premiered .
he made changes in many cases .
according to your research , less than 15 percent of films produced under the nazis were war and propaganda films .
who went to see what ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : famous stars like zarah leander lured people to the cinemas the small group of propaganda films was , on average , seen by many more people than the apolitical films were .
these films were in more cinemas because of tax breaks and political pressure .
secondly , viewers liked going to see these films .
they were better made and were cast with more prominent actors .
since you could also be sure to encounter nazi propaganda , people would learn what they should say about political issues in general .
as a result , box office figures for these films were , on average , 50 percent higher than the proportion of film production given over to them .
they accounted for one in four or one in five cinema visits .
during the war years , in particular , they reached 15 to 25 million paying viewers .
were there nazi directors and nazi actors ?
would people like leni riefenstahl and zarah leander have become well known without the nazis ?
of course , some of the directors and actors were national socialists , along with other film people .
as in the population at large , some were passionate nazis , the others more half-hearted .
some were opportunists and while some were critical , they did n't voice criticism openly .
people like leni riefenstahl , zarah leander and veit harlan would have become famous in the industry without the nazis .
but in the case of karl ritter it 's questionable whether he would have been able to shoot his 14 films considering how wooden they were .
what happened to the directors and actors who worked for hitler after the war ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the director of a virulently anti-semitic film was acquitted and able to resume work the directors and actors who worked during the third reich on behalf of the regime were quickly able to resume their work after the war although there were differences between east and west germany .
while allied-german de-nazification courts did impose professional bans of various lengths and , in some cases , financial penalties , it was n't long before filmmakers were back behind the camera — veit harlan was the only one to appear before a proper court on charges of crimes against humanity in " jud süss " -lrb- the jew süss -rrb- in 1940 .
he was acquitted both times – under the jurisdiction of the occupying forces .
it was ruled that " jud süss " did represent a crime against humanity , but it was found that he was acting under pressure .
in 1950 he was able to resume filming in germany .
how do you see the current discussion surrounding tom cruise 's controversial film valkyrie ?
i hope the film " valkyrie " will be good and provide a worthy memorial to the german resistance and not only the officers .
tom cruise will hopefully contribute to the success of the film .
given his previous performances , he is obviously up to the role of playing stauffenberg , but we should n't forget the significance of the scriptwriter and director .
the fact that cruise is a scientologist is a personal matter for him , just as it is my personal business that i reject scientology .
the film and those who go to see it will neither be harmed nor will it profit from the fact that cruise is a scientologist .
for that reason , i think the current debate around his scientology membership to be superfluous and wrong .
besides , the nazis quickly realized that what was important about filmmakers was not their beliefs , but their talent and reliability .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a border guard depicted in a 1981 book published in east germany " do not hesitate to use your firearm , not even when the border is breached in the company of women and children , which is a tactic the traitors have often used , " it said .
the director of the government office that manages the thousands of stasi files still in existence said the document offered iron-clad evidence that the top echelon of the regime expected that anyone trying to escape to the west should be killed .
" the document is so important because the political leaders of the time continue to deny there was an order to shoot , " marianne birthler told the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wall cut berlin in two the orders were issued to a special stasi unit which was posted alongside regular east german border guards in the magdeburg region .
its job was to stop escape attempts by guards , who sometimes tried to flee with their families .
it is believed that more than 2,800 east german soldiers crossed the border into the west .
the unit was disbanded in 1985 , four years before the berlin wall fell .
several border guards were tried in the years after the east german government collapsed in 1990 but most received only suspended sentences .
anniversary monday is the 46th anniversary of the start of construction of the berlin wall , which cleaved the city in half and symbolized the cold war until it was toppled amid joyous scenes on november 9 , 1989 .
some 133 people were killed trying to cross it into west berlin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : construction of the famous barrier began on august 13 , 1961 estimates vary , but it is thought that more than 1,000 people lost their lives on the eastern side of the highly fortified border that ran along the entire frontier between the two germanys .
" on the eve of the anniversary of the construction of the wall , it is a lesson to all of those who want to let the barbarity of the communist regime be consigned to the annals of history , " ronald pofalla , general secretary of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic party , told berlin 's bz newspaper .
the total length of the berlin wall was 155 kilometers -lrb- about 97 miles -rrb- , of which 43 kilometers ran roughly north-south , cutting the city in two , while another 112 kilometers isolated the enclave of west berlin from the surrounding east german state . article compiled from news reports -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de film -pipe- 12.08.2007 german expert on nazi films and propaganda großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leni riefenstahl used her considerable talents to make films for the nazis dw-world.de spoke film expert gerd albrecht about movies in the third reich and the fate of party-loyal filmmakers after world war ii . gerd albrecht has been studying film and cinema since the early 1950s .
he was one of the first west german film historians to write about film policy during the nazi regime .
dw-world.de : your book " national socialist film policy " appeared in 1969 .
why was it so long after the war before anyone tackled the topic ?
gerd albrecht : in 1945 , the allies banned the showing of films made during the nazi era .
they also confiscated important documents .
harmless films were soon released to the public , but in the 1950s they still had some 250 politically dubious films under lock and key .
the western allies only relinquished their privileges as an occupation force in 1955 .
the german government , which had inherited the nationalized german film industry , was quick to attend to the business of ensuring the industry 's survival .
the assignment to research national socialist film policy was commissioned in 1959 .
it only became clear over time that the propagandistic aims that found expression in some 1,100 films needed to be examined more carefully .
my research took 10 years despite substantial support from the german government because both the documents and the films were widely scattered .
what characterized nazi film policy ?
was it largely shaped by propaganda minister goebbels ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joseph goebbels was in charge of film policy in the third reich the first and foremost aim of national socialist films was to entertain .
they were intended to be escapist and offer reassurance in the face of everyday hardships .
the further that these films were removed from reality , the better they functioned in national socialist terms .
almost all references to political life and the everyday life of the viewers were missing .
any critical reference to contemporary reality was forbidden .
only a fraction of the films had direct propagandistic aims .
in these , national socialist ideology was presented as an ideal and impressively staged .
goebbels initially wanted 50 percent of the entire film output to be propaganda , but in the end , only 15 percent were .
in accordance with the beloved slogan of the time " ein volk — ein reich — ein führer " -lrb- one people — one empire — one leader -rrb- the propaganda films emphasize either the superiority of the " aryan race " -lrb- " wunschkonzert , " 1940 -rrb- , the superiority of the german reich over its enemies -lrb- " kadetten , " 1941 -rrb- or , of course , the superiority of the " greatest generals of all time " -lrb- " der grosse könig , " 1942 -rrb- .
goebbels decisively shaped contemporary film production .
he could almost always be sure he had the backing of adolf hitler .
both of them were not only enthusiastic film viewers , but they also had a firm grasp of this medium .
goebbels watched the majority of feature films before they were premiered .
he made changes in many cases .
according to your research , less than 15 percent of films produced under the nazis were war and propaganda films .
who went to see what ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : famous stars like zarah leander lured people to the cinemas the small group of propaganda films was , on average , seen by many more people than the apolitical films were .
these films were in more cinemas because of tax breaks and political pressure .
secondly , viewers liked going to see these films .
they were better made and were cast with more prominent actors .
since you could also be sure to encounter nazi propaganda , people would learn what they should say about political issues in general .
as a result , box office figures for these films were , on average , 50 percent higher than the proportion of film production given over to them .
they accounted for one in four or one in five cinema visits .
during the war years , in particular , they reached 15 to 25 million paying viewers .
were there nazi directors and nazi actors ?
would people like leni riefenstahl and zarah leander have become well known without the nazis ?
of course , some of the directors and actors were national socialists , along with other film people .
as in the population at large , some were passionate nazis , the others more half-hearted .
some were opportunists and while some were critical , they did n't voice criticism openly .
people like leni riefenstahl , zarah leander and veit harlan would have become famous in the industry without the nazis .
but in the case of karl ritter it 's questionable whether he would have been able to shoot his 14 films considering how wooden they were .
what happened to the directors and actors who worked for hitler after the war ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the director of a virulently anti-semitic film was acquitted and able to resume work the directors and actors who worked during the third reich on behalf of the regime were quickly able to resume their work after the war although there were differences between east and west germany .
while allied-german de-nazification courts did impose professional bans of various lengths and , in some cases , financial penalties , it was n't long before filmmakers were back behind the camera — veit harlan was the only one to appear before a proper court on charges of crimes against humanity in " jud süss " -lrb- the jew süss -rrb- in 1940 .
he was acquitted both times – under the jurisdiction of the occupying forces .
it was ruled that " jud süss " did represent a crime against humanity , but it was found that he was acting under pressure .
in 1950 he was able to resume filming in germany .
how do you see the current discussion surrounding tom cruise 's controversial film valkyrie ?
i hope the film " valkyrie " will be good and provide a worthy memorial to the german resistance and not only the officers .
tom cruise will hopefully contribute to the success of the film .
given his previous performances , he is obviously up to the role of playing stauffenberg , but we should n't forget the significance of the scriptwriter and director .
the fact that cruise is a scientologist is a personal matter for him , just as it is my personal business that i reject scientology .
the film and those who go to see it will neither be harmed nor will it profit from the fact that cruise is a scientologist .
for that reason , i think the current debate around his scientology membership to be superfluous and wrong .
besides , the nazis quickly realized that what was important about filmmakers was not their beliefs , but their talent and reliability .

they were better made and were cast with more prominent actors .
since you could also be sure to encounter nazi propaganda , people would learn what they should say about political issues in general .
as a result , box office figures for these films were , on average , 50 percent higher than the proportion of film production given over to them .
they accounted for one in four or one in five cinema visits .
during the war years , in particular , they reached 15 to 25 million paying viewers .
were there nazi directors and nazi actors ?
would people like leni riefenstahl and zarah leander have become well known without the nazis ?
of course , some of the directors and actors were national socialists , along with other film people .
as in the population at large , some were passionate nazis , the others more half-hearted .
some were opportunists and while some were critical , they did n't voice criticism openly .
people like leni riefenstahl , zarah leander and veit harlan would have become famous in the industry without the nazis .
but in the case of karl ritter it 's questionable whether he would have been able to shoot his 14 films considering how wooden they were .
what happened to the directors and actors who worked for hitler after the war ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the director of a virulently anti-semitic film was acquitted and able to resume work the directors and actors who worked during the third reich on behalf of the regime were quickly able to resume their work after the war although there were differences between east and west germany .
while allied-german de-nazification courts did impose professional bans of various lengths and , in some cases , financial penalties , it was n't long before filmmakers were back behind the camera — veit harlan was the only one to appear before a proper court on charges of crimes against humanity in " jud süss " -lrb- the jew süss -rrb- in 1940 .
he was acquitted both times – under the jurisdiction of the occupying forces .
it was ruled that " jud süss " did represent a crime against humanity , but it was found that he was acting under pressure .
in 1950 he was able to resume filming in germany .
how do you see the current discussion surrounding tom cruise 's controversial film valkyrie ?
i hope the film " valkyrie " will be good and provide a worthy memorial to the german resistance and not only the officers .
tom cruise will hopefully contribute to the success of the film .
given his previous performances , he is obviously up to the role of playing stauffenberg , but we should n't forget the significance of the scriptwriter and director .
the fact that cruise is a scientologist is a personal matter for him , just as it is my personal business that i reject scientology .
the film and those who go to see it will neither be harmed nor will it profit from the fact that cruise is a scientologist .
for that reason , i think the current debate around his scientology membership to be superfluous and wrong .
besides , the nazis quickly realized that what was important about filmmakers was not their beliefs , but their talent and reliability .

the mediterranean island of mallorca has come to symbolize everything bad about cheap , mass tourism : crowded beaches full of drunken louts and cheapskates .
bulgaria 's black sea coast wants to avoid the same fate . bulgarian vacation spots along the black sea are in a quandary .
they are drawn to the short-term money mass tourism brings , but do n't want to make the same mistakes as the spanish . yet without a significant change in direction , that seems to be the way the country 's coastline is headed . investors have built gigantic hotel complexes , significantly increasing the number of beds along the black sea coast .
this has caused a price war .
a night in a holiday apartment costs on average 25 euros -lrb- $ 34.50 -rrb- while a night in a single room can be as little as 2 euros .
hotels without a water view sit nearly empty .
too little infrastructure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tourist ghettos on bulgaria 's gold coast empty beds are only one of the bulgarian tourism industry 's problems .
during the recent building spree , the accompanying infrastructure never materialized , said marin neschkow , head of the tourism board and a tourism expert at the university in varna , the largest city on bulgaria 's black sea coast .
businesses have invested millions of euros to build beautiful hotel grounds , bars and other amenities .
but the corresponding transportation and communication networks are lacking .
there 's also insufficient water supply and sewage treatment , neschkow said .
hotels are built so quickly that skilled workers can not be trained quickly enough .
their apprenticeships take several years .
but the problem , according to neschkow is not the dearth of places in bulgarian training programs , it 's the fact that many students no longer stick around in the summers to work in the bulgarian tourism industry .
instead , they go abroad . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not much elbow room on many of europe 's most popular beaches " tourism pays the lowest average wage in bulgaria .
it is not logical , when one thinks about it , that international tourism amounts to 14 percent of the country 's gross national product , " neschkow said .
tourism provides two billion euros each year , approximately half of bulgaria 's trade deficit .
responsible tourism ?
the tourism industry represents the biggest hope for an economic boom in bulgaria .
the number of tourists continues to rise and bulgaria has managed to build modern hotels , which provide quality similar to that guests would expect to find in central europe .
that contrasts with nearby romania , neschkow said .
but bulgaria needs to be careful not to rely solely on black sea mass tourism , neschkow said .
in the long term , the country will need to increase not only the overall revenue from tourism but also how much each tourist spends .
it seems the bulgarian government is considering a change in its tourism strategy . bildunterschrift : there 's still hope for bulgaria " we 're trying to market bulgaria as a year-round tourism destination , " said stanislaw nowakow of the state tourism agency .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de film -pipe- 12.08.2007 german expert on nazi films and propaganda großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leni riefenstahl used her considerable talents to make films for the nazis dw-world.de spoke film expert gerd albrecht about movies in the third reich and the fate of party-loyal filmmakers after world war ii . gerd albrecht has been studying film and cinema since the early 1950s .
he was one of the first west german film historians to write about film policy during the nazi regime .
dw-world.de : your book " national socialist film policy " appeared in 1969 .
why was it so long after the war before anyone tackled the topic ?
gerd albrecht : in 1945 , the allies banned the showing of films made during the nazi era .
they also confiscated important documents .
harmless films were soon released to the public , but in the 1950s they still had some 250 politically dubious films under lock and key .
the western allies only relinquished their privileges as an occupation force in 1955 .
the german government , which had inherited the nationalized german film industry , was quick to attend to the business of ensuring the industry 's survival .
the assignment to research national socialist film policy was commissioned in 1959 .
it only became clear over time that the propagandistic aims that found expression in some 1,100 films needed to be examined more carefully .
my research took 10 years despite substantial support from the german government because both the documents and the films were widely scattered .
what characterized nazi film policy ?
was it largely shaped by propaganda minister goebbels ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joseph goebbels was in charge of film policy in the third reich the first and foremost aim of national socialist films was to entertain .
they were intended to be escapist and offer reassurance in the face of everyday hardships .
the further that these films were removed from reality , the better they functioned in national socialist terms .
almost all references to political life and the everyday life of the viewers were missing .
any critical reference to contemporary reality was forbidden .
only a fraction of the films had direct propagandistic aims .
in these , national socialist ideology was presented as an ideal and impressively staged .
goebbels initially wanted 50 percent of the entire film output to be propaganda , but in the end , only 15 percent were .
in accordance with the beloved slogan of the time " ein volk — ein reich — ein führer " -lrb- one people — one empire — one leader -rrb- the propaganda films emphasize either the superiority of the " aryan race " -lrb- " wunschkonzert , " 1940 -rrb- , the superiority of the german reich over its enemies -lrb- " kadetten , " 1941 -rrb- or , of course , the superiority of the " greatest generals of all time " -lrb- " der grosse könig , " 1942 -rrb- .
goebbels decisively shaped contemporary film production .
he could almost always be sure he had the backing of adolf hitler .
both of them were not only enthusiastic film viewers , but they also had a firm grasp of this medium .
goebbels watched the majority of feature films before they were premiered .
he made changes in many cases .
according to your research , less than 15 percent of films produced under the nazis were war and propaganda films .
who went to see what ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : famous stars like zarah leander lured people to the cinemas the small group of propaganda films was , on average , seen by many more people than the apolitical films were .
these films were in more cinemas because of tax breaks and political pressure .
secondly , viewers liked going to see these films .
they were better made and were cast with more prominent actors .
since you could also be sure to encounter nazi propaganda , people would learn what they should say about political issues in general .
as a result , box office figures for these films were , on average , 50 percent higher than the proportion of film production given over to them .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de travel -pipe- 12.08.2007 bulgaria tries to avoid mass-tourism quagmire großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will bulgaria make the same mistakes as spain 's mallorca ?
the mediterranean island of mallorca has come to symbolize everything bad about cheap , mass tourism : crowded beaches full of drunken louts and cheapskates .
bulgaria 's black sea coast wants to avoid the same fate . bulgarian vacation spots along the black sea are in a quandary .
they are drawn to the short-term money mass tourism brings , but do n't want to make the same mistakes as the spanish . yet without a significant change in direction , that seems to be the way the country 's coastline is headed . investors have built gigantic hotel complexes , significantly increasing the number of beds along the black sea coast .
this has caused a price war .
a night in a holiday apartment costs on average 25 euros -lrb- $ 34.50 -rrb- while a night in a single room can be as little as 2 euros .
hotels without a water view sit nearly empty .
too little infrastructure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tourist ghettos on bulgaria 's gold coast empty beds are only one of the bulgarian tourism industry 's problems .
during the recent building spree , the accompanying infrastructure never materialized , said marin neschkow , head of the tourism board and a tourism expert at the university in varna , the largest city on bulgaria 's black sea coast .
businesses have invested millions of euros to build beautiful hotel grounds , bars and other amenities .
but the corresponding transportation and communication networks are lacking .
there 's also insufficient water supply and sewage treatment , neschkow said .
hotels are built so quickly that skilled workers can not be trained quickly enough .
their apprenticeships take several years .
but the problem , according to neschkow is not the dearth of places in bulgarian training programs , it 's the fact that many students no longer stick around in the summers to work in the bulgarian tourism industry .
instead , they go abroad . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not much elbow room on many of europe 's most popular beaches " tourism pays the lowest average wage in bulgaria .
it is not logical , when one thinks about it , that international tourism amounts to 14 percent of the country 's gross national product , " neschkow said .
tourism provides two billion euros each year , approximately half of bulgaria 's trade deficit .
responsible tourism ?
the tourism industry represents the biggest hope for an economic boom in bulgaria .
the number of tourists continues to rise and bulgaria has managed to build modern hotels , which provide quality similar to that guests would expect to find in central europe .
that contrasts with nearby romania , neschkow said .
but bulgaria needs to be careful not to rely solely on black sea mass tourism , neschkow said .
in the long term , the country will need to increase not only the overall revenue from tourism but also how much each tourist spends .
it seems the bulgarian government is considering a change in its tourism strategy . bildunterschrift : there 's still hope for bulgaria " we 're trying to market bulgaria as a year-round tourism destination , " said stanislaw nowakow of the state tourism agency . " we 're actively promoting the possibilities in health and wellness tourism , since there are a lot of mineral springs in bulgaria .
in the upcoming year we will highlight our cultural monuments and promote bulgaria as a country with a multifaceted cultural past . " dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

today , german youngsters dress up as manga-characters and idolize japanese music bands . " i 'm queen esther , " said a young woman , whose might be compared to a futuristic disco-snow queen , if something like that existed .
she 's wearing a fairytale dress of silk with a hoop skirt , puffy shoulders and a corset - everything covered with pearls and rhinestones .
her large collar is turned up , making looking to the left or right difficult , but works well with the crown .
fashion 's not easy . her coat is faux leopard skin , completing the look . in reality , queen esther is stefanie wittman , and has a somewhat less elegant real-world vocation - she 's an employee at a car manufacturer .
but to fulfil her queenly duties , she recently drove over five hours to the city of bonn to participate in a fan fair for the japanese manga series called " animagic . " manga is a japanese word for comics and print cartoons .
to non-japanese , it refers specifically to comics originally published in japan . cosplay : the new way of dressing up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are few limits when it comes to cosplay queen esther is a character from the japanese television show " trinity blood . "
the costume play , that stefanie and many more revel in , is called " cosplay . "
dressing up as a cartoon character started in japan in the early 80s , when young people masqueraded as their favorite manga characters to pose in tokyo 's entertainment districts . now the trend has caught on in europe .
but it 's not just limited to manga characters .
anything from japanese bands , to disney figures , to hollywood movie characters such as " the pirates of the carribean " is allowed . plastic hair bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a visual kei fan , dressed up as her favorite band member according to jens nave , who works for the manga magazine " animania , " cosplay has its biggest following in germany , followed by france .
about 13,000 fans from germany and neighboring countries participated in the " animagic 2007 " gathering , most of them in full regalia . a good portion of the " cosplayers " are women between 15 and 25 years of age .
cat ears made out of plush are the simplest accessories .
most costumes are sexy and a little trashy .
plastic hair in pink or purple , sometimes falling down to one 's ankles , is a favorite .
short tops , mini skirts and high-heeled boots are popular as well . it is an expensive and time-consuming hobby .
the costumes are usually hand-made , but worn rarely , such as at events like this one at local meetings of fan clubs . visual kei bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an identifying feature of the visual kei followers : a black bag with pictures and buttons another form of cosplay is the co called " visual kei . "
instead of dressing up as anime-characters , youngsters dress up as their favorite bands .
fans of this are usually recognizable by a black bag they carry that 's accessorized with safety pins , buttons and pictures of japanese band members on it .
their hair is usually dyed black with neon-colored highlights .
the look often has an androgynous aesthetic . inspired by glam-rockers such as david bowie and kiss , youngsters consciously try to blur the lines between male and the female . outsiders assume that followers of the visual kei movement are also fans of the german band tokio hotel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german band tokio hotel is no favorite of visual kei fans " i hate it when people connect visual kei to tokio hotel , those two have nothing in common ! " said antje eggers .
the music antje really likes is quite harder and takes longer to get into than the german band .
and , the fact that it 's sung in japanese plays a role as well . according to nave , visual kei as a subculture that is slowly becoming mainstream .
the first visual kei concert in germany of a band named " dir en grey " sold out in berlin quickly although there was little advertising about it .
fans communicate through internet forums and exchange information about events . nave is sure that the fan base will continue to grow and says do n't be surprised if you see life-size clones of japanese cartoon characters on german streets before too long . dw staff -lrb- tip -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

today , german youngsters dress up as manga-characters and idolize japanese music bands . " i 'm queen esther , " said a young woman , whose might be compared to a futuristic disco-snow queen , if something like that existed .
she 's wearing a fairytale dress of silk with a hoop skirt , puffy shoulders and a corset - everything covered with pearls and rhinestones .
her large collar is turned up , making looking to the left or right difficult , but works well with the crown .
fashion 's not easy . her coat is faux leopard skin , completing the look . in reality , queen esther is stefanie wittman , and has a somewhat less elegant real-world vocation - she 's an employee at a car manufacturer .
but to fulfil her queenly duties , she recently drove over five hours to the city of bonn to participate in a fan fair for the japanese manga series called " animagic . " manga is a japanese word for comics and print cartoons .
to non-japanese , it refers specifically to comics originally published in japan . cosplay : the new way of dressing up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are few limits when it comes to cosplay queen esther is a character from the japanese television show " trinity blood . "
the costume play , that stefanie and many more revel in , is called " cosplay . "
dressing up as a cartoon character started in japan in the early 80s , when young people masqueraded as their favorite manga characters to pose in tokyo 's entertainment districts . now the trend has caught on in europe .

most costumes are sexy and a little trashy .
plastic hair in pink or purple , sometimes falling down to one 's ankles , is a favorite .

fans of this are usually recognizable by a black bag they carry that 's accessorized with safety pins , buttons and pictures of japanese band members on it .
their hair is usually dyed black with neon-colored highlights .
the look often has an androgynous aesthetic . inspired by glam-rockers such as david bowie and kiss , youngsters consciously try to blur the lines between male and the female . outsiders assume that followers of the visual kei movement are also fans of the german band tokio hotel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german band tokio hotel is no favorite of visual kei fans " i hate it when people connect visual kei to tokio hotel , those two have nothing in common !

and , the fact that it 's sung in japanese plays a role as well . according to nave , visual kei as a subculture that is slowly becoming mainstream .
the first visual kei concert in germany of a band named " dir en grey " sold out in berlin quickly although there was little advertising about it .

the mediterranean island of mallorca has come to symbolize everything bad about cheap , mass tourism : crowded beaches full of drunken louts and cheapskates .
bulgaria 's black sea coast wants to avoid the same fate . bulgarian vacation spots along the black sea are in a quandary .
they are drawn to the short-term money mass tourism brings , but do n't want to make the same mistakes as the spanish . yet without a significant change in direction , that seems to be the way the country 's coastline is headed . investors have built gigantic hotel complexes , significantly increasing the number of beds along the black sea coast .
this has caused a price war .
a night in a holiday apartment costs on average 25 euros -lrb- $ 34.50 -rrb- while a night in a single room can be as little as 2 euros .
hotels without a water view sit nearly empty .
too little infrastructure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tourist ghettos on bulgaria 's gold coast empty beds are only one of the bulgarian tourism industry 's problems .
during the recent building spree , the accompanying infrastructure never materialized , said marin neschkow , head of the tourism board and a tourism expert at the university in varna , the largest city on bulgaria 's black sea coast .
businesses have invested millions of euros to build beautiful hotel grounds , bars and other amenities .
but the corresponding transportation and communication networks are lacking .
there 's also insufficient water supply and sewage treatment , neschkow said .
hotels are built so quickly that skilled workers can not be trained quickly enough .
their apprenticeships take several years .
but the problem , according to neschkow is not the dearth of places in bulgarian training programs , it 's the fact that many students no longer stick around in the summers to work in the bulgarian tourism industry .
instead , they go abroad . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not much elbow room on many of europe 's most popular beaches " tourism pays the lowest average wage in bulgaria .
it is not logical , when one thinks about it , that international tourism amounts to 14 percent of the country 's gross national product , " neschkow said .
tourism provides two billion euros each year , approximately half of bulgaria 's trade deficit .
responsible tourism ?
the tourism industry represents the biggest hope for an economic boom in bulgaria .
the number of tourists continues to rise and bulgaria has managed to build modern hotels , which provide quality similar to that guests would expect to find in central europe .
that contrasts with nearby romania , neschkow said .
but bulgaria needs to be careful not to rely solely on black sea mass tourism , neschkow said .
in the long term , the country will need to increase not only the overall revenue from tourism but also how much each tourist spends .
it seems the bulgarian government is considering a change in its tourism strategy . bildunterschrift : there 's still hope for bulgaria " we 're trying to market bulgaria as a year-round tourism destination , " said stanislaw nowakow of the state tourism agency . " we 're actively promoting the possibilities in health and wellness tourism , since there are a lot of mineral springs in bulgaria .
in the upcoming year we will highlight our cultural monuments and promote bulgaria as a country with a multifaceted cultural past . " dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

politicians , however , say the troop deployment must continue in the face of a resurgent taliban . the german military must stay in afghanistan until the taliban has been defeated , the leader of the germany 's conservative christian democratic parliamentary party said in an interview made available saturday .
the german mission was not just about the people in afghanistan but also " about ourselves , " volker kauder told berlin-based weekly tagesspiegel am sonntag in a statement to be published sunday .
those asking for a withdrawal of german troops " seriously threaten our security , " kauder said .
the taliban were closely following current discussions in germany and drawing new courage from them , he added .
" but if we say clearly : we 'll stay until the taliban have been defeated , it will weaken their position .
the people in afghanistan also have to be reassured that they can rely on us , " kauder said .
support falling support has plunged in the german population for the country 's military presence in afghanistan , where more than 3,000 german troops and other personnel are helping the nato mission to combat the taliban insurgents .
an extension to the mandates for german forces to be in afghanistan must be renewed parliament by oct .
12 .
an opinion poll conducted after two german engineers were taken hostage showed heightened disapproval of germany 's participation in the nato-led mission .
support for the country 's continued military presence in afghanistan dropped 11 percentage points to 33 percent within the last two months , according to the infratest survey for ard television conducted on july 30-31 .
the number of germans calling for a withdrawal jumped 10 points to 64 percent , the poll of 1,000 german adults showed .
the mood has helped the new left party lead by politician oskar lafontaine , who has called for the withdrawal of all 7,700 german troops serving in foreign missions .
the far-left party 's position is attracting some disgruntled social democrats , unhappy with their party 's more centrist stance .
call for an international increase despite the falling public support , a former social democratic minister , egon bahr , has called for an increase of the international forces in afghanistan from their current 40,000 to " no less than 200,000 men . "
the troops should not stay for one year only , " but for five or ten years , " bahr told the sunday paper welt am sonntag .
the german military should also send more troops , bahr said , although exact numbers had to be decided on after a detailed nato analysis of the situation .
bahr was the brain behind germany 's ostpolitik -lrb- policy aimed at improving relations with east germany , poland , and the soviet union -rrb- in chancellor willy brandt 's social-liberal government coalition during the late 1960s and early 70s .
german forces are not on the front line of combat in afghanistan , but are based in the kunduz province in the relatively quiet northern part of the country .
still , suicide bombers in may killed three german soldiers who were on foot patrol .
while nato would like german troops to join dutch , british and canadian soldiers fighting a resurgent taliban in the south , chancellor angela merkel has refused to authorize such a deployment , saying germany is doing its part in the north .
fate uncertain the fate of the german engineer kidnapped in afghanistan three and a half weeks ago , meanwhile , remained uncertain on saturday .
" the crisis staff is working around the clock to free the german hostage , " a spokeswoman for the foreign ministry said in berlin without giving any further details .
an engineer identified in german media reports as rudolf b. , 62 , was abducted together with a colleague on july 18 - one day before the group of south koreans .
the colleague , 44-year-old rüdiger d. from the state of mecklenburg-western pomerania , was killed by his kidnappers .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a border guard depicted in a 1981 book published in east germany " do not hesitate to use your firearm , not even when the border is breached in the company of women and children , which is a tactic the traitors have often used , " it said .
the director of the government office that manages the thousands of stasi files still in existence said the document offered iron-clad evidence that the top echelon of the regime expected that anyone trying to escape to the west should be killed .
" the document is so important because the political leaders of the time continue to deny there was an order to shoot , " marianne birthler told the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wall cut berlin in two the orders were issued to a special stasi unit which was posted alongside regular east german border guards in the magdeburg region .
its job was to stop escape attempts by guards , who sometimes tried to flee with their families .
it is believed that more than 2,800 east german soldiers crossed the border into the west .
the unit was disbanded in 1985 , four years before the berlin wall fell .
several border guards were tried in the years after the east german government collapsed in 1990 but most received only suspended sentences .
anniversary monday is the 46th anniversary of the start of construction of the berlin wall , which cleaved the city in half and symbolized the cold war until it was toppled amid joyous scenes on november 9 , 1989 .

politicians , however , say the troop deployment must continue in the face of a resurgent taliban . the german military must stay in afghanistan until the taliban has been defeated , the leader of the germany 's conservative christian democratic parliamentary party said in an interview made available saturday .
the german mission was not just about the people in afghanistan but also " about ourselves , " volker kauder told berlin-based weekly tagesspiegel am sonntag in a statement to be published sunday .
those asking for a withdrawal of german troops " seriously threaten our security , " kauder said .
the taliban were closely following current discussions in germany and drawing new courage from them , he added .
" but if we say clearly : we 'll stay until the taliban have been defeated , it will weaken their position .
the people in afghanistan also have to be reassured that they can rely on us , " kauder said .
support falling support has plunged in the german population for the country 's military presence in afghanistan , where more than 3,000 german troops and other personnel are helping the nato mission to combat the taliban insurgents .
an extension to the mandates for german forces to be in afghanistan must be renewed parliament by oct .

an opinion poll conducted after two german engineers were taken hostage showed heightened disapproval of germany 's participation in the nato-led mission .
support for the country 's continued military presence in afghanistan dropped 11 percentage points to 33 percent within the last two months , according to the infratest survey for ard television conducted on july 30-31 .
the number of germans calling for a withdrawal jumped 10 points to 64 percent , the poll of 1,000 german adults showed .
the mood has helped the new left party lead by politician oskar lafontaine , who has called for the withdrawal of all 7,700 german troops serving in foreign missions .
the far-left party 's position is attracting some disgruntled social democrats , unhappy with their party 's more centrist stance .
call for an international increase despite the falling public support , a former social democratic minister , egon bahr , has called for an increase of the international forces in afghanistan from their current 40,000 to " no less than 200,000 men . "
the troops should not stay for one year only , " but for five or ten years , " bahr told the sunday paper welt am sonntag .
the german military should also send more troops , bahr said , although exact numbers had to be decided on after a detailed nato analysis of the situation .
bahr was the brain behind germany 's ostpolitik -lrb- policy aimed at improving relations with east germany , poland , and the soviet union -rrb- in chancellor willy brandt 's social-liberal government coalition during the late 1960s and early 70s .
german forces are not on the front line of combat in afghanistan , but are based in the kunduz province in the relatively quiet northern part of the country .
still , suicide bombers in may killed three german soldiers who were on foot patrol .
while nato would like german troops to join dutch , british and canadian soldiers fighting a resurgent taliban in the south , chancellor angela merkel has refused to authorize such a deployment , saying germany is doing its part in the north .
fate uncertain the fate of the german engineer kidnapped in afghanistan three and a half weeks ago , meanwhile , remained uncertain on saturday .
" the crisis staff is working around the clock to free the german hostage , " a spokeswoman for the foreign ministry said in berlin without giving any further details .
an engineer identified in german media reports as rudolf b. , 62 , was abducted together with a colleague on july 18 - one day before the group of south koreans .
the colleague , 44-year-old rüdiger d. from the state of mecklenburg-western pomerania , was killed by his kidnappers .

the director of the government office that manages the thousands of stasi files still in existence said the document offered iron-clad evidence that the top echelon of the regime expected that anyone trying to escape to the west should be killed .
" the document is so important because the political leaders of the time continue to deny there was an order to shoot , " marianne birthler told the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wall cut berlin in two the orders were issued to a special stasi unit which was posted alongside regular east german border guards in the magdeburg region .
its job was to stop escape attempts by guards , who sometimes tried to flee with their families .
it is believed that more than 2,800 east german soldiers crossed the border into the west .
the unit was disbanded in 1985 , four years before the berlin wall fell .
several border guards were tried in the years after the east german government collapsed in 1990 but most received only suspended sentences .
anniversary monday is the 46th anniversary of the start of construction of the berlin wall , which cleaved the city in half and symbolized the cold war until it was toppled amid joyous scenes on november 9 , 1989 .
some 133 people were killed trying to cross it into west berlin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : construction of the famous barrier began on august 13 , 1961 estimates vary , but it is thought that more than 1,000 people lost their lives on the eastern side of the highly fortified border that ran along the entire frontier between the two germanys .
" on the eve of the anniversary of the construction of the wall , it is a lesson to all of those who want to let the barbarity of the communist regime be consigned to the annals of history , " ronald pofalla , general secretary of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic party , told berlin 's bz newspaper .
the total length of the berlin wall was 155 kilometers -lrb- about 97 miles -rrb- , of which 43 kilometers ran roughly north-south , cutting the city in two , while another 112 kilometers isolated the enclave of west berlin from the surrounding east german state . article compiled from news reports -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

she 's wearing a fairytale dress of silk with a hoop skirt , puffy shoulders and a corset - everything covered with pearls and rhinestones .

fashion 's not easy . her coat is faux leopard skin , completing the look . in reality , queen esther is stefanie wittman , and has a somewhat less elegant real-world vocation - she 's an employee at a car manufacturer .
but to fulfil her queenly duties , she recently drove over five hours to the city of bonn to participate in a fan fair for the japanese manga series called " animagic . " manga is a japanese word for comics and print cartoons .

plastic hair in pink or purple , sometimes falling down to one 's ankles , is a favorite .

today , german youngsters dress up as manga-characters and idolize japanese music bands . " i 'm queen esther , " said a young woman , whose might be compared to a futuristic disco-snow queen , if something like that existed .
she 's wearing a fairytale dress of silk with a hoop skirt , puffy shoulders and a corset - everything covered with pearls and rhinestones .
her large collar is turned up , making looking to the left or right difficult , but works well with the crown .
fashion 's not easy . her coat is faux leopard skin , completing the look . in reality , queen esther is stefanie wittman , and has a somewhat less elegant real-world vocation - she 's an employee at a car manufacturer .
but to fulfil her queenly duties , she recently drove over five hours to the city of bonn to participate in a fan fair for the japanese manga series called " animagic . " manga is a japanese word for comics and print cartoons .
to non-japanese , it refers specifically to comics originally published in japan . cosplay : the new way of dressing up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are few limits when it comes to cosplay queen esther is a character from the japanese television show " trinity blood . "
the costume play , that stefanie and many more revel in , is called " cosplay . "
dressing up as a cartoon character started in japan in the early 80s , when young people masqueraded as their favorite manga characters to pose in tokyo 's entertainment districts . now the trend has caught on in europe .
but it 's not just limited to manga characters .
anything from japanese bands , to disney figures , to hollywood movie characters such as " the pirates of the carribean " is allowed . plastic hair bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a visual kei fan , dressed up as her favorite band member according to jens nave , who works for the manga magazine " animania , " cosplay has its biggest following in germany , followed by france .
about 13,000 fans from germany and neighboring countries participated in the " animagic 2007 " gathering , most of them in full regalia . a good portion of the " cosplayers " are women between 15 and 25 years of age .
cat ears made out of plush are the simplest accessories .
most costumes are sexy and a little trashy .
plastic hair in pink or purple , sometimes falling down to one 's ankles , is a favorite .
short tops , mini skirts and high-heeled boots are popular as well . it is an expensive and time-consuming hobby .
the costumes are usually hand-made , but worn rarely , such as at events like this one at local meetings of fan clubs . visual kei bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an identifying feature of the visual kei followers : a black bag with pictures and buttons another form of cosplay is the co called " visual kei . "
instead of dressing up as anime-characters , youngsters dress up as their favorite bands .

politicians , however , say the troop deployment must continue in the face of a resurgent taliban . the german military must stay in afghanistan until the taliban has been defeated , the leader of the germany 's conservative christian democratic parliamentary party said in an interview made available saturday .
the german mission was not just about the people in afghanistan but also " about ourselves , " volker kauder told berlin-based weekly tagesspiegel am sonntag in a statement to be published sunday .
those asking for a withdrawal of german troops " seriously threaten our security , " kauder said .
the taliban were closely following current discussions in germany and drawing new courage from them , he added .
" but if we say clearly : we 'll stay until the taliban have been defeated , it will weaken their position .
the people in afghanistan also have to be reassured that they can rely on us , " kauder said .
support falling support has plunged in the german population for the country 's military presence in afghanistan , where more than 3,000 german troops and other personnel are helping the nato mission to combat the taliban insurgents .
an extension to the mandates for german forces to be in afghanistan must be renewed parliament by oct .
12 .
an opinion poll conducted after two german engineers were taken hostage showed heightened disapproval of germany 's participation in the nato-led mission .
support for the country 's continued military presence in afghanistan dropped 11 percentage points to 33 percent within the last two months , according to the infratest survey for ard television conducted on july 30-31 .
the number of germans calling for a withdrawal jumped 10 points to 64 percent , the poll of 1,000 german adults showed .
the mood has helped the new left party lead by politician oskar lafontaine , who has called for the withdrawal of all 7,700 german troops serving in foreign missions .
the far-left party 's position is attracting some disgruntled social democrats , unhappy with their party 's more centrist stance .
call for an international increase despite the falling public support , a former social democratic minister , egon bahr , has called for an increase of the international forces in afghanistan from their current 40,000 to " no less than 200,000 men . "
the troops should not stay for one year only , " but for five or ten years , " bahr told the sunday paper welt am sonntag .
the german military should also send more troops , bahr said , although exact numbers had to be decided on after a detailed nato analysis of the situation .
bahr was the brain behind germany 's ostpolitik -lrb- policy aimed at improving relations with east germany , poland , and the soviet union -rrb- in chancellor willy brandt 's social-liberal government coalition during the late 1960s and early 70s .
german forces are not on the front line of combat in afghanistan , but are based in the kunduz province in the relatively quiet northern part of the country .
still , suicide bombers in may killed three german soldiers who were on foot patrol .
while nato would like german troops to join dutch , british and canadian soldiers fighting a resurgent taliban in the south , chancellor angela merkel has refused to authorize such a deployment , saying germany is doing its part in the north .
fate uncertain the fate of the german engineer kidnapped in afghanistan three and a half weeks ago , meanwhile , remained uncertain on saturday .
" the crisis staff is working around the clock to free the german hostage , " a spokeswoman for the foreign ministry said in berlin without giving any further details .
an engineer identified in german media reports as rudolf b. , 62 , was abducted together with a colleague on july 18 - one day before the group of south koreans .
the colleague , 44-year-old rüdiger d. from the state of mecklenburg-western pomerania , was killed by his kidnappers .

politicians , however , say the troop deployment must continue in the face of a resurgent taliban . the german military must stay in afghanistan until the taliban has been defeated , the leader of the germany 's conservative christian democratic parliamentary party said in an interview made available saturday .
the german mission was not just about the people in afghanistan but also " about ourselves , " volker kauder told berlin-based weekly tagesspiegel am sonntag in a statement to be published sunday .
those asking for a withdrawal of german troops " seriously threaten our security , " kauder said .
the taliban were closely following current discussions in germany and drawing new courage from them , he added .
" but if we say clearly : we 'll stay until the taliban have been defeated , it will weaken their position .
the people in afghanistan also have to be reassured that they can rely on us , " kauder said .
support falling support has plunged in the german population for the country 's military presence in afghanistan , where more than 3,000 german troops and other personnel are helping the nato mission to combat the taliban insurgents .
an extension to the mandates for german forces to be in afghanistan must be renewed parliament by oct .
12 .
an opinion poll conducted after two german engineers were taken hostage showed heightened disapproval of germany 's participation in the nato-led mission .
support for the country 's continued military presence in afghanistan dropped 11 percentage points to 33 percent within the last two months , according to the infratest survey for ard television conducted on july 30-31 .
the number of germans calling for a withdrawal jumped 10 points to 64 percent , the poll of 1,000 german adults showed .
the mood has helped the new left party lead by politician oskar lafontaine , who has called for the withdrawal of all 7,700 german troops serving in foreign missions .
the far-left party 's position is attracting some disgruntled social democrats , unhappy with their party 's more centrist stance .
call for an international increase despite the falling public support , a former social democratic minister , egon bahr , has called for an increase of the international forces in afghanistan from their current 40,000 to " no less than 200,000 men . "
the troops should not stay for one year only , " but for five or ten years , " bahr told the sunday paper welt am sonntag .
the german military should also send more troops , bahr said , although exact numbers had to be decided on after a detailed nato analysis of the situation .
bahr was the brain behind germany 's ostpolitik -lrb- policy aimed at improving relations with east germany , poland , and the soviet union -rrb- in chancellor willy brandt 's social-liberal government coalition during the late 1960s and early 70s .
german forces are not on the front line of combat in afghanistan , but are based in the kunduz province in the relatively quiet northern part of the country .
still , suicide bombers in may killed three german soldiers who were on foot patrol .
while nato would like german troops to join dutch , british and canadian soldiers fighting a resurgent taliban in the south , chancellor angela merkel has refused to authorize such a deployment , saying germany is doing its part in the north .
fate uncertain the fate of the german engineer kidnapped in afghanistan three and a half weeks ago , meanwhile , remained uncertain on saturday .
" the crisis staff is working around the clock to free the german hostage , " a spokeswoman for the foreign ministry said in berlin without giving any further details .
an engineer identified in german media reports as rudolf b. , 62 , was abducted together with a colleague on july 18 - one day before the group of south koreans .
the colleague , 44-year-old rüdiger d. from the state of mecklenburg-western pomerania , was killed by his kidnappers .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de travel -pipe- 12.08.2007 bulgaria tries to avoid mass-tourism quagmire großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will bulgaria make the same mistakes as spain 's mallorca ?
the mediterranean island of mallorca has come to symbolize everything bad about cheap , mass tourism : crowded beaches full of drunken louts and cheapskates .
bulgaria 's black sea coast wants to avoid the same fate . bulgarian vacation spots along the black sea are in a quandary .
they are drawn to the short-term money mass tourism brings , but do n't want to make the same mistakes as the spanish . yet without a significant change in direction , that seems to be the way the country 's coastline is headed . investors have built gigantic hotel complexes , significantly increasing the number of beds along the black sea coast .
this has caused a price war .
a night in a holiday apartment costs on average 25 euros -lrb- $ 34.50 -rrb- while a night in a single room can be as little as 2 euros .
hotels without a water view sit nearly empty .
too little infrastructure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tourist ghettos on bulgaria 's gold coast empty beds are only one of the bulgarian tourism industry 's problems .
during the recent building spree , the accompanying infrastructure never materialized , said marin neschkow , head of the tourism board and a tourism expert at the university in varna , the largest city on bulgaria 's black sea coast .
businesses have invested millions of euros to build beautiful hotel grounds , bars and other amenities .
but the corresponding transportation and communication networks are lacking .
there 's also insufficient water supply and sewage treatment , neschkow said .
hotels are built so quickly that skilled workers can not be trained quickly enough .
their apprenticeships take several years .
but the problem , according to neschkow is not the dearth of places in bulgarian training programs , it 's the fact that many students no longer stick around in the summers to work in the bulgarian tourism industry .
instead , they go abroad . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not much elbow room on many of europe 's most popular beaches " tourism pays the lowest average wage in bulgaria .
it is not logical , when one thinks about it , that international tourism amounts to 14 percent of the country 's gross national product , " neschkow said .
tourism provides two billion euros each year , approximately half of bulgaria 's trade deficit .
responsible tourism ?
the tourism industry represents the biggest hope for an economic boom in bulgaria .
the number of tourists continues to rise and bulgaria has managed to build modern hotels , which provide quality similar to that guests would expect to find in central europe .
that contrasts with nearby romania , neschkow said .
but bulgaria needs to be careful not to rely solely on black sea mass tourism , neschkow said .
in the long term , the country will need to increase not only the overall revenue from tourism but also how much each tourist spends .
it seems the bulgarian government is considering a change in its tourism strategy . bildunterschrift : there 's still hope for bulgaria " we 're trying to market bulgaria as a year-round tourism destination , " said stanislaw nowakow of the state tourism agency . " we 're actively promoting the possibilities in health and wellness tourism , since there are a lot of mineral springs in bulgaria .
in the upcoming year we will highlight our cultural monuments and promote bulgaria as a country with a multifaceted cultural past . " dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de film -pipe- 12.08.2007 german expert on nazi films and propaganda großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leni riefenstahl used her considerable talents to make films for the nazis dw-world.de spoke film expert gerd albrecht about movies in the third reich and the fate of party-loyal filmmakers after world war ii . gerd albrecht has been studying film and cinema since the early 1950s .
he was one of the first west german film historians to write about film policy during the nazi regime .
dw-world.de : your book " national socialist film policy " appeared in 1969 .
why was it so long after the war before anyone tackled the topic ?
gerd albrecht : in 1945 , the allies banned the showing of films made during the nazi era .
they also confiscated important documents .
harmless films were soon released to the public , but in the 1950s they still had some 250 politically dubious films under lock and key .
the western allies only relinquished their privileges as an occupation force in 1955 .
the german government , which had inherited the nationalized german film industry , was quick to attend to the business of ensuring the industry 's survival .
the assignment to research national socialist film policy was commissioned in 1959 .
it only became clear over time that the propagandistic aims that found expression in some 1,100 films needed to be examined more carefully .
my research took 10 years despite substantial support from the german government because both the documents and the films were widely scattered .
what characterized nazi film policy ?
was it largely shaped by propaganda minister goebbels ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joseph goebbels was in charge of film policy in the third reich the first and foremost aim of national socialist films was to entertain .
they were intended to be escapist and offer reassurance in the face of everyday hardships .
the further that these films were removed from reality , the better they functioned in national socialist terms .
almost all references to political life and the everyday life of the viewers were missing .
any critical reference to contemporary reality was forbidden .
only a fraction of the films had direct propagandistic aims .
in these , national socialist ideology was presented as an ideal and impressively staged .
goebbels initially wanted 50 percent of the entire film output to be propaganda , but in the end , only 15 percent were .
in accordance with the beloved slogan of the time " ein volk — ein reich — ein führer " -lrb- one people — one empire — one leader -rrb- the propaganda films emphasize either the superiority of the " aryan race " -lrb- " wunschkonzert , " 1940 -rrb- , the superiority of the german reich over its enemies -lrb- " kadetten , " 1941 -rrb- or , of course , the superiority of the " greatest generals of all time " -lrb- " der grosse könig , " 1942 -rrb- .
goebbels decisively shaped contemporary film production .
he could almost always be sure he had the backing of adolf hitler .
both of them were not only enthusiastic film viewers , but they also had a firm grasp of this medium .
goebbels watched the majority of feature films before they were premiered .
he made changes in many cases .
according to your research , less than 15 percent of films produced under the nazis were war and propaganda films .
who went to see what ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : famous stars like zarah leander lured people to the cinemas the small group of propaganda films was , on average , seen by many more people than the apolitical films were .
these films were in more cinemas because of tax breaks and political pressure .
secondly , viewers liked going to see these films .
they were better made and were cast with more prominent actors .
since you could also be sure to encounter nazi propaganda , people would learn what they should say about political issues in general .
as a result , box office figures for these films were , on average , 50 percent higher than the proportion of film production given over to them .
they accounted for one in four or one in five cinema visits .
during the war years , in particular , they reached 15 to 25 million paying viewers .
were there nazi directors and nazi actors ?
would people like leni riefenstahl and zarah leander have become well known without the nazis ?
of course , some of the directors and actors were national socialists , along with other film people .
as in the population at large , some were passionate nazis , the others more half-hearted .
some were opportunists and while some were critical , they did n't voice criticism openly .
people like leni riefenstahl , zarah leander and veit harlan would have become famous in the industry without the nazis .
but in the case of karl ritter it 's questionable whether he would have been able to shoot his 14 films considering how wooden they were .
what happened to the directors and actors who worked for hitler after the war ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the director of a virulently anti-semitic film was acquitted and able to resume work the directors and actors who worked during the third reich on behalf of the regime were quickly able to resume their work after the war although there were differences between east and west germany .
while allied-german de-nazification courts did impose professional bans of various lengths and , in some cases , financial penalties , it was n't long before filmmakers were back behind the camera — veit harlan was the only one to appear before a proper court on charges of crimes against humanity in " jud süss " -lrb- the jew süss -rrb- in 1940 .
he was acquitted both times – under the jurisdiction of the occupying forces .
it was ruled that " jud süss " did represent a crime against humanity , but it was found that he was acting under pressure .
in 1950 he was able to resume filming in germany .
how do you see the current discussion surrounding tom cruise 's controversial film valkyrie ?
i hope the film " valkyrie " will be good and provide a worthy memorial to the german resistance and not only the officers .
tom cruise will hopefully contribute to the success of the film .
given his previous performances , he is obviously up to the role of playing stauffenberg , but we should n't forget the significance of the scriptwriter and director .
the fact that cruise is a scientologist is a personal matter for him , just as it is my personal business that i reject scientology .
the film and those who go to see it will neither be harmed nor will it profit from the fact that cruise is a scientologist .
for that reason , i think the current debate around his scientology membership to be superfluous and wrong .
besides , the nazis quickly realized that what was important about filmmakers was not their beliefs , but their talent and reliability .

today , german youngsters dress up as manga-characters and idolize japanese music bands . " i 'm queen esther , " said a young woman , whose might be compared to a futuristic disco-snow queen , if something like that existed .
she 's wearing a fairytale dress of silk with a hoop skirt , puffy shoulders and a corset - everything covered with pearls and rhinestones .
her large collar is turned up , making looking to the left or right difficult , but works well with the crown .
fashion 's not easy . her coat is faux leopard skin , completing the look . in reality , queen esther is stefanie wittman , and has a somewhat less elegant real-world vocation - she 's an employee at a car manufacturer .
but to fulfil her queenly duties , she recently drove over five hours to the city of bonn to participate in a fan fair for the japanese manga series called " animagic . " manga is a japanese word for comics and print cartoons .

the costume play , that stefanie and many more revel in , is called " cosplay . "
dressing up as a cartoon character started in japan in the early 80s , when young people masqueraded as their favorite manga characters to pose in tokyo 's entertainment districts . now the trend has caught on in europe .

cat ears made out of plush are the simplest accessories .
most costumes are sexy and a little trashy .
plastic hair in pink or purple , sometimes falling down to one 's ankles , is a favorite .
short tops , mini skirts and high-heeled boots are popular as well . it is an expensive and time-consuming hobby .
the costumes are usually hand-made , but worn rarely , such as at events like this one at local meetings of fan clubs . visual kei bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an identifying feature of the visual kei followers : a black bag with pictures and buttons another form of cosplay is the co called " visual kei .

today , german youngsters dress up as manga-characters and idolize japanese music bands . " i 'm queen esther , " said a young woman , whose might be compared to a futuristic disco-snow queen , if something like that existed .
she 's wearing a fairytale dress of silk with a hoop skirt , puffy shoulders and a corset - everything covered with pearls and rhinestones .
her large collar is turned up , making looking to the left or right difficult , but works well with the crown .
fashion 's not easy . her coat is faux leopard skin , completing the look . in reality , queen esther is stefanie wittman , and has a somewhat less elegant real-world vocation - she 's an employee at a car manufacturer .
but to fulfil her queenly duties , she recently drove over five hours to the city of bonn to participate in a fan fair for the japanese manga series called " animagic . " manga is a japanese word for comics and print cartoons .
to non-japanese , it refers specifically to comics originally published in japan . cosplay : the new way of dressing up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are few limits when it comes to cosplay queen esther is a character from the japanese television show " trinity blood . "
the costume play , that stefanie and many more revel in , is called " cosplay . "
dressing up as a cartoon character started in japan in the early 80s , when young people masqueraded as their favorite manga characters to pose in tokyo 's entertainment districts . now the trend has caught on in europe .
but it 's not just limited to manga characters .
anything from japanese bands , to disney figures , to hollywood movie characters such as " the pirates of the carribean " is allowed . plastic hair bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a visual kei fan , dressed up as her favorite band member according to jens nave , who works for the manga magazine " animania , " cosplay has its biggest following in germany , followed by france .
about 13,000 fans from germany and neighboring countries participated in the " animagic 2007 " gathering , most of them in full regalia . a good portion of the " cosplayers " are women between 15 and 25 years of age .
cat ears made out of plush are the simplest accessories .
most costumes are sexy and a little trashy .
plastic hair in pink or purple , sometimes falling down to one 's ankles , is a favorite .
short tops , mini skirts and high-heeled boots are popular as well . it is an expensive and time-consuming hobby .
the costumes are usually hand-made , but worn rarely , such as at events like this one at local meetings of fan clubs . visual kei bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an identifying feature of the visual kei followers : a black bag with pictures and buttons another form of cosplay is the co called " visual kei . "
instead of dressing up as anime-characters , youngsters dress up as their favorite bands .
fans of this are usually recognizable by a black bag they carry that 's accessorized with safety pins , buttons and pictures of japanese band members on it .
their hair is usually dyed black with neon-colored highlights .
the look often has an androgynous aesthetic . inspired by glam-rockers such as david bowie and kiss , youngsters consciously try to blur the lines between male and the female . outsiders assume that followers of the visual kei movement are also fans of the german band tokio hotel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german band tokio hotel is no favorite of visual kei fans " i hate it when people connect visual kei to tokio hotel , those two have nothing in common ! " said antje eggers .

and , the fact that it 's sung in japanese plays a role as well . according to nave , visual kei as a subculture that is slowly becoming mainstream .
the first visual kei concert in germany of a band named " dir en grey " sold out in berlin quickly although there was little advertising about it .

but to fulfil her queenly duties , she recently drove over five hours to the city of bonn to participate in a fan fair for the japanese manga series called " animagic . " manga is a japanese word for comics and print cartoons .
to non-japanese , it refers specifically to comics originally published in japan . cosplay : the new way of dressing up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are few limits when it comes to cosplay queen esther is a character from the japanese television show " trinity blood . "
the costume play , that stefanie and many more revel in , is called " cosplay . "
dressing up as a cartoon character started in japan in the early 80s , when young people masqueraded as their favorite manga characters to pose in tokyo 's entertainment districts . now the trend has caught on in europe .
but it 's not just limited to manga characters .
anything from japanese bands , to disney figures , to hollywood movie characters such as " the pirates of the carribean " is allowed . plastic hair bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a visual kei fan , dressed up as her favorite band member according to jens nave , who works for the manga magazine " animania , " cosplay has its biggest following in germany , followed by france .
about 13,000 fans from germany and neighboring countries participated in the " animagic 2007 " gathering , most of them in full regalia . a good portion of the " cosplayers " are women between 15 and 25 years of age .
cat ears made out of plush are the simplest accessories .
most costumes are sexy and a little trashy .
plastic hair in pink or purple , sometimes falling down to one 's ankles , is a favorite .
short tops , mini skirts and high-heeled boots are popular as well . it is an expensive and time-consuming hobby .
the costumes are usually hand-made , but worn rarely , such as at events like this one at local meetings of fan clubs . visual kei bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an identifying feature of the visual kei followers : a black bag with pictures and buttons another form of cosplay is the co called " visual kei . "
instead of dressing up as anime-characters , youngsters dress up as their favorite bands .
fans of this are usually recognizable by a black bag they carry that 's accessorized with safety pins , buttons and pictures of japanese band members on it .
their hair is usually dyed black with neon-colored highlights .
the look often has an androgynous aesthetic . inspired by glam-rockers such as david bowie and kiss , youngsters consciously try to blur the lines between male and the female . outsiders assume that followers of the visual kei movement are also fans of the german band tokio hotel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german band tokio hotel is no favorite of visual kei fans " i hate it when people connect visual kei to tokio hotel , those two have nothing in common ! " said antje eggers .
the music antje really likes is quite harder and takes longer to get into than the german band .
and , the fact that it 's sung in japanese plays a role as well . according to nave , visual kei as a subculture that is slowly becoming mainstream .
the first visual kei concert in germany of a band named " dir en grey " sold out in berlin quickly although there was little advertising about it .
fans communicate through internet forums and exchange information about events . nave is sure that the fan base will continue to grow and says do n't be surprised if you see life-size clones of japanese cartoon characters on german streets before too long . dw staff -lrb- tip -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the mediterranean island of mallorca has come to symbolize everything bad about cheap , mass tourism : crowded beaches full of drunken louts and cheapskates .
bulgaria 's black sea coast wants to avoid the same fate . bulgarian vacation spots along the black sea are in a quandary .
they are drawn to the short-term money mass tourism brings , but do n't want to make the same mistakes as the spanish . yet without a significant change in direction , that seems to be the way the country 's coastline is headed . investors have built gigantic hotel complexes , significantly increasing the number of beds along the black sea coast .
this has caused a price war .
a night in a holiday apartment costs on average 25 euros -lrb- $ 34.50 -rrb- while a night in a single room can be as little as 2 euros .
hotels without a water view sit nearly empty .
too little infrastructure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tourist ghettos on bulgaria 's gold coast empty beds are only one of the bulgarian tourism industry 's problems .
during the recent building spree , the accompanying infrastructure never materialized , said marin neschkow , head of the tourism board and a tourism expert at the university in varna , the largest city on bulgaria 's black sea coast .
businesses have invested millions of euros to build beautiful hotel grounds , bars and other amenities .
but the corresponding transportation and communication networks are lacking .
there 's also insufficient water supply and sewage treatment , neschkow said .
hotels are built so quickly that skilled workers can not be trained quickly enough .
their apprenticeships take several years .
but the problem , according to neschkow is not the dearth of places in bulgarian training programs , it 's the fact that many students no longer stick around in the summers to work in the bulgarian tourism industry .
instead , they go abroad . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not much elbow room on many of europe 's most popular beaches " tourism pays the lowest average wage in bulgaria .
it is not logical , when one thinks about it , that international tourism amounts to 14 percent of the country 's gross national product , " neschkow said .
tourism provides two billion euros each year , approximately half of bulgaria 's trade deficit .
responsible tourism ?
the tourism industry represents the biggest hope for an economic boom in bulgaria .
the number of tourists continues to rise and bulgaria has managed to build modern hotels , which provide quality similar to that guests would expect to find in central europe .
that contrasts with nearby romania , neschkow said .
but bulgaria needs to be careful not to rely solely on black sea mass tourism , neschkow said .
in the long term , the country will need to increase not only the overall revenue from tourism but also how much each tourist spends .
it seems the bulgarian government is considering a change in its tourism strategy . bildunterschrift : there 's still hope for bulgaria " we 're trying to market bulgaria as a year-round tourism destination , " said stanislaw nowakow of the state tourism agency .

the mediterranean island of mallorca has come to symbolize everything bad about cheap , mass tourism : crowded beaches full of drunken louts and cheapskates .
bulgaria 's black sea coast wants to avoid the same fate . bulgarian vacation spots along the black sea are in a quandary .
they are drawn to the short-term money mass tourism brings , but do n't want to make the same mistakes as the spanish . yet without a significant change in direction , that seems to be the way the country 's coastline is headed . investors have built gigantic hotel complexes , significantly increasing the number of beds along the black sea coast .
this has caused a price war .
a night in a holiday apartment costs on average 25 euros -lrb- $ 34.50 -rrb- while a night in a single room can be as little as 2 euros .
hotels without a water view sit nearly empty .
too little infrastructure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tourist ghettos on bulgaria 's gold coast empty beds are only one of the bulgarian tourism industry 's problems .
during the recent building spree , the accompanying infrastructure never materialized , said marin neschkow , head of the tourism board and a tourism expert at the university in varna , the largest city on bulgaria 's black sea coast .
businesses have invested millions of euros to build beautiful hotel grounds , bars and other amenities .
but the corresponding transportation and communication networks are lacking .
there 's also insufficient water supply and sewage treatment , neschkow said .
hotels are built so quickly that skilled workers can not be trained quickly enough .
their apprenticeships take several years .
but the problem , according to neschkow is not the dearth of places in bulgarian training programs , it 's the fact that many students no longer stick around in the summers to work in the bulgarian tourism industry .
instead , they go abroad . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not much elbow room on many of europe 's most popular beaches " tourism pays the lowest average wage in bulgaria .
it is not logical , when one thinks about it , that international tourism amounts to 14 percent of the country 's gross national product , " neschkow said .
tourism provides two billion euros each year , approximately half of bulgaria 's trade deficit .
responsible tourism ?
the tourism industry represents the biggest hope for an economic boom in bulgaria .
the number of tourists continues to rise and bulgaria has managed to build modern hotels , which provide quality similar to that guests would expect to find in central europe .
that contrasts with nearby romania , neschkow said .
but bulgaria needs to be careful not to rely solely on black sea mass tourism , neschkow said .
in the long term , the country will need to increase not only the overall revenue from tourism but also how much each tourist spends .
it seems the bulgarian government is considering a change in its tourism strategy . bildunterschrift : there 's still hope for bulgaria " we 're trying to market bulgaria as a year-round tourism destination , " said stanislaw nowakow of the state tourism agency .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de film -pipe- 12.08.2007 german expert on nazi films and propaganda großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leni riefenstahl used her considerable talents to make films for the nazis dw-world.de spoke film expert gerd albrecht about movies in the third reich and the fate of party-loyal filmmakers after world war ii . gerd albrecht has been studying film and cinema since the early 1950s .
he was one of the first west german film historians to write about film policy during the nazi regime .
dw-world.de : your book " national socialist film policy " appeared in 1969 .
why was it so long after the war before anyone tackled the topic ?
gerd albrecht : in 1945 , the allies banned the showing of films made during the nazi era .
they also confiscated important documents .
harmless films were soon released to the public , but in the 1950s they still had some 250 politically dubious films under lock and key .
the western allies only relinquished their privileges as an occupation force in 1955 .
the german government , which had inherited the nationalized german film industry , was quick to attend to the business of ensuring the industry 's survival .
the assignment to research national socialist film policy was commissioned in 1959 .
it only became clear over time that the propagandistic aims that found expression in some 1,100 films needed to be examined more carefully .
my research took 10 years despite substantial support from the german government because both the documents and the films were widely scattered .
what characterized nazi film policy ?
was it largely shaped by propaganda minister goebbels ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joseph goebbels was in charge of film policy in the third reich the first and foremost aim of national socialist films was to entertain .
they were intended to be escapist and offer reassurance in the face of everyday hardships .
the further that these films were removed from reality , the better they functioned in national socialist terms .
almost all references to political life and the everyday life of the viewers were missing .
any critical reference to contemporary reality was forbidden .
only a fraction of the films had direct propagandistic aims .
in these , national socialist ideology was presented as an ideal and impressively staged .
goebbels initially wanted 50 percent of the entire film output to be propaganda , but in the end , only 15 percent were .
in accordance with the beloved slogan of the time " ein volk — ein reich — ein führer " -lrb- one people — one empire — one leader -rrb- the propaganda films emphasize either the superiority of the " aryan race " -lrb- " wunschkonzert , " 1940 -rrb- , the superiority of the german reich over its enemies -lrb- " kadetten , " 1941 -rrb- or , of course , the superiority of the " greatest generals of all time " -lrb- " der grosse könig , " 1942 -rrb- .
goebbels decisively shaped contemporary film production .
he could almost always be sure he had the backing of adolf hitler .
both of them were not only enthusiastic film viewers , but they also had a firm grasp of this medium .
goebbels watched the majority of feature films before they were premiered .
he made changes in many cases .
according to your research , less than 15 percent of films produced under the nazis were war and propaganda films .
who went to see what ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : famous stars like zarah leander lured people to the cinemas the small group of propaganda films was , on average , seen by many more people than the apolitical films were .
these films were in more cinemas because of tax breaks and political pressure .
secondly , viewers liked going to see these films .
they were better made and were cast with more prominent actors .
since you could also be sure to encounter nazi propaganda , people would learn what they should say about political issues in general .
as a result , box office figures for these films were , on average , 50 percent higher than the proportion of film production given over to them .
they accounted for one in four or one in five cinema visits .
during the war years , in particular , they reached 15 to 25 million paying viewers .
were there nazi directors and nazi actors ?
would people like leni riefenstahl and zarah leander have become well known without the nazis ?
of course , some of the directors and actors were national socialists , along with other film people .
as in the population at large , some were passionate nazis , the others more half-hearted .
some were opportunists and while some were critical , they did n't voice criticism openly .
people like leni riefenstahl , zarah leander and veit harlan would have become famous in the industry without the nazis .
but in the case of karl ritter it 's questionable whether he would have been able to shoot his 14 films considering how wooden they were .
what happened to the directors and actors who worked for hitler after the war ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the director of a virulently anti-semitic film was acquitted and able to resume work the directors and actors who worked during the third reich on behalf of the regime were quickly able to resume their work after the war although there were differences between east and west germany .
while allied-german de-nazification courts did impose professional bans of various lengths and , in some cases , financial penalties , it was n't long before filmmakers were back behind the camera — veit harlan was the only one to appear before a proper court on charges of crimes against humanity in " jud süss " -lrb- the jew süss -rrb- in 1940 .
he was acquitted both times – under the jurisdiction of the occupying forces .
it was ruled that " jud süss " did represent a crime against humanity , but it was found that he was acting under pressure .
in 1950 he was able to resume filming in germany .
how do you see the current discussion surrounding tom cruise 's controversial film valkyrie ?
i hope the film " valkyrie " will be good and provide a worthy memorial to the german resistance and not only the officers .
tom cruise will hopefully contribute to the success of the film .
given his previous performances , he is obviously up to the role of playing stauffenberg , but we should n't forget the significance of the scriptwriter and director .
the fact that cruise is a scientologist is a personal matter for him , just as it is my personal business that i reject scientology .
the film and those who go to see it will neither be harmed nor will it profit from the fact that cruise is a scientologist .
for that reason , i think the current debate around his scientology membership to be superfluous and wrong .
besides , the nazis quickly realized that what was important about filmmakers was not their beliefs , but their talent and reliability .

he was one of the first west german film historians to write about film policy during the nazi regime .
dw-world.de : your book " national socialist film policy " appeared in 1969 .
why was it so long after the war before anyone tackled the topic ?
gerd albrecht : in 1945 , the allies banned the showing of films made during the nazi era .
they also confiscated important documents .
harmless films were soon released to the public , but in the 1950s they still had some 250 politically dubious films under lock and key .
the western allies only relinquished their privileges as an occupation force in 1955 .
the german government , which had inherited the nationalized german film industry , was quick to attend to the business of ensuring the industry 's survival .
the assignment to research national socialist film policy was commissioned in 1959 .
it only became clear over time that the propagandistic aims that found expression in some 1,100 films needed to be examined more carefully .
my research took 10 years despite substantial support from the german government because both the documents and the films were widely scattered .
what characterized nazi film policy ?
was it largely shaped by propaganda minister goebbels ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joseph goebbels was in charge of film policy in the third reich the first and foremost aim of national socialist films was to entertain .
they were intended to be escapist and offer reassurance in the face of everyday hardships .
the further that these films were removed from reality , the better they functioned in national socialist terms .
almost all references to political life and the everyday life of the viewers were missing .
any critical reference to contemporary reality was forbidden .
only a fraction of the films had direct propagandistic aims .
in these , national socialist ideology was presented as an ideal and impressively staged .
goebbels initially wanted 50 percent of the entire film output to be propaganda , but in the end , only 15 percent were .
in accordance with the beloved slogan of the time " ein volk — ein reich — ein führer " -lrb- one people — one empire — one leader -rrb- the propaganda films emphasize either the superiority of the " aryan race " -lrb- " wunschkonzert , " 1940 -rrb- , the superiority of the german reich over its enemies -lrb- " kadetten , " 1941 -rrb- or , of course , the superiority of the " greatest generals of all time " -lrb- " der grosse könig , " 1942 -rrb- .
goebbels decisively shaped contemporary film production .
he could almost always be sure he had the backing of adolf hitler .
both of them were not only enthusiastic film viewers , but they also had a firm grasp of this medium .
goebbels watched the majority of feature films before they were premiered .
he made changes in many cases .
according to your research , less than 15 percent of films produced under the nazis were war and propaganda films .
who went to see what ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : famous stars like zarah leander lured people to the cinemas the small group of propaganda films was , on average , seen by many more people than the apolitical films were .
these films were in more cinemas because of tax breaks and political pressure .
secondly , viewers liked going to see these films .
they were better made and were cast with more prominent actors .
since you could also be sure to encounter nazi propaganda , people would learn what they should say about political issues in general .
as a result , box office figures for these films were , on average , 50 percent higher than the proportion of film production given over to them .
they accounted for one in four or one in five cinema visits .
during the war years , in particular , they reached 15 to 25 million paying viewers .
were there nazi directors and nazi actors ?
would people like leni riefenstahl and zarah leander have become well known without the nazis ?
of course , some of the directors and actors were national socialists , along with other film people .
as in the population at large , some were passionate nazis , the others more half-hearted .
some were opportunists and while some were critical , they did n't voice criticism openly .
people like leni riefenstahl , zarah leander and veit harlan would have become famous in the industry without the nazis .
but in the case of karl ritter it 's questionable whether he would have been able to shoot his 14 films considering how wooden they were .
what happened to the directors and actors who worked for hitler after the war ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the director of a virulently anti-semitic film was acquitted and able to resume work the directors and actors who worked during the third reich on behalf of the regime were quickly able to resume their work after the war although there were differences between east and west germany .
while allied-german de-nazification courts did impose professional bans of various lengths and , in some cases , financial penalties , it was n't long before filmmakers were back behind the camera — veit harlan was the only one to appear before a proper court on charges of crimes against humanity in " jud süss " -lrb- the jew süss -rrb- in 1940 .
he was acquitted both times – under the jurisdiction of the occupying forces .
it was ruled that " jud süss " did represent a crime against humanity , but it was found that he was acting under pressure .
in 1950 he was able to resume filming in germany .
how do you see the current discussion surrounding tom cruise 's controversial film valkyrie ?
i hope the film " valkyrie " will be good and provide a worthy memorial to the german resistance and not only the officers .
tom cruise will hopefully contribute to the success of the film .
given his previous performances , he is obviously up to the role of playing stauffenberg , but we should n't forget the significance of the scriptwriter and director .
the fact that cruise is a scientologist is a personal matter for him , just as it is my personal business that i reject scientology .
the film and those who go to see it will neither be harmed nor will it profit from the fact that cruise is a scientologist .
for that reason , i think the current debate around his scientology membership to be superfluous and wrong .
besides , the nazis quickly realized that what was important about filmmakers was not their beliefs , but their talent and reliability .

it only became clear over time that the propagandistic aims that found expression in some 1,100 films needed to be examined more carefully .
my research took 10 years despite substantial support from the german government because both the documents and the films were widely scattered .
what characterized nazi film policy ?
was it largely shaped by propaganda minister goebbels ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joseph goebbels was in charge of film policy in the third reich the first and foremost aim of national socialist films was to entertain .
they were intended to be escapist and offer reassurance in the face of everyday hardships .
the further that these films were removed from reality , the better they functioned in national socialist terms .
almost all references to political life and the everyday life of the viewers were missing .
any critical reference to contemporary reality was forbidden .
only a fraction of the films had direct propagandistic aims .
in these , national socialist ideology was presented as an ideal and impressively staged .
goebbels initially wanted 50 percent of the entire film output to be propaganda , but in the end , only 15 percent were .
in accordance with the beloved slogan of the time " ein volk — ein reich — ein führer " -lrb- one people — one empire — one leader -rrb- the propaganda films emphasize either the superiority of the " aryan race " -lrb- " wunschkonzert , " 1940 -rrb- , the superiority of the german reich over its enemies -lrb- " kadetten , " 1941 -rrb- or , of course , the superiority of the " greatest generals of all time " -lrb- " der grosse könig , " 1942 -rrb- .
goebbels decisively shaped contemporary film production .
he could almost always be sure he had the backing of adolf hitler .
both of them were not only enthusiastic film viewers , but they also had a firm grasp of this medium .
goebbels watched the majority of feature films before they were premiered .
he made changes in many cases .
according to your research , less than 15 percent of films produced under the nazis were war and propaganda films .
who went to see what ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : famous stars like zarah leander lured people to the cinemas the small group of propaganda films was , on average , seen by many more people than the apolitical films were .
these films were in more cinemas because of tax breaks and political pressure .
secondly , viewers liked going to see these films .
they were better made and were cast with more prominent actors .
since you could also be sure to encounter nazi propaganda , people would learn what they should say about political issues in general .
as a result , box office figures for these films were , on average , 50 percent higher than the proportion of film production given over to them .
they accounted for one in four or one in five cinema visits .
during the war years , in particular , they reached 15 to 25 million paying viewers .
were there nazi directors and nazi actors ?
would people like leni riefenstahl and zarah leander have become well known without the nazis ?
of course , some of the directors and actors were national socialists , along with other film people .
as in the population at large , some were passionate nazis , the others more half-hearted .
some were opportunists and while some were critical , they did n't voice criticism openly .
people like leni riefenstahl , zarah leander and veit harlan would have become famous in the industry without the nazis .
but in the case of karl ritter it 's questionable whether he would have been able to shoot his 14 films considering how wooden they were .
what happened to the directors and actors who worked for hitler after the war ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the director of a virulently anti-semitic film was acquitted and able to resume work the directors and actors who worked during the third reich on behalf of the regime were quickly able to resume their work after the war although there were differences between east and west germany .
while allied-german de-nazification courts did impose professional bans of various lengths and , in some cases , financial penalties , it was n't long before filmmakers were back behind the camera — veit harlan was the only one to appear before a proper court on charges of crimes against humanity in " jud süss " -lrb- the jew süss -rrb- in 1940 .
he was acquitted both times – under the jurisdiction of the occupying forces .
it was ruled that " jud süss " did represent a crime against humanity , but it was found that he was acting under pressure .
in 1950 he was able to resume filming in germany .
how do you see the current discussion surrounding tom cruise 's controversial film valkyrie ?
i hope the film " valkyrie " will be good and provide a worthy memorial to the german resistance and not only the officers .
tom cruise will hopefully contribute to the success of the film .
given his previous performances , he is obviously up to the role of playing stauffenberg , but we should n't forget the significance of the scriptwriter and director .
the fact that cruise is a scientologist is a personal matter for him , just as it is my personal business that i reject scientology .
the film and those who go to see it will neither be harmed nor will it profit from the fact that cruise is a scientologist .
for that reason , i think the current debate around his scientology membership to be superfluous and wrong .
besides , the nazis quickly realized that what was important about filmmakers was not their beliefs , but their talent and reliability .

he was one of the first west german film historians to write about film policy during the nazi regime .
dw-world.de : your book " national socialist film policy " appeared in 1969 .
why was it so long after the war before anyone tackled the topic ?
gerd albrecht : in 1945 , the allies banned the showing of films made during the nazi era .
they also confiscated important documents .
harmless films were soon released to the public , but in the 1950s they still had some 250 politically dubious films under lock and key .
the western allies only relinquished their privileges as an occupation force in 1955 .
the german government , which had inherited the nationalized german film industry , was quick to attend to the business of ensuring the industry 's survival .

the mediterranean island of mallorca has come to symbolize everything bad about cheap , mass tourism : crowded beaches full of drunken louts and cheapskates .
bulgaria 's black sea coast wants to avoid the same fate . bulgarian vacation spots along the black sea are in a quandary .
they are drawn to the short-term money mass tourism brings , but do n't want to make the same mistakes as the spanish . yet without a significant change in direction , that seems to be the way the country 's coastline is headed . investors have built gigantic hotel complexes , significantly increasing the number of beds along the black sea coast .
this has caused a price war .
a night in a holiday apartment costs on average 25 euros -lrb- $ 34.50 -rrb- while a night in a single room can be as little as 2 euros .
hotels without a water view sit nearly empty .
too little infrastructure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tourist ghettos on bulgaria 's gold coast empty beds are only one of the bulgarian tourism industry 's problems .
during the recent building spree , the accompanying infrastructure never materialized , said marin neschkow , head of the tourism board and a tourism expert at the university in varna , the largest city on bulgaria 's black sea coast .
businesses have invested millions of euros to build beautiful hotel grounds , bars and other amenities .
but the corresponding transportation and communication networks are lacking .
there 's also insufficient water supply and sewage treatment , neschkow said .
hotels are built so quickly that skilled workers can not be trained quickly enough .
their apprenticeships take several years .
but the problem , according to neschkow is not the dearth of places in bulgarian training programs , it 's the fact that many students no longer stick around in the summers to work in the bulgarian tourism industry .
instead , they go abroad . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not much elbow room on many of europe 's most popular beaches " tourism pays the lowest average wage in bulgaria .
it is not logical , when one thinks about it , that international tourism amounts to 14 percent of the country 's gross national product , " neschkow said .
tourism provides two billion euros each year , approximately half of bulgaria 's trade deficit .
responsible tourism ?
the tourism industry represents the biggest hope for an economic boom in bulgaria .
the number of tourists continues to rise and bulgaria has managed to build modern hotels , which provide quality similar to that guests would expect to find in central europe .
that contrasts with nearby romania , neschkow said .
but bulgaria needs to be careful not to rely solely on black sea mass tourism , neschkow said .
in the long term , the country will need to increase not only the overall revenue from tourism but also how much each tourist spends .
it seems the bulgarian government is considering a change in its tourism strategy . bildunterschrift : there 's still hope for bulgaria " we 're trying to market bulgaria as a year-round tourism destination , " said stanislaw nowakow of the state tourism agency . " we 're actively promoting the possibilities in health and wellness tourism , since there are a lot of mineral springs in bulgaria .
in the upcoming year we will highlight our cultural monuments and promote bulgaria as a country with a multifaceted cultural past . " dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

today , german youngsters dress up as manga-characters and idolize japanese music bands . " i 'm queen esther , " said a young woman , whose might be compared to a futuristic disco-snow queen , if something like that existed .
she 's wearing a fairytale dress of silk with a hoop skirt , puffy shoulders and a corset - everything covered with pearls and rhinestones .
her large collar is turned up , making looking to the left or right difficult , but works well with the crown .
fashion 's not easy . her coat is faux leopard skin , completing the look . in reality , queen esther is stefanie wittman , and has a somewhat less elegant real-world vocation - she 's an employee at a car manufacturer .
but to fulfil her queenly duties , she recently drove over five hours to the city of bonn to participate in a fan fair for the japanese manga series called " animagic . " manga is a japanese word for comics and print cartoons .
to non-japanese , it refers specifically to comics originally published in japan . cosplay : the new way of dressing up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are few limits when it comes to cosplay queen esther is a character from the japanese television show " trinity blood . "
the costume play , that stefanie and many more revel in , is called " cosplay . "
dressing up as a cartoon character started in japan in the early 80s , when young people masqueraded as their favorite manga characters to pose in tokyo 's entertainment districts . now the trend has caught on in europe .
but it 's not just limited to manga characters .
anything from japanese bands , to disney figures , to hollywood movie characters such as " the pirates of the carribean " is allowed . plastic hair bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a visual kei fan , dressed up as her favorite band member according to jens nave , who works for the manga magazine " animania , " cosplay has its biggest following in germany , followed by france .
about 13,000 fans from germany and neighboring countries participated in the " animagic 2007 " gathering , most of them in full regalia . a good portion of the " cosplayers " are women between 15 and 25 years of age .
cat ears made out of plush are the simplest accessories .
most costumes are sexy and a little trashy .
plastic hair in pink or purple , sometimes falling down to one 's ankles , is a favorite .
short tops , mini skirts and high-heeled boots are popular as well . it is an expensive and time-consuming hobby .
the costumes are usually hand-made , but worn rarely , such as at events like this one at local meetings of fan clubs . visual kei bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an identifying feature of the visual kei followers : a black bag with pictures and buttons another form of cosplay is the co called " visual kei . "
instead of dressing up as anime-characters , youngsters dress up as their favorite bands .
fans of this are usually recognizable by a black bag they carry that 's accessorized with safety pins , buttons and pictures of japanese band members on it .
their hair is usually dyed black with neon-colored highlights .
the look often has an androgynous aesthetic . inspired by glam-rockers such as david bowie and kiss , youngsters consciously try to blur the lines between male and the female . outsiders assume that followers of the visual kei movement are also fans of the german band tokio hotel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german band tokio hotel is no favorite of visual kei fans " i hate it when people connect visual kei to tokio hotel , those two have nothing in common ! " said antje eggers .
the music antje really likes is quite harder and takes longer to get into than the german band .
and , the fact that it 's sung in japanese plays a role as well . according to nave , visual kei as a subculture that is slowly becoming mainstream .
the first visual kei concert in germany of a band named " dir en grey " sold out in berlin quickly although there was little advertising about it .
fans communicate through internet forums and exchange information about events . nave is sure that the fan base will continue to grow and says do n't be surprised if you see life-size clones of japanese cartoon characters on german streets before too long . dw staff -lrb- tip -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

today , german youngsters dress up as manga-characters and idolize japanese music bands . " i 'm queen esther , " said a young woman , whose might be compared to a futuristic disco-snow queen , if something like that existed .
she 's wearing a fairytale dress of silk with a hoop skirt , puffy shoulders and a corset - everything covered with pearls and rhinestones .
her large collar is turned up , making looking to the left or right difficult , but works well with the crown .
fashion 's not easy . her coat is faux leopard skin , completing the look . in reality , queen esther is stefanie wittman , and has a somewhat less elegant real-world vocation - she 's an employee at a car manufacturer .
but to fulfil her queenly duties , she recently drove over five hours to the city of bonn to participate in a fan fair for the japanese manga series called " animagic . " manga is a japanese word for comics and print cartoons .
to non-japanese , it refers specifically to comics originally published in japan . cosplay : the new way of dressing up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are few limits when it comes to cosplay queen esther is a character from the japanese television show " trinity blood . "
the costume play , that stefanie and many more revel in , is called " cosplay . "
dressing up as a cartoon character started in japan in the early 80s , when young people masqueraded as their favorite manga characters to pose in tokyo 's entertainment districts . now the trend has caught on in europe .
but it 's not just limited to manga characters .
anything from japanese bands , to disney figures , to hollywood movie characters such as " the pirates of the carribean " is allowed . plastic hair bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a visual kei fan , dressed up as her favorite band member according to jens nave , who works for the manga magazine " animania , " cosplay has its biggest following in germany , followed by france .
about 13,000 fans from germany and neighboring countries participated in the " animagic 2007 " gathering , most of them in full regalia . a good portion of the " cosplayers " are women between 15 and 25 years of age .
cat ears made out of plush are the simplest accessories .
most costumes are sexy and a little trashy .
plastic hair in pink or purple , sometimes falling down to one 's ankles , is a favorite .
short tops , mini skirts and high-heeled boots are popular as well . it is an expensive and time-consuming hobby .
the costumes are usually hand-made , but worn rarely , such as at events like this one at local meetings of fan clubs . visual kei bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an identifying feature of the visual kei followers : a black bag with pictures and buttons another form of cosplay is the co called " visual kei . "
instead of dressing up as anime-characters , youngsters dress up as their favorite bands .
fans of this are usually recognizable by a black bag they carry that 's accessorized with safety pins , buttons and pictures of japanese band members on it .
their hair is usually dyed black with neon-colored highlights .
the look often has an androgynous aesthetic . inspired by glam-rockers such as david bowie and kiss , youngsters consciously try to blur the lines between male and the female . outsiders assume that followers of the visual kei movement are also fans of the german band tokio hotel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german band tokio hotel is no favorite of visual kei fans " i hate it when people connect visual kei to tokio hotel , those two have nothing in common ! " said antje eggers .
the music antje really likes is quite harder and takes longer to get into than the german band .
and , the fact that it 's sung in japanese plays a role as well . according to nave , visual kei as a subculture that is slowly becoming mainstream .
the first visual kei concert in germany of a band named " dir en grey " sold out in berlin quickly although there was little advertising about it .
fans communicate through internet forums and exchange information about events . nave is sure that the fan base will continue to grow and says do n't be surprised if you see life-size clones of japanese cartoon characters on german streets before too long . dw staff -lrb- tip -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the mediterranean island of mallorca has come to symbolize everything bad about cheap , mass tourism : crowded beaches full of drunken louts and cheapskates .
bulgaria 's black sea coast wants to avoid the same fate . bulgarian vacation spots along the black sea are in a quandary .
they are drawn to the short-term money mass tourism brings , but do n't want to make the same mistakes as the spanish . yet without a significant change in direction , that seems to be the way the country 's coastline is headed . investors have built gigantic hotel complexes , significantly increasing the number of beds along the black sea coast .
this has caused a price war .
a night in a holiday apartment costs on average 25 euros -lrb- $ 34.50 -rrb- while a night in a single room can be as little as 2 euros .
hotels without a water view sit nearly empty .
too little infrastructure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tourist ghettos on bulgaria 's gold coast empty beds are only one of the bulgarian tourism industry 's problems .
during the recent building spree , the accompanying infrastructure never materialized , said marin neschkow , head of the tourism board and a tourism expert at the university in varna , the largest city on bulgaria 's black sea coast .
businesses have invested millions of euros to build beautiful hotel grounds , bars and other amenities .
but the corresponding transportation and communication networks are lacking .
there 's also insufficient water supply and sewage treatment , neschkow said .
hotels are built so quickly that skilled workers can not be trained quickly enough .
their apprenticeships take several years .
but the problem , according to neschkow is not the dearth of places in bulgarian training programs , it 's the fact that many students no longer stick around in the summers to work in the bulgarian tourism industry .
instead , they go abroad . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not much elbow room on many of europe 's most popular beaches " tourism pays the lowest average wage in bulgaria .
it is not logical , when one thinks about it , that international tourism amounts to 14 percent of the country 's gross national product , " neschkow said .
tourism provides two billion euros each year , approximately half of bulgaria 's trade deficit .
responsible tourism ?
the tourism industry represents the biggest hope for an economic boom in bulgaria .
the number of tourists continues to rise and bulgaria has managed to build modern hotels , which provide quality similar to that guests would expect to find in central europe .
that contrasts with nearby romania , neschkow said .
but bulgaria needs to be careful not to rely solely on black sea mass tourism , neschkow said .
in the long term , the country will need to increase not only the overall revenue from tourism but also how much each tourist spends .
it seems the bulgarian government is considering a change in its tourism strategy . bildunterschrift : there 's still hope for bulgaria " we 're trying to market bulgaria as a year-round tourism destination , " said stanislaw nowakow of the state tourism agency .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de film -pipe- 12.08.2007 german expert on nazi films and propaganda großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leni riefenstahl used her considerable talents to make films for the nazis dw-world.de spoke film expert gerd albrecht about movies in the third reich and the fate of party-loyal filmmakers after world war ii . gerd albrecht has been studying film and cinema since the early 1950s .
he was one of the first west german film historians to write about film policy during the nazi regime .
dw-world.de : your book " national socialist film policy " appeared in 1969 .
why was it so long after the war before anyone tackled the topic ?
gerd albrecht : in 1945 , the allies banned the showing of films made during the nazi era .
they also confiscated important documents .
harmless films were soon released to the public , but in the 1950s they still had some 250 politically dubious films under lock and key .
the western allies only relinquished their privileges as an occupation force in 1955 .
the german government , which had inherited the nationalized german film industry , was quick to attend to the business of ensuring the industry 's survival .
the assignment to research national socialist film policy was commissioned in 1959 .
it only became clear over time that the propagandistic aims that found expression in some 1,100 films needed to be examined more carefully .
my research took 10 years despite substantial support from the german government because both the documents and the films were widely scattered .
what characterized nazi film policy ?
was it largely shaped by propaganda minister goebbels ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joseph goebbels was in charge of film policy in the third reich the first and foremost aim of national socialist films was to entertain .
they were intended to be escapist and offer reassurance in the face of everyday hardships .
the further that these films were removed from reality , the better they functioned in national socialist terms .
almost all references to political life and the everyday life of the viewers were missing .
any critical reference to contemporary reality was forbidden .
only a fraction of the films had direct propagandistic aims .
in these , national socialist ideology was presented as an ideal and impressively staged .
goebbels initially wanted 50 percent of the entire film output to be propaganda , but in the end , only 15 percent were .
in accordance with the beloved slogan of the time " ein volk — ein reich — ein führer " -lrb- one people — one empire — one leader -rrb- the propaganda films emphasize either the superiority of the " aryan race " -lrb- " wunschkonzert , " 1940 -rrb- , the superiority of the german reich over its enemies -lrb- " kadetten , " 1941 -rrb- or , of course , the superiority of the " greatest generals of all time " -lrb- " der grosse könig , " 1942 -rrb- .
goebbels decisively shaped contemporary film production .
he could almost always be sure he had the backing of adolf hitler .
both of them were not only enthusiastic film viewers , but they also had a firm grasp of this medium .
goebbels watched the majority of feature films before they were premiered .
he made changes in many cases .
according to your research , less than 15 percent of films produced under the nazis were war and propaganda films .
who went to see what ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : famous stars like zarah leander lured people to the cinemas the small group of propaganda films was , on average , seen by many more people than the apolitical films were .
these films were in more cinemas because of tax breaks and political pressure .
secondly , viewers liked going to see these films .
they were better made and were cast with more prominent actors .
since you could also be sure to encounter nazi propaganda , people would learn what they should say about political issues in general .
as a result , box office figures for these films were , on average , 50 percent higher than the proportion of film production given over to them .
they accounted for one in four or one in five cinema visits .
during the war years , in particular , they reached 15 to 25 million paying viewers .
were there nazi directors and nazi actors ?
would people like leni riefenstahl and zarah leander have become well known without the nazis ?
of course , some of the directors and actors were national socialists , along with other film people .
as in the population at large , some were passionate nazis , the others more half-hearted .
some were opportunists and while some were critical , they did n't voice criticism openly .
people like leni riefenstahl , zarah leander and veit harlan would have become famous in the industry without the nazis .
but in the case of karl ritter it 's questionable whether he would have been able to shoot his 14 films considering how wooden they were .
what happened to the directors and actors who worked for hitler after the war ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the director of a virulently anti-semitic film was acquitted and able to resume work the directors and actors who worked during the third reich on behalf of the regime were quickly able to resume their work after the war although there were differences between east and west germany .
while allied-german de-nazification courts did impose professional bans of various lengths and , in some cases , financial penalties , it was n't long before filmmakers were back behind the camera — veit harlan was the only one to appear before a proper court on charges of crimes against humanity in " jud süss " -lrb- the jew süss -rrb- in 1940 .
he was acquitted both times – under the jurisdiction of the occupying forces .
it was ruled that " jud süss " did represent a crime against humanity , but it was found that he was acting under pressure .
in 1950 he was able to resume filming in germany .
how do you see the current discussion surrounding tom cruise 's controversial film valkyrie ?
i hope the film " valkyrie " will be good and provide a worthy memorial to the german resistance and not only the officers .
tom cruise will hopefully contribute to the success of the film .
given his previous performances , he is obviously up to the role of playing stauffenberg , but we should n't forget the significance of the scriptwriter and director .
the fact that cruise is a scientologist is a personal matter for him , just as it is my personal business that i reject scientology .
the film and those who go to see it will neither be harmed nor will it profit from the fact that cruise is a scientologist .
for that reason , i think the current debate around his scientology membership to be superfluous and wrong .
besides , the nazis quickly realized that what was important about filmmakers was not their beliefs , but their talent and reliability .

he was one of the first west german film historians to write about film policy during the nazi regime .
dw-world.de : your book " national socialist film policy " appeared in 1969 .
why was it so long after the war before anyone tackled the topic ?
gerd albrecht : in 1945 , the allies banned the showing of films made during the nazi era .
they also confiscated important documents .
harmless films were soon released to the public , but in the 1950s they still had some 250 politically dubious films under lock and key .
the western allies only relinquished their privileges as an occupation force in 1955 .
the german government , which had inherited the nationalized german film industry , was quick to attend to the business of ensuring the industry 's survival .
the assignment to research national socialist film policy was commissioned in 1959 .
it only became clear over time that the propagandistic aims that found expression in some 1,100 films needed to be examined more carefully .
my research took 10 years despite substantial support from the german government because both the documents and the films were widely scattered .
what characterized nazi film policy ?
was it largely shaped by propaganda minister goebbels ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joseph goebbels was in charge of film policy in the third reich the first and foremost aim of national socialist films was to entertain .
they were intended to be escapist and offer reassurance in the face of everyday hardships .
the further that these films were removed from reality , the better they functioned in national socialist terms .
almost all references to political life and the everyday life of the viewers were missing .
any critical reference to contemporary reality was forbidden .
only a fraction of the films had direct propagandistic aims .
in these , national socialist ideology was presented as an ideal and impressively staged .
goebbels initially wanted 50 percent of the entire film output to be propaganda , but in the end , only 15 percent were .
in accordance with the beloved slogan of the time " ein volk — ein reich — ein führer " -lrb- one people — one empire — one leader -rrb- the propaganda films emphasize either the superiority of the " aryan race " -lrb- " wunschkonzert , " 1940 -rrb- , the superiority of the german reich over its enemies -lrb- " kadetten , " 1941 -rrb- or , of course , the superiority of the " greatest generals of all time " -lrb- " der grosse könig , " 1942 -rrb- .
goebbels decisively shaped contemporary film production .
he could almost always be sure he had the backing of adolf hitler .
both of them were not only enthusiastic film viewers , but they also had a firm grasp of this medium .
goebbels watched the majority of feature films before they were premiered .
he made changes in many cases .
according to your research , less than 15 percent of films produced under the nazis were war and propaganda films .
who went to see what ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : famous stars like zarah leander lured people to the cinemas the small group of propaganda films was , on average , seen by many more people than the apolitical films were .
these films were in more cinemas because of tax breaks and political pressure .
secondly , viewers liked going to see these films .
they were better made and were cast with more prominent actors .
since you could also be sure to encounter nazi propaganda , people would learn what they should say about political issues in general .
as a result , box office figures for these films were , on average , 50 percent higher than the proportion of film production given over to them .
they accounted for one in four or one in five cinema visits .

today , german youngsters dress up as manga-characters and idolize japanese music bands . " i 'm queen esther , " said a young woman , whose might be compared to a futuristic disco-snow queen , if something like that existed .
she 's wearing a fairytale dress of silk with a hoop skirt , puffy shoulders and a corset - everything covered with pearls and rhinestones .
her large collar is turned up , making looking to the left or right difficult , but works well with the crown .
fashion 's not easy . her coat is faux leopard skin , completing the look . in reality , queen esther is stefanie wittman , and has a somewhat less elegant real-world vocation - she 's an employee at a car manufacturer .
but to fulfil her queenly duties , she recently drove over five hours to the city of bonn to participate in a fan fair for the japanese manga series called " animagic . " manga is a japanese word for comics and print cartoons .
to non-japanese , it refers specifically to comics originally published in japan . cosplay : the new way of dressing up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are few limits when it comes to cosplay queen esther is a character from the japanese television show " trinity blood . "
the costume play , that stefanie and many more revel in , is called " cosplay . "
dressing up as a cartoon character started in japan in the early 80s , when young people masqueraded as their favorite manga characters to pose in tokyo 's entertainment districts . now the trend has caught on in europe .
but it 's not just limited to manga characters .
anything from japanese bands , to disney figures , to hollywood movie characters such as " the pirates of the carribean " is allowed . plastic hair bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a visual kei fan , dressed up as her favorite band member according to jens nave , who works for the manga magazine " animania , " cosplay has its biggest following in germany , followed by france .
about 13,000 fans from germany and neighboring countries participated in the " animagic 2007 " gathering , most of them in full regalia . a good portion of the " cosplayers " are women between 15 and 25 years of age .
cat ears made out of plush are the simplest accessories .
most costumes are sexy and a little trashy .
plastic hair in pink or purple , sometimes falling down to one 's ankles , is a favorite .
short tops , mini skirts and high-heeled boots are popular as well . it is an expensive and time-consuming hobby .
the costumes are usually hand-made , but worn rarely , such as at events like this one at local meetings of fan clubs . visual kei bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an identifying feature of the visual kei followers : a black bag with pictures and buttons another form of cosplay is the co called " visual kei . "
instead of dressing up as anime-characters , youngsters dress up as their favorite bands .
fans of this are usually recognizable by a black bag they carry that 's accessorized with safety pins , buttons and pictures of japanese band members on it .
their hair is usually dyed black with neon-colored highlights .
the look often has an androgynous aesthetic . inspired by glam-rockers such as david bowie and kiss , youngsters consciously try to blur the lines between male and the female . outsiders assume that followers of the visual kei movement are also fans of the german band tokio hotel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german band tokio hotel is no favorite of visual kei fans " i hate it when people connect visual kei to tokio hotel , those two have nothing in common ! " said antje eggers .
the music antje really likes is quite harder and takes longer to get into than the german band .
and , the fact that it 's sung in japanese plays a role as well . according to nave , visual kei as a subculture that is slowly becoming mainstream .
the first visual kei concert in germany of a band named " dir en grey " sold out in berlin quickly although there was little advertising about it .
fans communicate through internet forums and exchange information about events . nave is sure that the fan base will continue to grow and says do n't be surprised if you see life-size clones of japanese cartoon characters on german streets before too long . dw staff -lrb- tip -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in north wales , 31 of the 86 who tested positive were aged between 17 and 25 .
some 400 drivers , of all ages , were over the legal limit when 7,970 tests were carried out by the welsh forces .
that figure means 5 % of all motorists breathalysed during this time were over the limit .
