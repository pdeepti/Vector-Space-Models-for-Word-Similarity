" look over the fence " now , this vast army of globe-trotters has been asked to do more than work on a tan while vacationing abroad . last week , the german government 's commissioner for human rights made a sudden appeal to german tourists to be more critical of social and political conditions when they jet off to far-flung destinations with dubious human rights records . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : günter nooke was a civil rights activist in former communist east germany at a press conference in berlin , günter nooke singled out countries such as cuba , mexico , egypt , thailand , turkey , kenya , mexico , the dominican republic and indonesia for deficits in human rights . he urged german tourists not to be " taken in by glossy appearances " and to " look over the fence of their holiday resort . " " away from beaches and palm trees , there are people living there whose human rights are trampled upon . " nooke stressed he did n't want to dissuade germans from traveling to countries with poor human rights .
rather , tourists should inform themselves about the situation and should bring up issues such as censorship , press freedom and torture in talks with local people in the places they travel to , he said . the problem with speaking out campaigners working to promote ethical travel and human rights say that nooke 's remarks may have been well-intentioned , but that they appear to be short-sighted , nonetheless . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tunisia is a popular destination for german tourists " it really depends on where you 're traveling , " said regina spöttl from the german chapter of amnesty international . " in countries such as syria and tunisia for instance , where intelligence agencies are ubiquitous , you have to be careful speaking about the political situation .
as a western tourist , you 're probably not at risk , but you could easily put the local person you talk to in great danger , " she said . more often than not , political abuse and social mistreatment are not entirely obvious to western tourists . " there are dozens of examples of how tourism is repeatedly a part of human rights violations in an understated way , " said hein fuchs , an expert at tourism watch , set up by the protestant church in germany . he cited the erection of special tourist zones in kerala , southern india , a popular destination for well-heeled german tourists seeking ayurveda treatment in luxurious spas . often bypassing the established legal procedures , such tourist areas tend to be associated with a range of problems including displacement of local communities , environmental destruction and illegal working conditions , for instance . underestimating today 's tourist ? last week , nooke also urged travel companies to mention the state of human rights when they advertise sunny beaches and swanky resorts in their glossy brochures - a somewhat naïve suggestion , some campaigners say . given the sheer range of information available , tourists nowadays have a deeper knowledge of foreign destinations and are increasingly critical , fuchs said .
and slowly but surely , the travel industry is adapting to the needs of the better-informed tourist , he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tourists today are usually well-informed , say experts at the turn of the 21st century , sustainable tourism and eco-friendliness became the new mantra of the travel industry . " it 's true you do n't have the same emphasis on the social dimension of tourism when the aim is to make it a win-win situation for all involved , including the local population at the tourist destination , " he said .
" but things are improving . " for starters , most german travel companies have adopted a code of conduct developed by un agencies and the european commission to protect children from sexual exploitation in tourism . traveling ethically given the explosion of niche travel agencies that specialize in socially responsible and sustainable travel routes , campaigners say that germans seeking to travel ethically have never had as much choice as they do today . " why would a curious tourist nowadays choose an all-inclusive package tour with a travel company where even the bazaar is artificial when he has an alternative or can travel on his own , " said fuchs . a decade ago , german tourists on study tours only wanted to visit historical ruins .
now , the emphasis is on getting to know the country , its people and its social problems , said klaus dietsch , spokesman for studiosus , a munich-based travel company which offers special educational tours to over 100 destinations around the world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gone are the days when tourists only wanted to visit ruins and monuments " just flying to a far-away country and lying in the sun for two weeks in some fancy resort is n't what they want . " in order to have a more responsible vacation abroad , travelers simply need be discerning when it comes to organizing their trip , experts say .
and they need to read up on their destinations and walk around with their ears and eyes wide open . so , was nooke 's unusual appeal to german tourists to be more critical of human rights merely an attempt to fill in a news void during the holiday season ? not everyone would say so . " i 'm always happy when politicians , irrespective of their political convictions , push the topic of human rights into public consciousness - even if it 's controversial , " said amnesty 's spöttl .
" that does n't happen everyday . " sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

following its decisive victory in the july 22 elections , the akp has re-nominated gül for the presidency .
the turkish parliament will choose the new president in a series of up to four votes , the first of was held on monday .
in the first round of voting , gül received 341 votes from the 550-seat house , 26 short of the two-thirds majority of 367 needed in the first round .
the second round of voting is scheduled for friday .
gül , a former islamist , hopes to placate those who opposed him in the april elections by expressing his commitment to turkey 's secular constitution .
" the constitution will be my guide , " gül said during the announcement of his second bid to become turkey 's new president last week .
" the republic of turkey is a democratic , secular and social state based on the rule of law .
my primary objective will be to protect and further strengthen these principles … " thousands protest against islamisation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands protested in support of secularism the ruling akp 's first nomination of gül to the presidency sparked turkey 's most serious political crisis in a decade , with hundreds of thousands of protestors rallying in the big cities in support of secularism .
the military also weighed in and warned that it would defend secularism at all costs .
the akp was forced to call early elections and on july 22 the islamist-rooted party won a decisive victory .
according to saban disli , the vice chairman of the akp , the election results were also a popular vindication of gül 's presidential bid , and anything other than his re-nomination would mean acting against the will of the electorate .
disli dismissed the fears of liberal and secularists who harbor concerns over gül 's islamist background .
" first of all mr. gül will be an independent president , he will be at equal distance to all political parties , all turkish people , " disli said .
" his only guideline will be the turkish constitution .
he says that he will be following up very closely what the constitution says and he will be safeguarding the turkish constitution - nothing more .
so i think gül will be a very good president of turkey . "
güls background a concern to many bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gül can not shake off the stigma of his islamist past what makes the idea of a gül presidency so controversial in turkey is his long history of involvement in political islamic movements .
he first became involved during his university days before joining the islamic development bank , in jeddah , saudi arabia , as an economist in 1983 .
after leaving the bank in 1991 , he entered politics and became a deputy of the islamist welfare party , rising to become state minister and spokesman in the erbakan government in 1996 .
however , his ambitions were curtailed by a political campaign backed by the military which ousted the government in 1997 .
despite his political background , gül has earned a worldwide reputation as a moderate conservative , reform-minded and pro-eu politician , particularly during the last four years as the akp government 's foreign minister .
these last few years have seen many changes in gül 's approach .
during the early 90s , he was highly critical of turkey 's western orientation and was against its possible membership to the european union .
but , as turkey 's foreign minister , he has overseen turkey 's bid to join the eu and has championed political and economic reforms .
he has also developed close working relationships with his european colleagues and has coordinated efforts to solve problems in the neighboring regions and the middle east .
during gul 's foreign ministry , turkey also adopted a new approach and formed closer relations with the arab and the muslim world .
under gül ’ s recommendation , a turkish scholar , ekmeleddin ihsanoglu , was elected as the new secretary general of saudi dominated organization of the islamic conference -lrb- oic -rrb- .
ihsanoglu , with the support of the turkish government , has initiated an ambitious reform agenda , to re-structure the organization , in order to make it a strong international body of muslim countries .
a man of contradictions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamas leaders were guests of the akp in ankara on the other hand , despite his perceived even-handedness , gül continues to cause concerns in the western world .
his continued close contacts with islamic organizations have particularly worried the us , especially after he welcomed a hamas delegation to ankara , presented a timid stance against iran 's nuclear program and made bellicose statements about attacking kurdish rebels in northern iraq , all of which did little to convince washington that a gül presidency could be fully depended on .
gül also harshly criticized the eu on cyprus and the us on its middle east policies ; however , in both cases , he also adopted a constructive and moderate approach that enabled quickly mending the ties .
despite these instances , gul 's overall performance in the last four years has been taken by many western powers as evidence of his new moderate ideas .
however , at home , turkey 's secularists still believe that this is just double-speak and akp is in fact itching to dismantle the secular character of turkish state .
secularists oppose gül as president bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the army vows to protect the constitution at all costs republican people 's party -lrb- chp -rrb- vice chairman onur oymen , who strongly opposes gul 's presidency , recently said that gül has provided enough evidence for his opponents to believe that under his presidency , turkey 's secular state would be at risk .
" he is on the record with his views against the basic principles of our republic , starting with secularism , the separation of religion from the affairs of the state , " oymen said .
" such a person , we believe , should not be the president of turkey . "
according to semih idiz , a prominent turkish columnist , gul 's past record as foreign minister is not so problematic among the eyes of turkey 's liberals and seculars .
but he said it is turkey 's secular forces , including the military , who are most suspicious of gul 's islamist past and because his wife wears a headscarf , a symbol of political islam .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gül 's islamist past and his wife 's headscarf are issues " his performance -lrb- as the foreign minister -rrb- has been rather positive and this is the general understanding , " idiz said .
" it is his islamic background that is creating the controversy here and in particular the fact that his wife 's head is covered .
the secularist forces in turkey do not want to see this because for them , it represents the collapse of the last bastion of secularism . "
idiz added that the secularist camp is increasingly concerned about the amount of power the akp has acquired ; it is currently in power , it has a strong majority in the parliament , including the prime minister and the speaker of the house and now it appears the next president could also come from the party .
" the secularists say this is unacceptable , " idiz said .
akp consolidating power bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the akp has a huge majority , large support and key roles in parliament in the turkish parliamentary system , policies are defined and carried out by the government , but the president also has significant power over decisions .
he or she must approve every law and formal decision emerging from the parliament , as well as the appointments of key officials , including generals , governors , ambassadors and university rectors .
secularists fear abdullah gül as president would promote islamist candidates to key state institutions , gradually undermining secularism .
the akp dismisses charges that it has a secret islamist agenda , and describes itself as a " conservative democrat " party .
but secularists point to its record in the past five years , including encouragement of religious schools , failed attempts to restrict alcohol sales and make adultery a punishable crime .
turkey 's military , which traditionally views itself as the guardian of secularism , refrained from making a hasty statement on gül 's re-nomination .
the akp 's saban disli has said that the military will adopt a " wait and see " approach on abdullah gül 's presidency .
" the military as usual is showing great responsibility , " disli said .
" the military 's public declarations have always quoted the constitution .
with the akp having won the election with a large majority , and with gül declaring that he will guard the secular statute of turkey , turkish democracy , turkish civil rights and economic development … i think it is very important the military take this patient approach .

the turkish parliament will choose the new president in a series of up to four votes , the first of was held on monday .
in the first round of voting , gül received 341 votes from the 550-seat house , 26 short of the two-thirds majority of 367 needed in the first round .
the second round of voting is scheduled for friday .
gül , a former islamist , hopes to placate those who opposed him in the april elections by expressing his commitment to turkey 's secular constitution .
" the constitution will be my guide , " gül said during the announcement of his second bid to become turkey 's new president last week .
" the republic of turkey is a democratic , secular and social state based on the rule of law .
my primary objective will be to protect and further strengthen these principles … " thousands protest against islamisation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands protested in support of secularism the ruling akp 's first nomination of gül to the presidency sparked turkey 's most serious political crisis in a decade , with hundreds of thousands of protestors rallying in the big cities in support of secularism .
the military also weighed in and warned that it would defend secularism at all costs .
the akp was forced to call early elections and on july 22 the islamist-rooted party won a decisive victory .
according to saban disli , the vice chairman of the akp , the election results were also a popular vindication of gül 's presidential bid , and anything other than his re-nomination would mean acting against the will of the electorate .
disli dismissed the fears of liberal and secularists who harbor concerns over gül 's islamist background .
" first of all mr. gül will be an independent president , he will be at equal distance to all political parties , all turkish people , " disli said .
" his only guideline will be the turkish constitution .
he says that he will be following up very closely what the constitution says and he will be safeguarding the turkish constitution - nothing more .
so i think gül will be a very good president of turkey . "
güls background a concern to many bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gül can not shake off the stigma of his islamist past what makes the idea of a gül presidency so controversial in turkey is his long history of involvement in political islamic movements .
he first became involved during his university days before joining the islamic development bank , in jeddah , saudi arabia , as an economist in 1983 .
after leaving the bank in 1991 , he entered politics and became a deputy of the islamist welfare party , rising to become state minister and spokesman in the erbakan government in 1996 .
however , his ambitions were curtailed by a political campaign backed by the military which ousted the government in 1997 .
despite his political background , gül has earned a worldwide reputation as a moderate conservative , reform-minded and pro-eu politician , particularly during the last four years as the akp government 's foreign minister .
these last few years have seen many changes in gül 's approach .
during the early 90s , he was highly critical of turkey 's western orientation and was against its possible membership to the european union .
but , as turkey 's foreign minister , he has overseen turkey 's bid to join the eu and has championed political and economic reforms .
he has also developed close working relationships with his european colleagues and has coordinated efforts to solve problems in the neighboring regions and the middle east .
during gul 's foreign ministry , turkey also adopted a new approach and formed closer relations with the arab and the muslim world .
under gül ’ s recommendation , a turkish scholar , ekmeleddin ihsanoglu , was elected as the new secretary general of saudi dominated organization of the islamic conference -lrb- oic -rrb- .
ihsanoglu , with the support of the turkish government , has initiated an ambitious reform agenda , to re-structure the organization , in order to make it a strong international body of muslim countries .
a man of contradictions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamas leaders were guests of the akp in ankara on the other hand , despite his perceived even-handedness , gül continues to cause concerns in the western world .
his continued close contacts with islamic organizations have particularly worried the us , especially after he welcomed a hamas delegation to ankara , presented a timid stance against iran 's nuclear program and made bellicose statements about attacking kurdish rebels in northern iraq , all of which did little to convince washington that a gül presidency could be fully depended on .
gül also harshly criticized the eu on cyprus and the us on its middle east policies ; however , in both cases , he also adopted a constructive and moderate approach that enabled quickly mending the ties .
despite these instances , gul 's overall performance in the last four years has been taken by many western powers as evidence of his new moderate ideas .
however , at home , turkey 's secularists still believe that this is just double-speak and akp is in fact itching to dismantle the secular character of turkish state .
secularists oppose gül as president bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the army vows to protect the constitution at all costs republican people 's party -lrb- chp -rrb- vice chairman onur oymen , who strongly opposes gul 's presidency , recently said that gül has provided enough evidence for his opponents to believe that under his presidency , turkey 's secular state would be at risk .
" he is on the record with his views against the basic principles of our republic , starting with secularism , the separation of religion from the affairs of the state , " oymen said .
" such a person , we believe , should not be the president of turkey . "
according to semih idiz , a prominent turkish columnist , gul 's past record as foreign minister is not so problematic among the eyes of turkey 's liberals and seculars .
but he said it is turkey 's secular forces , including the military , who are most suspicious of gul 's islamist past and because his wife wears a headscarf , a symbol of political islam .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gül 's islamist past and his wife 's headscarf are issues " his performance -lrb- as the foreign minister -rrb- has been rather positive and this is the general understanding , " idiz said .
" it is his islamic background that is creating the controversy here and in particular the fact that his wife 's head is covered .
the secularist forces in turkey do not want to see this because for them , it represents the collapse of the last bastion of secularism . "
idiz added that the secularist camp is increasingly concerned about the amount of power the akp has acquired ; it is currently in power , it has a strong majority in the parliament , including the prime minister and the speaker of the house and now it appears the next president could also come from the party .
" the secularists say this is unacceptable , " idiz said .
akp consolidating power bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the akp has a huge majority , large support and key roles in parliament in the turkish parliamentary system , policies are defined and carried out by the government , but the president also has significant power over decisions .
he or she must approve every law and formal decision emerging from the parliament , as well as the appointments of key officials , including generals , governors , ambassadors and university rectors .
secularists fear abdullah gül as president would promote islamist candidates to key state institutions , gradually undermining secularism .
the akp dismisses charges that it has a secret islamist agenda , and describes itself as a " conservative democrat " party .
but secularists point to its record in the past five years , including encouragement of religious schools , failed attempts to restrict alcohol sales and make adultery a punishable crime .
turkey 's military , which traditionally views itself as the guardian of secularism , refrained from making a hasty statement on gül 's re-nomination .
the akp 's saban disli has said that the military will adopt a " wait and see " approach on abdullah gül 's presidency .
" the military as usual is showing great responsibility , " disli said .
" the military 's public declarations have always quoted the constitution .
with the akp having won the election with a large majority , and with gül declaring that he will guard the secular statute of turkey , turkish democracy , turkish civil rights and economic development … i think it is very important the military take this patient approach .

now , a government study warns that the skills crunch will cost the nation more than 20 billion euros -lrb- $ 27 billion -rrb- this year . a study commissioned by the german economics ministry and whose results were published in a newspaper this week carried probably the most dire warning of how a long-standing skills shortage could put a dent in the resurgent german economy if steps are n't taken to tackle the problem .
quoting from the study , german daily süddeutsche zeitung said the economic loss resulting from unfilled jobs could reach a two-digit figure in the billions .
" this could reach up to one percent of gross domestic product , " the paper said , citing the study .
that would amount to more than 20 million euros -lrb- $ 26.8 million -rrb- , it added .
acute skills crunch german business and industry representatives have for years complained of a lack of qualified professionals in critical hi-tech sectors , warning that it could seriously undermine the country 's competitiveness in an increasingly globalized world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany could lack 135,000 scientists by 2014 the study concluded that the number of jobs that were either filled after delays or were n't filled at all was in the six-digit region .
the crunch is particularly acute in areas such as engineering , the metal and electronics industry and the services sector .
young brains are missing in academic subjects such as mathematics , natural sciences and technology , the study said .
it calculates that germany would lack up to 95,000 engineers and 135,000 scientists by 2014 .
the study is likely to provide food for thought for the german government when it meets later this week for a special cabinet retreat to discuss the skills shortage , among other issues .
the topic has long been a sticking point in germany with politicians divided on easing tight immigration restrictions for highly-qualified professionals . some argue that instead of relying on foreign skilled labor , german businesses should focus instead on training students and budding scientists in the country .
immigration still an ideological issue german education and research minister annette schavan has long favored lowering the unrealistically high income bar for immigrants .
so far , skilled professionals can only come to germany if they can prove they earn an annual salary of 85,000 euros .
schavan wants to reduce that limit to between 40,000 and 60,000 euros - a figure that many business leaders say is still too high .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigration is still plagued by ideological hang-ups in germany but german economics minister michael glos , whose ministry commissioned the latest study , remains reserved about easing immigration restrictions for skilled labor . in a paper published by his ministry , he merely spoke of a " partial opening " of the german labor market for certain segments , of reducing the number of school dropouts and of easing job restrictions for graduates from german universities .
in an editorial in its monday edition , the munich-based süddeutsche zeitung urged chancellor angela merkel 's government to finally take steps to remedy the skills crisis in germany .
" immigration is handled ideologically instead of objectively in the governing coalition , " the paper wrote , adding that politicians still feared the effect that opening the doors to skilled labor could have on germany 's 3.7 million unemployed .

in its latest issue , german news magazine der spiegel reported that germany 's foreign intelligence service , the bnd , held secret talks with taliban representatives for several months in 2005 on neutral swiss territory .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's secret service in 2005 promised the taliban help with reconstruction the magazine said the bnd wanted to find out whether the taliban were prepared to distance themselves from the al-qaeda terrorist network .
in exchange for cooperation , the bnd offered the taliban help with rebuilding the country 's crumbling infrastructure such as hospitals and mosques , the magazine said without citing its sources .
chancellor angela merkel 's office was aware of the talks as were france and us secret services , the magazine said .
the talks between the bnd and the taliban apparently ended in late summer 2005 because the germans were unable to prove that the taliban representatives spoke on behalf of leader mullah omar .
politicians split over talking to the enemy the magazine report comes at a time when politicians in merkel 's joint coalition made up of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- and the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- are sharply divided over negotiating with moderate taliban elements to stem the spiraling violence in afghanistan .
last week , three german police officers were killed in kabul , fuelling concerns in germany about the safety of its 3,200 soldiers stationed there as part of the nato-led peacekeeping force , isaf .
while some spd politicians are in favor of reaching out to moderate elements of the taliban in order to secure peace in volatile afghanistan , members of chancellor merkel 's cdu party are vehemently opposed to the proposal .
ruprecht polenz , a cdu foreign policy expert has warned that speaking to the taliban would " undermine the moral fundament for the german and international involvement in afghanistan . "
bildunterschrift : gert weisskirchen said he was surprised by the report 's directness gert weisskirchen , spd foreign policy expert told dw-world.de he was " surprised by the concreteness and directness of the -lrb- spiegel -rrb- magazine report , " but not that the talks had taken place .
" the fact that there have been efforts to speak with moderate , pragmatic elements of the taliban is nothing new , " he said .
complex taliban structure the belief that lasting peace in afghanistan can only be achieved by integrating moderate taliban elements in a reconciliation process was given added currency by a study by afghanistan experts at the berlin-based german institute for international and security affairs .
one of the experts , thomas ruttig , told dw-world.de last week it was important to recognize the fragmented structure of the taliban as it becomes increasingly difficult to establish with any certainty who is behind some of the violence in afghanistan .
" the taliban is by no means a homogeneous group , " ruttig said .
ruttig said the core of the taliban was made up of hardline ideologically and religiously motivated mujahedeen leaders .
but in addition , there were several other groups that loosely fell under the taliban banner .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even kabul , afghanistan 's capital , is considered unsafe for western workers he pointed out that a general collapse of law and order in afghanistan , rampant corruption , an explosion in the drugs trade and lack of food and money had led to widespread dissatisfaction among the afghan population .
that in turn had created fertile ground for criminal networks to flourish .
in the absence of a strong , national authority , the networks remain loyal to local clans like the pashtun tribe , an ethnic group that forms the majority of afghanistan 's diverse population and also inhabits the north-west frontier province -lrb- nwfp -rrb- and balochistan in neighboring pakistan , and have taken up arms against us forces .
these criminal groups are also increasingly blamed for a rise in kidnappings of foreigners in recent months .
experts urge caution given the complexity of the taliban structure , experts warn that kabul and western governments in afghanistan need to be careful about engaging with the terrorist group .
weisskirchen said it had to be made clear what " moderate taliban " are .

twelve people were injured in the incident which took place in the early hours of sunday . after a scuffle broke out shortly after midnight saturday in a festival tent , a group of about 50 mostly young germans apparently chased the eight indians , who fled into a pizzeria .
according to police , the german mob kicked in the door to the restaurant .
around 70 police officers were needed to break up the assailants .

two of the wounded had to be treated in hospital .
a large crowd apparently witnessed the violence .
" we 're not ruling out a xenophobic motive , " bernd merbitz , police chief of saxony told german news agency dpa .
authorities have formed a task force to investigate the incident .
there were no news of arrests .
the incident took place in mügeln , about 45 kilometers east of leipzig , the largest city in saxony .
racially-motivated crime ?
the leipziger-volkszeitung daily in leipzig reported on monday that the german mob had shouted xenophobic slogans .
reinhard böttcher of the local police force said he could n't confirm the report but added that according to eye witness statements , the mob could have shouted right-wing insults .
the paper also reported that the german mob had smashed the window panes of the pizzeria and damaged the owner 's car .
" if the police had n't come , something much worse might have happened here , " the paper quoted the pizzeria owner as saying .
mügeln 's mayor , gotthard deuse , told the paper he believed the incident was racially motivated and that right-wing slogans were chanted .
" alcohol played a role " it remains unclear what sparked the incident and whether the large crowd of onlookers cheered on the mob or failed to intervene .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eastern germany is struggling with a rise in right-wing extremism " the fact is - alcohol played a role at the time , " böttcher said .

experts say the call is misguided and out of touch with reality . what do beaches in thailand , bazaars in cairo and the desert of rajasthan have in common during the summer ?
loads of german holidaymakers . world-beaters when it comes to travel , german tourists made 86.6 million foreign trips in 2005 , the last year for which statistics are available .
from those , some 24 million were made to countries outside the european union . turkey topped the list of most popular destinations - almost four million germans traveled there that year - followed by egypt and tunisia . " look over the fence " now , this vast army of globe-trotters has been asked to do more than work on a tan while vacationing abroad . last week , the german government 's commissioner for human rights made a sudden appeal to german tourists to be more critical of social and political conditions when they jet off to far-flung destinations with dubious human rights records . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : günter nooke was a civil rights activist in former communist east germany at a press conference in berlin , günter nooke singled out countries such as cuba , mexico , egypt , thailand , turkey , kenya , mexico , the dominican republic and indonesia for deficits in human rights . he urged german tourists not to be " taken in by glossy appearances " and to " look over the fence of their holiday resort . " " away from beaches and palm trees , there are people living there whose human rights are trampled upon . " nooke stressed he did n't want to dissuade germans from traveling to countries with poor human rights .
rather , tourists should inform themselves about the situation and should bring up issues such as censorship , press freedom and torture in talks with local people in the places they travel to , he said . the problem with speaking out campaigners working to promote ethical travel and human rights say that nooke 's remarks may have been well-intentioned , but that they appear to be short-sighted , nonetheless . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tunisia is a popular destination for german tourists " it really depends on where you 're traveling , " said regina spöttl from the german chapter of amnesty international . " in countries such as syria and tunisia for instance , where intelligence agencies are ubiquitous , you have to be careful speaking about the political situation .
as a western tourist , you 're probably not at risk , but you could easily put the local person you talk to in great danger , " she said . more often than not , political abuse and social mistreatment are not entirely obvious to western tourists . " there are dozens of examples of how tourism is repeatedly a part of human rights violations in an understated way , " said hein fuchs , an expert at tourism watch , set up by the protestant church in germany . he cited the erection of special tourist zones in kerala , southern india , a popular destination for well-heeled german tourists seeking ayurveda treatment in luxurious spas . often bypassing the established legal procedures , such tourist areas tend to be associated with a range of problems including displacement of local communities , environmental destruction and illegal working conditions , for instance . underestimating today 's tourist ? last week , nooke also urged travel companies to mention the state of human rights when they advertise sunny beaches and swanky resorts in their glossy brochures - a somewhat naïve suggestion , some campaigners say . given the sheer range of information available , tourists nowadays have a deeper knowledge of foreign destinations and are increasingly critical , fuchs said .
and slowly but surely , the travel industry is adapting to the needs of the better-informed tourist , he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tourists today are usually well-informed , say experts at the turn of the 21st century , sustainable tourism and eco-friendliness became the new mantra of the travel industry . " it 's true you do n't have the same emphasis on the social dimension of tourism when the aim is to make it a win-win situation for all involved , including the local population at the tourist destination , " he said .
" but things are improving . " for starters , most german travel companies have adopted a code of conduct developed by un agencies and the european commission to protect children from sexual exploitation in tourism . traveling ethically given the explosion of niche travel agencies that specialize in socially responsible and sustainable travel routes , campaigners say that germans seeking to travel ethically have never had as much choice as they do today . " why would a curious tourist nowadays choose an all-inclusive package tour with a travel company where even the bazaar is artificial when he has an alternative or can travel on his own , " said fuchs . a decade ago , german tourists on study tours only wanted to visit historical ruins .
now , the emphasis is on getting to know the country , its people and its social problems , said klaus dietsch , spokesman for studiosus , a munich-based travel company which offers special educational tours to over 100 destinations around the world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gone are the days when tourists only wanted to visit ruins and monuments " just flying to a far-away country and lying in the sun for two weeks in some fancy resort is n't what they want . " in order to have a more responsible vacation abroad , travelers simply need be discerning when it comes to organizing their trip , experts say .
and they need to read up on their destinations and walk around with their ears and eyes wide open . so , was nooke 's unusual appeal to german tourists to be more critical of human rights merely an attempt to fill in a news void during the holiday season ? not everyone would say so . " i 'm always happy when politicians , irrespective of their political convictions , push the topic of human rights into public consciousness - even if it 's controversial , " said amnesty 's spöttl .

twelve people were injured in the incident which took place in the early hours of sunday . after a scuffle broke out shortly after midnight saturday in a festival tent , a group of about 50 mostly young germans apparently chased the eight indians , who fled into a pizzeria .
according to police , the german mob kicked in the door to the restaurant .
around 70 police officers were needed to break up the assailants .
in the ensuing melee , all eight indians and four germans - among them two police officers - were injured .
two of the wounded had to be treated in hospital .
a large crowd apparently witnessed the violence .
" we 're not ruling out a xenophobic motive , " bernd merbitz , police chief of saxony told german news agency dpa .
authorities have formed a task force to investigate the incident .
there were no news of arrests .
the incident took place in mügeln , about 45 kilometers east of leipzig , the largest city in saxony .
racially-motivated crime ?
the leipziger-volkszeitung daily in leipzig reported on monday that the german mob had shouted xenophobic slogans .
reinhard böttcher of the local police force said he could n't confirm the report but added that according to eye witness statements , the mob could have shouted right-wing insults .
the paper also reported that the german mob had smashed the window panes of the pizzeria and damaged the owner 's car .
" if the police had n't come , something much worse might have happened here , " the paper quoted the pizzeria owner as saying .
mügeln 's mayor , gotthard deuse , told the paper he believed the incident was racially motivated and that right-wing slogans were chanted .

twelve people were injured in the incident which took place in the early hours of sunday . after a scuffle broke out shortly after midnight saturday in a festival tent , a group of about 50 mostly young germans apparently chased the eight indians , who fled into a pizzeria .
according to police , the german mob kicked in the door to the restaurant .
around 70 police officers were needed to break up the assailants .
in the ensuing melee , all eight indians and four germans - among them two police officers - were injured .
two of the wounded had to be treated in hospital .
a large crowd apparently witnessed the violence .
" we 're not ruling out a xenophobic motive , " bernd merbitz , police chief of saxony told german news agency dpa .
authorities have formed a task force to investigate the incident .
there were no news of arrests .
the incident took place in mügeln , about 45 kilometers east of leipzig , the largest city in saxony .
racially-motivated crime ?
the leipziger-volkszeitung daily in leipzig reported on monday that the german mob had shouted xenophobic slogans .
reinhard böttcher of the local police force said he could n't confirm the report but added that according to eye witness statements , the mob could have shouted right-wing insults .
the paper also reported that the german mob had smashed the window panes of the pizzeria and damaged the owner 's car .
" if the police had n't come , something much worse might have happened here , " the paper quoted the pizzeria owner as saying .
mügeln 's mayor , gotthard deuse , told the paper he believed the incident was racially motivated and that right-wing slogans were chanted .
" alcohol played a role " it remains unclear what sparked the incident and whether the large crowd of onlookers cheered on the mob or failed to intervene .

in its latest issue , german news magazine der spiegel reported that germany 's foreign intelligence service , the bnd , held secret talks with taliban representatives for several months in 2005 on neutral swiss territory .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's secret service in 2005 promised the taliban help with reconstruction the magazine said the bnd wanted to find out whether the taliban were prepared to distance themselves from the al-qaeda terrorist network .
in exchange for cooperation , the bnd offered the taliban help with rebuilding the country 's crumbling infrastructure such as hospitals and mosques , the magazine said without citing its sources .
chancellor angela merkel 's office was aware of the talks as were france and us secret services , the magazine said .
the talks between the bnd and the taliban apparently ended in late summer 2005 because the germans were unable to prove that the taliban representatives spoke on behalf of leader mullah omar .
politicians split over talking to the enemy the magazine report comes at a time when politicians in merkel 's joint coalition made up of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- and the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- are sharply divided over negotiating with moderate taliban elements to stem the spiraling violence in afghanistan .
last week , three german police officers were killed in kabul , fuelling concerns in germany about the safety of its 3,200 soldiers stationed there as part of the nato-led peacekeeping force , isaf .
while some spd politicians are in favor of reaching out to moderate elements of the taliban in order to secure peace in volatile afghanistan , members of chancellor merkel 's cdu party are vehemently opposed to the proposal .
ruprecht polenz , a cdu foreign policy expert has warned that speaking to the taliban would " undermine the moral fundament for the german and international involvement in afghanistan . "
bildunterschrift : gert weisskirchen said he was surprised by the report 's directness gert weisskirchen , spd foreign policy expert told dw-world.de he was " surprised by the concreteness and directness of the -lrb- spiegel -rrb- magazine report , " but not that the talks had taken place .
" the fact that there have been efforts to speak with moderate , pragmatic elements of the taliban is nothing new , " he said .
complex taliban structure the belief that lasting peace in afghanistan can only be achieved by integrating moderate taliban elements in a reconciliation process was given added currency by a study by afghanistan experts at the berlin-based german institute for international and security affairs .
one of the experts , thomas ruttig , told dw-world.de last week it was important to recognize the fragmented structure of the taliban as it becomes increasingly difficult to establish with any certainty who is behind some of the violence in afghanistan .
" the taliban is by no means a homogeneous group , " ruttig said .
ruttig said the core of the taliban was made up of hardline ideologically and religiously motivated mujahedeen leaders .
but in addition , there were several other groups that loosely fell under the taliban banner .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even kabul , afghanistan 's capital , is considered unsafe for western workers he pointed out that a general collapse of law and order in afghanistan , rampant corruption , an explosion in the drugs trade and lack of food and money had led to widespread dissatisfaction among the afghan population .
that in turn had created fertile ground for criminal networks to flourish .
in the absence of a strong , national authority , the networks remain loyal to local clans like the pashtun tribe , an ethnic group that forms the majority of afghanistan 's diverse population and also inhabits the north-west frontier province -lrb- nwfp -rrb- and balochistan in neighboring pakistan , and have taken up arms against us forces .
these criminal groups are also increasingly blamed for a rise in kidnappings of foreigners in recent months .
experts urge caution given the complexity of the taliban structure , experts warn that kabul and western governments in afghanistan need to be careful about engaging with the terrorist group .

in its latest issue , german news magazine der spiegel reported that germany 's foreign intelligence service , the bnd , held secret talks with taliban representatives for several months in 2005 on neutral swiss territory .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's secret service in 2005 promised the taliban help with reconstruction the magazine said the bnd wanted to find out whether the taliban were prepared to distance themselves from the al-qaeda terrorist network .
in exchange for cooperation , the bnd offered the taliban help with rebuilding the country 's crumbling infrastructure such as hospitals and mosques , the magazine said without citing its sources .
chancellor angela merkel 's office was aware of the talks as were france and us secret services , the magazine said .
the talks between the bnd and the taliban apparently ended in late summer 2005 because the germans were unable to prove that the taliban representatives spoke on behalf of leader mullah omar .
politicians split over talking to the enemy the magazine report comes at a time when politicians in merkel 's joint coalition made up of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- and the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- are sharply divided over negotiating with moderate taliban elements to stem the spiraling violence in afghanistan .
last week , three german police officers were killed in kabul , fuelling concerns in germany about the safety of its 3,200 soldiers stationed there as part of the nato-led peacekeeping force , isaf .
while some spd politicians are in favor of reaching out to moderate elements of the taliban in order to secure peace in volatile afghanistan , members of chancellor merkel 's cdu party are vehemently opposed to the proposal .
ruprecht polenz , a cdu foreign policy expert has warned that speaking to the taliban would " undermine the moral fundament for the german and international involvement in afghanistan . "
bildunterschrift : gert weisskirchen said he was surprised by the report 's directness gert weisskirchen , spd foreign policy expert told dw-world.de he was " surprised by the concreteness and directness of the -lrb- spiegel -rrb- magazine report , " but not that the talks had taken place .
" the fact that there have been efforts to speak with moderate , pragmatic elements of the taliban is nothing new , " he said .
complex taliban structure the belief that lasting peace in afghanistan can only be achieved by integrating moderate taliban elements in a reconciliation process was given added currency by a study by afghanistan experts at the berlin-based german institute for international and security affairs .
one of the experts , thomas ruttig , told dw-world.de last week it was important to recognize the fragmented structure of the taliban as it becomes increasingly difficult to establish with any certainty who is behind some of the violence in afghanistan .
" the taliban is by no means a homogeneous group , " ruttig said .
ruttig said the core of the taliban was made up of hardline ideologically and religiously motivated mujahedeen leaders .
but in addition , there were several other groups that loosely fell under the taliban banner .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even kabul , afghanistan 's capital , is considered unsafe for western workers he pointed out that a general collapse of law and order in afghanistan , rampant corruption , an explosion in the drugs trade and lack of food and money had led to widespread dissatisfaction among the afghan population .
that in turn had created fertile ground for criminal networks to flourish .
in the absence of a strong , national authority , the networks remain loyal to local clans like the pashtun tribe , an ethnic group that forms the majority of afghanistan 's diverse population and also inhabits the north-west frontier province -lrb- nwfp -rrb- and balochistan in neighboring pakistan , and have taken up arms against us forces .
these criminal groups are also increasingly blamed for a rise in kidnappings of foreigners in recent months .
experts urge caution given the complexity of the taliban structure , experts warn that kabul and western governments in afghanistan need to be careful about engaging with the terrorist group .
weisskirchen said it had to be made clear what " moderate taliban " are .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de turkey -pipe- 20.08.2007 abdullah gül : the man who would be turkey 's president großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gül 's opponents have accused him of plotting to dismantle turkey 's secular state after causing turkey 's biggest political crisis in a decade , abdullah gül on monday again failed to be elected president in the first round of voting by falling short of the two-thirds majority necessary to win . turkey 's parliament is to pick a new president this month after the country 's secular opposition , backed by the military , derailed a previous election in april because of objections to the ruling justice and development party 's -lrb- akp -rrb- candidate , foreign minister abdullah gül .
following its decisive victory in the july 22 elections , the akp has re-nominated gül for the presidency .
the turkish parliament will choose the new president in a series of up to four votes , the first of was held on monday .
in the first round of voting , gül received 341 votes from the 550-seat house , 26 short of the two-thirds majority of 367 needed in the first round .
the second round of voting is scheduled for friday .
gül , a former islamist , hopes to placate those who opposed him in the april elections by expressing his commitment to turkey 's secular constitution .
" the constitution will be my guide , " gül said during the announcement of his second bid to become turkey 's new president last week .
" the republic of turkey is a democratic , secular and social state based on the rule of law .
my primary objective will be to protect and further strengthen these principles … " thousands protest against islamisation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands protested in support of secularism the ruling akp 's first nomination of gül to the presidency sparked turkey 's most serious political crisis in a decade , with hundreds of thousands of protestors rallying in the big cities in support of secularism .
the military also weighed in and warned that it would defend secularism at all costs .
the akp was forced to call early elections and on july 22 the islamist-rooted party won a decisive victory .
according to saban disli , the vice chairman of the akp , the election results were also a popular vindication of gül 's presidential bid , and anything other than his re-nomination would mean acting against the will of the electorate .
disli dismissed the fears of liberal and secularists who harbor concerns over gül 's islamist background .
" first of all mr. gül will be an independent president , he will be at equal distance to all political parties , all turkish people , " disli said .
" his only guideline will be the turkish constitution .
he says that he will be following up very closely what the constitution says and he will be safeguarding the turkish constitution - nothing more .
so i think gül will be a very good president of turkey . "
güls background a concern to many bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gül can not shake off the stigma of his islamist past what makes the idea of a gül presidency so controversial in turkey is his long history of involvement in political islamic movements .
he first became involved during his university days before joining the islamic development bank , in jeddah , saudi arabia , as an economist in 1983 .
after leaving the bank in 1991 , he entered politics and became a deputy of the islamist welfare party , rising to become state minister and spokesman in the erbakan government in 1996 .
however , his ambitions were curtailed by a political campaign backed by the military which ousted the government in 1997 .
despite his political background , gül has earned a worldwide reputation as a moderate conservative , reform-minded and pro-eu politician , particularly during the last four years as the akp government 's foreign minister .
these last few years have seen many changes in gül 's approach .
during the early 90s , he was highly critical of turkey 's western orientation and was against its possible membership to the european union .
but , as turkey 's foreign minister , he has overseen turkey 's bid to join the eu and has championed political and economic reforms .
he has also developed close working relationships with his european colleagues and has coordinated efforts to solve problems in the neighboring regions and the middle east .
during gul 's foreign ministry , turkey also adopted a new approach and formed closer relations with the arab and the muslim world .
under gül ’ s recommendation , a turkish scholar , ekmeleddin ihsanoglu , was elected as the new secretary general of saudi dominated organization of the islamic conference -lrb- oic -rrb- .
ihsanoglu , with the support of the turkish government , has initiated an ambitious reform agenda , to re-structure the organization , in order to make it a strong international body of muslim countries .
a man of contradictions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamas leaders were guests of the akp in ankara on the other hand , despite his perceived even-handedness , gül continues to cause concerns in the western world .
his continued close contacts with islamic organizations have particularly worried the us , especially after he welcomed a hamas delegation to ankara , presented a timid stance against iran 's nuclear program and made bellicose statements about attacking kurdish rebels in northern iraq , all of which did little to convince washington that a gül presidency could be fully depended on .
gül also harshly criticized the eu on cyprus and the us on its middle east policies ; however , in both cases , he also adopted a constructive and moderate approach that enabled quickly mending the ties .
despite these instances , gul 's overall performance in the last four years has been taken by many western powers as evidence of his new moderate ideas .
however , at home , turkey 's secularists still believe that this is just double-speak and akp is in fact itching to dismantle the secular character of turkish state .
secularists oppose gül as president bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the army vows to protect the constitution at all costs republican people 's party -lrb- chp -rrb- vice chairman onur oymen , who strongly opposes gul 's presidency , recently said that gül has provided enough evidence for his opponents to believe that under his presidency , turkey 's secular state would be at risk .
" he is on the record with his views against the basic principles of our republic , starting with secularism , the separation of religion from the affairs of the state , " oymen said .
" such a person , we believe , should not be the president of turkey . "
according to semih idiz , a prominent turkish columnist , gul 's past record as foreign minister is not so problematic among the eyes of turkey 's liberals and seculars .
but he said it is turkey 's secular forces , including the military , who are most suspicious of gul 's islamist past and because his wife wears a headscarf , a symbol of political islam .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gül 's islamist past and his wife 's headscarf are issues " his performance -lrb- as the foreign minister -rrb- has been rather positive and this is the general understanding , " idiz said .
" it is his islamic background that is creating the controversy here and in particular the fact that his wife 's head is covered .
the secularist forces in turkey do not want to see this because for them , it represents the collapse of the last bastion of secularism . "
idiz added that the secularist camp is increasingly concerned about the amount of power the akp has acquired ; it is currently in power , it has a strong majority in the parliament , including the prime minister and the speaker of the house and now it appears the next president could also come from the party .
" the secularists say this is unacceptable , " idiz said .
akp consolidating power bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the akp has a huge majority , large support and key roles in parliament in the turkish parliamentary system , policies are defined and carried out by the government , but the president also has significant power over decisions .
he or she must approve every law and formal decision emerging from the parliament , as well as the appointments of key officials , including generals , governors , ambassadors and university rectors .
secularists fear abdullah gül as president would promote islamist candidates to key state institutions , gradually undermining secularism .
the akp dismisses charges that it has a secret islamist agenda , and describes itself as a " conservative democrat " party .
but secularists point to its record in the past five years , including encouragement of religious schools , failed attempts to restrict alcohol sales and make adultery a punishable crime .
turkey 's military , which traditionally views itself as the guardian of secularism , refrained from making a hasty statement on gül 's re-nomination .
the akp 's saban disli has said that the military will adopt a " wait and see " approach on abdullah gül 's presidency .
" the military as usual is showing great responsibility , " disli said .
" the military 's public declarations have always quoted the constitution .
with the akp having won the election with a large majority , and with gül declaring that he will guard the secular statute of turkey , turkish democracy , turkish civil rights and economic development … i think it is very important the military take this patient approach .

following its decisive victory in the july 22 elections , the akp has re-nominated gül for the presidency .
the turkish parliament will choose the new president in a series of up to four votes , the first of was held on monday .
in the first round of voting , gül received 341 votes from the 550-seat house , 26 short of the two-thirds majority of 367 needed in the first round .
the second round of voting is scheduled for friday .
gül , a former islamist , hopes to placate those who opposed him in the april elections by expressing his commitment to turkey 's secular constitution .
" the constitution will be my guide , " gül said during the announcement of his second bid to become turkey 's new president last week .
" the republic of turkey is a democratic , secular and social state based on the rule of law .
my primary objective will be to protect and further strengthen these principles … " thousands protest against islamisation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands protested in support of secularism the ruling akp 's first nomination of gül to the presidency sparked turkey 's most serious political crisis in a decade , with hundreds of thousands of protestors rallying in the big cities in support of secularism .
the military also weighed in and warned that it would defend secularism at all costs .
the akp was forced to call early elections and on july 22 the islamist-rooted party won a decisive victory .
according to saban disli , the vice chairman of the akp , the election results were also a popular vindication of gül 's presidential bid , and anything other than his re-nomination would mean acting against the will of the electorate .
disli dismissed the fears of liberal and secularists who harbor concerns over gül 's islamist background .
" first of all mr. gül will be an independent president , he will be at equal distance to all political parties , all turkish people , " disli said .
" his only guideline will be the turkish constitution .
he says that he will be following up very closely what the constitution says and he will be safeguarding the turkish constitution - nothing more .
so i think gül will be a very good president of turkey . "
güls background a concern to many bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gül can not shake off the stigma of his islamist past what makes the idea of a gül presidency so controversial in turkey is his long history of involvement in political islamic movements .
he first became involved during his university days before joining the islamic development bank , in jeddah , saudi arabia , as an economist in 1983 .
after leaving the bank in 1991 , he entered politics and became a deputy of the islamist welfare party , rising to become state minister and spokesman in the erbakan government in 1996 .
however , his ambitions were curtailed by a political campaign backed by the military which ousted the government in 1997 .
despite his political background , gül has earned a worldwide reputation as a moderate conservative , reform-minded and pro-eu politician , particularly during the last four years as the akp government 's foreign minister .
these last few years have seen many changes in gül 's approach .
during the early 90s , he was highly critical of turkey 's western orientation and was against its possible membership to the european union .
but , as turkey 's foreign minister , he has overseen turkey 's bid to join the eu and has championed political and economic reforms .
he has also developed close working relationships with his european colleagues and has coordinated efforts to solve problems in the neighboring regions and the middle east .
during gul 's foreign ministry , turkey also adopted a new approach and formed closer relations with the arab and the muslim world .
under gül ’ s recommendation , a turkish scholar , ekmeleddin ihsanoglu , was elected as the new secretary general of saudi dominated organization of the islamic conference -lrb- oic -rrb- .
ihsanoglu , with the support of the turkish government , has initiated an ambitious reform agenda , to re-structure the organization , in order to make it a strong international body of muslim countries .

experts say the call is misguided and out of touch with reality . what do beaches in thailand , bazaars in cairo and the desert of rajasthan have in common during the summer ?
loads of german holidaymakers . world-beaters when it comes to travel , german tourists made 86.6 million foreign trips in 2005 , the last year for which statistics are available .
from those , some 24 million were made to countries outside the european union . turkey topped the list of most popular destinations - almost four million germans traveled there that year - followed by egypt and tunisia . " look over the fence " now , this vast army of globe-trotters has been asked to do more than work on a tan while vacationing abroad . last week , the german government 's commissioner for human rights made a sudden appeal to german tourists to be more critical of social and political conditions when they jet off to far-flung destinations with dubious human rights records . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : günter nooke was a civil rights activist in former communist east germany at a press conference in berlin , günter nooke singled out countries such as cuba , mexico , egypt , thailand , turkey , kenya , mexico , the dominican republic and indonesia for deficits in human rights . he urged german tourists not to be " taken in by glossy appearances " and to " look over the fence of their holiday resort . " " away from beaches and palm trees , there are people living there whose human rights are trampled upon . " nooke stressed he did n't want to dissuade germans from traveling to countries with poor human rights .
rather , tourists should inform themselves about the situation and should bring up issues such as censorship , press freedom and torture in talks with local people in the places they travel to , he said . the problem with speaking out campaigners working to promote ethical travel and human rights say that nooke 's remarks may have been well-intentioned , but that they appear to be short-sighted , nonetheless . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tunisia is a popular destination for german tourists " it really depends on where you 're traveling , " said regina spöttl from the german chapter of amnesty international . " in countries such as syria and tunisia for instance , where intelligence agencies are ubiquitous , you have to be careful speaking about the political situation .
as a western tourist , you 're probably not at risk , but you could easily put the local person you talk to in great danger , " she said . more often than not , political abuse and social mistreatment are not entirely obvious to western tourists . " there are dozens of examples of how tourism is repeatedly a part of human rights violations in an understated way , " said hein fuchs , an expert at tourism watch , set up by the protestant church in germany . he cited the erection of special tourist zones in kerala , southern india , a popular destination for well-heeled german tourists seeking ayurveda treatment in luxurious spas . often bypassing the established legal procedures , such tourist areas tend to be associated with a range of problems including displacement of local communities , environmental destruction and illegal working conditions , for instance . underestimating today 's tourist ? last week , nooke also urged travel companies to mention the state of human rights when they advertise sunny beaches and swanky resorts in their glossy brochures - a somewhat naïve suggestion , some campaigners say . given the sheer range of information available , tourists nowadays have a deeper knowledge of foreign destinations and are increasingly critical , fuchs said .
and slowly but surely , the travel industry is adapting to the needs of the better-informed tourist , he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tourists today are usually well-informed , say experts at the turn of the 21st century , sustainable tourism and eco-friendliness became the new mantra of the travel industry . " it 's true you do n't have the same emphasis on the social dimension of tourism when the aim is to make it a win-win situation for all involved , including the local population at the tourist destination , " he said .
" but things are improving . " for starters , most german travel companies have adopted a code of conduct developed by un agencies and the european commission to protect children from sexual exploitation in tourism . traveling ethically given the explosion of niche travel agencies that specialize in socially responsible and sustainable travel routes , campaigners say that germans seeking to travel ethically have never had as much choice as they do today . " why would a curious tourist nowadays choose an all-inclusive package tour with a travel company where even the bazaar is artificial when he has an alternative or can travel on his own , " said fuchs . a decade ago , german tourists on study tours only wanted to visit historical ruins .
now , the emphasis is on getting to know the country , its people and its social problems , said klaus dietsch , spokesman for studiosus , a munich-based travel company which offers special educational tours to over 100 destinations around the world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gone are the days when tourists only wanted to visit ruins and monuments " just flying to a far-away country and lying in the sun for two weeks in some fancy resort is n't what they want . " in order to have a more responsible vacation abroad , travelers simply need be discerning when it comes to organizing their trip , experts say .
and they need to read up on their destinations and walk around with their ears and eyes wide open . so , was nooke 's unusual appeal to german tourists to be more critical of human rights merely an attempt to fill in a news void during the holiday season ? not everyone would say so . " i 'm always happy when politicians , irrespective of their political convictions , push the topic of human rights into public consciousness - even if it 's controversial , " said amnesty 's spöttl .
" that does n't happen everyday . " sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de turkey -pipe- 20.08.2007 abdullah gül : the man who would be turkey 's president großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gül 's opponents have accused him of plotting to dismantle turkey 's secular state after causing turkey 's biggest political crisis in a decade , abdullah gül on monday again failed to be elected president in the first round of voting by falling short of the two-thirds majority necessary to win . turkey 's parliament is to pick a new president this month after the country 's secular opposition , backed by the military , derailed a previous election in april because of objections to the ruling justice and development party 's -lrb- akp -rrb- candidate , foreign minister abdullah gül .
following its decisive victory in the july 22 elections , the akp has re-nominated gül for the presidency .
the turkish parliament will choose the new president in a series of up to four votes , the first of was held on monday .
in the first round of voting , gül received 341 votes from the 550-seat house , 26 short of the two-thirds majority of 367 needed in the first round .
the second round of voting is scheduled for friday .
gül , a former islamist , hopes to placate those who opposed him in the april elections by expressing his commitment to turkey 's secular constitution .
" the constitution will be my guide , " gül said during the announcement of his second bid to become turkey 's new president last week .
" the republic of turkey is a democratic , secular and social state based on the rule of law .
my primary objective will be to protect and further strengthen these principles … " thousands protest against islamisation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands protested in support of secularism the ruling akp 's first nomination of gül to the presidency sparked turkey 's most serious political crisis in a decade , with hundreds of thousands of protestors rallying in the big cities in support of secularism .
the military also weighed in and warned that it would defend secularism at all costs .
the akp was forced to call early elections and on july 22 the islamist-rooted party won a decisive victory .
according to saban disli , the vice chairman of the akp , the election results were also a popular vindication of gül 's presidential bid , and anything other than his re-nomination would mean acting against the will of the electorate .
disli dismissed the fears of liberal and secularists who harbor concerns over gül 's islamist background .
" first of all mr. gül will be an independent president , he will be at equal distance to all political parties , all turkish people , " disli said .
" his only guideline will be the turkish constitution .
he says that he will be following up very closely what the constitution says and he will be safeguarding the turkish constitution - nothing more .
so i think gül will be a very good president of turkey . "
güls background a concern to many bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gül can not shake off the stigma of his islamist past what makes the idea of a gül presidency so controversial in turkey is his long history of involvement in political islamic movements .
he first became involved during his university days before joining the islamic development bank , in jeddah , saudi arabia , as an economist in 1983 .
after leaving the bank in 1991 , he entered politics and became a deputy of the islamist welfare party , rising to become state minister and spokesman in the erbakan government in 1996 .
however , his ambitions were curtailed by a political campaign backed by the military which ousted the government in 1997 .
despite his political background , gül has earned a worldwide reputation as a moderate conservative , reform-minded and pro-eu politician , particularly during the last four years as the akp government 's foreign minister .
these last few years have seen many changes in gül 's approach .
during the early 90s , he was highly critical of turkey 's western orientation and was against its possible membership to the european union .
but , as turkey 's foreign minister , he has overseen turkey 's bid to join the eu and has championed political and economic reforms .
he has also developed close working relationships with his european colleagues and has coordinated efforts to solve problems in the neighboring regions and the middle east .
during gul 's foreign ministry , turkey also adopted a new approach and formed closer relations with the arab and the muslim world .
under gül ’ s recommendation , a turkish scholar , ekmeleddin ihsanoglu , was elected as the new secretary general of saudi dominated organization of the islamic conference -lrb- oic -rrb- .
ihsanoglu , with the support of the turkish government , has initiated an ambitious reform agenda , to re-structure the organization , in order to make it a strong international body of muslim countries .
a man of contradictions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamas leaders were guests of the akp in ankara on the other hand , despite his perceived even-handedness , gül continues to cause concerns in the western world .
his continued close contacts with islamic organizations have particularly worried the us , especially after he welcomed a hamas delegation to ankara , presented a timid stance against iran 's nuclear program and made bellicose statements about attacking kurdish rebels in northern iraq , all of which did little to convince washington that a gül presidency could be fully depended on .
gül also harshly criticized the eu on cyprus and the us on its middle east policies ; however , in both cases , he also adopted a constructive and moderate approach that enabled quickly mending the ties .
despite these instances , gul 's overall performance in the last four years has been taken by many western powers as evidence of his new moderate ideas .
however , at home , turkey 's secularists still believe that this is just double-speak and akp is in fact itching to dismantle the secular character of turkish state .
secularists oppose gül as president bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the army vows to protect the constitution at all costs republican people 's party -lrb- chp -rrb- vice chairman onur oymen , who strongly opposes gul 's presidency , recently said that gül has provided enough evidence for his opponents to believe that under his presidency , turkey 's secular state would be at risk .
" he is on the record with his views against the basic principles of our republic , starting with secularism , the separation of religion from the affairs of the state , " oymen said .
" such a person , we believe , should not be the president of turkey . "
according to semih idiz , a prominent turkish columnist , gul 's past record as foreign minister is not so problematic among the eyes of turkey 's liberals and seculars .
but he said it is turkey 's secular forces , including the military , who are most suspicious of gul 's islamist past and because his wife wears a headscarf , a symbol of political islam .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gül 's islamist past and his wife 's headscarf are issues " his performance -lrb- as the foreign minister -rrb- has been rather positive and this is the general understanding , " idiz said .
" it is his islamic background that is creating the controversy here and in particular the fact that his wife 's head is covered .
the secularist forces in turkey do not want to see this because for them , it represents the collapse of the last bastion of secularism . "
idiz added that the secularist camp is increasingly concerned about the amount of power the akp has acquired ; it is currently in power , it has a strong majority in the parliament , including the prime minister and the speaker of the house and now it appears the next president could also come from the party .
" the secularists say this is unacceptable , " idiz said .
akp consolidating power bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the akp has a huge majority , large support and key roles in parliament in the turkish parliamentary system , policies are defined and carried out by the government , but the president also has significant power over decisions .
he or she must approve every law and formal decision emerging from the parliament , as well as the appointments of key officials , including generals , governors , ambassadors and university rectors .
secularists fear abdullah gül as president would promote islamist candidates to key state institutions , gradually undermining secularism .
the akp dismisses charges that it has a secret islamist agenda , and describes itself as a " conservative democrat " party .
but secularists point to its record in the past five years , including encouragement of religious schools , failed attempts to restrict alcohol sales and make adultery a punishable crime .
turkey 's military , which traditionally views itself as the guardian of secularism , refrained from making a hasty statement on gül 's re-nomination .
the akp 's saban disli has said that the military will adopt a " wait and see " approach on abdullah gül 's presidency .
" the military as usual is showing great responsibility , " disli said .
" the military 's public declarations have always quoted the constitution .
with the akp having won the election with a large majority , and with gül declaring that he will guard the secular statute of turkey , turkish democracy , turkish civil rights and economic development … i think it is very important the military take this patient approach .

now , a government study warns that the skills crunch will cost the nation more than 20 billion euros -lrb- $ 27 billion -rrb- this year . a study commissioned by the german economics ministry and whose results were published in a newspaper this week carried probably the most dire warning of how a long-standing skills shortage could put a dent in the resurgent german economy if steps are n't taken to tackle the problem .
quoting from the study , german daily süddeutsche zeitung said the economic loss resulting from unfilled jobs could reach a two-digit figure in the billions .
" this could reach up to one percent of gross domestic product , " the paper said , citing the study .
that would amount to more than 20 million euros -lrb- $ 26.8 million -rrb- , it added .
acute skills crunch german business and industry representatives have for years complained of a lack of qualified professionals in critical hi-tech sectors , warning that it could seriously undermine the country 's competitiveness in an increasingly globalized world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany could lack 135,000 scientists by 2014 the study concluded that the number of jobs that were either filled after delays or were n't filled at all was in the six-digit region .
the crunch is particularly acute in areas such as engineering , the metal and electronics industry and the services sector .
young brains are missing in academic subjects such as mathematics , natural sciences and technology , the study said .
it calculates that germany would lack up to 95,000 engineers and 135,000 scientists by 2014 .
the study is likely to provide food for thought for the german government when it meets later this week for a special cabinet retreat to discuss the skills shortage , among other issues .
the topic has long been a sticking point in germany with politicians divided on easing tight immigration restrictions for highly-qualified professionals . some argue that instead of relying on foreign skilled labor , german businesses should focus instead on training students and budding scientists in the country .
immigration still an ideological issue german education and research minister annette schavan has long favored lowering the unrealistically high income bar for immigrants .
so far , skilled professionals can only come to germany if they can prove they earn an annual salary of 85,000 euros .
schavan wants to reduce that limit to between 40,000 and 60,000 euros - a figure that many business leaders say is still too high .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigration is still plagued by ideological hang-ups in germany but german economics minister michael glos , whose ministry commissioned the latest study , remains reserved about easing immigration restrictions for skilled labor . in a paper published by his ministry , he merely spoke of a " partial opening " of the german labor market for certain segments , of reducing the number of school dropouts and of easing job restrictions for graduates from german universities .
in an editorial in its monday edition , the munich-based süddeutsche zeitung urged chancellor angela merkel 's government to finally take steps to remedy the skills crisis in germany .
" immigration is handled ideologically instead of objectively in the governing coalition , " the paper wrote , adding that politicians still feared the effect that opening the doors to skilled labor could have on germany 's 3.7 million unemployed .
" but that does n't help anyone - not even the jobless , " the paper said .

now , a government study warns that the skills crunch will cost the nation more than 20 billion euros -lrb- $ 27 billion -rrb- this year . a study commissioned by the german economics ministry and whose results were published in a newspaper this week carried probably the most dire warning of how a long-standing skills shortage could put a dent in the resurgent german economy if steps are n't taken to tackle the problem .
quoting from the study , german daily süddeutsche zeitung said the economic loss resulting from unfilled jobs could reach a two-digit figure in the billions .
" this could reach up to one percent of gross domestic product , " the paper said , citing the study .
that would amount to more than 20 million euros -lrb- $ 26.8 million -rrb- , it added .
acute skills crunch german business and industry representatives have for years complained of a lack of qualified professionals in critical hi-tech sectors , warning that it could seriously undermine the country 's competitiveness in an increasingly globalized world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany could lack 135,000 scientists by 2014 the study concluded that the number of jobs that were either filled after delays or were n't filled at all was in the six-digit region .
the crunch is particularly acute in areas such as engineering , the metal and electronics industry and the services sector .
young brains are missing in academic subjects such as mathematics , natural sciences and technology , the study said .
it calculates that germany would lack up to 95,000 engineers and 135,000 scientists by 2014 .
the study is likely to provide food for thought for the german government when it meets later this week for a special cabinet retreat to discuss the skills shortage , among other issues .
the topic has long been a sticking point in germany with politicians divided on easing tight immigration restrictions for highly-qualified professionals . some argue that instead of relying on foreign skilled labor , german businesses should focus instead on training students and budding scientists in the country .
immigration still an ideological issue german education and research minister annette schavan has long favored lowering the unrealistically high income bar for immigrants .
so far , skilled professionals can only come to germany if they can prove they earn an annual salary of 85,000 euros .
schavan wants to reduce that limit to between 40,000 and 60,000 euros - a figure that many business leaders say is still too high .

twelve people were injured in the incident which took place in the early hours of sunday . after a scuffle broke out shortly after midnight saturday in a festival tent , a group of about 50 mostly young germans apparently chased the eight indians , who fled into a pizzeria .
according to police , the german mob kicked in the door to the restaurant .
around 70 police officers were needed to break up the assailants .
in the ensuing melee , all eight indians and four germans - among them two police officers - were injured .
two of the wounded had to be treated in hospital .
a large crowd apparently witnessed the violence .
" we 're not ruling out a xenophobic motive , " bernd merbitz , police chief of saxony told german news agency dpa .
authorities have formed a task force to investigate the incident .
there were no news of arrests .
the incident took place in mügeln , about 45 kilometers east of leipzig , the largest city in saxony .
racially-motivated crime ?
the leipziger-volkszeitung daily in leipzig reported on monday that the german mob had shouted xenophobic slogans .
reinhard böttcher of the local police force said he could n't confirm the report but added that according to eye witness statements , the mob could have shouted right-wing insults .
the paper also reported that the german mob had smashed the window panes of the pizzeria and damaged the owner 's car .
" if the police had n't come , something much worse might have happened here , " the paper quoted the pizzeria owner as saying .
mügeln 's mayor , gotthard deuse , told the paper he believed the incident was racially motivated and that right-wing slogans were chanted .
" alcohol played a role " it remains unclear what sparked the incident and whether the large crowd of onlookers cheered on the mob or failed to intervene .

a spokeswoman for the german foreign ministry in berlin confirmed the report of the abductee 's release .
" she is in the safe custody of the german embassy in kabul , " said the spokeswoman , who declined to comment on the health of christina m. , who is believed to be pregnant .
in kabul , a spokesman for the afghan interior ministry , semarai baschari , announced that christina m. was freed in a joint operation by the ministry and the afghan secret service after one and a half days in captivity , and that four people had been arrested in relation to the abduction case , german news agency dpa reported .
slain dw journalists ' killer caught bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw mourned journalist karen fischer among them is said to be the person who planned the kidnapping , as well as the mastermind behind the killing of karen fischer and christian struwe , two journalists from this news organization , who were shot while working in northern afghanistan last october , according to dpa .
afghan sources have told deutsche welle 's afghanistan radio services that the suspected killers of fischer and struwe were arrested a week ago .
baschari said authorities did not know why the murders occurred and added that the investigation continued .
baschari said it was a coincidence that the announcement of the arrests and hostage 's release were both made monday .
after christina m. was abducted , kabul police cordoned off the district where the woman was snatched , conducted house-to-house searches and threw up roadblocks on major roads out of the city to prevent her from being taken out of the capital .
one taxi driver was reported slain by mistaken gunfire .
in berlin , government officials vowed to continue the participation of german bundeswehr troops in the nato-led international coalition to stabilize afghanistan .
german interior minister wolfgang schäuble said that there was no alternative but to extend the german military commitment .
taliban connection denied in a videotape broadcast earlier sunday by the private tolo news channel , a captor of christina m. wore a turban and hid his face .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slain dw journalist christian struwe -lrb- right -rrb- " we have madam christina .
we are trying hard to keep her safe , " he said .
" we want for the government of -lrb- afghan president -rrb- hamid karzai to release our innocent prisoners . ...
we do n't have any other demand .
we are not bad people . "
the captor denied being part of the taliban , the former ruling islamic militia that was toppled by a us-led coalition in 2001 and has continued a guerrilla war .
a taliban spokesman had previously denied responsibility for the german woman 's abduction .
in the videotape , christina m. also spoke .
" i am fine .
there is no threat toward me , " she said , reading from a piece of paper and speaking broken dari , the main language in afghanistan .
" i want for my country to immediately try to win my release .
they should help . "
steinmeier is grateful christina m. is a staffer for ora international , a christian aid organization that has operated in afghanistan since 1991 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier thanked afghan authorities german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier in berlin extended gratitude to the afghan authorities with whom his government had worked " closely , faithfully and successfully " to safely gain the german woman 's freedom .
steinmeier emphasized that the german foreign ministry is continuing to seek the release of the german construction engineer abducted last month , identified as rudolf b. he was kidnapped on july 18 in the central province of maidan wardak .
the 62-year-old hostage was able to speak by telephone sunday with a reporter in kabul from german broadcaster ard , reporting that his health was deteriorating .

a taliban spokesman had previously denied responsibility for the german woman 's abduction .
in the videotape , christina m. also spoke .
" i am fine .
there is no threat toward me , " she said , reading from a piece of paper and speaking broken dari , the main language in afghanistan .
" i want for my country to immediately try to win my release .

the killer was sentenced to life in prison . now , the tawdry tale has been set to music by dutch composer bruno nelissen and librettist ralph hammerthaler .
" moshammeroper " opens at the neuköllner opera house on aug .
23 . tale of the times " the material was lying there on the street , crying out to be formed , " hammerthaler told the tagesspiegel newspaper . he worked for over a year and a half on the opera , reading moshammer 's books " mama and me , " about the munich star 's close relationship with his mother , and " i , daisy : confessions of a lady dog , " about the beloved pooch , as well as biographies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kathrin unger played german chancellor merkel in a neuköllner opera performance " the moshammer phenomenon is symptomatic of our times , " hammerthaler told the paper .
" it shows how a man without particular talent can turn himself into an artistic figure . " anyone who thinks an opera about the media-hungry socialite is trash is dead wrong , director robert lehmeier insisted .
he said the piece really explores how moshammer used the media and vice versa , and the interplay between fame , the media , and consumers . pop culture under the microscope " i could have told the whole story in five minutes , but that would have been too boring , " lehmeier told the tagesspiegel . " it 's about how everyone has a role , and the performance depends on everyone who plays along . " pop culture and political topics are commonplace for the neuköllner opera house , which has previously staged an opera on angela merkel and made a musical about the iraq war . robert lehmeier will direct " moshammeroper .

now , a government study warns that the skills crunch will cost the nation more than 20 billion euros -lrb- $ 27 billion -rrb- this year . a study commissioned by the german economics ministry and whose results were published in a newspaper this week carried probably the most dire warning of how a long-standing skills shortage could put a dent in the resurgent german economy if steps are n't taken to tackle the problem .
quoting from the study , german daily süddeutsche zeitung said the economic loss resulting from unfilled jobs could reach a two-digit figure in the billions .
" this could reach up to one percent of gross domestic product , " the paper said , citing the study .
that would amount to more than 20 million euros -lrb- $ 26.8 million -rrb- , it added .
acute skills crunch german business and industry representatives have for years complained of a lack of qualified professionals in critical hi-tech sectors , warning that it could seriously undermine the country 's competitiveness in an increasingly globalized world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany could lack 135,000 scientists by 2014 the study concluded that the number of jobs that were either filled after delays or were n't filled at all was in the six-digit region .
the crunch is particularly acute in areas such as engineering , the metal and electronics industry and the services sector .
young brains are missing in academic subjects such as mathematics , natural sciences and technology , the study said .
it calculates that germany would lack up to 95,000 engineers and 135,000 scientists by 2014 .
the study is likely to provide food for thought for the german government when it meets later this week for a special cabinet retreat to discuss the skills shortage , among other issues .
the topic has long been a sticking point in germany with politicians divided on easing tight immigration restrictions for highly-qualified professionals . some argue that instead of relying on foreign skilled labor , german businesses should focus instead on training students and budding scientists in the country .
immigration still an ideological issue german education and research minister annette schavan has long favored lowering the unrealistically high income bar for immigrants .
so far , skilled professionals can only come to germany if they can prove they earn an annual salary of 85,000 euros .
schavan wants to reduce that limit to between 40,000 and 60,000 euros - a figure that many business leaders say is still too high .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigration is still plagued by ideological hang-ups in germany but german economics minister michael glos , whose ministry commissioned the latest study , remains reserved about easing immigration restrictions for skilled labor . in a paper published by his ministry , he merely spoke of a " partial opening " of the german labor market for certain segments , of reducing the number of school dropouts and of easing job restrictions for graduates from german universities .
in an editorial in its monday edition , the munich-based süddeutsche zeitung urged chancellor angela merkel 's government to finally take steps to remedy the skills crisis in germany .
" immigration is handled ideologically instead of objectively in the governing coalition , " the paper wrote , adding that politicians still feared the effect that opening the doors to skilled labor could have on germany 's 3.7 million unemployed .

twelve people were injured in the incident which took place in the early hours of sunday . after a scuffle broke out shortly after midnight saturday in a festival tent , a group of about 50 mostly young germans apparently chased the eight indians , who fled into a pizzeria .
according to police , the german mob kicked in the door to the restaurant .
around 70 police officers were needed to break up the assailants .
in the ensuing melee , all eight indians and four germans - among them two police officers - were injured .
two of the wounded had to be treated in hospital .
a large crowd apparently witnessed the violence .
" we 're not ruling out a xenophobic motive , " bernd merbitz , police chief of saxony told german news agency dpa .
authorities have formed a task force to investigate the incident .
there were no news of arrests .
the incident took place in mügeln , about 45 kilometers east of leipzig , the largest city in saxony .
racially-motivated crime ?
the leipziger-volkszeitung daily in leipzig reported on monday that the german mob had shouted xenophobic slogans .
reinhard böttcher of the local police force said he could n't confirm the report but added that according to eye witness statements , the mob could have shouted right-wing insults .
the paper also reported that the german mob had smashed the window panes of the pizzeria and damaged the owner 's car .
" if the police had n't come , something much worse might have happened here , " the paper quoted the pizzeria owner as saying .
mügeln 's mayor , gotthard deuse , told the paper he believed the incident was racially motivated and that right-wing slogans were chanted .
" alcohol played a role " it remains unclear what sparked the incident and whether the large crowd of onlookers cheered on the mob or failed to intervene .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eastern germany is struggling with a rise in right-wing extremism " the fact is - alcohol played a role at the time , " böttcher said .
saxony police revealed news of the incident almost a day after it took place .
formerly part of communist east germany , saxony has seen a high rate of violence and racially-motivated attacks against foreigners since german reunification in 1990 .
eastern germany is also grappling with a resurgence in right-wing extremism after recent electoral successes of the far-right npd party . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

reinhard böttcher of the local police force said he could n't confirm the report but added that according to eye witness statements , the mob could have shouted right-wing insults .
the paper also reported that the german mob had smashed the window panes of the pizzeria and damaged the owner 's car .
" if the police had n't come , something much worse might have happened here , " the paper quoted the pizzeria owner as saying .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's secret service in 2005 promised the taliban help with reconstruction the magazine said the bnd wanted to find out whether the taliban were prepared to distance themselves from the al-qaeda terrorist network .
in exchange for cooperation , the bnd offered the taliban help with rebuilding the country 's crumbling infrastructure such as hospitals and mosques , the magazine said without citing its sources .
chancellor angela merkel 's office was aware of the talks as were france and us secret services , the magazine said .
the talks between the bnd and the taliban apparently ended in late summer 2005 because the germans were unable to prove that the taliban representatives spoke on behalf of leader mullah omar .
politicians split over talking to the enemy the magazine report comes at a time when politicians in merkel 's joint coalition made up of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- and the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- are sharply divided over negotiating with moderate taliban elements to stem the spiraling violence in afghanistan .
last week , three german police officers were killed in kabul , fuelling concerns in germany about the safety of its 3,200 soldiers stationed there as part of the nato-led peacekeeping force , isaf .
while some spd politicians are in favor of reaching out to moderate elements of the taliban in order to secure peace in volatile afghanistan , members of chancellor merkel 's cdu party are vehemently opposed to the proposal .
ruprecht polenz , a cdu foreign policy expert has warned that speaking to the taliban would " undermine the moral fundament for the german and international involvement in afghanistan . "
bildunterschrift : gert weisskirchen said he was surprised by the report 's directness gert weisskirchen , spd foreign policy expert told dw-world.de he was " surprised by the concreteness and directness of the -lrb- spiegel -rrb- magazine report , " but not that the talks had taken place .
" the fact that there have been efforts to speak with moderate , pragmatic elements of the taliban is nothing new , " he said .
complex taliban structure the belief that lasting peace in afghanistan can only be achieved by integrating moderate taliban elements in a reconciliation process was given added currency by a study by afghanistan experts at the berlin-based german institute for international and security affairs .
one of the experts , thomas ruttig , told dw-world.de last week it was important to recognize the fragmented structure of the taliban as it becomes increasingly difficult to establish with any certainty who is behind some of the violence in afghanistan .
" the taliban is by no means a homogeneous group , " ruttig said .
ruttig said the core of the taliban was made up of hardline ideologically and religiously motivated mujahedeen leaders .
but in addition , there were several other groups that loosely fell under the taliban banner .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even kabul , afghanistan 's capital , is considered unsafe for western workers he pointed out that a general collapse of law and order in afghanistan , rampant corruption , an explosion in the drugs trade and lack of food and money had led to widespread dissatisfaction among the afghan population .
that in turn had created fertile ground for criminal networks to flourish .
in the absence of a strong , national authority , the networks remain loyal to local clans like the pashtun tribe , an ethnic group that forms the majority of afghanistan 's diverse population and also inhabits the north-west frontier province -lrb- nwfp -rrb- and balochistan in neighboring pakistan , and have taken up arms against us forces .
these criminal groups are also increasingly blamed for a rise in kidnappings of foreigners in recent months .
experts urge caution given the complexity of the taliban structure , experts warn that kabul and western governments in afghanistan need to be careful about engaging with the terrorist group .
weisskirchen said it had to be made clear what " moderate taliban " are .

in its latest issue , german news magazine der spiegel reported that germany 's foreign intelligence service , the bnd , held secret talks with taliban representatives for several months in 2005 on neutral swiss territory .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's secret service in 2005 promised the taliban help with reconstruction the magazine said the bnd wanted to find out whether the taliban were prepared to distance themselves from the al-qaeda terrorist network .
in exchange for cooperation , the bnd offered the taliban help with rebuilding the country 's crumbling infrastructure such as hospitals and mosques , the magazine said without citing its sources .
chancellor angela merkel 's office was aware of the talks as were france and us secret services , the magazine said .
the talks between the bnd and the taliban apparently ended in late summer 2005 because the germans were unable to prove that the taliban representatives spoke on behalf of leader mullah omar .

loads of german holidaymakers . world-beaters when it comes to travel , german tourists made 86.6 million foreign trips in 2005 , the last year for which statistics are available .
from those , some 24 million were made to countries outside the european union . turkey topped the list of most popular destinations - almost four million germans traveled there that year - followed by egypt and tunisia . " look over the fence " now , this vast army of globe-trotters has been asked to do more than work on a tan while vacationing abroad . last week , the german government 's commissioner for human rights made a sudden appeal to german tourists to be more critical of social and political conditions when they jet off to far-flung destinations with dubious human rights records . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : günter nooke was a civil rights activist in former communist east germany at a press conference in berlin , günter nooke singled out countries such as cuba , mexico , egypt , thailand , turkey , kenya , mexico , the dominican republic and indonesia for deficits in human rights . he urged german tourists not to be " taken in by glossy appearances " and to " look over the fence of their holiday resort . " " away from beaches and palm trees , there are people living there whose human rights are trampled upon . " nooke stressed he did n't want to dissuade germans from traveling to countries with poor human rights .
rather , tourists should inform themselves about the situation and should bring up issues such as censorship , press freedom and torture in talks with local people in the places they travel to , he said . the problem with speaking out campaigners working to promote ethical travel and human rights say that nooke 's remarks may have been well-intentioned , but that they appear to be short-sighted , nonetheless . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tunisia is a popular destination for german tourists " it really depends on where you 're traveling , " said regina spöttl from the german chapter of amnesty international . " in countries such as syria and tunisia for instance , where intelligence agencies are ubiquitous , you have to be careful speaking about the political situation .
as a western tourist , you 're probably not at risk , but you could easily put the local person you talk to in great danger , " she said . more often than not , political abuse and social mistreatment are not entirely obvious to western tourists . " there are dozens of examples of how tourism is repeatedly a part of human rights violations in an understated way , " said hein fuchs , an expert at tourism watch , set up by the protestant church in germany . he cited the erection of special tourist zones in kerala , southern india , a popular destination for well-heeled german tourists seeking ayurveda treatment in luxurious spas . often bypassing the established legal procedures , such tourist areas tend to be associated with a range of problems including displacement of local communities , environmental destruction and illegal working conditions , for instance . underestimating today 's tourist ? last week , nooke also urged travel companies to mention the state of human rights when they advertise sunny beaches and swanky resorts in their glossy brochures - a somewhat naïve suggestion , some campaigners say . given the sheer range of information available , tourists nowadays have a deeper knowledge of foreign destinations and are increasingly critical , fuchs said .
and slowly but surely , the travel industry is adapting to the needs of the better-informed tourist , he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tourists today are usually well-informed , say experts at the turn of the 21st century , sustainable tourism and eco-friendliness became the new mantra of the travel industry . " it 's true you do n't have the same emphasis on the social dimension of tourism when the aim is to make it a win-win situation for all involved , including the local population at the tourist destination , " he said .
" but things are improving . " for starters , most german travel companies have adopted a code of conduct developed by un agencies and the european commission to protect children from sexual exploitation in tourism . traveling ethically given the explosion of niche travel agencies that specialize in socially responsible and sustainable travel routes , campaigners say that germans seeking to travel ethically have never had as much choice as they do today . " why would a curious tourist nowadays choose an all-inclusive package tour with a travel company where even the bazaar is artificial when he has an alternative or can travel on his own , " said fuchs . a decade ago , german tourists on study tours only wanted to visit historical ruins .
now , the emphasis is on getting to know the country , its people and its social problems , said klaus dietsch , spokesman for studiosus , a munich-based travel company which offers special educational tours to over 100 destinations around the world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gone are the days when tourists only wanted to visit ruins and monuments " just flying to a far-away country and lying in the sun for two weeks in some fancy resort is n't what they want .

now , a government study warns that the skills crunch will cost the nation more than 20 billion euros -lrb- $ 27 billion -rrb- this year . a study commissioned by the german economics ministry and whose results were published in a newspaper this week carried probably the most dire warning of how a long-standing skills shortage could put a dent in the resurgent german economy if steps are n't taken to tackle the problem .
quoting from the study , german daily süddeutsche zeitung said the economic loss resulting from unfilled jobs could reach a two-digit figure in the billions .
" this could reach up to one percent of gross domestic product , " the paper said , citing the study .
that would amount to more than 20 million euros -lrb- $ 26.8 million -rrb- , it added .
acute skills crunch german business and industry representatives have for years complained of a lack of qualified professionals in critical hi-tech sectors , warning that it could seriously undermine the country 's competitiveness in an increasingly globalized world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany could lack 135,000 scientists by 2014 the study concluded that the number of jobs that were either filled after delays or were n't filled at all was in the six-digit region .
the crunch is particularly acute in areas such as engineering , the metal and electronics industry and the services sector .
young brains are missing in academic subjects such as mathematics , natural sciences and technology , the study said .
it calculates that germany would lack up to 95,000 engineers and 135,000 scientists by 2014 .
the study is likely to provide food for thought for the german government when it meets later this week for a special cabinet retreat to discuss the skills shortage , among other issues .
the topic has long been a sticking point in germany with politicians divided on easing tight immigration restrictions for highly-qualified professionals . some argue that instead of relying on foreign skilled labor , german businesses should focus instead on training students and budding scientists in the country .
immigration still an ideological issue german education and research minister annette schavan has long favored lowering the unrealistically high income bar for immigrants .
so far , skilled professionals can only come to germany if they can prove they earn an annual salary of 85,000 euros .
schavan wants to reduce that limit to between 40,000 and 60,000 euros - a figure that many business leaders say is still too high .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigration is still plagued by ideological hang-ups in germany but german economics minister michael glos , whose ministry commissioned the latest study , remains reserved about easing immigration restrictions for skilled labor . in a paper published by his ministry , he merely spoke of a " partial opening " of the german labor market for certain segments , of reducing the number of school dropouts and of easing job restrictions for graduates from german universities .
in an editorial in its monday edition , the munich-based süddeutsche zeitung urged chancellor angela merkel 's government to finally take steps to remedy the skills crisis in germany .
" immigration is handled ideologically instead of objectively in the governing coalition , " the paper wrote , adding that politicians still feared the effect that opening the doors to skilled labor could have on germany 's 3.7 million unemployed .
" but that does n't help anyone - not even the jobless , " the paper said .
germany lags on a european level when it comes to attracting much-needed skilled professionals .
britain , ireland and france lure foreign professionals with time-limited visas .
sweden , denmark and the netherlands have courted qualified foreigners with tax breaks . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a spokeswoman for the german foreign ministry in berlin confirmed the report of the abductee 's release .
" she is in the safe custody of the german embassy in kabul , " said the spokeswoman , who declined to comment on the health of christina m. , who is believed to be pregnant .
in kabul , a spokesman for the afghan interior ministry , semarai baschari , announced that christina m. was freed in a joint operation by the ministry and the afghan secret service after one and a half days in captivity , and that four people had been arrested in relation to the abduction case , german news agency dpa reported .
slain dw journalists ' killer caught bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw mourned journalist karen fischer among them is said to be the person who planned the kidnapping , as well as the mastermind behind the killing of karen fischer and christian struwe , two journalists from this news organization , who were shot while working in northern afghanistan last october , according to dpa .
afghan sources have told deutsche welle 's afghanistan radio services that the suspected killers of fischer and struwe were arrested a week ago .
baschari said authorities did not know why the murders occurred and added that the investigation continued .
baschari said it was a coincidence that the announcement of the arrests and hostage 's release were both made monday .
after christina m. was abducted , kabul police cordoned off the district where the woman was snatched , conducted house-to-house searches and threw up roadblocks on major roads out of the city to prevent her from being taken out of the capital .
one taxi driver was reported slain by mistaken gunfire .
in berlin , government officials vowed to continue the participation of german bundeswehr troops in the nato-led international coalition to stabilize afghanistan .
german interior minister wolfgang schäuble said that there was no alternative but to extend the german military commitment .
taliban connection denied in a videotape broadcast earlier sunday by the private tolo news channel , a captor of christina m. wore a turban and hid his face .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slain dw journalist christian struwe -lrb- right -rrb- " we have madam christina .
we are trying hard to keep her safe , " he said .
" we want for the government of -lrb- afghan president -rrb- hamid karzai to release our innocent prisoners . ...
we do n't have any other demand .
we are not bad people . "
the captor denied being part of the taliban , the former ruling islamic militia that was toppled by a us-led coalition in 2001 and has continued a guerrilla war .
a taliban spokesman had previously denied responsibility for the german woman 's abduction .
in the videotape , christina m. also spoke .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de turkey -pipe- 20.08.2007 abdullah gül : the man who would be turkey 's president großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gül 's opponents have accused him of plotting to dismantle turkey 's secular state after causing turkey 's biggest political crisis in a decade , abdullah gül on monday again failed to be elected president in the first round of voting by falling short of the two-thirds majority necessary to win . turkey 's parliament is to pick a new president this month after the country 's secular opposition , backed by the military , derailed a previous election in april because of objections to the ruling justice and development party 's -lrb- akp -rrb- candidate , foreign minister abdullah gül .
following its decisive victory in the july 22 elections , the akp has re-nominated gül for the presidency .
the turkish parliament will choose the new president in a series of up to four votes , the first of was held on monday .
in the first round of voting , gül received 341 votes from the 550-seat house , 26 short of the two-thirds majority of 367 needed in the first round .
the second round of voting is scheduled for friday .
gül , a former islamist , hopes to placate those who opposed him in the april elections by expressing his commitment to turkey 's secular constitution .
" the constitution will be my guide , " gül said during the announcement of his second bid to become turkey 's new president last week .
" the republic of turkey is a democratic , secular and social state based on the rule of law .
my primary objective will be to protect and further strengthen these principles … " thousands protest against islamisation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands protested in support of secularism the ruling akp 's first nomination of gül to the presidency sparked turkey 's most serious political crisis in a decade , with hundreds of thousands of protestors rallying in the big cities in support of secularism .
the military also weighed in and warned that it would defend secularism at all costs .
the akp was forced to call early elections and on july 22 the islamist-rooted party won a decisive victory .
according to saban disli , the vice chairman of the akp , the election results were also a popular vindication of gül 's presidential bid , and anything other than his re-nomination would mean acting against the will of the electorate .
disli dismissed the fears of liberal and secularists who harbor concerns over gül 's islamist background .
" first of all mr. gül will be an independent president , he will be at equal distance to all political parties , all turkish people , " disli said .
" his only guideline will be the turkish constitution .
he says that he will be following up very closely what the constitution says and he will be safeguarding the turkish constitution - nothing more .
so i think gül will be a very good president of turkey . "
güls background a concern to many bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gül can not shake off the stigma of his islamist past what makes the idea of a gül presidency so controversial in turkey is his long history of involvement in political islamic movements .
he first became involved during his university days before joining the islamic development bank , in jeddah , saudi arabia , as an economist in 1983 .
after leaving the bank in 1991 , he entered politics and became a deputy of the islamist welfare party , rising to become state minister and spokesman in the erbakan government in 1996 .
however , his ambitions were curtailed by a political campaign backed by the military which ousted the government in 1997 .
despite his political background , gül has earned a worldwide reputation as a moderate conservative , reform-minded and pro-eu politician , particularly during the last four years as the akp government 's foreign minister .
these last few years have seen many changes in gül 's approach .
during the early 90s , he was highly critical of turkey 's western orientation and was against its possible membership to the european union .
but , as turkey 's foreign minister , he has overseen turkey 's bid to join the eu and has championed political and economic reforms .
he has also developed close working relationships with his european colleagues and has coordinated efforts to solve problems in the neighboring regions and the middle east .
during gul 's foreign ministry , turkey also adopted a new approach and formed closer relations with the arab and the muslim world .
under gül ’ s recommendation , a turkish scholar , ekmeleddin ihsanoglu , was elected as the new secretary general of saudi dominated organization of the islamic conference -lrb- oic -rrb- .
ihsanoglu , with the support of the turkish government , has initiated an ambitious reform agenda , to re-structure the organization , in order to make it a strong international body of muslim countries .
a man of contradictions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamas leaders were guests of the akp in ankara on the other hand , despite his perceived even-handedness , gül continues to cause concerns in the western world .
his continued close contacts with islamic organizations have particularly worried the us , especially after he welcomed a hamas delegation to ankara , presented a timid stance against iran 's nuclear program and made bellicose statements about attacking kurdish rebels in northern iraq , all of which did little to convince washington that a gül presidency could be fully depended on .
gül also harshly criticized the eu on cyprus and the us on its middle east policies ; however , in both cases , he also adopted a constructive and moderate approach that enabled quickly mending the ties .
despite these instances , gul 's overall performance in the last four years has been taken by many western powers as evidence of his new moderate ideas .
however , at home , turkey 's secularists still believe that this is just double-speak and akp is in fact itching to dismantle the secular character of turkish state .
secularists oppose gül as president bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the army vows to protect the constitution at all costs republican people 's party -lrb- chp -rrb- vice chairman onur oymen , who strongly opposes gul 's presidency , recently said that gül has provided enough evidence for his opponents to believe that under his presidency , turkey 's secular state would be at risk .
" he is on the record with his views against the basic principles of our republic , starting with secularism , the separation of religion from the affairs of the state , " oymen said .
" such a person , we believe , should not be the president of turkey . "
according to semih idiz , a prominent turkish columnist , gul 's past record as foreign minister is not so problematic among the eyes of turkey 's liberals and seculars .
but he said it is turkey 's secular forces , including the military , who are most suspicious of gul 's islamist past and because his wife wears a headscarf , a symbol of political islam .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gül 's islamist past and his wife 's headscarf are issues " his performance -lrb- as the foreign minister -rrb- has been rather positive and this is the general understanding , " idiz said .
" it is his islamic background that is creating the controversy here and in particular the fact that his wife 's head is covered .
the secularist forces in turkey do not want to see this because for them , it represents the collapse of the last bastion of secularism . "
idiz added that the secularist camp is increasingly concerned about the amount of power the akp has acquired ; it is currently in power , it has a strong majority in the parliament , including the prime minister and the speaker of the house and now it appears the next president could also come from the party .
" the secularists say this is unacceptable , " idiz said .
akp consolidating power bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the akp has a huge majority , large support and key roles in parliament in the turkish parliamentary system , policies are defined and carried out by the government , but the president also has significant power over decisions .
he or she must approve every law and formal decision emerging from the parliament , as well as the appointments of key officials , including generals , governors , ambassadors and university rectors .
secularists fear abdullah gül as president would promote islamist candidates to key state institutions , gradually undermining secularism .
the akp dismisses charges that it has a secret islamist agenda , and describes itself as a " conservative democrat " party .
but secularists point to its record in the past five years , including encouragement of religious schools , failed attempts to restrict alcohol sales and make adultery a punishable crime .
turkey 's military , which traditionally views itself as the guardian of secularism , refrained from making a hasty statement on gül 's re-nomination .
the akp 's saban disli has said that the military will adopt a " wait and see " approach on abdullah gül 's presidency .
" the military as usual is showing great responsibility , " disli said .
" the military 's public declarations have always quoted the constitution .
with the akp having won the election with a large majority , and with gül declaring that he will guard the secular statute of turkey , turkish democracy , turkish civil rights and economic development … i think it is very important the military take this patient approach .

following its decisive victory in the july 22 elections , the akp has re-nominated gül for the presidency .
the turkish parliament will choose the new president in a series of up to four votes , the first of was held on monday .
in the first round of voting , gül received 341 votes from the 550-seat house , 26 short of the two-thirds majority of 367 needed in the first round .
the second round of voting is scheduled for friday .
gül , a former islamist , hopes to placate those who opposed him in the april elections by expressing his commitment to turkey 's secular constitution .
" the constitution will be my guide , " gül said during the announcement of his second bid to become turkey 's new president last week .
" the republic of turkey is a democratic , secular and social state based on the rule of law .
my primary objective will be to protect and further strengthen these principles … " thousands protest against islamisation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands protested in support of secularism the ruling akp 's first nomination of gül to the presidency sparked turkey 's most serious political crisis in a decade , with hundreds of thousands of protestors rallying in the big cities in support of secularism .
the military also weighed in and warned that it would defend secularism at all costs .
the akp was forced to call early elections and on july 22 the islamist-rooted party won a decisive victory .
according to saban disli , the vice chairman of the akp , the election results were also a popular vindication of gül 's presidential bid , and anything other than his re-nomination would mean acting against the will of the electorate .
disli dismissed the fears of liberal and secularists who harbor concerns over gül 's islamist background .
" first of all mr. gül will be an independent president , he will be at equal distance to all political parties , all turkish people , " disli said .
" his only guideline will be the turkish constitution .
he says that he will be following up very closely what the constitution says and he will be safeguarding the turkish constitution - nothing more .
so i think gül will be a very good president of turkey . "
güls background a concern to many bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gül can not shake off the stigma of his islamist past what makes the idea of a gül presidency so controversial in turkey is his long history of involvement in political islamic movements .
he first became involved during his university days before joining the islamic development bank , in jeddah , saudi arabia , as an economist in 1983 .
after leaving the bank in 1991 , he entered politics and became a deputy of the islamist welfare party , rising to become state minister and spokesman in the erbakan government in 1996 .
however , his ambitions were curtailed by a political campaign backed by the military which ousted the government in 1997 .
despite his political background , gül has earned a worldwide reputation as a moderate conservative , reform-minded and pro-eu politician , particularly during the last four years as the akp government 's foreign minister .
these last few years have seen many changes in gül 's approach .
during the early 90s , he was highly critical of turkey 's western orientation and was against its possible membership to the european union .
but , as turkey 's foreign minister , he has overseen turkey 's bid to join the eu and has championed political and economic reforms .
he has also developed close working relationships with his european colleagues and has coordinated efforts to solve problems in the neighboring regions and the middle east .
during gul 's foreign ministry , turkey also adopted a new approach and formed closer relations with the arab and the muslim world .
under gül ’ s recommendation , a turkish scholar , ekmeleddin ihsanoglu , was elected as the new secretary general of saudi dominated organization of the islamic conference -lrb- oic -rrb- .
ihsanoglu , with the support of the turkish government , has initiated an ambitious reform agenda , to re-structure the organization , in order to make it a strong international body of muslim countries .
a man of contradictions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamas leaders were guests of the akp in ankara on the other hand , despite his perceived even-handedness , gül continues to cause concerns in the western world .
his continued close contacts with islamic organizations have particularly worried the us , especially after he welcomed a hamas delegation to ankara , presented a timid stance against iran 's nuclear program and made bellicose statements about attacking kurdish rebels in northern iraq , all of which did little to convince washington that a gül presidency could be fully depended on .
gül also harshly criticized the eu on cyprus and the us on its middle east policies ; however , in both cases , he also adopted a constructive and moderate approach that enabled quickly mending the ties .
despite these instances , gul 's overall performance in the last four years has been taken by many western powers as evidence of his new moderate ideas .
however , at home , turkey 's secularists still believe that this is just double-speak and akp is in fact itching to dismantle the secular character of turkish state .
secularists oppose gül as president bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the army vows to protect the constitution at all costs republican people 's party -lrb- chp -rrb- vice chairman onur oymen , who strongly opposes gul 's presidency , recently said that gül has provided enough evidence for his opponents to believe that under his presidency , turkey 's secular state would be at risk .
" he is on the record with his views against the basic principles of our republic , starting with secularism , the separation of religion from the affairs of the state , " oymen said .
" such a person , we believe , should not be the president of turkey . "
according to semih idiz , a prominent turkish columnist , gul 's past record as foreign minister is not so problematic among the eyes of turkey 's liberals and seculars .
but he said it is turkey 's secular forces , including the military , who are most suspicious of gul 's islamist past and because his wife wears a headscarf , a symbol of political islam .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gül 's islamist past and his wife 's headscarf are issues " his performance -lrb- as the foreign minister -rrb- has been rather positive and this is the general understanding , " idiz said .

he first became involved during his university days before joining the islamic development bank , in jeddah , saudi arabia , as an economist in 1983 .
after leaving the bank in 1991 , he entered politics and became a deputy of the islamist welfare party , rising to become state minister and spokesman in the erbakan government in 1996 .
however , his ambitions were curtailed by a political campaign backed by the military which ousted the government in 1997 .
despite his political background , gül has earned a worldwide reputation as a moderate conservative , reform-minded and pro-eu politician , particularly during the last four years as the akp government 's foreign minister .
these last few years have seen many changes in gül 's approach .
during the early 90s , he was highly critical of turkey 's western orientation and was against its possible membership to the european union .
but , as turkey 's foreign minister , he has overseen turkey 's bid to join the eu and has championed political and economic reforms .
he has also developed close working relationships with his european colleagues and has coordinated efforts to solve problems in the neighboring regions and the middle east .
during gul 's foreign ministry , turkey also adopted a new approach and formed closer relations with the arab and the muslim world .
under gül ’ s recommendation , a turkish scholar , ekmeleddin ihsanoglu , was elected as the new secretary general of saudi dominated organization of the islamic conference -lrb- oic -rrb- .
ihsanoglu , with the support of the turkish government , has initiated an ambitious reform agenda , to re-structure the organization , in order to make it a strong international body of muslim countries .
a man of contradictions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamas leaders were guests of the akp in ankara on the other hand , despite his perceived even-handedness , gül continues to cause concerns in the western world .
his continued close contacts with islamic organizations have particularly worried the us , especially after he welcomed a hamas delegation to ankara , presented a timid stance against iran 's nuclear program and made bellicose statements about attacking kurdish rebels in northern iraq , all of which did little to convince washington that a gül presidency could be fully depended on .
gül also harshly criticized the eu on cyprus and the us on its middle east policies ; however , in both cases , he also adopted a constructive and moderate approach that enabled quickly mending the ties .
despite these instances , gul 's overall performance in the last four years has been taken by many western powers as evidence of his new moderate ideas .
however , at home , turkey 's secularists still believe that this is just double-speak and akp is in fact itching to dismantle the secular character of turkish state .
secularists oppose gül as president bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the army vows to protect the constitution at all costs republican people 's party -lrb- chp -rrb- vice chairman onur oymen , who strongly opposes gul 's presidency , recently said that gül has provided enough evidence for his opponents to believe that under his presidency , turkey 's secular state would be at risk .
" he is on the record with his views against the basic principles of our republic , starting with secularism , the separation of religion from the affairs of the state , " oymen said .
" such a person , we believe , should not be the president of turkey . "
according to semih idiz , a prominent turkish columnist , gul 's past record as foreign minister is not so problematic among the eyes of turkey 's liberals and seculars .
but he said it is turkey 's secular forces , including the military , who are most suspicious of gul 's islamist past and because his wife wears a headscarf , a symbol of political islam .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gül 's islamist past and his wife 's headscarf are issues " his performance -lrb- as the foreign minister -rrb- has been rather positive and this is the general understanding , " idiz said .
" it is his islamic background that is creating the controversy here and in particular the fact that his wife 's head is covered .
the secularist forces in turkey do not want to see this because for them , it represents the collapse of the last bastion of secularism . "
idiz added that the secularist camp is increasingly concerned about the amount of power the akp has acquired ; it is currently in power , it has a strong majority in the parliament , including the prime minister and the speaker of the house and now it appears the next president could also come from the party .
" the secularists say this is unacceptable , " idiz said .
akp consolidating power bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the akp has a huge majority , large support and key roles in parliament in the turkish parliamentary system , policies are defined and carried out by the government , but the president also has significant power over decisions .
he or she must approve every law and formal decision emerging from the parliament , as well as the appointments of key officials , including generals , governors , ambassadors and university rectors .
secularists fear abdullah gül as president would promote islamist candidates to key state institutions , gradually undermining secularism .
the akp dismisses charges that it has a secret islamist agenda , and describes itself as a " conservative democrat " party .
but secularists point to its record in the past five years , including encouragement of religious schools , failed attempts to restrict alcohol sales and make adultery a punishable crime .
turkey 's military , which traditionally views itself as the guardian of secularism , refrained from making a hasty statement on gül 's re-nomination .
the akp 's saban disli has said that the military will adopt a " wait and see " approach on abdullah gül 's presidency .

following its decisive victory in the july 22 elections , the akp has re-nominated gül for the presidency .
the turkish parliament will choose the new president in a series of up to four votes , the first of was held on monday .
in the first round of voting , gül received 341 votes from the 550-seat house , 26 short of the two-thirds majority of 367 needed in the first round .
the second round of voting is scheduled for friday .
gül , a former islamist , hopes to placate those who opposed him in the april elections by expressing his commitment to turkey 's secular constitution .
" the constitution will be my guide , " gül said during the announcement of his second bid to become turkey 's new president last week .
" the republic of turkey is a democratic , secular and social state based on the rule of law .
my primary objective will be to protect and further strengthen these principles … " thousands protest against islamisation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands protested in support of secularism the ruling akp 's first nomination of gül to the presidency sparked turkey 's most serious political crisis in a decade , with hundreds of thousands of protestors rallying in the big cities in support of secularism .
the military also weighed in and warned that it would defend secularism at all costs .
the akp was forced to call early elections and on july 22 the islamist-rooted party won a decisive victory .
according to saban disli , the vice chairman of the akp , the election results were also a popular vindication of gül 's presidential bid , and anything other than his re-nomination would mean acting against the will of the electorate .
disli dismissed the fears of liberal and secularists who harbor concerns over gül 's islamist background .
" first of all mr. gül will be an independent president , he will be at equal distance to all political parties , all turkish people , " disli said .
" his only guideline will be the turkish constitution .
he says that he will be following up very closely what the constitution says and he will be safeguarding the turkish constitution - nothing more .
so i think gül will be a very good president of turkey . "

now , a government study warns that the skills crunch will cost the nation more than 20 billion euros -lrb- $ 27 billion -rrb- this year . a study commissioned by the german economics ministry and whose results were published in a newspaper this week carried probably the most dire warning of how a long-standing skills shortage could put a dent in the resurgent german economy if steps are n't taken to tackle the problem .
quoting from the study , german daily süddeutsche zeitung said the economic loss resulting from unfilled jobs could reach a two-digit figure in the billions .
" this could reach up to one percent of gross domestic product , " the paper said , citing the study .
that would amount to more than 20 million euros -lrb- $ 26.8 million -rrb- , it added .
acute skills crunch german business and industry representatives have for years complained of a lack of qualified professionals in critical hi-tech sectors , warning that it could seriously undermine the country 's competitiveness in an increasingly globalized world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany could lack 135,000 scientists by 2014 the study concluded that the number of jobs that were either filled after delays or were n't filled at all was in the six-digit region .
the crunch is particularly acute in areas such as engineering , the metal and electronics industry and the services sector .
young brains are missing in academic subjects such as mathematics , natural sciences and technology , the study said .
it calculates that germany would lack up to 95,000 engineers and 135,000 scientists by 2014 .
the study is likely to provide food for thought for the german government when it meets later this week for a special cabinet retreat to discuss the skills shortage , among other issues .
the topic has long been a sticking point in germany with politicians divided on easing tight immigration restrictions for highly-qualified professionals . some argue that instead of relying on foreign skilled labor , german businesses should focus instead on training students and budding scientists in the country .
immigration still an ideological issue german education and research minister annette schavan has long favored lowering the unrealistically high income bar for immigrants .
so far , skilled professionals can only come to germany if they can prove they earn an annual salary of 85,000 euros .
schavan wants to reduce that limit to between 40,000 and 60,000 euros - a figure that many business leaders say is still too high .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigration is still plagued by ideological hang-ups in germany but german economics minister michael glos , whose ministry commissioned the latest study , remains reserved about easing immigration restrictions for skilled labor . in a paper published by his ministry , he merely spoke of a " partial opening " of the german labor market for certain segments , of reducing the number of school dropouts and of easing job restrictions for graduates from german universities .
in an editorial in its monday edition , the munich-based süddeutsche zeitung urged chancellor angela merkel 's government to finally take steps to remedy the skills crisis in germany .

in its latest issue , german news magazine der spiegel reported that germany 's foreign intelligence service , the bnd , held secret talks with taliban representatives for several months in 2005 on neutral swiss territory .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's secret service in 2005 promised the taliban help with reconstruction the magazine said the bnd wanted to find out whether the taliban were prepared to distance themselves from the al-qaeda terrorist network .
in exchange for cooperation , the bnd offered the taliban help with rebuilding the country 's crumbling infrastructure such as hospitals and mosques , the magazine said without citing its sources .
chancellor angela merkel 's office was aware of the talks as were france and us secret services , the magazine said .
the talks between the bnd and the taliban apparently ended in late summer 2005 because the germans were unable to prove that the taliban representatives spoke on behalf of leader mullah omar .
politicians split over talking to the enemy the magazine report comes at a time when politicians in merkel 's joint coalition made up of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- and the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- are sharply divided over negotiating with moderate taliban elements to stem the spiraling violence in afghanistan .
last week , three german police officers were killed in kabul , fuelling concerns in germany about the safety of its 3,200 soldiers stationed there as part of the nato-led peacekeeping force , isaf .
while some spd politicians are in favor of reaching out to moderate elements of the taliban in order to secure peace in volatile afghanistan , members of chancellor merkel 's cdu party are vehemently opposed to the proposal .
ruprecht polenz , a cdu foreign policy expert has warned that speaking to the taliban would " undermine the moral fundament for the german and international involvement in afghanistan . "
bildunterschrift : gert weisskirchen said he was surprised by the report 's directness gert weisskirchen , spd foreign policy expert told dw-world.de he was " surprised by the concreteness and directness of the -lrb- spiegel -rrb- magazine report , " but not that the talks had taken place .
" the fact that there have been efforts to speak with moderate , pragmatic elements of the taliban is nothing new , " he said .
complex taliban structure the belief that lasting peace in afghanistan can only be achieved by integrating moderate taliban elements in a reconciliation process was given added currency by a study by afghanistan experts at the berlin-based german institute for international and security affairs .
one of the experts , thomas ruttig , told dw-world.de last week it was important to recognize the fragmented structure of the taliban as it becomes increasingly difficult to establish with any certainty who is behind some of the violence in afghanistan .
" the taliban is by no means a homogeneous group , " ruttig said .
ruttig said the core of the taliban was made up of hardline ideologically and religiously motivated mujahedeen leaders .
but in addition , there were several other groups that loosely fell under the taliban banner .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even kabul , afghanistan 's capital , is considered unsafe for western workers he pointed out that a general collapse of law and order in afghanistan , rampant corruption , an explosion in the drugs trade and lack of food and money had led to widespread dissatisfaction among the afghan population .
that in turn had created fertile ground for criminal networks to flourish .
in the absence of a strong , national authority , the networks remain loyal to local clans like the pashtun tribe , an ethnic group that forms the majority of afghanistan 's diverse population and also inhabits the north-west frontier province -lrb- nwfp -rrb- and balochistan in neighboring pakistan , and have taken up arms against us forces .
these criminal groups are also increasingly blamed for a rise in kidnappings of foreigners in recent months .
experts urge caution given the complexity of the taliban structure , experts warn that kabul and western governments in afghanistan need to be careful about engaging with the terrorist group .
weisskirchen said it had to be made clear what " moderate taliban " are .
" they must recognize basic principles of international law and give up violence , " he said .
" and they have to give afghanistan 's civil government priority . " sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

rather , tourists should inform themselves about the situation and should bring up issues such as censorship , press freedom and torture in talks with local people in the places they travel to , he said . the problem with speaking out campaigners working to promote ethical travel and human rights say that nooke 's remarks may have been well-intentioned , but that they appear to be short-sighted , nonetheless . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tunisia is a popular destination for german tourists " it really depends on where you 're traveling , " said regina spöttl from the german chapter of amnesty international . " in countries such as syria and tunisia for instance , where intelligence agencies are ubiquitous , you have to be careful speaking about the political situation .
as a western tourist , you 're probably not at risk , but you could easily put the local person you talk to in great danger , " she said . more often than not , political abuse and social mistreatment are not entirely obvious to western tourists . " there are dozens of examples of how tourism is repeatedly a part of human rights violations in an understated way , " said hein fuchs , an expert at tourism watch , set up by the protestant church in germany . he cited the erection of special tourist zones in kerala , southern india , a popular destination for well-heeled german tourists seeking ayurveda treatment in luxurious spas . often bypassing the established legal procedures , such tourist areas tend to be associated with a range of problems including displacement of local communities , environmental destruction and illegal working conditions , for instance . underestimating today 's tourist ? last week , nooke also urged travel companies to mention the state of human rights when they advertise sunny beaches and swanky resorts in their glossy brochures - a somewhat naïve suggestion , some campaigners say . given the sheer range of information available , tourists nowadays have a deeper knowledge of foreign destinations and are increasingly critical , fuchs said .
and slowly but surely , the travel industry is adapting to the needs of the better-informed tourist , he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tourists today are usually well-informed , say experts at the turn of the 21st century , sustainable tourism and eco-friendliness became the new mantra of the travel industry . " it 's true you do n't have the same emphasis on the social dimension of tourism when the aim is to make it a win-win situation for all involved , including the local population at the tourist destination , " he said .
" but things are improving . " for starters , most german travel companies have adopted a code of conduct developed by un agencies and the european commission to protect children from sexual exploitation in tourism . traveling ethically given the explosion of niche travel agencies that specialize in socially responsible and sustainable travel routes , campaigners say that germans seeking to travel ethically have never had as much choice as they do today . " why would a curious tourist nowadays choose an all-inclusive package tour with a travel company where even the bazaar is artificial when he has an alternative or can travel on his own , " said fuchs . a decade ago , german tourists on study tours only wanted to visit historical ruins .
now , the emphasis is on getting to know the country , its people and its social problems , said klaus dietsch , spokesman for studiosus , a munich-based travel company which offers special educational tours to over 100 destinations around the world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gone are the days when tourists only wanted to visit ruins and monuments " just flying to a far-away country and lying in the sun for two weeks in some fancy resort is n't what they want . " in order to have a more responsible vacation abroad , travelers simply need be discerning when it comes to organizing their trip , experts say .
and they need to read up on their destinations and walk around with their ears and eyes wide open . so , was nooke 's unusual appeal to german tourists to be more critical of human rights merely an attempt to fill in a news void during the holiday season ? not everyone would say so . " i 'm always happy when politicians , irrespective of their political convictions , push the topic of human rights into public consciousness - even if it 's controversial , " said amnesty 's spöttl .
" that does n't happen everyday . " sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

twelve people were injured in the incident which took place in the early hours of sunday . after a scuffle broke out shortly after midnight saturday in a festival tent , a group of about 50 mostly young germans apparently chased the eight indians , who fled into a pizzeria .
according to police , the german mob kicked in the door to the restaurant .
around 70 police officers were needed to break up the assailants .
in the ensuing melee , all eight indians and four germans - among them two police officers - were injured .
two of the wounded had to be treated in hospital .
a large crowd apparently witnessed the violence .
" we 're not ruling out a xenophobic motive , " bernd merbitz , police chief of saxony told german news agency dpa .
authorities have formed a task force to investigate the incident .
there were no news of arrests .
the incident took place in mügeln , about 45 kilometers east of leipzig , the largest city in saxony .
racially-motivated crime ?
the leipziger-volkszeitung daily in leipzig reported on monday that the german mob had shouted xenophobic slogans .
reinhard böttcher of the local police force said he could n't confirm the report but added that according to eye witness statements , the mob could have shouted right-wing insults .
the paper also reported that the german mob had smashed the window panes of the pizzeria and damaged the owner 's car .
" if the police had n't come , something much worse might have happened here , " the paper quoted the pizzeria owner as saying .
mügeln 's mayor , gotthard deuse , told the paper he believed the incident was racially motivated and that right-wing slogans were chanted .
" alcohol played a role " it remains unclear what sparked the incident and whether the large crowd of onlookers cheered on the mob or failed to intervene .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eastern germany is struggling with a rise in right-wing extremism " the fact is - alcohol played a role at the time , " böttcher said .
saxony police revealed news of the incident almost a day after it took place .
formerly part of communist east germany , saxony has seen a high rate of violence and racially-motivated attacks against foreigners since german reunification in 1990 .
eastern germany is also grappling with a resurgence in right-wing extremism after recent electoral successes of the far-right npd party . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

now , a government study warns that the skills crunch will cost the nation more than 20 billion euros -lrb- $ 27 billion -rrb- this year . a study commissioned by the german economics ministry and whose results were published in a newspaper this week carried probably the most dire warning of how a long-standing skills shortage could put a dent in the resurgent german economy if steps are n't taken to tackle the problem .
quoting from the study , german daily süddeutsche zeitung said the economic loss resulting from unfilled jobs could reach a two-digit figure in the billions .
" this could reach up to one percent of gross domestic product , " the paper said , citing the study .
that would amount to more than 20 million euros -lrb- $ 26.8 million -rrb- , it added .
acute skills crunch german business and industry representatives have for years complained of a lack of qualified professionals in critical hi-tech sectors , warning that it could seriously undermine the country 's competitiveness in an increasingly globalized world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany could lack 135,000 scientists by 2014 the study concluded that the number of jobs that were either filled after delays or were n't filled at all was in the six-digit region .
the crunch is particularly acute in areas such as engineering , the metal and electronics industry and the services sector .
young brains are missing in academic subjects such as mathematics , natural sciences and technology , the study said .
it calculates that germany would lack up to 95,000 engineers and 135,000 scientists by 2014 .
the study is likely to provide food for thought for the german government when it meets later this week for a special cabinet retreat to discuss the skills shortage , among other issues .
the topic has long been a sticking point in germany with politicians divided on easing tight immigration restrictions for highly-qualified professionals . some argue that instead of relying on foreign skilled labor , german businesses should focus instead on training students and budding scientists in the country .
immigration still an ideological issue german education and research minister annette schavan has long favored lowering the unrealistically high income bar for immigrants .
so far , skilled professionals can only come to germany if they can prove they earn an annual salary of 85,000 euros .
schavan wants to reduce that limit to between 40,000 and 60,000 euros - a figure that many business leaders say is still too high .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigration is still plagued by ideological hang-ups in germany but german economics minister michael glos , whose ministry commissioned the latest study , remains reserved about easing immigration restrictions for skilled labor . in a paper published by his ministry , he merely spoke of a " partial opening " of the german labor market for certain segments , of reducing the number of school dropouts and of easing job restrictions for graduates from german universities .
in an editorial in its monday edition , the munich-based süddeutsche zeitung urged chancellor angela merkel 's government to finally take steps to remedy the skills crisis in germany .
" immigration is handled ideologically instead of objectively in the governing coalition , " the paper wrote , adding that politicians still feared the effect that opening the doors to skilled labor could have on germany 's 3.7 million unemployed .
" but that does n't help anyone - not even the jobless , " the paper said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de turkey -pipe- 20.08.2007 abdullah gül : the man who would be turkey 's president großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gül 's opponents have accused him of plotting to dismantle turkey 's secular state after causing turkey 's biggest political crisis in a decade , abdullah gül on monday again failed to be elected president in the first round of voting by falling short of the two-thirds majority necessary to win . turkey 's parliament is to pick a new president this month after the country 's secular opposition , backed by the military , derailed a previous election in april because of objections to the ruling justice and development party 's -lrb- akp -rrb- candidate , foreign minister abdullah gül .
following its decisive victory in the july 22 elections , the akp has re-nominated gül for the presidency .
the turkish parliament will choose the new president in a series of up to four votes , the first of was held on monday .
in the first round of voting , gül received 341 votes from the 550-seat house , 26 short of the two-thirds majority of 367 needed in the first round .
the second round of voting is scheduled for friday .
gül , a former islamist , hopes to placate those who opposed him in the april elections by expressing his commitment to turkey 's secular constitution .
" the constitution will be my guide , " gül said during the announcement of his second bid to become turkey 's new president last week .
" the republic of turkey is a democratic , secular and social state based on the rule of law .
my primary objective will be to protect and further strengthen these principles … " thousands protest against islamisation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands protested in support of secularism the ruling akp 's first nomination of gül to the presidency sparked turkey 's most serious political crisis in a decade , with hundreds of thousands of protestors rallying in the big cities in support of secularism .
the military also weighed in and warned that it would defend secularism at all costs .
the akp was forced to call early elections and on july 22 the islamist-rooted party won a decisive victory .
according to saban disli , the vice chairman of the akp , the election results were also a popular vindication of gül 's presidential bid , and anything other than his re-nomination would mean acting against the will of the electorate .
disli dismissed the fears of liberal and secularists who harbor concerns over gül 's islamist background .
" first of all mr. gül will be an independent president , he will be at equal distance to all political parties , all turkish people , " disli said .
" his only guideline will be the turkish constitution .
he says that he will be following up very closely what the constitution says and he will be safeguarding the turkish constitution - nothing more .
so i think gül will be a very good president of turkey . "
güls background a concern to many bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gül can not shake off the stigma of his islamist past what makes the idea of a gül presidency so controversial in turkey is his long history of involvement in political islamic movements .
he first became involved during his university days before joining the islamic development bank , in jeddah , saudi arabia , as an economist in 1983 .
after leaving the bank in 1991 , he entered politics and became a deputy of the islamist welfare party , rising to become state minister and spokesman in the erbakan government in 1996 .
however , his ambitions were curtailed by a political campaign backed by the military which ousted the government in 1997 .
despite his political background , gül has earned a worldwide reputation as a moderate conservative , reform-minded and pro-eu politician , particularly during the last four years as the akp government 's foreign minister .
these last few years have seen many changes in gül 's approach .
during the early 90s , he was highly critical of turkey 's western orientation and was against its possible membership to the european union .

following its decisive victory in the july 22 elections , the akp has re-nominated gül for the presidency .
the turkish parliament will choose the new president in a series of up to four votes , the first of was held on monday .
in the first round of voting , gül received 341 votes from the 550-seat house , 26 short of the two-thirds majority of 367 needed in the first round .
the second round of voting is scheduled for friday .
gül , a former islamist , hopes to placate those who opposed him in the april elections by expressing his commitment to turkey 's secular constitution .
" the constitution will be my guide , " gül said during the announcement of his second bid to become turkey 's new president last week .
" the republic of turkey is a democratic , secular and social state based on the rule of law .
my primary objective will be to protect and further strengthen these principles … " thousands protest against islamisation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands protested in support of secularism the ruling akp 's first nomination of gül to the presidency sparked turkey 's most serious political crisis in a decade , with hundreds of thousands of protestors rallying in the big cities in support of secularism .
the military also weighed in and warned that it would defend secularism at all costs .
the akp was forced to call early elections and on july 22 the islamist-rooted party won a decisive victory .
according to saban disli , the vice chairman of the akp , the election results were also a popular vindication of gül 's presidential bid , and anything other than his re-nomination would mean acting against the will of the electorate .
disli dismissed the fears of liberal and secularists who harbor concerns over gül 's islamist background .
" first of all mr. gül will be an independent president , he will be at equal distance to all political parties , all turkish people , " disli said .
" his only guideline will be the turkish constitution .
he says that he will be following up very closely what the constitution says and he will be safeguarding the turkish constitution - nothing more .
so i think gül will be a very good president of turkey . "
güls background a concern to many bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gül can not shake off the stigma of his islamist past what makes the idea of a gül presidency so controversial in turkey is his long history of involvement in political islamic movements .
he first became involved during his university days before joining the islamic development bank , in jeddah , saudi arabia , as an economist in 1983 .
after leaving the bank in 1991 , he entered politics and became a deputy of the islamist welfare party , rising to become state minister and spokesman in the erbakan government in 1996 .
however , his ambitions were curtailed by a political campaign backed by the military which ousted the government in 1997 .
despite his political background , gül has earned a worldwide reputation as a moderate conservative , reform-minded and pro-eu politician , particularly during the last four years as the akp government 's foreign minister .
these last few years have seen many changes in gül 's approach .
during the early 90s , he was highly critical of turkey 's western orientation and was against its possible membership to the european union .
but , as turkey 's foreign minister , he has overseen turkey 's bid to join the eu and has championed political and economic reforms .
he has also developed close working relationships with his european colleagues and has coordinated efforts to solve problems in the neighboring regions and the middle east .

following its decisive victory in the july 22 elections , the akp has re-nominated gül for the presidency .
the turkish parliament will choose the new president in a series of up to four votes , the first of was held on monday .
in the first round of voting , gül received 341 votes from the 550-seat house , 26 short of the two-thirds majority of 367 needed in the first round .
the second round of voting is scheduled for friday .
gül , a former islamist , hopes to placate those who opposed him in the april elections by expressing his commitment to turkey 's secular constitution .
" the constitution will be my guide , " gül said during the announcement of his second bid to become turkey 's new president last week .
" the republic of turkey is a democratic , secular and social state based on the rule of law .
my primary objective will be to protect and further strengthen these principles … " thousands protest against islamisation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands protested in support of secularism the ruling akp 's first nomination of gül to the presidency sparked turkey 's most serious political crisis in a decade , with hundreds of thousands of protestors rallying in the big cities in support of secularism .
the military also weighed in and warned that it would defend secularism at all costs .
the akp was forced to call early elections and on july 22 the islamist-rooted party won a decisive victory .
according to saban disli , the vice chairman of the akp , the election results were also a popular vindication of gül 's presidential bid , and anything other than his re-nomination would mean acting against the will of the electorate .
disli dismissed the fears of liberal and secularists who harbor concerns over gül 's islamist background .
" first of all mr. gül will be an independent president , he will be at equal distance to all political parties , all turkish people , " disli said .
" his only guideline will be the turkish constitution .
he says that he will be following up very closely what the constitution says and he will be safeguarding the turkish constitution - nothing more .
so i think gül will be a very good president of turkey . "
güls background a concern to many bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gül can not shake off the stigma of his islamist past what makes the idea of a gül presidency so controversial in turkey is his long history of involvement in political islamic movements .
he first became involved during his university days before joining the islamic development bank , in jeddah , saudi arabia , as an economist in 1983 .
after leaving the bank in 1991 , he entered politics and became a deputy of the islamist welfare party , rising to become state minister and spokesman in the erbakan government in 1996 .
however , his ambitions were curtailed by a political campaign backed by the military which ousted the government in 1997 .
despite his political background , gül has earned a worldwide reputation as a moderate conservative , reform-minded and pro-eu politician , particularly during the last four years as the akp government 's foreign minister .
these last few years have seen many changes in gül 's approach .
during the early 90s , he was highly critical of turkey 's western orientation and was against its possible membership to the european union .
but , as turkey 's foreign minister , he has overseen turkey 's bid to join the eu and has championed political and economic reforms .
he has also developed close working relationships with his european colleagues and has coordinated efforts to solve problems in the neighboring regions and the middle east .
during gul 's foreign ministry , turkey also adopted a new approach and formed closer relations with the arab and the muslim world .
under gül ’ s recommendation , a turkish scholar , ekmeleddin ihsanoglu , was elected as the new secretary general of saudi dominated organization of the islamic conference -lrb- oic -rrb- .
ihsanoglu , with the support of the turkish government , has initiated an ambitious reform agenda , to re-structure the organization , in order to make it a strong international body of muslim countries .
a man of contradictions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamas leaders were guests of the akp in ankara on the other hand , despite his perceived even-handedness , gül continues to cause concerns in the western world .
his continued close contacts with islamic organizations have particularly worried the us , especially after he welcomed a hamas delegation to ankara , presented a timid stance against iran 's nuclear program and made bellicose statements about attacking kurdish rebels in northern iraq , all of which did little to convince washington that a gül presidency could be fully depended on .
gül also harshly criticized the eu on cyprus and the us on its middle east policies ; however , in both cases , he also adopted a constructive and moderate approach that enabled quickly mending the ties .
despite these instances , gul 's overall performance in the last four years has been taken by many western powers as evidence of his new moderate ideas .
however , at home , turkey 's secularists still believe that this is just double-speak and akp is in fact itching to dismantle the secular character of turkish state .
secularists oppose gül as president bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the army vows to protect the constitution at all costs republican people 's party -lrb- chp -rrb- vice chairman onur oymen , who strongly opposes gul 's presidency , recently said that gül has provided enough evidence for his opponents to believe that under his presidency , turkey 's secular state would be at risk .
" he is on the record with his views against the basic principles of our republic , starting with secularism , the separation of religion from the affairs of the state , " oymen said .
" such a person , we believe , should not be the president of turkey . "
according to semih idiz , a prominent turkish columnist , gul 's past record as foreign minister is not so problematic among the eyes of turkey 's liberals and seculars .
but he said it is turkey 's secular forces , including the military , who are most suspicious of gul 's islamist past and because his wife wears a headscarf , a symbol of political islam .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gül 's islamist past and his wife 's headscarf are issues " his performance -lrb- as the foreign minister -rrb- has been rather positive and this is the general understanding , " idiz said .
" it is his islamic background that is creating the controversy here and in particular the fact that his wife 's head is covered .
the secularist forces in turkey do not want to see this because for them , it represents the collapse of the last bastion of secularism . "
idiz added that the secularist camp is increasingly concerned about the amount of power the akp has acquired ; it is currently in power , it has a strong majority in the parliament , including the prime minister and the speaker of the house and now it appears the next president could also come from the party .
" the secularists say this is unacceptable , " idiz said .
akp consolidating power bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the akp has a huge majority , large support and key roles in parliament in the turkish parliamentary system , policies are defined and carried out by the government , but the president also has significant power over decisions .
he or she must approve every law and formal decision emerging from the parliament , as well as the appointments of key officials , including generals , governors , ambassadors and university rectors .
secularists fear abdullah gül as president would promote islamist candidates to key state institutions , gradually undermining secularism .
the akp dismisses charges that it has a secret islamist agenda , and describes itself as a " conservative democrat " party .
but secularists point to its record in the past five years , including encouragement of religious schools , failed attempts to restrict alcohol sales and make adultery a punishable crime .
turkey 's military , which traditionally views itself as the guardian of secularism , refrained from making a hasty statement on gül 's re-nomination .
the akp 's saban disli has said that the military will adopt a " wait and see " approach on abdullah gül 's presidency .
" the military as usual is showing great responsibility , " disli said .
" the military 's public declarations have always quoted the constitution .
with the akp having won the election with a large majority , and with gül declaring that he will guard the secular statute of turkey , turkish democracy , turkish civil rights and economic development … i think it is very important the military take this patient approach .

in its latest issue , german news magazine der spiegel reported that germany 's foreign intelligence service , the bnd , held secret talks with taliban representatives for several months in 2005 on neutral swiss territory .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's secret service in 2005 promised the taliban help with reconstruction the magazine said the bnd wanted to find out whether the taliban were prepared to distance themselves from the al-qaeda terrorist network .
in exchange for cooperation , the bnd offered the taliban help with rebuilding the country 's crumbling infrastructure such as hospitals and mosques , the magazine said without citing its sources .
chancellor angela merkel 's office was aware of the talks as were france and us secret services , the magazine said .
the talks between the bnd and the taliban apparently ended in late summer 2005 because the germans were unable to prove that the taliban representatives spoke on behalf of leader mullah omar .
politicians split over talking to the enemy the magazine report comes at a time when politicians in merkel 's joint coalition made up of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- and the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- are sharply divided over negotiating with moderate taliban elements to stem the spiraling violence in afghanistan .
last week , three german police officers were killed in kabul , fuelling concerns in germany about the safety of its 3,200 soldiers stationed there as part of the nato-led peacekeeping force , isaf .
while some spd politicians are in favor of reaching out to moderate elements of the taliban in order to secure peace in volatile afghanistan , members of chancellor merkel 's cdu party are vehemently opposed to the proposal .
ruprecht polenz , a cdu foreign policy expert has warned that speaking to the taliban would " undermine the moral fundament for the german and international involvement in afghanistan . "
bildunterschrift : gert weisskirchen said he was surprised by the report 's directness gert weisskirchen , spd foreign policy expert told dw-world.de he was " surprised by the concreteness and directness of the -lrb- spiegel -rrb- magazine report , " but not that the talks had taken place .
" the fact that there have been efforts to speak with moderate , pragmatic elements of the taliban is nothing new , " he said .
complex taliban structure the belief that lasting peace in afghanistan can only be achieved by integrating moderate taliban elements in a reconciliation process was given added currency by a study by afghanistan experts at the berlin-based german institute for international and security affairs .
one of the experts , thomas ruttig , told dw-world.de last week it was important to recognize the fragmented structure of the taliban as it becomes increasingly difficult to establish with any certainty who is behind some of the violence in afghanistan .
" the taliban is by no means a homogeneous group , " ruttig said .
ruttig said the core of the taliban was made up of hardline ideologically and religiously motivated mujahedeen leaders .
but in addition , there were several other groups that loosely fell under the taliban banner .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even kabul , afghanistan 's capital , is considered unsafe for western workers he pointed out that a general collapse of law and order in afghanistan , rampant corruption , an explosion in the drugs trade and lack of food and money had led to widespread dissatisfaction among the afghan population .
that in turn had created fertile ground for criminal networks to flourish .
in the absence of a strong , national authority , the networks remain loyal to local clans like the pashtun tribe , an ethnic group that forms the majority of afghanistan 's diverse population and also inhabits the north-west frontier province -lrb- nwfp -rrb- and balochistan in neighboring pakistan , and have taken up arms against us forces .
these criminal groups are also increasingly blamed for a rise in kidnappings of foreigners in recent months .
experts urge caution given the complexity of the taliban structure , experts warn that kabul and western governments in afghanistan need to be careful about engaging with the terrorist group .
weisskirchen said it had to be made clear what " moderate taliban " are .
" they must recognize basic principles of international law and give up violence , " he said .

in exchange for cooperation , the bnd offered the taliban help with rebuilding the country 's crumbling infrastructure such as hospitals and mosques , the magazine said without citing its sources .
chancellor angela merkel 's office was aware of the talks as were france and us secret services , the magazine said .
the talks between the bnd and the taliban apparently ended in late summer 2005 because the germans were unable to prove that the taliban representatives spoke on behalf of leader mullah omar .
politicians split over talking to the enemy the magazine report comes at a time when politicians in merkel 's joint coalition made up of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- and the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- are sharply divided over negotiating with moderate taliban elements to stem the spiraling violence in afghanistan .
last week , three german police officers were killed in kabul , fuelling concerns in germany about the safety of its 3,200 soldiers stationed there as part of the nato-led peacekeeping force , isaf .
while some spd politicians are in favor of reaching out to moderate elements of the taliban in order to secure peace in volatile afghanistan , members of chancellor merkel 's cdu party are vehemently opposed to the proposal .
ruprecht polenz , a cdu foreign policy expert has warned that speaking to the taliban would " undermine the moral fundament for the german and international involvement in afghanistan . "
bildunterschrift : gert weisskirchen said he was surprised by the report 's directness gert weisskirchen , spd foreign policy expert told dw-world.de he was " surprised by the concreteness and directness of the -lrb- spiegel -rrb- magazine report , " but not that the talks had taken place .
" the fact that there have been efforts to speak with moderate , pragmatic elements of the taliban is nothing new , " he said .
complex taliban structure the belief that lasting peace in afghanistan can only be achieved by integrating moderate taliban elements in a reconciliation process was given added currency by a study by afghanistan experts at the berlin-based german institute for international and security affairs .
one of the experts , thomas ruttig , told dw-world.de last week it was important to recognize the fragmented structure of the taliban as it becomes increasingly difficult to establish with any certainty who is behind some of the violence in afghanistan .
" the taliban is by no means a homogeneous group , " ruttig said .
ruttig said the core of the taliban was made up of hardline ideologically and religiously motivated mujahedeen leaders .
but in addition , there were several other groups that loosely fell under the taliban banner .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even kabul , afghanistan 's capital , is considered unsafe for western workers he pointed out that a general collapse of law and order in afghanistan , rampant corruption , an explosion in the drugs trade and lack of food and money had led to widespread dissatisfaction among the afghan population .
that in turn had created fertile ground for criminal networks to flourish .
in the absence of a strong , national authority , the networks remain loyal to local clans like the pashtun tribe , an ethnic group that forms the majority of afghanistan 's diverse population and also inhabits the north-west frontier province -lrb- nwfp -rrb- and balochistan in neighboring pakistan , and have taken up arms against us forces .
these criminal groups are also increasingly blamed for a rise in kidnappings of foreigners in recent months .
experts urge caution given the complexity of the taliban structure , experts warn that kabul and western governments in afghanistan need to be careful about engaging with the terrorist group .
weisskirchen said it had to be made clear what " moderate taliban " are .

in its latest issue , german news magazine der spiegel reported that germany 's foreign intelligence service , the bnd , held secret talks with taliban representatives for several months in 2005 on neutral swiss territory .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's secret service in 2005 promised the taliban help with reconstruction the magazine said the bnd wanted to find out whether the taliban were prepared to distance themselves from the al-qaeda terrorist network .
in exchange for cooperation , the bnd offered the taliban help with rebuilding the country 's crumbling infrastructure such as hospitals and mosques , the magazine said without citing its sources .
chancellor angela merkel 's office was aware of the talks as were france and us secret services , the magazine said .
the talks between the bnd and the taliban apparently ended in late summer 2005 because the germans were unable to prove that the taliban representatives spoke on behalf of leader mullah omar .
politicians split over talking to the enemy the magazine report comes at a time when politicians in merkel 's joint coalition made up of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- and the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- are sharply divided over negotiating with moderate taliban elements to stem the spiraling violence in afghanistan .
last week , three german police officers were killed in kabul , fuelling concerns in germany about the safety of its 3,200 soldiers stationed there as part of the nato-led peacekeeping force , isaf .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de turkey -pipe- 20.08.2007 abdullah gül : the man who would be turkey 's president großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gül 's opponents have accused him of plotting to dismantle turkey 's secular state after causing turkey 's biggest political crisis in a decade , abdullah gül on monday again failed to be elected president in the first round of voting by falling short of the two-thirds majority necessary to win . turkey 's parliament is to pick a new president this month after the country 's secular opposition , backed by the military , derailed a previous election in april because of objections to the ruling justice and development party 's -lrb- akp -rrb- candidate , foreign minister abdullah gül .
following its decisive victory in the july 22 elections , the akp has re-nominated gül for the presidency .
the turkish parliament will choose the new president in a series of up to four votes , the first of was held on monday .
in the first round of voting , gül received 341 votes from the 550-seat house , 26 short of the two-thirds majority of 367 needed in the first round .
the second round of voting is scheduled for friday .
gül , a former islamist , hopes to placate those who opposed him in the april elections by expressing his commitment to turkey 's secular constitution .
" the constitution will be my guide , " gül said during the announcement of his second bid to become turkey 's new president last week .
" the republic of turkey is a democratic , secular and social state based on the rule of law .
my primary objective will be to protect and further strengthen these principles … " thousands protest against islamisation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands protested in support of secularism the ruling akp 's first nomination of gül to the presidency sparked turkey 's most serious political crisis in a decade , with hundreds of thousands of protestors rallying in the big cities in support of secularism .
the military also weighed in and warned that it would defend secularism at all costs .
the akp was forced to call early elections and on july 22 the islamist-rooted party won a decisive victory .
according to saban disli , the vice chairman of the akp , the election results were also a popular vindication of gül 's presidential bid , and anything other than his re-nomination would mean acting against the will of the electorate .
disli dismissed the fears of liberal and secularists who harbor concerns over gül 's islamist background .
" first of all mr. gül will be an independent president , he will be at equal distance to all political parties , all turkish people , " disli said .
" his only guideline will be the turkish constitution .
he says that he will be following up very closely what the constitution says and he will be safeguarding the turkish constitution - nothing more .
so i think gül will be a very good president of turkey . "
güls background a concern to many bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gül can not shake off the stigma of his islamist past what makes the idea of a gül presidency so controversial in turkey is his long history of involvement in political islamic movements .
he first became involved during his university days before joining the islamic development bank , in jeddah , saudi arabia , as an economist in 1983 .
after leaving the bank in 1991 , he entered politics and became a deputy of the islamist welfare party , rising to become state minister and spokesman in the erbakan government in 1996 .
however , his ambitions were curtailed by a political campaign backed by the military which ousted the government in 1997 .
despite his political background , gül has earned a worldwide reputation as a moderate conservative , reform-minded and pro-eu politician , particularly during the last four years as the akp government 's foreign minister .
these last few years have seen many changes in gül 's approach .
during the early 90s , he was highly critical of turkey 's western orientation and was against its possible membership to the european union .
but , as turkey 's foreign minister , he has overseen turkey 's bid to join the eu and has championed political and economic reforms .
he has also developed close working relationships with his european colleagues and has coordinated efforts to solve problems in the neighboring regions and the middle east .
during gul 's foreign ministry , turkey also adopted a new approach and formed closer relations with the arab and the muslim world .
under gül ’ s recommendation , a turkish scholar , ekmeleddin ihsanoglu , was elected as the new secretary general of saudi dominated organization of the islamic conference -lrb- oic -rrb- .
ihsanoglu , with the support of the turkish government , has initiated an ambitious reform agenda , to re-structure the organization , in order to make it a strong international body of muslim countries .
a man of contradictions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamas leaders were guests of the akp in ankara on the other hand , despite his perceived even-handedness , gül continues to cause concerns in the western world .
his continued close contacts with islamic organizations have particularly worried the us , especially after he welcomed a hamas delegation to ankara , presented a timid stance against iran 's nuclear program and made bellicose statements about attacking kurdish rebels in northern iraq , all of which did little to convince washington that a gül presidency could be fully depended on .
gül also harshly criticized the eu on cyprus and the us on its middle east policies ; however , in both cases , he also adopted a constructive and moderate approach that enabled quickly mending the ties .
despite these instances , gul 's overall performance in the last four years has been taken by many western powers as evidence of his new moderate ideas .
however , at home , turkey 's secularists still believe that this is just double-speak and akp is in fact itching to dismantle the secular character of turkish state .
secularists oppose gül as president bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the army vows to protect the constitution at all costs republican people 's party -lrb- chp -rrb- vice chairman onur oymen , who strongly opposes gul 's presidency , recently said that gül has provided enough evidence for his opponents to believe that under his presidency , turkey 's secular state would be at risk .
" he is on the record with his views against the basic principles of our republic , starting with secularism , the separation of religion from the affairs of the state , " oymen said .

according to semih idiz , a prominent turkish columnist , gul 's past record as foreign minister is not so problematic among the eyes of turkey 's liberals and seculars .

following its decisive victory in the july 22 elections , the akp has re-nominated gül for the presidency .
the turkish parliament will choose the new president in a series of up to four votes , the first of was held on monday .
in the first round of voting , gül received 341 votes from the 550-seat house , 26 short of the two-thirds majority of 367 needed in the first round .
the second round of voting is scheduled for friday .
gül , a former islamist , hopes to placate those who opposed him in the april elections by expressing his commitment to turkey 's secular constitution .
" the constitution will be my guide , " gül said during the announcement of his second bid to become turkey 's new president last week .
" the republic of turkey is a democratic , secular and social state based on the rule of law .
my primary objective will be to protect and further strengthen these principles … " thousands protest against islamisation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands protested in support of secularism the ruling akp 's first nomination of gül to the presidency sparked turkey 's most serious political crisis in a decade , with hundreds of thousands of protestors rallying in the big cities in support of secularism .
the military also weighed in and warned that it would defend secularism at all costs .
the akp was forced to call early elections and on july 22 the islamist-rooted party won a decisive victory .
according to saban disli , the vice chairman of the akp , the election results were also a popular vindication of gül 's presidential bid , and anything other than his re-nomination would mean acting against the will of the electorate .
disli dismissed the fears of liberal and secularists who harbor concerns over gül 's islamist background .
" first of all mr. gül will be an independent president , he will be at equal distance to all political parties , all turkish people , " disli said .
" his only guideline will be the turkish constitution .
he says that he will be following up very closely what the constitution says and he will be safeguarding the turkish constitution - nothing more .
so i think gül will be a very good president of turkey . "
güls background a concern to many bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gül can not shake off the stigma of his islamist past what makes the idea of a gül presidency so controversial in turkey is his long history of involvement in political islamic movements .
he first became involved during his university days before joining the islamic development bank , in jeddah , saudi arabia , as an economist in 1983 .
after leaving the bank in 1991 , he entered politics and became a deputy of the islamist welfare party , rising to become state minister and spokesman in the erbakan government in 1996 .
however , his ambitions were curtailed by a political campaign backed by the military which ousted the government in 1997 .
despite his political background , gül has earned a worldwide reputation as a moderate conservative , reform-minded and pro-eu politician , particularly during the last four years as the akp government 's foreign minister .
these last few years have seen many changes in gül 's approach .
during the early 90s , he was highly critical of turkey 's western orientation and was against its possible membership to the european union .
but , as turkey 's foreign minister , he has overseen turkey 's bid to join the eu and has championed political and economic reforms .
he has also developed close working relationships with his european colleagues and has coordinated efforts to solve problems in the neighboring regions and the middle east .
during gul 's foreign ministry , turkey also adopted a new approach and formed closer relations with the arab and the muslim world .
under gül ’ s recommendation , a turkish scholar , ekmeleddin ihsanoglu , was elected as the new secretary general of saudi dominated organization of the islamic conference -lrb- oic -rrb- .
ihsanoglu , with the support of the turkish government , has initiated an ambitious reform agenda , to re-structure the organization , in order to make it a strong international body of muslim countries .
a man of contradictions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamas leaders were guests of the akp in ankara on the other hand , despite his perceived even-handedness , gül continues to cause concerns in the western world .
his continued close contacts with islamic organizations have particularly worried the us , especially after he welcomed a hamas delegation to ankara , presented a timid stance against iran 's nuclear program and made bellicose statements about attacking kurdish rebels in northern iraq , all of which did little to convince washington that a gül presidency could be fully depended on .
gül also harshly criticized the eu on cyprus and the us on its middle east policies ; however , in both cases , he also adopted a constructive and moderate approach that enabled quickly mending the ties .
despite these instances , gul 's overall performance in the last four years has been taken by many western powers as evidence of his new moderate ideas .
however , at home , turkey 's secularists still believe that this is just double-speak and akp is in fact itching to dismantle the secular character of turkish state .
secularists oppose gül as president bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the army vows to protect the constitution at all costs republican people 's party -lrb- chp -rrb- vice chairman onur oymen , who strongly opposes gul 's presidency , recently said that gül has provided enough evidence for his opponents to believe that under his presidency , turkey 's secular state would be at risk .
" he is on the record with his views against the basic principles of our republic , starting with secularism , the separation of religion from the affairs of the state , " oymen said .

güls background a concern to many bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gül can not shake off the stigma of his islamist past what makes the idea of a gül presidency so controversial in turkey is his long history of involvement in political islamic movements .
he first became involved during his university days before joining the islamic development bank , in jeddah , saudi arabia , as an economist in 1983 .
after leaving the bank in 1991 , he entered politics and became a deputy of the islamist welfare party , rising to become state minister and spokesman in the erbakan government in 1996 .
however , his ambitions were curtailed by a political campaign backed by the military which ousted the government in 1997 .
despite his political background , gül has earned a worldwide reputation as a moderate conservative , reform-minded and pro-eu politician , particularly during the last four years as the akp government 's foreign minister .
these last few years have seen many changes in gül 's approach .
during the early 90s , he was highly critical of turkey 's western orientation and was against its possible membership to the european union .
but , as turkey 's foreign minister , he has overseen turkey 's bid to join the eu and has championed political and economic reforms .
he has also developed close working relationships with his european colleagues and has coordinated efforts to solve problems in the neighboring regions and the middle east .
during gul 's foreign ministry , turkey also adopted a new approach and formed closer relations with the arab and the muslim world .
under gül ’ s recommendation , a turkish scholar , ekmeleddin ihsanoglu , was elected as the new secretary general of saudi dominated organization of the islamic conference -lrb- oic -rrb- .
ihsanoglu , with the support of the turkish government , has initiated an ambitious reform agenda , to re-structure the organization , in order to make it a strong international body of muslim countries .
a man of contradictions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamas leaders were guests of the akp in ankara on the other hand , despite his perceived even-handedness , gül continues to cause concerns in the western world .
his continued close contacts with islamic organizations have particularly worried the us , especially after he welcomed a hamas delegation to ankara , presented a timid stance against iran 's nuclear program and made bellicose statements about attacking kurdish rebels in northern iraq , all of which did little to convince washington that a gül presidency could be fully depended on .
gül also harshly criticized the eu on cyprus and the us on its middle east policies ; however , in both cases , he also adopted a constructive and moderate approach that enabled quickly mending the ties .
despite these instances , gul 's overall performance in the last four years has been taken by many western powers as evidence of his new moderate ideas .
however , at home , turkey 's secularists still believe that this is just double-speak and akp is in fact itching to dismantle the secular character of turkish state .
secularists oppose gül as president bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the army vows to protect the constitution at all costs republican people 's party -lrb- chp -rrb- vice chairman onur oymen , who strongly opposes gul 's presidency , recently said that gül has provided enough evidence for his opponents to believe that under his presidency , turkey 's secular state would be at risk .
" he is on the record with his views against the basic principles of our republic , starting with secularism , the separation of religion from the affairs of the state , " oymen said .
" such a person , we believe , should not be the president of turkey . "
according to semih idiz , a prominent turkish columnist , gul 's past record as foreign minister is not so problematic among the eyes of turkey 's liberals and seculars .
but he said it is turkey 's secular forces , including the military , who are most suspicious of gul 's islamist past and because his wife wears a headscarf , a symbol of political islam .

the secularist forces in turkey do not want to see this because for them , it represents the collapse of the last bastion of secularism . "
idiz added that the secularist camp is increasingly concerned about the amount of power the akp has acquired ; it is currently in power , it has a strong majority in the parliament , including the prime minister and the speaker of the house and now it appears the next president could also come from the party .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de turkey -pipe- 20.08.2007 abdullah gül : the man who would be turkey 's president großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gül 's opponents have accused him of plotting to dismantle turkey 's secular state after causing turkey 's biggest political crisis in a decade , abdullah gül on monday again failed to be elected president in the first round of voting by falling short of the two-thirds majority necessary to win . turkey 's parliament is to pick a new president this month after the country 's secular opposition , backed by the military , derailed a previous election in april because of objections to the ruling justice and development party 's -lrb- akp -rrb- candidate , foreign minister abdullah gül .
following its decisive victory in the july 22 elections , the akp has re-nominated gül for the presidency .
the turkish parliament will choose the new president in a series of up to four votes , the first of was held on monday .
in the first round of voting , gül received 341 votes from the 550-seat house , 26 short of the two-thirds majority of 367 needed in the first round .
the second round of voting is scheduled for friday .
gül , a former islamist , hopes to placate those who opposed him in the april elections by expressing his commitment to turkey 's secular constitution .
" the constitution will be my guide , " gül said during the announcement of his second bid to become turkey 's new president last week .
" the republic of turkey is a democratic , secular and social state based on the rule of law .
my primary objective will be to protect and further strengthen these principles … " thousands protest against islamisation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands protested in support of secularism the ruling akp 's first nomination of gül to the presidency sparked turkey 's most serious political crisis in a decade , with hundreds of thousands of protestors rallying in the big cities in support of secularism .
the military also weighed in and warned that it would defend secularism at all costs .
the akp was forced to call early elections and on july 22 the islamist-rooted party won a decisive victory .
according to saban disli , the vice chairman of the akp , the election results were also a popular vindication of gül 's presidential bid , and anything other than his re-nomination would mean acting against the will of the electorate .
disli dismissed the fears of liberal and secularists who harbor concerns over gül 's islamist background .
" first of all mr. gül will be an independent president , he will be at equal distance to all political parties , all turkish people , " disli said .
" his only guideline will be the turkish constitution .
he says that he will be following up very closely what the constitution says and he will be safeguarding the turkish constitution - nothing more .
so i think gül will be a very good president of turkey . "
güls background a concern to many bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gül can not shake off the stigma of his islamist past what makes the idea of a gül presidency so controversial in turkey is his long history of involvement in political islamic movements .
he first became involved during his university days before joining the islamic development bank , in jeddah , saudi arabia , as an economist in 1983 .
after leaving the bank in 1991 , he entered politics and became a deputy of the islamist welfare party , rising to become state minister and spokesman in the erbakan government in 1996 .
however , his ambitions were curtailed by a political campaign backed by the military which ousted the government in 1997 .
despite his political background , gül has earned a worldwide reputation as a moderate conservative , reform-minded and pro-eu politician , particularly during the last four years as the akp government 's foreign minister .
these last few years have seen many changes in gül 's approach .
during the early 90s , he was highly critical of turkey 's western orientation and was against its possible membership to the european union .
but , as turkey 's foreign minister , he has overseen turkey 's bid to join the eu and has championed political and economic reforms .
he has also developed close working relationships with his european colleagues and has coordinated efforts to solve problems in the neighboring regions and the middle east .
during gul 's foreign ministry , turkey also adopted a new approach and formed closer relations with the arab and the muslim world .
under gül ’ s recommendation , a turkish scholar , ekmeleddin ihsanoglu , was elected as the new secretary general of saudi dominated organization of the islamic conference -lrb- oic -rrb- .
ihsanoglu , with the support of the turkish government , has initiated an ambitious reform agenda , to re-structure the organization , in order to make it a strong international body of muslim countries .
a man of contradictions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamas leaders were guests of the akp in ankara on the other hand , despite his perceived even-handedness , gül continues to cause concerns in the western world .
his continued close contacts with islamic organizations have particularly worried the us , especially after he welcomed a hamas delegation to ankara , presented a timid stance against iran 's nuclear program and made bellicose statements about attacking kurdish rebels in northern iraq , all of which did little to convince washington that a gül presidency could be fully depended on .
gül also harshly criticized the eu on cyprus and the us on its middle east policies ; however , in both cases , he also adopted a constructive and moderate approach that enabled quickly mending the ties .
despite these instances , gul 's overall performance in the last four years has been taken by many western powers as evidence of his new moderate ideas .
however , at home , turkey 's secularists still believe that this is just double-speak and akp is in fact itching to dismantle the secular character of turkish state .
secularists oppose gül as president bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the army vows to protect the constitution at all costs republican people 's party -lrb- chp -rrb- vice chairman onur oymen , who strongly opposes gul 's presidency , recently said that gül has provided enough evidence for his opponents to believe that under his presidency , turkey 's secular state would be at risk .
" he is on the record with his views against the basic principles of our republic , starting with secularism , the separation of religion from the affairs of the state , " oymen said .
" such a person , we believe , should not be the president of turkey . "
according to semih idiz , a prominent turkish columnist , gul 's past record as foreign minister is not so problematic among the eyes of turkey 's liberals and seculars .
but he said it is turkey 's secular forces , including the military , who are most suspicious of gul 's islamist past and because his wife wears a headscarf , a symbol of political islam .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gül 's islamist past and his wife 's headscarf are issues " his performance -lrb- as the foreign minister -rrb- has been rather positive and this is the general understanding , " idiz said .
" it is his islamic background that is creating the controversy here and in particular the fact that his wife 's head is covered .
the secularist forces in turkey do not want to see this because for them , it represents the collapse of the last bastion of secularism . "
idiz added that the secularist camp is increasingly concerned about the amount of power the akp has acquired ; it is currently in power , it has a strong majority in the parliament , including the prime minister and the speaker of the house and now it appears the next president could also come from the party .
" the secularists say this is unacceptable , " idiz said .
akp consolidating power bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the akp has a huge majority , large support and key roles in parliament in the turkish parliamentary system , policies are defined and carried out by the government , but the president also has significant power over decisions .
he or she must approve every law and formal decision emerging from the parliament , as well as the appointments of key officials , including generals , governors , ambassadors and university rectors .
secularists fear abdullah gül as president would promote islamist candidates to key state institutions , gradually undermining secularism .
the akp dismisses charges that it has a secret islamist agenda , and describes itself as a " conservative democrat " party .
but secularists point to its record in the past five years , including encouragement of religious schools , failed attempts to restrict alcohol sales and make adultery a punishable crime .
turkey 's military , which traditionally views itself as the guardian of secularism , refrained from making a hasty statement on gül 's re-nomination .
the akp 's saban disli has said that the military will adopt a " wait and see " approach on abdullah gül 's presidency .
" the military as usual is showing great responsibility , " disli said .
" the military 's public declarations have always quoted the constitution .
with the akp having won the election with a large majority , and with gül declaring that he will guard the secular statute of turkey , turkish democracy , turkish civil rights and economic development … i think it is very important the military take this patient approach .

now , a government study warns that the skills crunch will cost the nation more than 20 billion euros -lrb- $ 27 billion -rrb- this year . a study commissioned by the german economics ministry and whose results were published in a newspaper this week carried probably the most dire warning of how a long-standing skills shortage could put a dent in the resurgent german economy if steps are n't taken to tackle the problem .
quoting from the study , german daily süddeutsche zeitung said the economic loss resulting from unfilled jobs could reach a two-digit figure in the billions .
" this could reach up to one percent of gross domestic product , " the paper said , citing the study .
that would amount to more than 20 million euros -lrb- $ 26.8 million -rrb- , it added .
acute skills crunch german business and industry representatives have for years complained of a lack of qualified professionals in critical hi-tech sectors , warning that it could seriously undermine the country 's competitiveness in an increasingly globalized world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany could lack 135,000 scientists by 2014 the study concluded that the number of jobs that were either filled after delays or were n't filled at all was in the six-digit region .
the crunch is particularly acute in areas such as engineering , the metal and electronics industry and the services sector .
young brains are missing in academic subjects such as mathematics , natural sciences and technology , the study said .
it calculates that germany would lack up to 95,000 engineers and 135,000 scientists by 2014 .
the study is likely to provide food for thought for the german government when it meets later this week for a special cabinet retreat to discuss the skills shortage , among other issues .
the topic has long been a sticking point in germany with politicians divided on easing tight immigration restrictions for highly-qualified professionals . some argue that instead of relying on foreign skilled labor , german businesses should focus instead on training students and budding scientists in the country .
immigration still an ideological issue german education and research minister annette schavan has long favored lowering the unrealistically high income bar for immigrants .
so far , skilled professionals can only come to germany if they can prove they earn an annual salary of 85,000 euros .
schavan wants to reduce that limit to between 40,000 and 60,000 euros - a figure that many business leaders say is still too high .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigration is still plagued by ideological hang-ups in germany but german economics minister michael glos , whose ministry commissioned the latest study , remains reserved about easing immigration restrictions for skilled labor . in a paper published by his ministry , he merely spoke of a " partial opening " of the german labor market for certain segments , of reducing the number of school dropouts and of easing job restrictions for graduates from german universities .
in an editorial in its monday edition , the munich-based süddeutsche zeitung urged chancellor angela merkel 's government to finally take steps to remedy the skills crisis in germany .
" immigration is handled ideologically instead of objectively in the governing coalition , " the paper wrote , adding that politicians still feared the effect that opening the doors to skilled labor could have on germany 's 3.7 million unemployed .

now , a government study warns that the skills crunch will cost the nation more than 20 billion euros -lrb- $ 27 billion -rrb- this year . a study commissioned by the german economics ministry and whose results were published in a newspaper this week carried probably the most dire warning of how a long-standing skills shortage could put a dent in the resurgent german economy if steps are n't taken to tackle the problem .
quoting from the study , german daily süddeutsche zeitung said the economic loss resulting from unfilled jobs could reach a two-digit figure in the billions .
" this could reach up to one percent of gross domestic product , " the paper said , citing the study .
that would amount to more than 20 million euros -lrb- $ 26.8 million -rrb- , it added .
acute skills crunch german business and industry representatives have for years complained of a lack of qualified professionals in critical hi-tech sectors , warning that it could seriously undermine the country 's competitiveness in an increasingly globalized world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany could lack 135,000 scientists by 2014 the study concluded that the number of jobs that were either filled after delays or were n't filled at all was in the six-digit region .
the crunch is particularly acute in areas such as engineering , the metal and electronics industry and the services sector .
young brains are missing in academic subjects such as mathematics , natural sciences and technology , the study said .
it calculates that germany would lack up to 95,000 engineers and 135,000 scientists by 2014 .
the study is likely to provide food for thought for the german government when it meets later this week for a special cabinet retreat to discuss the skills shortage , among other issues .
the topic has long been a sticking point in germany with politicians divided on easing tight immigration restrictions for highly-qualified professionals . some argue that instead of relying on foreign skilled labor , german businesses should focus instead on training students and budding scientists in the country .
immigration still an ideological issue german education and research minister annette schavan has long favored lowering the unrealistically high income bar for immigrants .
so far , skilled professionals can only come to germany if they can prove they earn an annual salary of 85,000 euros .
schavan wants to reduce that limit to between 40,000 and 60,000 euros - a figure that many business leaders say is still too high .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigration is still plagued by ideological hang-ups in germany but german economics minister michael glos , whose ministry commissioned the latest study , remains reserved about easing immigration restrictions for skilled labor . in a paper published by his ministry , he merely spoke of a " partial opening " of the german labor market for certain segments , of reducing the number of school dropouts and of easing job restrictions for graduates from german universities .
in an editorial in its monday edition , the munich-based süddeutsche zeitung urged chancellor angela merkel 's government to finally take steps to remedy the skills crisis in germany .
" immigration is handled ideologically instead of objectively in the governing coalition , " the paper wrote , adding that politicians still feared the effect that opening the doors to skilled labor could have on germany 's 3.7 million unemployed .
" but that does n't help anyone - not even the jobless , " the paper said .

" it shows how a man without particular talent can turn himself into an artistic figure . " anyone who thinks an opera about the media-hungry socialite is trash is dead wrong , director robert lehmeier insisted .
he said the piece really explores how moshammer used the media and vice versa , and the interplay between fame , the media , and consumers . pop culture under the microscope " i could have told the whole story in five minutes , but that would have been too boring , " lehmeier told the tagesspiegel . " it 's about how everyone has a role , and the performance depends on everyone who plays along . " pop culture and political topics are commonplace for the neuköllner opera house , which has previously staged an opera on angela merkel and made a musical about the iraq war . robert lehmeier will direct " moshammeroper .

experts say the call is misguided and out of touch with reality . what do beaches in thailand , bazaars in cairo and the desert of rajasthan have in common during the summer ?
loads of german holidaymakers . world-beaters when it comes to travel , german tourists made 86.6 million foreign trips in 2005 , the last year for which statistics are available .
from those , some 24 million were made to countries outside the european union . turkey topped the list of most popular destinations - almost four million germans traveled there that year - followed by egypt and tunisia . " look over the fence " now , this vast army of globe-trotters has been asked to do more than work on a tan while vacationing abroad . last week , the german government 's commissioner for human rights made a sudden appeal to german tourists to be more critical of social and political conditions when they jet off to far-flung destinations with dubious human rights records . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : günter nooke was a civil rights activist in former communist east germany at a press conference in berlin , günter nooke singled out countries such as cuba , mexico , egypt , thailand , turkey , kenya , mexico , the dominican republic and indonesia for deficits in human rights . he urged german tourists not to be " taken in by glossy appearances " and to " look over the fence of their holiday resort . " " away from beaches and palm trees , there are people living there whose human rights are trampled upon . " nooke stressed he did n't want to dissuade germans from traveling to countries with poor human rights .
rather , tourists should inform themselves about the situation and should bring up issues such as censorship , press freedom and torture in talks with local people in the places they travel to , he said . the problem with speaking out campaigners working to promote ethical travel and human rights say that nooke 's remarks may have been well-intentioned , but that they appear to be short-sighted , nonetheless . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tunisia is a popular destination for german tourists " it really depends on where you 're traveling , " said regina spöttl from the german chapter of amnesty international . " in countries such as syria and tunisia for instance , where intelligence agencies are ubiquitous , you have to be careful speaking about the political situation .
as a western tourist , you 're probably not at risk , but you could easily put the local person you talk to in great danger , " she said . more often than not , political abuse and social mistreatment are not entirely obvious to western tourists . " there are dozens of examples of how tourism is repeatedly a part of human rights violations in an understated way , " said hein fuchs , an expert at tourism watch , set up by the protestant church in germany . he cited the erection of special tourist zones in kerala , southern india , a popular destination for well-heeled german tourists seeking ayurveda treatment in luxurious spas . often bypassing the established legal procedures , such tourist areas tend to be associated with a range of problems including displacement of local communities , environmental destruction and illegal working conditions , for instance . underestimating today 's tourist ? last week , nooke also urged travel companies to mention the state of human rights when they advertise sunny beaches and swanky resorts in their glossy brochures - a somewhat naïve suggestion , some campaigners say . given the sheer range of information available , tourists nowadays have a deeper knowledge of foreign destinations and are increasingly critical , fuchs said .
and slowly but surely , the travel industry is adapting to the needs of the better-informed tourist , he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tourists today are usually well-informed , say experts at the turn of the 21st century , sustainable tourism and eco-friendliness became the new mantra of the travel industry . " it 's true you do n't have the same emphasis on the social dimension of tourism when the aim is to make it a win-win situation for all involved , including the local population at the tourist destination , " he said .
" but things are improving . " for starters , most german travel companies have adopted a code of conduct developed by un agencies and the european commission to protect children from sexual exploitation in tourism . traveling ethically given the explosion of niche travel agencies that specialize in socially responsible and sustainable travel routes , campaigners say that germans seeking to travel ethically have never had as much choice as they do today . " why would a curious tourist nowadays choose an all-inclusive package tour with a travel company where even the bazaar is artificial when he has an alternative or can travel on his own , " said fuchs . a decade ago , german tourists on study tours only wanted to visit historical ruins .
now , the emphasis is on getting to know the country , its people and its social problems , said klaus dietsch , spokesman for studiosus , a munich-based travel company which offers special educational tours to over 100 destinations around the world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gone are the days when tourists only wanted to visit ruins and monuments " just flying to a far-away country and lying in the sun for two weeks in some fancy resort is n't what they want . " in order to have a more responsible vacation abroad , travelers simply need be discerning when it comes to organizing their trip , experts say .
and they need to read up on their destinations and walk around with their ears and eyes wide open . so , was nooke 's unusual appeal to german tourists to be more critical of human rights merely an attempt to fill in a news void during the holiday season ? not everyone would say so . " i 'm always happy when politicians , irrespective of their political convictions , push the topic of human rights into public consciousness - even if it 's controversial , " said amnesty 's spöttl .

experts say the call is misguided and out of touch with reality . what do beaches in thailand , bazaars in cairo and the desert of rajasthan have in common during the summer ?
loads of german holidaymakers . world-beaters when it comes to travel , german tourists made 86.6 million foreign trips in 2005 , the last year for which statistics are available .
from those , some 24 million were made to countries outside the european union . turkey topped the list of most popular destinations - almost four million germans traveled there that year - followed by egypt and tunisia . " look over the fence " now , this vast army of globe-trotters has been asked to do more than work on a tan while vacationing abroad . last week , the german government 's commissioner for human rights made a sudden appeal to german tourists to be more critical of social and political conditions when they jet off to far-flung destinations with dubious human rights records . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : günter nooke was a civil rights activist in former communist east germany at a press conference in berlin , günter nooke singled out countries such as cuba , mexico , egypt , thailand , turkey , kenya , mexico , the dominican republic and indonesia for deficits in human rights . he urged german tourists not to be " taken in by glossy appearances " and to " look over the fence of their holiday resort . " " away from beaches and palm trees , there are people living there whose human rights are trampled upon . " nooke stressed he did n't want to dissuade germans from traveling to countries with poor human rights .
rather , tourists should inform themselves about the situation and should bring up issues such as censorship , press freedom and torture in talks with local people in the places they travel to , he said . the problem with speaking out campaigners working to promote ethical travel and human rights say that nooke 's remarks may have been well-intentioned , but that they appear to be short-sighted , nonetheless . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tunisia is a popular destination for german tourists " it really depends on where you 're traveling , " said regina spöttl from the german chapter of amnesty international . " in countries such as syria and tunisia for instance , where intelligence agencies are ubiquitous , you have to be careful speaking about the political situation .
as a western tourist , you 're probably not at risk , but you could easily put the local person you talk to in great danger , " she said . more often than not , political abuse and social mistreatment are not entirely obvious to western tourists . " there are dozens of examples of how tourism is repeatedly a part of human rights violations in an understated way , " said hein fuchs , an expert at tourism watch , set up by the protestant church in germany . he cited the erection of special tourist zones in kerala , southern india , a popular destination for well-heeled german tourists seeking ayurveda treatment in luxurious spas . often bypassing the established legal procedures , such tourist areas tend to be associated with a range of problems including displacement of local communities , environmental destruction and illegal working conditions , for instance . underestimating today 's tourist ? last week , nooke also urged travel companies to mention the state of human rights when they advertise sunny beaches and swanky resorts in their glossy brochures - a somewhat naïve suggestion , some campaigners say . given the sheer range of information available , tourists nowadays have a deeper knowledge of foreign destinations and are increasingly critical , fuchs said .
and slowly but surely , the travel industry is adapting to the needs of the better-informed tourist , he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tourists today are usually well-informed , say experts at the turn of the 21st century , sustainable tourism and eco-friendliness became the new mantra of the travel industry . " it 's true you do n't have the same emphasis on the social dimension of tourism when the aim is to make it a win-win situation for all involved , including the local population at the tourist destination , " he said .
" but things are improving . " for starters , most german travel companies have adopted a code of conduct developed by un agencies and the european commission to protect children from sexual exploitation in tourism . traveling ethically given the explosion of niche travel agencies that specialize in socially responsible and sustainable travel routes , campaigners say that germans seeking to travel ethically have never had as much choice as they do today . " why would a curious tourist nowadays choose an all-inclusive package tour with a travel company where even the bazaar is artificial when he has an alternative or can travel on his own , " said fuchs . a decade ago , german tourists on study tours only wanted to visit historical ruins .
now , the emphasis is on getting to know the country , its people and its social problems , said klaus dietsch , spokesman for studiosus , a munich-based travel company which offers special educational tours to over 100 destinations around the world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gone are the days when tourists only wanted to visit ruins and monuments " just flying to a far-away country and lying in the sun for two weeks in some fancy resort is n't what they want . " in order to have a more responsible vacation abroad , travelers simply need be discerning when it comes to organizing their trip , experts say .
and they need to read up on their destinations and walk around with their ears and eyes wide open . so , was nooke 's unusual appeal to german tourists to be more critical of human rights merely an attempt to fill in a news void during the holiday season ? not everyone would say so . " i 'm always happy when politicians , irrespective of their political convictions , push the topic of human rights into public consciousness - even if it 's controversial , " said amnesty 's spöttl .
" that does n't happen everyday . " sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in its latest issue , german news magazine der spiegel reported that germany 's foreign intelligence service , the bnd , held secret talks with taliban representatives for several months in 2005 on neutral swiss territory .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's secret service in 2005 promised the taliban help with reconstruction the magazine said the bnd wanted to find out whether the taliban were prepared to distance themselves from the al-qaeda terrorist network .
in exchange for cooperation , the bnd offered the taliban help with rebuilding the country 's crumbling infrastructure such as hospitals and mosques , the magazine said without citing its sources .
chancellor angela merkel 's office was aware of the talks as were france and us secret services , the magazine said .
the talks between the bnd and the taliban apparently ended in late summer 2005 because the germans were unable to prove that the taliban representatives spoke on behalf of leader mullah omar .
politicians split over talking to the enemy the magazine report comes at a time when politicians in merkel 's joint coalition made up of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- and the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- are sharply divided over negotiating with moderate taliban elements to stem the spiraling violence in afghanistan .
last week , three german police officers were killed in kabul , fuelling concerns in germany about the safety of its 3,200 soldiers stationed there as part of the nato-led peacekeeping force , isaf .
while some spd politicians are in favor of reaching out to moderate elements of the taliban in order to secure peace in volatile afghanistan , members of chancellor merkel 's cdu party are vehemently opposed to the proposal .
ruprecht polenz , a cdu foreign policy expert has warned that speaking to the taliban would " undermine the moral fundament for the german and international involvement in afghanistan . "
bildunterschrift : gert weisskirchen said he was surprised by the report 's directness gert weisskirchen , spd foreign policy expert told dw-world.de he was " surprised by the concreteness and directness of the -lrb- spiegel -rrb- magazine report , " but not that the talks had taken place .
" the fact that there have been efforts to speak with moderate , pragmatic elements of the taliban is nothing new , " he said .
complex taliban structure the belief that lasting peace in afghanistan can only be achieved by integrating moderate taliban elements in a reconciliation process was given added currency by a study by afghanistan experts at the berlin-based german institute for international and security affairs .
one of the experts , thomas ruttig , told dw-world.de last week it was important to recognize the fragmented structure of the taliban as it becomes increasingly difficult to establish with any certainty who is behind some of the violence in afghanistan .
" the taliban is by no means a homogeneous group , " ruttig said .
ruttig said the core of the taliban was made up of hardline ideologically and religiously motivated mujahedeen leaders .
but in addition , there were several other groups that loosely fell under the taliban banner .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even kabul , afghanistan 's capital , is considered unsafe for western workers he pointed out that a general collapse of law and order in afghanistan , rampant corruption , an explosion in the drugs trade and lack of food and money had led to widespread dissatisfaction among the afghan population .
that in turn had created fertile ground for criminal networks to flourish .
in the absence of a strong , national authority , the networks remain loyal to local clans like the pashtun tribe , an ethnic group that forms the majority of afghanistan 's diverse population and also inhabits the north-west frontier province -lrb- nwfp -rrb- and balochistan in neighboring pakistan , and have taken up arms against us forces .
these criminal groups are also increasingly blamed for a rise in kidnappings of foreigners in recent months .
experts urge caution given the complexity of the taliban structure , experts warn that kabul and western governments in afghanistan need to be careful about engaging with the terrorist group .
weisskirchen said it had to be made clear what " moderate taliban " are .

" alcohol played a role " it remains unclear what sparked the incident and whether the large crowd of onlookers cheered on the mob or failed to intervene .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eastern germany is struggling with a rise in right-wing extremism " the fact is - alcohol played a role at the time , " böttcher said .
saxony police revealed news of the incident almost a day after it took place .
formerly part of communist east germany , saxony has seen a high rate of violence and racially-motivated attacks against foreigners since german reunification in 1990 .
eastern germany is also grappling with a resurgence in right-wing extremism after recent electoral successes of the far-right npd party . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

experts say the call is misguided and out of touch with reality . what do beaches in thailand , bazaars in cairo and the desert of rajasthan have in common during the summer ?
loads of german holidaymakers . world-beaters when it comes to travel , german tourists made 86.6 million foreign trips in 2005 , the last year for which statistics are available .
from those , some 24 million were made to countries outside the european union . turkey topped the list of most popular destinations - almost four million germans traveled there that year - followed by egypt and tunisia . " look over the fence " now , this vast army of globe-trotters has been asked to do more than work on a tan while vacationing abroad . last week , the german government 's commissioner for human rights made a sudden appeal to german tourists to be more critical of social and political conditions when they jet off to far-flung destinations with dubious human rights records . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : günter nooke was a civil rights activist in former communist east germany at a press conference in berlin , günter nooke singled out countries such as cuba , mexico , egypt , thailand , turkey , kenya , mexico , the dominican republic and indonesia for deficits in human rights . he urged german tourists not to be " taken in by glossy appearances " and to " look over the fence of their holiday resort . " " away from beaches and palm trees , there are people living there whose human rights are trampled upon . " nooke stressed he did n't want to dissuade germans from traveling to countries with poor human rights .
rather , tourists should inform themselves about the situation and should bring up issues such as censorship , press freedom and torture in talks with local people in the places they travel to , he said . the problem with speaking out campaigners working to promote ethical travel and human rights say that nooke 's remarks may have been well-intentioned , but that they appear to be short-sighted , nonetheless . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tunisia is a popular destination for german tourists " it really depends on where you 're traveling , " said regina spöttl from the german chapter of amnesty international . " in countries such as syria and tunisia for instance , where intelligence agencies are ubiquitous , you have to be careful speaking about the political situation .
as a western tourist , you 're probably not at risk , but you could easily put the local person you talk to in great danger , " she said . more often than not , political abuse and social mistreatment are not entirely obvious to western tourists . " there are dozens of examples of how tourism is repeatedly a part of human rights violations in an understated way , " said hein fuchs , an expert at tourism watch , set up by the protestant church in germany . he cited the erection of special tourist zones in kerala , southern india , a popular destination for well-heeled german tourists seeking ayurveda treatment in luxurious spas . often bypassing the established legal procedures , such tourist areas tend to be associated with a range of problems including displacement of local communities , environmental destruction and illegal working conditions , for instance . underestimating today 's tourist ? last week , nooke also urged travel companies to mention the state of human rights when they advertise sunny beaches and swanky resorts in their glossy brochures - a somewhat naïve suggestion , some campaigners say . given the sheer range of information available , tourists nowadays have a deeper knowledge of foreign destinations and are increasingly critical , fuchs said .
and slowly but surely , the travel industry is adapting to the needs of the better-informed tourist , he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tourists today are usually well-informed , say experts at the turn of the 21st century , sustainable tourism and eco-friendliness became the new mantra of the travel industry . " it 's true you do n't have the same emphasis on the social dimension of tourism when the aim is to make it a win-win situation for all involved , including the local population at the tourist destination , " he said .
" but things are improving . " for starters , most german travel companies have adopted a code of conduct developed by un agencies and the european commission to protect children from sexual exploitation in tourism . traveling ethically given the explosion of niche travel agencies that specialize in socially responsible and sustainable travel routes , campaigners say that germans seeking to travel ethically have never had as much choice as they do today . " why would a curious tourist nowadays choose an all-inclusive package tour with a travel company where even the bazaar is artificial when he has an alternative or can travel on his own , " said fuchs . a decade ago , german tourists on study tours only wanted to visit historical ruins .
now , the emphasis is on getting to know the country , its people and its social problems , said klaus dietsch , spokesman for studiosus , a munich-based travel company which offers special educational tours to over 100 destinations around the world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gone are the days when tourists only wanted to visit ruins and monuments " just flying to a far-away country and lying in the sun for two weeks in some fancy resort is n't what they want . " in order to have a more responsible vacation abroad , travelers simply need be discerning when it comes to organizing their trip , experts say .
and they need to read up on their destinations and walk around with their ears and eyes wide open . so , was nooke 's unusual appeal to german tourists to be more critical of human rights merely an attempt to fill in a news void during the holiday season ? not everyone would say so . " i 'm always happy when politicians , irrespective of their political convictions , push the topic of human rights into public consciousness - even if it 's controversial , " said amnesty 's spöttl .

in its latest issue , german news magazine der spiegel reported that germany 's foreign intelligence service , the bnd , held secret talks with taliban representatives for several months in 2005 on neutral swiss territory .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's secret service in 2005 promised the taliban help with reconstruction the magazine said the bnd wanted to find out whether the taliban were prepared to distance themselves from the al-qaeda terrorist network .
in exchange for cooperation , the bnd offered the taliban help with rebuilding the country 's crumbling infrastructure such as hospitals and mosques , the magazine said without citing its sources .
chancellor angela merkel 's office was aware of the talks as were france and us secret services , the magazine said .
the talks between the bnd and the taliban apparently ended in late summer 2005 because the germans were unable to prove that the taliban representatives spoke on behalf of leader mullah omar .
politicians split over talking to the enemy the magazine report comes at a time when politicians in merkel 's joint coalition made up of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- and the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- are sharply divided over negotiating with moderate taliban elements to stem the spiraling violence in afghanistan .
last week , three german police officers were killed in kabul , fuelling concerns in germany about the safety of its 3,200 soldiers stationed there as part of the nato-led peacekeeping force , isaf .
while some spd politicians are in favor of reaching out to moderate elements of the taliban in order to secure peace in volatile afghanistan , members of chancellor merkel 's cdu party are vehemently opposed to the proposal .
ruprecht polenz , a cdu foreign policy expert has warned that speaking to the taliban would " undermine the moral fundament for the german and international involvement in afghanistan . "
bildunterschrift : gert weisskirchen said he was surprised by the report 's directness gert weisskirchen , spd foreign policy expert told dw-world.de he was " surprised by the concreteness and directness of the -lrb- spiegel -rrb- magazine report , " but not that the talks had taken place .
" the fact that there have been efforts to speak with moderate , pragmatic elements of the taliban is nothing new , " he said .
complex taliban structure the belief that lasting peace in afghanistan can only be achieved by integrating moderate taliban elements in a reconciliation process was given added currency by a study by afghanistan experts at the berlin-based german institute for international and security affairs .
one of the experts , thomas ruttig , told dw-world.de last week it was important to recognize the fragmented structure of the taliban as it becomes increasingly difficult to establish with any certainty who is behind some of the violence in afghanistan .
" the taliban is by no means a homogeneous group , " ruttig said .
ruttig said the core of the taliban was made up of hardline ideologically and religiously motivated mujahedeen leaders .
but in addition , there were several other groups that loosely fell under the taliban banner .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even kabul , afghanistan 's capital , is considered unsafe for western workers he pointed out that a general collapse of law and order in afghanistan , rampant corruption , an explosion in the drugs trade and lack of food and money had led to widespread dissatisfaction among the afghan population .
that in turn had created fertile ground for criminal networks to flourish .
in the absence of a strong , national authority , the networks remain loyal to local clans like the pashtun tribe , an ethnic group that forms the majority of afghanistan 's diverse population and also inhabits the north-west frontier province -lrb- nwfp -rrb- and balochistan in neighboring pakistan , and have taken up arms against us forces .
these criminal groups are also increasingly blamed for a rise in kidnappings of foreigners in recent months .
experts urge caution given the complexity of the taliban structure , experts warn that kabul and western governments in afghanistan need to be careful about engaging with the terrorist group .
weisskirchen said it had to be made clear what " moderate taliban " are .
" they must recognize basic principles of international law and give up violence , " he said .
" and they have to give afghanistan 's civil government priority . " sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

according to police , the german mob kicked in the door to the restaurant .
around 70 police officers were needed to break up the assailants .
in the ensuing melee , all eight indians and four germans - among them two police officers - were injured .
two of the wounded had to be treated in hospital .
a large crowd apparently witnessed the violence .
" we 're not ruling out a xenophobic motive , " bernd merbitz , police chief of saxony told german news agency dpa .
authorities have formed a task force to investigate the incident .
there were no news of arrests .
the incident took place in mügeln , about 45 kilometers east of leipzig , the largest city in saxony .
racially-motivated crime ?
the leipziger-volkszeitung daily in leipzig reported on monday that the german mob had shouted xenophobic slogans .
reinhard böttcher of the local police force said he could n't confirm the report but added that according to eye witness statements , the mob could have shouted right-wing insults .
the paper also reported that the german mob had smashed the window panes of the pizzeria and damaged the owner 's car .
" if the police had n't come , something much worse might have happened here , " the paper quoted the pizzeria owner as saying .
mügeln 's mayor , gotthard deuse , told the paper he believed the incident was racially motivated and that right-wing slogans were chanted .
" alcohol played a role " it remains unclear what sparked the incident and whether the large crowd of onlookers cheered on the mob or failed to intervene .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eastern germany is struggling with a rise in right-wing extremism " the fact is - alcohol played a role at the time , " böttcher said .
saxony police revealed news of the incident almost a day after it took place .
formerly part of communist east germany , saxony has seen a high rate of violence and racially-motivated attacks against foreigners since german reunification in 1990 .

here he answers some of the questions readers have been asking about his trip .
how much journalistic freedom did you have to make your reports ?
could you go where you wanted or were you taken to the places the chinese wanted you to see ?
michael massey , nancy , france i was on a tour on which a group of foreign journalists based in china was taken to tibet by the chinese government . "
tibetans enjoy a certain level of religious freedom " the government planned our itinerary and escorted us during the entire six days we were there .
i think it 's safe to assume that officials took us to places they wanted us to visit .
having said that , journalists were given some leeway to break off from the schedule , go to places on their own and conduct their own interviews .
government-supplied interviewees were also prepared to answer any questions put to them .
it is very hard for me to understand how you can claim that there is even minimal political and religious freedom in tibet .
johann kupeczki , cooloola cove , australia people can worship openly on the streets and in temples and monasteries , so there is at least some level of religious freedom .
however , the fact that the dalai lama can not be openly venerated shows the limits to that freedom .
politically , tibetans , just like people in other parts of china , are subject to one-party rule .
tibet 's sensitive status means there are tighter restrictions there .
but the chinese communist party claims it listens to what ordinary people say before making decisions .
this is how they define democracy .
of course , westerners would not recognise this as political freedom .
have you ever seen any human rights activists in tibet gathering first-hand information ?
john , maryland , us i 'm sure most human rights groups would welcome an invitation to visit tibet , but they are not welcome .
the experiences of manfred nowak , the un 's rapporteur on torture , illustrates just how unwelcome independent investigators are in china .
he visited china in 2005 - 10 years after an initial request .
while here , he says his work was obstructed by security officials .
faced with this situation , human rights groups act in different ways .
some try to sneak in and carry out what research they can , others decide not to try .
they also say they try to engage the chinese government in discussion about their work , but with little or no success .
china is often accused of actively promoting the immigration of han chinese into the tibetan autonomous region in order to change the culture of tibet forever .
how true is this ?
chaitanya siriprolu , delhi , india the chinese government is very sensitive to this accusation .
to counter the claim , many business-related interviewees on the trip would stress the importance of giving the majority of jobs to tibetans .
the government also claims tibetans occupy most senior government posts .
but it was not hard to discover that these claims do not fully reflect the reality of the situation .
one construction worker , for example , told me that most workers on the site were non-tibetans from nearby sichuan province .
and i met several han chinese people who had moved to tibet in recent years to find better jobs without any great difficulty .
on the political front , there are reports that tibetans are being increasingly excluded from top jobs in the party , which wields real power in tibet as in the rest of china .
what is the annual income of tibetans ?
yuen tek pang , tawau , sabah , malaysia according to chinese government statistics , there 's a wide difference in the amounts earned by rural tibetans and those living in urban areas .
last year , per capita income for urban residents was 8,941 yuan -lrb- $ 1,177 , £ 598 -rrb- , but farmers and herders earned less than a third of that - 2,435 yuan -lrb- $ 320 , £ 163 -rrb- .
the urban-rural income divide is similar to wage differences found all over china .
it certainly seemed to me that there are large income differences between rural and urban people in tibet .
swiss watches are advertised in the capital lhasa , but children were running around barefoot in a village outside the second city , shigatse .
i 'm going travelling and will be spending some time in china .
is it difficult to gain access to tibet ?
caoimhin ó raghallaigh , belfast visiting tibet is certainly not as easy as travelling to other parts of china - where tourists just need a visa and a passport - but it 's not too difficult to arrange .
you firstly need to get a special permit for tibet , which can be obtained through a travel agent in china .
you might also need to get other permits while in the region , depending on where you want to go .
but rules seem to change quite quickly .
there were reports that tourist restrictions were tightened earlier this year after a demonstration by free-tibet supporters at mount everest base camp .
it 's best to check with a travel agent in china .

here he answers some of the questions readers have been asking about his trip .
how much journalistic freedom did you have to make your reports ?
could you go where you wanted or were you taken to the places the chinese wanted you to see ?
michael massey , nancy , france i was on a tour on which a group of foreign journalists based in china was taken to tibet by the chinese government .
tibetans enjoy a certain level of religious freedom the government planned our itinerary and escorted us during the entire six days we were there .
i think it 's safe to assume that officials took us to places they wanted us to visit .
having said that , journalists were given some leeway to break off from the schedule , go to places on their own and conduct their own interviews .
government-supplied interviewees were also prepared to answer any questions put to them .
it is very hard for me to understand how you can claim that there is even minimal political and religious freedom in tibet .
johann kupeczki , cooloola cove , australia people can worship openly on the streets and in temples and monasteries , so there is at least some level of religious freedom .
however , the fact that the dalai lama can not be openly venerated shows the limits to that freedom .
politically , tibetans , just like people in other parts of china , are subject to one-party rule .
tibet 's sensitive status means there are tighter restrictions there .
but the chinese communist party claims it listens to what ordinary people say before making decisions .
this is how they define democracy .
of course , westerners would not recognise this as political freedom .
have you ever seen any human rights activists in tibet gathering first-hand information ?
john , maryland , us i 'm sure most human rights groups would welcome an invitation to visit tibet , but they are not welcome .
the experiences of manfred nowak , the un 's rapporteur on torture , illustrates just how unwelcome independent investigators are in china .
he visited china in 2005 - 10 years after an initial request .
while here , he says his work was obstructed by security officials .
faced with this situation , human rights groups act in different ways .
some try to sneak in and carry out what research they can , others decide not to try .
they also say they try to engage the chinese government in discussion about their work , but with little or no success .
china is often accused of actively promoting the immigration of han chinese into the tibetan autonomous region in order to change the culture of tibet forever .
how true is this ?
chaitanya siriprolu , delhi , india the chinese government is very sensitive to this accusation .
the dalai lama is not discussed openly in tibetan temples to counter the claim , many business-related interviewees on the trip would stress the importance of giving the majority of jobs to tibetans .
the government also claims tibetans occupy most senior government posts .
but it was not hard to discover that these claims do not fully reflect the reality of the situation .
one construction worker , for example , told me that most workers on the site were non-tibetans from nearby sichuan province .
and i met several han chinese people who had moved to tibet in recent years to find better jobs without any great difficulty .
on the political front , there are reports that tibetans are being increasingly excluded from top jobs in the party , which wields real power in tibet as in the rest of china .
what is the annual income of tibetans ?
yuen tek pang , tawau , sabah , malaysia according to chinese government statistics , there 's a wide difference in the amounts earned by rural tibetans and those living in urban areas .
last year , per capita income for urban residents was 8,941 yuan -lrb- $ 1,177 , £ 598 -rrb- , but farmers and herders earned less than a third of that - 2,435 yuan -lrb- $ 320 , £ 163 -rrb- .
the urban-rural income divide is similar to wage differences found all over china .
it certainly seemed to me that there are large income differences between rural and urban people in tibet .
swiss watches are advertised in the capital lhasa , but children were running around barefoot in a village outside the second city , shigatse .
i 'm going travelling and will be spending some time in china .
is it difficult to gain access to tibet ?
caoimhin ó raghallaigh , belfast visiting tibet is certainly not as easy as travelling to other parts of china - where tourists just need a visa and a passport - but it 's not too difficult to arrange .
you firstly need to get a special permit for tibet , which can be obtained through a travel agent in china .
you might also need to get other permits while in the region , depending on where you want to go .
but rules seem to change quite quickly .
there were reports that tourist restrictions were tightened earlier this year after a demonstration by free-tibet supporters at mount everest base camp .
it 's best to check with a travel agent in china .

second life has about 8.7 million users worldwide - though only about 1.7 million have accounts used in the past three months .
many regularly spend a few linden dollars on things which boost their enjoyment of the environment from trips to a bar to buying a replica football kit .

users can also buy vehicles as a means of travelling around second life .
these include cars , sold by dealerships set up by real-life motor firms .
other sellers flog unauthorised versions of the same cars .
buying something branded without the authorisation of the company concerned not only means it misses out on revenue - but - mr naylor argues leaves them open to the risk of damaged reputation .
in the case of mercedes , the firm has built a race track where users can test drive its latest models .
" they will have spent a lot of time and money on doing that , " mr naylor says .
" if someone comes along with a fake mercedes car which does not work well or looks like an old version of a vehicle , or underperforms against mercedes own virtual cars , then you can see why the company might be unhappy . "

many firms already anxious about ip abuse in the virtual world are already facing the situation elsewhere on the internet .
while music and film companies battle against illegal downloading and the plethora of their copyrighted material on websites such as youtube , second life is equally full of such content .
a visit to in-world cinemas will allow you to watch releases including the latest pirates of the caribbean film to the simpsons movie , while the bars play hits from rhianna to the rolling stones .
however despite what seem to be legitimate legal concerns - and the presence of lawyers such as mr naylor - it is not always clear what action , can be taken. not least because avatars mean that real identities are kept secret " finding out who is behind illegal practices could be a drawn out process , potential requiring legal action forcing the identity of the perpetrators to be revealed , " mr naylor adds .
" and even if successful , there is little to stop an offender creating another avatar - or character - and start infringing again . "
then there is the problem of establishing under which jurisdiction the offence is committed .
is it in the country where the perpetrator is based ?
or perhaps in san francisco where the linden labs ' servers are located ?
despite the difficulties , mr naylor feels that there will become a need for advice to be offered to those firms which choose to get involved in virtual worlds .
this could range from what rights you have over land in-world to the employment law implications of hiring another resident in your virtual business .
" there are definitely risks for firms which get involved in virtual worlds , but there also great opportunities too . "

hundreds of soldiers , police and fellow miners are working to pump water from two flooded mine shafts at collieries in eastern shandong province .
torrential rain caused a river to burst its banks , sending water cascading down an old shaft into the mine .
the incident has again thrown the spotlight on china 's bad safety record .
in a separate incident , 14 people were killed on sunday after a molten aluminium spill at a factory in the same province .
relatives ' protest rescue teams were working flat out to pump water from the mines , in xintai city , 450km -lrb- 280 miles -rrb- south of beijing .
by late sunday the water level was reported to have dropped several metres .
continuing rain has frustrated rescuers ' efforts at the mine but officials warned it could take days before the water levels dropped enough for the pumps to reach the bottom of the mine .
" we are pumping the water out of the wells ... but hopes of anyone surviving are very slim , " an yuanjie , of the state administration of work safety , told the afp news agency .
meanwhile , hundreds of miners have been helping to mend the levee that breached the wen river , sending water into two nearby mines .
the main mine , where 172 miners are missing , was completely inundated and many of the missing are believed to be stranded far below the surface .
nine other miners are also trapped at a nearby pit .
provincial officials have called for " no efforts to be spared " in the rescue - and a similar message has come from beijing .
but distraught relatives of the missing miners have been demonstrating , demanding information on the rescue effort and an open investigation into the incident itself .

writing on his website , the star said his 2000 hit romeo must die was banned by censors for featuring gangsters .
in 2001 , kiss of the dragon was banned because li 's character , a chinese policeman , killed people abroad .
" films do n't always have to be realistic , " said li , who argued china 's film industry was suffering as a result of the restrictions placed on it .
" typically , action films have good and bad characters , " the star said .
" if gangsters are n't appropriate and police officers are n't appropriate , then what type of character can there be that would n't start an argument ? "
" it leaves only the ancient chinese stories to be produced . "
strict rules china carefully controls media content and only allows about 20 foreign movies to be officially screened each year .
and china 's film bureau has the power to request further editing of films which it considers to contain offensive scenes .
one such film was the johnny depp 's pirates of the caribbean : at world 's end .
the chinese news agency xinhua said scenes with actor chow yun-fat were cut because his character - a bald and scarred pirate - was an insult to the country 's population .
li , a former national kung fu champion , made his name in hong kong film with movies like the once upon a time in china series before moving on to hollywood .
he has appeared in several western action films , including lethal weapon 4 , but continues to make chinese-language films like hero - which was nominated for the best foreign film oscar in 2002 .
li is currently shooting hollywood movie the forbidden kingdom with fellow martial arts expert jackie chan .

internet sales rose to £ 4.2bn in july , up from £ 2.34bn in the same month a year ago , according to the interactive media in retail group -lrb- imrg -rrb- .
sales are also picking up as retailers improve websites , and as consumers get faster internet connections , imrg said .

rising costs the bank of england has raised its main borrowing cost five times in the past year to their current level of 5.75 % as it tries to slow the rate of inflation .
earlier this month , the office for national statistics said that uk retail sales increased by more than many analysts had expected in july .
however , the increase was mainly driven by discounting and sales as shops and companies tried to tempt consumers into spending their money .
imrg said that the fastest growing sector of online sales was electrical goods , which almost doubled from a year earlier .
