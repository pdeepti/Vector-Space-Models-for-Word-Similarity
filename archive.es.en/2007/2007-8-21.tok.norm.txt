program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de extremism -pipe- 21.08.2007 opinion : germany must protect its foreigners großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eight indians were attacked by a violent mob in a village in the state of saxony .
germany needs to ask itself whether it really is doing enough to fight right-wing extremism , says dw 's daniel scheschkewitz . anyone who has lived outside of germany for some time knows how alert people are to reports about racism and xenophobia in germany , especially when they involve physical violence .
and even more so when they occur in the part of germany considered a right-wing extremist stronghold , such as the region south of leipzig .
the brutal attack on eight indians in the small town of mügeln is all the more disturbing in view of the fact that anti-racist organizations have repeatedly pointed out how dangerous parts of eastern germany are for foreigners .
and in this case , there were n't even any indications that violent skinheads would go to the local fair .
luckily the eight indians got away with their lives .
but the trauma will remain - as will scars from the wounds inflicted on them by the mob that the police could only control by putting themselves in danger .
the investigation will have to determine the extent to which the violence was organized and whether it did indeed stem from neo-nazis .
but the shameful fact remains that the people of mügeln did not protect the foreigners .
the mayor 's statement that the guilty parties were n't locals ca n't change that .
clearly , things that our society simply can not tolerate remain possible even now , more than 10 years after the brutal attacks on asylum seekers in the eastern germany towns of hoyerswerda and rostock .
thus , it was good that georg milbradt , the premier of saxony , where mügeln is located , did n't hesitate for a moment to go there and find out for himself what had happened and to express his disgust .
but that 's not enough .
germany 's political authorities have to ask themselves whether enough is being done when it comes to education and prevention - in schools , in the social welfare system , but also in prosecuting cases and preventing crime .
and there must be more to it than preserving germany 's reputation abroad .
the soccer world cup showed last year that we are indeed a hospitable country that welcomes people of all skin colors and religious beliefs .
but germany must learn for its own sake to accept foreigners , and that must also happen in places where there are few jobs for germans .
another deplorable incident last weekend showed how far away from that state we in former west germany are : a german national soccer team player said he was called a " black pig " by an opposing team 's german goalkeeper .
that , too , is a scandal !
whether as the child of black african immigrants in the bundesliga or as an indian businessman in saxony , unfortunately people who are willing to become integrated in german society far too often run into barriers .
those who expect immigrants to be willing to integrate must also be prepared to protect them - from physical violence and verbal abuse .

economists say the flat tax trend wo n't likely spread from eastern to western europe . when bulgaria 's institute for market economics -lrb- ime -rrb- began touting a flat tax system for the country in the 1990s , it was seen as a crazy free market idea that would never become reality .
but a lot has changed in the past decade .
bulgaria 's neighbors have launched a tax revolution , with a total of nine eastern european and former communist countries shunning progressive tax systems in favor of a simple , one-rate-fits-all model of taxation .
in bulgaria , flat taxes are no longer the exclusive domain of free market dreamers .
fresh from introducing a flat 10 percent tax on corporate profits , bulgaria 's socialist-led coalition government now wants to do the same for personal income . besides switching to a flat tax , the bulgarian government also wants to cut social insurance contributions by 3 percent and increase pensions by 10 percent .
details of the tax proposal are being debated within the governing coalition . fuel for economic transition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flat tax has been criticized as unfair to low wage earners svetla kostadinova , who heads the ime , a free market think tank based in sofia , said she 's confident that starting in 2008 bulgaria will have a flat tax in some form .
kostadinova said she thinks the flat tax will further fuel bulgaria 's economy and cut down on the informal economy , which is often used to avoid taxes .
" we think that the flat tax idea is a good approach for small transitional economies that want to reach european levels of income faster than the usual way , " kostadinova said .
" small countries more easily take such decisions . "
with its 10 percent rate , bulgaria sits at the low end of the flat tax spectrum while lithuania 's 33 percent is at the top end .
estonia , latvia , russia , ukraine , slovakia , georgia and romania have also switched to flat tax systems in recent years .
it 's too soon to say how much of an economic boost eastern europe has gotten by switching to a flat tax , said dutch economist wouter den haan .
furthermore , flat tax schemes are only one part of the economic growth of eastern europe .
many have joined the european union and are realigning their economic policies to switch over to the euro .
czech government looks to shrink deficit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : different approaches in different eu countries the czech republic is launching major economic reforms to try and get its deficit under control .
part of its reform package includes a flat tax .
the ruling center-right coalition said if its tax reform package falls apart , it will seek an early election .
coalition leaders agreed to adopt a 15 percent personal income tax last week .
the rate would drop further to 12.5 percent in 2009 .
the income tax currently maxes out at 32 percent .
the government also wants to decrease the corporate tax rate to 21 percent in 2008 and down to 19 percent by 2010 .
a vote on the reform package is expected in the next week .
tax break or tax increase ?
but eastern europe is n't an economic miracle .
many countries face hefty current-account deficits and high inflation rates .
in bulgaria , there 's also been widespread concern in recent weeks that the flat taxes will hurt poor people and families .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bulgaria wants to add tax haven to its list of assets the average wage in bulgaria is 350 leva a month -lrb- 179 euros , $ 241 -rrb- .
people who make less than this amount , as well as freelancers , will pay more under the new tax system , the bulgarian media has reported .
there 's a common misconception that all forms of flat tax place undue burdens on the poor , said den haan , a professor at the university of amsterdam .
in many cases , only incomes above a certain threshold are taxed , which can make the system quite progressive , he added . while progressive income tax systems in western europe are aimed at taxing the wealthy at higher rates than the poor , it often does n't work out that way .
" our current tax system is n't as progressive as people think , " den haan said .
" that 's because of all the tax deductions . "
western europe remains skeptical bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will taxes ever be this easy ?
western europeans looking to get rid of a complicated system of tax deductions and exclusions , however , are unlikely to see a flat tax any time soon , economists said .
friedrich merz , a german financial expert with the center-right christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , declared a few years back that taxes should be simple enough to fit on back side of a beer coaster .
even so , it remains likely that europe 's pension systems will keeps its largest economies form adopting a flat tax .
most countries in western europe have long-standing social security systems which are funded by the redistribution that comes from progressive tax systems that get higher revenues from the rich , said linda yueh , a visiting professor at the london business school . " to some people , including some views from western europe , a flat tax is a free market mechanism because there 's no redistributive aim , " yueh said .

" i think they should wait until this financial market turbulence passes . "
several large banks changed previous forecasts that the ecb would further increase rates this year , instead predicting that the rate will remain at 4 percent . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it 's the first time germany has permitted the use of marijuana for medicinal purposes . germany ' süddeutsche zeitung reported on tuesday that the german federal institute for drugs and medical devices for the first time approved the application of a 51-year-old woman suffering from multiple sclerosis to legally buy cannabis from a pharmacy to ease her symptoms . the approval is linked to strict restrictions , but starting at the end of august , the woman , claudia h , is allowed to buy a " standardized extract " from the cannabis plant from the pharmacy for a year .
a doctor has to monitor the therapy .
in addition , both the patient and the pharmacy have to store the drug extracts in a safe so to prevent theft . cannabis shown to ease pain according to the munich-based paper , several scientific studies show that cannabis can ease pain and spasms often associated with multiple sclerosis , a debilitating nerve ailment .
it 's also known to prevent weight loss among cancer and aids patients . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : studies have show that extracts from the cannabis plant have medicinal properties so far , cannabis has been illegal in germany - only possession of small amounts of the drug are allowed - and its use for medicinal purposes limited to scientific studies and aims that " are in the public interest . " doctors so far can only prescribe the synthetically-produced dronabinol , which is an active ingredient in cannabis .
but since the substance is n't approved as a medicine in germany , the medicine 's costs are n't covered by health insurance .
in contrast , the price of the direct cannabis medicine is expected to be much cheaper . cannabis remains illegal in 2005 , a court ruling threw into question the complete ban on cannabis for medicinal purposes .
the german federal administrative court ruled that the health of individual patients also lay in " the public interest . "
that means that the bonn-based federal institute for drugs and medical devices now has to consider each application for use of cannabis for medicinal purposes on a case-by-case basis . despite tuesday 's landmark decision to allow cannabis for treatment , the drug remains illegal in future .
patients who acquire it on their own risk prosecution .
the süddeutsche zeitung reported of a case last week when a local court sentenced a hepatitis-c patient for possession of cannabis to a year in prison without bail . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de extremism -pipe- 21.08.2007 opinion : germany must protect its foreigners großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eight indians were attacked by a violent mob in a village in the state of saxony .
germany needs to ask itself whether it really is doing enough to fight right-wing extremism , says dw 's daniel scheschkewitz . anyone who has lived outside of germany for some time knows how alert people are to reports about racism and xenophobia in germany , especially when they involve physical violence .
and even more so when they occur in the part of germany considered a right-wing extremist stronghold , such as the region south of leipzig .
the brutal attack on eight indians in the small town of mügeln is all the more disturbing in view of the fact that anti-racist organizations have repeatedly pointed out how dangerous parts of eastern germany are for foreigners .
and in this case , there were n't even any indications that violent skinheads would go to the local fair .
luckily the eight indians got away with their lives .
but the trauma will remain - as will scars from the wounds inflicted on them by the mob that the police could only control by putting themselves in danger .
the investigation will have to determine the extent to which the violence was organized and whether it did indeed stem from neo-nazis .
but the shameful fact remains that the people of mügeln did not protect the foreigners .
the mayor 's statement that the guilty parties were n't locals ca n't change that .
clearly , things that our society simply can not tolerate remain possible even now , more than 10 years after the brutal attacks on asylum seekers in the eastern germany towns of hoyerswerda and rostock .
thus , it was good that georg milbradt , the premier of saxony , where mügeln is located , did n't hesitate for a moment to go there and find out for himself what had happened and to express his disgust .
but that 's not enough .
germany 's political authorities have to ask themselves whether enough is being done when it comes to education and prevention - in schools , in the social welfare system , but also in prosecuting cases and preventing crime .
and there must be more to it than preserving germany 's reputation abroad .
the soccer world cup showed last year that we are indeed a hospitable country that welcomes people of all skin colors and religious beliefs .
but germany must learn for its own sake to accept foreigners , and that must also happen in places where there are few jobs for germans .
another deplorable incident last weekend showed how far away from that state we in former west germany are : a german national soccer team player said he was called a " black pig " by an opposing team 's german goalkeeper .
that , too , is a scandal !
whether as the child of black african immigrants in the bundesliga or as an indian businessman in saxony , unfortunately people who are willing to become integrated in german society far too often run into barriers .
those who expect immigrants to be willing to integrate must also be prepared to protect them - from physical violence and verbal abuse .

luckily the eight indians got away with their lives .
but the trauma will remain - as will scars from the wounds inflicted on them by the mob that the police could only control by putting themselves in danger .
the investigation will have to determine the extent to which the violence was organized and whether it did indeed stem from neo-nazis .
but the shameful fact remains that the people of mügeln did not protect the foreigners .
the mayor 's statement that the guilty parties were n't locals ca n't change that .
clearly , things that our society simply can not tolerate remain possible even now , more than 10 years after the brutal attacks on asylum seekers in the eastern germany towns of hoyerswerda and rostock .
thus , it was good that georg milbradt , the premier of saxony , where mügeln is located , did n't hesitate for a moment to go there and find out for himself what had happened and to express his disgust .
but that 's not enough .
germany 's political authorities have to ask themselves whether enough is being done when it comes to education and prevention - in schools , in the social welfare system , but also in prosecuting cases and preventing crime .
and there must be more to it than preserving germany 's reputation abroad .
the soccer world cup showed last year that we are indeed a hospitable country that welcomes people of all skin colors and religious beliefs .
but germany must learn for its own sake to accept foreigners , and that must also happen in places where there are few jobs for germans .
another deplorable incident last weekend showed how far away from that state we in former west germany are : a german national soccer team player said he was called a " black pig " by an opposing team 's german goalkeeper .
that , too , is a scandal !
whether as the child of black african immigrants in the bundesliga or as an indian businessman in saxony , unfortunately people who are willing to become integrated in german society far too often run into barriers .
those who expect immigrants to be willing to integrate must also be prepared to protect them - from physical violence and verbal abuse .

fresh from introducing a flat 10 percent tax on corporate profits , bulgaria 's socialist-led coalition government now wants to do the same for personal income . besides switching to a flat tax , the bulgarian government also wants to cut social insurance contributions by 3 percent and increase pensions by 10 percent .
details of the tax proposal are being debated within the governing coalition . fuel for economic transition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flat tax has been criticized as unfair to low wage earners svetla kostadinova , who heads the ime , a free market think tank based in sofia , said she 's confident that starting in 2008 bulgaria will have a flat tax in some form .
kostadinova said she thinks the flat tax will further fuel bulgaria 's economy and cut down on the informal economy , which is often used to avoid taxes .
" we think that the flat tax idea is a good approach for small transitional economies that want to reach european levels of income faster than the usual way , " kostadinova said .
" small countries more easily take such decisions . "
with its 10 percent rate , bulgaria sits at the low end of the flat tax spectrum while lithuania 's 33 percent is at the top end .
estonia , latvia , russia , ukraine , slovakia , georgia and romania have also switched to flat tax systems in recent years .
it 's too soon to say how much of an economic boost eastern europe has gotten by switching to a flat tax , said dutch economist wouter den haan .
furthermore , flat tax schemes are only one part of the economic growth of eastern europe .
many have joined the european union and are realigning their economic policies to switch over to the euro .
czech government looks to shrink deficit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : different approaches in different eu countries the czech republic is launching major economic reforms to try and get its deficit under control .
part of its reform package includes a flat tax .
the ruling center-right coalition said if its tax reform package falls apart , it will seek an early election .
coalition leaders agreed to adopt a 15 percent personal income tax last week .
the rate would drop further to 12.5 percent in 2009 .
the income tax currently maxes out at 32 percent .

people who make less than this amount , as well as freelancers , will pay more under the new tax system , the bulgarian media has reported .
there 's a common misconception that all forms of flat tax place undue burdens on the poor , said den haan , a professor at the university of amsterdam .
in many cases , only incomes above a certain threshold are taxed , which can make the system quite progressive , he added . while progressive income tax systems in western europe are aimed at taxing the wealthy at higher rates than the poor , it often does n't work out that way .
" our current tax system is n't as progressive as people think , " den haan said .
" that 's because of all the tax deductions . "
western europe remains skeptical bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will taxes ever be this easy ?
western europeans looking to get rid of a complicated system of tax deductions and exclusions , however , are unlikely to see a flat tax any time soon , economists said .

even so , it remains likely that europe 's pension systems will keeps its largest economies form adopting a flat tax .
most countries in western europe have long-standing social security systems which are funded by the redistribution that comes from progressive tax systems that get higher revenues from the rich , said linda yueh , a visiting professor at the london business school . " to some people , including some views from western europe , a flat tax is a free market mechanism because there 's no redistributive aim , " yueh said .
taxpayers also like the idea of exemptions and the feeling of getting money back from the government , den haan said , adding that people can see how specific exemptions benefit them and do n't want to lose those benefits . trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

economists say the flat tax trend wo n't likely spread from eastern to western europe . when bulgaria 's institute for market economics -lrb- ime -rrb- began touting a flat tax system for the country in the 1990s , it was seen as a crazy free market idea that would never become reality .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de taxes -pipe- 21.08.2007 eastern europeans eyeing flat tax großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tax time is much different in eastern europe bulgaria and the czech republic have proposed doing away with exemptions , deductions and loopholes in favor of a flat tax .
economists say the flat tax trend wo n't likely spread from eastern to western europe . when bulgaria 's institute for market economics -lrb- ime -rrb- began touting a flat tax system for the country in the 1990s , it was seen as a crazy free market idea that would never become reality .
but a lot has changed in the past decade .
bulgaria 's neighbors have launched a tax revolution , with a total of nine eastern european and former communist countries shunning progressive tax systems in favor of a simple , one-rate-fits-all model of taxation .
in bulgaria , flat taxes are no longer the exclusive domain of free market dreamers .
fresh from introducing a flat 10 percent tax on corporate profits , bulgaria 's socialist-led coalition government now wants to do the same for personal income . besides switching to a flat tax , the bulgarian government also wants to cut social insurance contributions by 3 percent and increase pensions by 10 percent .
details of the tax proposal are being debated within the governing coalition . fuel for economic transition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flat tax has been criticized as unfair to low wage earners svetla kostadinova , who heads the ime , a free market think tank based in sofia , said she 's confident that starting in 2008 bulgaria will have a flat tax in some form .
kostadinova said she thinks the flat tax will further fuel bulgaria 's economy and cut down on the informal economy , which is often used to avoid taxes .
" we think that the flat tax idea is a good approach for small transitional economies that want to reach european levels of income faster than the usual way , " kostadinova said .
" small countries more easily take such decisions . "
with its 10 percent rate , bulgaria sits at the low end of the flat tax spectrum while lithuania 's 33 percent is at the top end .
estonia , latvia , russia , ukraine , slovakia , georgia and romania have also switched to flat tax systems in recent years .
it 's too soon to say how much of an economic boost eastern europe has gotten by switching to a flat tax , said dutch economist wouter den haan .
furthermore , flat tax schemes are only one part of the economic growth of eastern europe .
many have joined the european union and are realigning their economic policies to switch over to the euro .
czech government looks to shrink deficit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : different approaches in different eu countries the czech republic is launching major economic reforms to try and get its deficit under control .
part of its reform package includes a flat tax .
the ruling center-right coalition said if its tax reform package falls apart , it will seek an early election .
coalition leaders agreed to adopt a 15 percent personal income tax last week .
the rate would drop further to 12.5 percent in 2009 .
the income tax currently maxes out at 32 percent .
the government also wants to decrease the corporate tax rate to 21 percent in 2008 and down to 19 percent by 2010 .
a vote on the reform package is expected in the next week .
tax break or tax increase ?
but eastern europe is n't an economic miracle .
many countries face hefty current-account deficits and high inflation rates .
in bulgaria , there 's also been widespread concern in recent weeks that the flat taxes will hurt poor people and families .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bulgaria wants to add tax haven to its list of assets the average wage in bulgaria is 350 leva a month -lrb- 179 euros , $ 241 -rrb- .
people who make less than this amount , as well as freelancers , will pay more under the new tax system , the bulgarian media has reported .
there 's a common misconception that all forms of flat tax place undue burdens on the poor , said den haan , a professor at the university of amsterdam .
in many cases , only incomes above a certain threshold are taxed , which can make the system quite progressive , he added . while progressive income tax systems in western europe are aimed at taxing the wealthy at higher rates than the poor , it often does n't work out that way .
" our current tax system is n't as progressive as people think , " den haan said .
" that 's because of all the tax deductions . "
western europe remains skeptical bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will taxes ever be this easy ?
western europeans looking to get rid of a complicated system of tax deductions and exclusions , however , are unlikely to see a flat tax any time soon , economists said .
friedrich merz , a german financial expert with the center-right christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , declared a few years back that taxes should be simple enough to fit on back side of a beer coaster .
even so , it remains likely that europe 's pension systems will keeps its largest economies form adopting a flat tax .
most countries in western europe have long-standing social security systems which are funded by the redistribution that comes from progressive tax systems that get higher revenues from the rich , said linda yueh , a visiting professor at the london business school . " to some people , including some views from western europe , a flat tax is a free market mechanism because there 's no redistributive aim , " yueh said .
taxpayers also like the idea of exemptions and the feeling of getting money back from the government , den haan said , adding that people can see how specific exemptions benefit them and do n't want to lose those benefits . trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

quoting data from the country 's federal statistics agency , the organization said that the figures accounted for more than one in 10 of positions nationwide .
during the same period , 1,451 professorships had been lost at universities .
" improvement in the quality of our higher education system and study conditions is n't possible without a noticeable change in the proportion of 60 students per lecturer , which can not compete internationally , " dhv president bernhard kempen , a professor of law at the university of cologne , said in a press statement .
kempen called for germany 's federal and state governments to reinstate the 1,451 positions that had been eliminated . " with ever fewer professors , the system can not improve , " he said .
the dhv 's figures showed that the cuts were most extreme in the humanities , particularly in classical philology and education , which both lost around 35 percent of lecturers over the decade .
fewer teachers , more students bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the average student-teacher ratio at german universities is 60 to 1 both catholic and protestant theology had lost academic staff , by 18.9 and 20.7 percent respectively .
the number of professorial positions in engineering -lrb- 356 spots or -13.3 percent -rrb- ; mathematics and natural science -lrb- 264 or -4.3 percent -rrb- and medicine -lrb- 86 or -2.7 percent -rrb- had also fallen .
law , economics , social sciences and art history departments were the only ones to benefit from the creation of new positions .
the former three fields saw gains of 5.6 percent , while the increase in university lectureships in art history was 9.4 percent .
during the same time , the number of students had increased by 0.5 percent , said the dhv , which represents over 22,000 members .
in an academic ranking of the world 's universities released by jiao tong university in shanghai last week , germany 's two best universities , munich 's ludwig maximilians university and its technical university , only came in 53rd and 56th .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de extremism -pipe- 21.08.2007 opinion : germany must protect its foreigners großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eight indians were attacked by a violent mob in a village in the state of saxony .
germany needs to ask itself whether it really is doing enough to fight right-wing extremism , says dw 's daniel scheschkewitz . anyone who has lived outside of germany for some time knows how alert people are to reports about racism and xenophobia in germany , especially when they involve physical violence .
and even more so when they occur in the part of germany considered a right-wing extremist stronghold , such as the region south of leipzig .
the brutal attack on eight indians in the small town of mügeln is all the more disturbing in view of the fact that anti-racist organizations have repeatedly pointed out how dangerous parts of eastern germany are for foreigners .
and in this case , there were n't even any indications that violent skinheads would go to the local fair .
luckily the eight indians got away with their lives .
but the trauma will remain - as will scars from the wounds inflicted on them by the mob that the police could only control by putting themselves in danger .
the investigation will have to determine the extent to which the violence was organized and whether it did indeed stem from neo-nazis .
but the shameful fact remains that the people of mügeln did not protect the foreigners .
the mayor 's statement that the guilty parties were n't locals ca n't change that .
clearly , things that our society simply can not tolerate remain possible even now , more than 10 years after the brutal attacks on asylum seekers in the eastern germany towns of hoyerswerda and rostock .
thus , it was good that georg milbradt , the premier of saxony , where mügeln is located , did n't hesitate for a moment to go there and find out for himself what had happened and to express his disgust .
but that 's not enough .
germany 's political authorities have to ask themselves whether enough is being done when it comes to education and prevention - in schools , in the social welfare system , but also in prosecuting cases and preventing crime .
and there must be more to it than preserving germany 's reputation abroad .
the soccer world cup showed last year that we are indeed a hospitable country that welcomes people of all skin colors and religious beliefs .
but germany must learn for its own sake to accept foreigners , and that must also happen in places where there are few jobs for germans .
another deplorable incident last weekend showed how far away from that state we in former west germany are : a german national soccer team player said he was called a " black pig " by an opposing team 's german goalkeeper .
that , too , is a scandal !
whether as the child of black african immigrants in the bundesliga or as an indian businessman in saxony , unfortunately people who are willing to become integrated in german society far too often run into barriers .
those who expect immigrants to be willing to integrate must also be prepared to protect them - from physical violence and verbal abuse .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de extremism -pipe- 21.08.2007 opinion : germany must protect its foreigners großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eight indians were attacked by a violent mob in a village in the state of saxony .
germany needs to ask itself whether it really is doing enough to fight right-wing extremism , says dw 's daniel scheschkewitz . anyone who has lived outside of germany for some time knows how alert people are to reports about racism and xenophobia in germany , especially when they involve physical violence .
and even more so when they occur in the part of germany considered a right-wing extremist stronghold , such as the region south of leipzig .
the brutal attack on eight indians in the small town of mügeln is all the more disturbing in view of the fact that anti-racist organizations have repeatedly pointed out how dangerous parts of eastern germany are for foreigners .
and in this case , there were n't even any indications that violent skinheads would go to the local fair .
luckily the eight indians got away with their lives .
but the trauma will remain - as will scars from the wounds inflicted on them by the mob that the police could only control by putting themselves in danger .
the investigation will have to determine the extent to which the violence was organized and whether it did indeed stem from neo-nazis .
but the shameful fact remains that the people of mügeln did not protect the foreigners .
the mayor 's statement that the guilty parties were n't locals ca n't change that .
clearly , things that our society simply can not tolerate remain possible even now , more than 10 years after the brutal attacks on asylum seekers in the eastern germany towns of hoyerswerda and rostock .
thus , it was good that georg milbradt , the premier of saxony , where mügeln is located , did n't hesitate for a moment to go there and find out for himself what had happened and to express his disgust .
but that 's not enough .
germany 's political authorities have to ask themselves whether enough is being done when it comes to education and prevention - in schools , in the social welfare system , but also in prosecuting cases and preventing crime .
and there must be more to it than preserving germany 's reputation abroad .
the soccer world cup showed last year that we are indeed a hospitable country that welcomes people of all skin colors and religious beliefs .
but germany must learn for its own sake to accept foreigners , and that must also happen in places where there are few jobs for germans .
another deplorable incident last weekend showed how far away from that state we in former west germany are : a german national soccer team player said he was called a " black pig " by an opposing team 's german goalkeeper .
that , too , is a scandal !
whether as the child of black african immigrants in the bundesliga or as an indian businessman in saxony , unfortunately people who are willing to become integrated in german society far too often run into barriers .
those who expect immigrants to be willing to integrate must also be prepared to protect them - from physical violence and verbal abuse .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 21.08.2007 us housing crisis causes plunge in german business confidence großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : problems in the us housing industry are being felt in germany the us subprime crisis continues to affect the german economy .
an important index that measures business confidence dropped below zero tuesday on fears related to a lack of liquidity in financial markets . german businesses are afraid that the crisis in the united states housing industry will put the brakes on the euro-zone 's largest economy .
the zew research institute 's economic expectations index , based on a poll of 306 analysts and institutional investors , fell by 17.3 points to -6.9 points this month , according to a zew press release .
it is the first time since january that the index has fallen into negative territory .
the drop is even larger than the -5.0 analysts expected .
the index was at 10.4 points in july .
the recent decrease is a clear indication that experts expect the economy to lose its buoyancy .
a second index that measures institutional investors ' assessment of the actual business climate , also dropped more than expected .
it fell eight points to 80.2 points .
analysts had predicted it would fall to 84 points . in its continuing effort to ease subprime-related fears , the european central bank pumped 275 billion euros -lrb- $ 370.6 billion -rrb- - about 46 billion euros more than anticipated on monday - into money markets on tuesday .
the money was part of the frankfurt-based bank 's routine weekly financing . germany does n't face crisis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german market has reacted to bad news from abroad wolfgang franz , head of the mannheim-based zew , said despite the confidence drop , there 's no cause for alarm in germany .
" the crisis is first and foremost the unites states ' problem , " he told reporters .
" the possible impact on the german economy should , as far as we can tell , be limited . "
germany 's export-driven economy , however , could suffer if us consumers rein in their spending habits as a result of the crisis in their loan markets , franz said .
in recent months , the market for german exports had weakened in part due to the rising value of the euro against the dollar .
this happened long before the subprime market in the us collapsed this month and threw world markets into turmoil . analysts cautioned against overreaction to the zew data .
" the results published today do n't suggest an imminent recession , " brian mandt , an economist at postbank , told the afp news agency .
" they do however show that the risks to growth have increased . " ecb unlikely to raise rates bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ecb is expected to keep rates stable andreas rees of hvb / unicredit agreed .
" this is more a matter of psychology than fundamental facts , " he told afp .
" a meltdown for the german economy is not on the cards . "
the new data has raised hopes among businesses that the european central bank wo n't its benchmark rate from a six-year high next month .
" if i could give advice to the ecb , it would be to keep rates stable , " the zew 's franz said , according to bloomberg news .
" i think they should wait until this financial market turbulence passes . "
several large banks changed previous forecasts that the ecb would further increase rates this year , instead predicting that the rate will remain at 4 percent . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the man has confessed to the crimes . the former insurance salesman and trained nurse was identified as the killer after he voluntarily gave a dna test earlier this year after he was caught stealing scrap metal .
police found his genetic data to perfectly match dna clues found in the case of 17-year-old angelika s who was raped and strangled on sept .
1 , 1984 while hitchhiking .
the news of the killer 's arrest came as police in aachen , southern germany , were preparing to conduct mass genetic testing on 150 people who lived in the vicinity of the victim .
police said the man had admitted to murdering five women and girls between 1983 and 1990 .
the victims , who ranged in age from 15 to 31 , all came from the area around the city of aachen near germany 's border with the netherlands and belgium .
police said the crimes all followed the same pattern : the killer picked up young women and girls at night , often hitchhikers who wanted to get home from the disco .
he then tied up the women and raped them before strangling them .
the corpses were found days , or in some cases , months later in the surrounding woods .
police relieved bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most of the crimes took place around the city of aachen the cracking of the cases comes as a relief to investigators in aachen .
despite broadcasting the cases on the german tv show version of " america 's most wanted , " aimed to capture dangerous criminals , as well as enlisting the help of trained criminal profilers , police struggled for years to make any headway in the probes .
investigator uwe breuer told news agency ap that in the last 17 years since the last crime was committed , police had repeatedly reopened the cases and searched for clues without luck .
police said it was possible that the serial killer could be responsible for further crimes and hence were considering widening the investigations to neighboring belgium as well as the netherlands . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the man has confessed to the crimes . the former insurance salesman and trained nurse was identified as the killer after he voluntarily gave a dna test earlier this year after he was caught stealing scrap metal .
police found his genetic data to perfectly match dna clues found in the case of 17-year-old angelika s who was raped and strangled on sept .
1 , 1984 while hitchhiking .
the news of the killer 's arrest came as police in aachen , southern germany , were preparing to conduct mass genetic testing on 150 people who lived in the vicinity of the victim .
police said the man had admitted to murdering five women and girls between 1983 and 1990 .
the victims , who ranged in age from 15 to 31 , all came from the area around the city of aachen near germany 's border with the netherlands and belgium .
police said the crimes all followed the same pattern : the killer picked up young women and girls at night , often hitchhikers who wanted to get home from the disco .
he then tied up the women and raped them before strangling them .
the corpses were found days , or in some cases , months later in the surrounding woods .
police relieved bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most of the crimes took place around the city of aachen the cracking of the cases comes as a relief to investigators in aachen .
despite broadcasting the cases on the german tv show version of " america 's most wanted , " aimed to capture dangerous criminals , as well as enlisting the help of trained criminal profilers , police struggled for years to make any headway in the probes .
investigator uwe breuer told news agency ap that in the last 17 years since the last crime was committed , police had repeatedly reopened the cases and searched for clues without luck .
police said it was possible that the serial killer could be responsible for further crimes and hence were considering widening the investigations to neighboring belgium as well as the netherlands . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

an important index that measures business confidence dropped below zero tuesday on fears related to a lack of liquidity in financial markets . german businesses are afraid that the crisis in the united states housing industry will put the brakes on the euro-zone 's largest economy .
the zew research institute 's economic expectations index , based on a poll of 306 analysts and institutional investors , fell by 17.3 points to -6.9 points this month , according to a zew press release .
it is the first time since january that the index has fallen into negative territory .
the drop is even larger than the -5.0 analysts expected .
the index was at 10.4 points in july .
the recent decrease is a clear indication that experts expect the economy to lose its buoyancy .
a second index that measures institutional investors ' assessment of the actual business climate , also dropped more than expected .
it fell eight points to 80.2 points .
analysts had predicted it would fall to 84 points . in its continuing effort to ease subprime-related fears , the european central bank pumped 275 billion euros -lrb- $ 370.6 billion -rrb- - about 46 billion euros more than anticipated on monday - into money markets on tuesday .
the money was part of the frankfurt-based bank 's routine weekly financing . germany does n't face crisis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german market has reacted to bad news from abroad wolfgang franz , head of the mannheim-based zew , said despite the confidence drop , there 's no cause for alarm in germany .
" the crisis is first and foremost the unites states ' problem , " he told reporters .
" the possible impact on the german economy should , as far as we can tell , be limited . "
germany 's export-driven economy , however , could suffer if us consumers rein in their spending habits as a result of the crisis in their loan markets , franz said .
in recent months , the market for german exports had weakened in part due to the rising value of the euro against the dollar .
this happened long before the subprime market in the us collapsed this month and threw world markets into turmoil . analysts cautioned against overreaction to the zew data .
" the results published today do n't suggest an imminent recession , " brian mandt , an economist at postbank , told the afp news agency .
" they do however show that the risks to growth have increased . " ecb unlikely to raise rates bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ecb is expected to keep rates stable andreas rees of hvb / unicredit agreed .
" this is more a matter of psychology than fundamental facts , " he told afp .
" a meltdown for the german economy is not on the cards . "
the new data has raised hopes among businesses that the european central bank wo n't its benchmark rate from a six-year high next month .
" if i could give advice to the ecb , it would be to keep rates stable , " the zew 's franz said , according to bloomberg news .
" i think they should wait until this financial market turbulence passes . "
several large banks changed previous forecasts that the ecb would further increase rates this year , instead predicting that the rate will remain at 4 percent . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de extremism -pipe- 21.08.2007 opinion : germany must protect its foreigners großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eight indians were attacked by a violent mob in a village in the state of saxony .
germany needs to ask itself whether it really is doing enough to fight right-wing extremism , says dw 's daniel scheschkewitz . anyone who has lived outside of germany for some time knows how alert people are to reports about racism and xenophobia in germany , especially when they involve physical violence .
and even more so when they occur in the part of germany considered a right-wing extremist stronghold , such as the region south of leipzig .
the brutal attack on eight indians in the small town of mügeln is all the more disturbing in view of the fact that anti-racist organizations have repeatedly pointed out how dangerous parts of eastern germany are for foreigners .
and in this case , there were n't even any indications that violent skinheads would go to the local fair .
luckily the eight indians got away with their lives .
but the trauma will remain - as will scars from the wounds inflicted on them by the mob that the police could only control by putting themselves in danger .
the investigation will have to determine the extent to which the violence was organized and whether it did indeed stem from neo-nazis .
but the shameful fact remains that the people of mügeln did not protect the foreigners .
the mayor 's statement that the guilty parties were n't locals ca n't change that .
clearly , things that our society simply can not tolerate remain possible even now , more than 10 years after the brutal attacks on asylum seekers in the eastern germany towns of hoyerswerda and rostock .
thus , it was good that georg milbradt , the premier of saxony , where mügeln is located , did n't hesitate for a moment to go there and find out for himself what had happened and to express his disgust .
but that 's not enough .
germany 's political authorities have to ask themselves whether enough is being done when it comes to education and prevention - in schools , in the social welfare system , but also in prosecuting cases and preventing crime .
and there must be more to it than preserving germany 's reputation abroad .
the soccer world cup showed last year that we are indeed a hospitable country that welcomes people of all skin colors and religious beliefs .
but germany must learn for its own sake to accept foreigners , and that must also happen in places where there are few jobs for germans .
another deplorable incident last weekend showed how far away from that state we in former west germany are : a german national soccer team player said he was called a " black pig " by an opposing team 's german goalkeeper .
that , too , is a scandal !
whether as the child of black african immigrants in the bundesliga or as an indian businessman in saxony , unfortunately people who are willing to become integrated in german society far too often run into barriers .
those who expect immigrants to be willing to integrate must also be prepared to protect them - from physical violence and verbal abuse .

an important index that measures business confidence dropped below zero tuesday on fears related to a lack of liquidity in financial markets . german businesses are afraid that the crisis in the united states housing industry will put the brakes on the euro-zone 's largest economy .
the zew research institute 's economic expectations index , based on a poll of 306 analysts and institutional investors , fell by 17.3 points to -6.9 points this month , according to a zew press release .
it is the first time since january that the index has fallen into negative territory .
the drop is even larger than the -5.0 analysts expected .
the index was at 10.4 points in july .
the recent decrease is a clear indication that experts expect the economy to lose its buoyancy .
a second index that measures institutional investors ' assessment of the actual business climate , also dropped more than expected .
it fell eight points to 80.2 points .
analysts had predicted it would fall to 84 points . in its continuing effort to ease subprime-related fears , the european central bank pumped 275 billion euros -lrb- $ 370.6 billion -rrb- - about 46 billion euros more than anticipated on monday - into money markets on tuesday .

germany needs to ask itself whether it really is doing enough to fight right-wing extremism , says dw 's daniel scheschkewitz . anyone who has lived outside of germany for some time knows how alert people are to reports about racism and xenophobia in germany , especially when they involve physical violence .
and even more so when they occur in the part of germany considered a right-wing extremist stronghold , such as the region south of leipzig .
the brutal attack on eight indians in the small town of mügeln is all the more disturbing in view of the fact that anti-racist organizations have repeatedly pointed out how dangerous parts of eastern germany are for foreigners .
and in this case , there were n't even any indications that violent skinheads would go to the local fair .
luckily the eight indians got away with their lives .
but the trauma will remain - as will scars from the wounds inflicted on them by the mob that the police could only control by putting themselves in danger .
the investigation will have to determine the extent to which the violence was organized and whether it did indeed stem from neo-nazis .
but the shameful fact remains that the people of mügeln did not protect the foreigners .
the mayor 's statement that the guilty parties were n't locals ca n't change that .
clearly , things that our society simply can not tolerate remain possible even now , more than 10 years after the brutal attacks on asylum seekers in the eastern germany towns of hoyerswerda and rostock .
thus , it was good that georg milbradt , the premier of saxony , where mügeln is located , did n't hesitate for a moment to go there and find out for himself what had happened and to express his disgust .
but that 's not enough .
germany 's political authorities have to ask themselves whether enough is being done when it comes to education and prevention - in schools , in the social welfare system , but also in prosecuting cases and preventing crime .
and there must be more to it than preserving germany 's reputation abroad .
the soccer world cup showed last year that we are indeed a hospitable country that welcomes people of all skin colors and religious beliefs .
but germany must learn for its own sake to accept foreigners , and that must also happen in places where there are few jobs for germans .
another deplorable incident last weekend showed how far away from that state we in former west germany are : a german national soccer team player said he was called a " black pig " by an opposing team 's german goalkeeper .
that , too , is a scandal !
whether as the child of black african immigrants in the bundesliga or as an indian businessman in saxony , unfortunately people who are willing to become integrated in german society far too often run into barriers .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 21.08.2007 germany allows patient legal use of cannabis großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2003 , dutch pharmacies began selling small amounts of cannabis on prescription a patient suffering from multiple sclerosis has been legally allowed to buy cannabis at the pharmacy under strict conditions .
it 's the first time germany has permitted the use of marijuana for medicinal purposes . germany ' süddeutsche zeitung reported on tuesday that the german federal institute for drugs and medical devices for the first time approved the application of a 51-year-old woman suffering from multiple sclerosis to legally buy cannabis from a pharmacy to ease her symptoms . the approval is linked to strict restrictions , but starting at the end of august , the woman , claudia h , is allowed to buy a " standardized extract " from the cannabis plant from the pharmacy for a year .
a doctor has to monitor the therapy .
in addition , both the patient and the pharmacy have to store the drug extracts in a safe so to prevent theft . cannabis shown to ease pain according to the munich-based paper , several scientific studies show that cannabis can ease pain and spasms often associated with multiple sclerosis , a debilitating nerve ailment .
it 's also known to prevent weight loss among cancer and aids patients . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : studies have show that extracts from the cannabis plant have medicinal properties so far , cannabis has been illegal in germany - only possession of small amounts of the drug are allowed - and its use for medicinal purposes limited to scientific studies and aims that " are in the public interest . " doctors so far can only prescribe the synthetically-produced dronabinol , which is an active ingredient in cannabis .
but since the substance is n't approved as a medicine in germany , the medicine 's costs are n't covered by health insurance .
in contrast , the price of the direct cannabis medicine is expected to be much cheaper . cannabis remains illegal in 2005 , a court ruling threw into question the complete ban on cannabis for medicinal purposes .
the german federal administrative court ruled that the health of individual patients also lay in " the public interest . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de taxes -pipe- 21.08.2007 eastern europeans eyeing flat tax großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tax time is much different in eastern europe bulgaria and the czech republic have proposed doing away with exemptions , deductions and loopholes in favor of a flat tax .
economists say the flat tax trend wo n't likely spread from eastern to western europe . when bulgaria 's institute for market economics -lrb- ime -rrb- began touting a flat tax system for the country in the 1990s , it was seen as a crazy free market idea that would never become reality .
but a lot has changed in the past decade .
bulgaria 's neighbors have launched a tax revolution , with a total of nine eastern european and former communist countries shunning progressive tax systems in favor of a simple , one-rate-fits-all model of taxation .
in bulgaria , flat taxes are no longer the exclusive domain of free market dreamers .
fresh from introducing a flat 10 percent tax on corporate profits , bulgaria 's socialist-led coalition government now wants to do the same for personal income . besides switching to a flat tax , the bulgarian government also wants to cut social insurance contributions by 3 percent and increase pensions by 10 percent .
details of the tax proposal are being debated within the governing coalition . fuel for economic transition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flat tax has been criticized as unfair to low wage earners svetla kostadinova , who heads the ime , a free market think tank based in sofia , said she 's confident that starting in 2008 bulgaria will have a flat tax in some form .
kostadinova said she thinks the flat tax will further fuel bulgaria 's economy and cut down on the informal economy , which is often used to avoid taxes .
" we think that the flat tax idea is a good approach for small transitional economies that want to reach european levels of income faster than the usual way , " kostadinova said .
" small countries more easily take such decisions . "
with its 10 percent rate , bulgaria sits at the low end of the flat tax spectrum while lithuania 's 33 percent is at the top end .
estonia , latvia , russia , ukraine , slovakia , georgia and romania have also switched to flat tax systems in recent years .
it 's too soon to say how much of an economic boost eastern europe has gotten by switching to a flat tax , said dutch economist wouter den haan .
furthermore , flat tax schemes are only one part of the economic growth of eastern europe .
many have joined the european union and are realigning their economic policies to switch over to the euro .
czech government looks to shrink deficit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : different approaches in different eu countries the czech republic is launching major economic reforms to try and get its deficit under control .
part of its reform package includes a flat tax .
the ruling center-right coalition said if its tax reform package falls apart , it will seek an early election .
coalition leaders agreed to adopt a 15 percent personal income tax last week .
the rate would drop further to 12.5 percent in 2009 .
the income tax currently maxes out at 32 percent .
the government also wants to decrease the corporate tax rate to 21 percent in 2008 and down to 19 percent by 2010 .
a vote on the reform package is expected in the next week .
tax break or tax increase ?
but eastern europe is n't an economic miracle .
many countries face hefty current-account deficits and high inflation rates .
in bulgaria , there 's also been widespread concern in recent weeks that the flat taxes will hurt poor people and families .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bulgaria wants to add tax haven to its list of assets the average wage in bulgaria is 350 leva a month -lrb- 179 euros , $ 241 -rrb- .
people who make less than this amount , as well as freelancers , will pay more under the new tax system , the bulgarian media has reported .
there 's a common misconception that all forms of flat tax place undue burdens on the poor , said den haan , a professor at the university of amsterdam .
in many cases , only incomes above a certain threshold are taxed , which can make the system quite progressive , he added . while progressive income tax systems in western europe are aimed at taxing the wealthy at higher rates than the poor , it often does n't work out that way .
" our current tax system is n't as progressive as people think , " den haan said .
" that 's because of all the tax deductions . "
western europe remains skeptical bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will taxes ever be this easy ?
western europeans looking to get rid of a complicated system of tax deductions and exclusions , however , are unlikely to see a flat tax any time soon , economists said .
friedrich merz , a german financial expert with the center-right christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , declared a few years back that taxes should be simple enough to fit on back side of a beer coaster .
even so , it remains likely that europe 's pension systems will keeps its largest economies form adopting a flat tax .
most countries in western europe have long-standing social security systems which are funded by the redistribution that comes from progressive tax systems that get higher revenues from the rich , said linda yueh , a visiting professor at the london business school .

an important index that measures business confidence dropped below zero tuesday on fears related to a lack of liquidity in financial markets . german businesses are afraid that the crisis in the united states housing industry will put the brakes on the euro-zone 's largest economy .
the zew research institute 's economic expectations index , based on a poll of 306 analysts and institutional investors , fell by 17.3 points to -6.9 points this month , according to a zew press release .
it is the first time since january that the index has fallen into negative territory .
the drop is even larger than the -5.0 analysts expected .
the index was at 10.4 points in july .
the recent decrease is a clear indication that experts expect the economy to lose its buoyancy .
a second index that measures institutional investors ' assessment of the actual business climate , also dropped more than expected .
it fell eight points to 80.2 points .
analysts had predicted it would fall to 84 points . in its continuing effort to ease subprime-related fears , the european central bank pumped 275 billion euros -lrb- $ 370.6 billion -rrb- - about 46 billion euros more than anticipated on monday - into money markets on tuesday .
the money was part of the frankfurt-based bank 's routine weekly financing . germany does n't face crisis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german market has reacted to bad news from abroad wolfgang franz , head of the mannheim-based zew , said despite the confidence drop , there 's no cause for alarm in germany .
" the crisis is first and foremost the unites states ' problem , " he told reporters .
" the possible impact on the german economy should , as far as we can tell , be limited . "
germany 's export-driven economy , however , could suffer if us consumers rein in their spending habits as a result of the crisis in their loan markets , franz said .
in recent months , the market for german exports had weakened in part due to the rising value of the euro against the dollar .
this happened long before the subprime market in the us collapsed this month and threw world markets into turmoil . analysts cautioned against overreaction to the zew data .
" the results published today do n't suggest an imminent recession , " brian mandt , an economist at postbank , told the afp news agency .
" they do however show that the risks to growth have increased . " ecb unlikely to raise rates bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ecb is expected to keep rates stable andreas rees of hvb / unicredit agreed .
" this is more a matter of psychology than fundamental facts , " he told afp .
" a meltdown for the german economy is not on the cards . "
the new data has raised hopes among businesses that the european central bank wo n't its benchmark rate from a six-year high next month .
" if i could give advice to the ecb , it would be to keep rates stable , " the zew 's franz said , according to bloomberg news .
" i think they should wait until this financial market turbulence passes . "
several large banks changed previous forecasts that the ecb would further increase rates this year , instead predicting that the rate will remain at 4 percent . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de taxes -pipe- 21.08.2007 eastern europeans eyeing flat tax großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tax time is much different in eastern europe bulgaria and the czech republic have proposed doing away with exemptions , deductions and loopholes in favor of a flat tax .
economists say the flat tax trend wo n't likely spread from eastern to western europe . when bulgaria 's institute for market economics -lrb- ime -rrb- began touting a flat tax system for the country in the 1990s , it was seen as a crazy free market idea that would never become reality .
but a lot has changed in the past decade .
bulgaria 's neighbors have launched a tax revolution , with a total of nine eastern european and former communist countries shunning progressive tax systems in favor of a simple , one-rate-fits-all model of taxation .
in bulgaria , flat taxes are no longer the exclusive domain of free market dreamers .
fresh from introducing a flat 10 percent tax on corporate profits , bulgaria 's socialist-led coalition government now wants to do the same for personal income . besides switching to a flat tax , the bulgarian government also wants to cut social insurance contributions by 3 percent and increase pensions by 10 percent .
details of the tax proposal are being debated within the governing coalition . fuel for economic transition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flat tax has been criticized as unfair to low wage earners svetla kostadinova , who heads the ime , a free market think tank based in sofia , said she 's confident that starting in 2008 bulgaria will have a flat tax in some form .
kostadinova said she thinks the flat tax will further fuel bulgaria 's economy and cut down on the informal economy , which is often used to avoid taxes .
" we think that the flat tax idea is a good approach for small transitional economies that want to reach european levels of income faster than the usual way , " kostadinova said .
" small countries more easily take such decisions . "
with its 10 percent rate , bulgaria sits at the low end of the flat tax spectrum while lithuania 's 33 percent is at the top end .
estonia , latvia , russia , ukraine , slovakia , georgia and romania have also switched to flat tax systems in recent years .
it 's too soon to say how much of an economic boost eastern europe has gotten by switching to a flat tax , said dutch economist wouter den haan .
furthermore , flat tax schemes are only one part of the economic growth of eastern europe .
many have joined the european union and are realigning their economic policies to switch over to the euro .
czech government looks to shrink deficit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : different approaches in different eu countries the czech republic is launching major economic reforms to try and get its deficit under control .
part of its reform package includes a flat tax .
the ruling center-right coalition said if its tax reform package falls apart , it will seek an early election .
coalition leaders agreed to adopt a 15 percent personal income tax last week .
the rate would drop further to 12.5 percent in 2009 .
the income tax currently maxes out at 32 percent .
the government also wants to decrease the corporate tax rate to 21 percent in 2008 and down to 19 percent by 2010 .
a vote on the reform package is expected in the next week .
tax break or tax increase ?
but eastern europe is n't an economic miracle .
many countries face hefty current-account deficits and high inflation rates .
in bulgaria , there 's also been widespread concern in recent weeks that the flat taxes will hurt poor people and families .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bulgaria wants to add tax haven to its list of assets the average wage in bulgaria is 350 leva a month -lrb- 179 euros , $ 241 -rrb- .
people who make less than this amount , as well as freelancers , will pay more under the new tax system , the bulgarian media has reported .
there 's a common misconception that all forms of flat tax place undue burdens on the poor , said den haan , a professor at the university of amsterdam .
in many cases , only incomes above a certain threshold are taxed , which can make the system quite progressive , he added . while progressive income tax systems in western europe are aimed at taxing the wealthy at higher rates than the poor , it often does n't work out that way .
" our current tax system is n't as progressive as people think , " den haan said .
" that 's because of all the tax deductions . "
western europe remains skeptical bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will taxes ever be this easy ?
western europeans looking to get rid of a complicated system of tax deductions and exclusions , however , are unlikely to see a flat tax any time soon , economists said .
friedrich merz , a german financial expert with the center-right christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , declared a few years back that taxes should be simple enough to fit on back side of a beer coaster .
even so , it remains likely that europe 's pension systems will keeps its largest economies form adopting a flat tax .
most countries in western europe have long-standing social security systems which are funded by the redistribution that comes from progressive tax systems that get higher revenues from the rich , said linda yueh , a visiting professor at the london business school . " to some people , including some views from western europe , a flat tax is a free market mechanism because there 's no redistributive aim , " yueh said .
taxpayers also like the idea of exemptions and the feeling of getting money back from the government , den haan said , adding that people can see how specific exemptions benefit them and do n't want to lose those benefits . trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de extremism -pipe- 21.08.2007 opinion : germany must protect its foreigners großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eight indians were attacked by a violent mob in a village in the state of saxony .
germany needs to ask itself whether it really is doing enough to fight right-wing extremism , says dw 's daniel scheschkewitz . anyone who has lived outside of germany for some time knows how alert people are to reports about racism and xenophobia in germany , especially when they involve physical violence .
and even more so when they occur in the part of germany considered a right-wing extremist stronghold , such as the region south of leipzig .
the brutal attack on eight indians in the small town of mügeln is all the more disturbing in view of the fact that anti-racist organizations have repeatedly pointed out how dangerous parts of eastern germany are for foreigners .
and in this case , there were n't even any indications that violent skinheads would go to the local fair .
luckily the eight indians got away with their lives .
but the trauma will remain - as will scars from the wounds inflicted on them by the mob that the police could only control by putting themselves in danger .
the investigation will have to determine the extent to which the violence was organized and whether it did indeed stem from neo-nazis .
but the shameful fact remains that the people of mügeln did not protect the foreigners .
the mayor 's statement that the guilty parties were n't locals ca n't change that .
clearly , things that our society simply can not tolerate remain possible even now , more than 10 years after the brutal attacks on asylum seekers in the eastern germany towns of hoyerswerda and rostock .
thus , it was good that georg milbradt , the premier of saxony , where mügeln is located , did n't hesitate for a moment to go there and find out for himself what had happened and to express his disgust .
but that 's not enough .
germany 's political authorities have to ask themselves whether enough is being done when it comes to education and prevention - in schools , in the social welfare system , but also in prosecuting cases and preventing crime .
and there must be more to it than preserving germany 's reputation abroad .
the soccer world cup showed last year that we are indeed a hospitable country that welcomes people of all skin colors and religious beliefs .
but germany must learn for its own sake to accept foreigners , and that must also happen in places where there are few jobs for germans .
another deplorable incident last weekend showed how far away from that state we in former west germany are : a german national soccer team player said he was called a " black pig " by an opposing team 's german goalkeeper .
that , too , is a scandal !
whether as the child of black african immigrants in the bundesliga or as an indian businessman in saxony , unfortunately people who are willing to become integrated in german society far too often run into barriers .
those who expect immigrants to be willing to integrate must also be prepared to protect them - from physical violence and verbal abuse .

an important index that measures business confidence dropped below zero tuesday on fears related to a lack of liquidity in financial markets . german businesses are afraid that the crisis in the united states housing industry will put the brakes on the euro-zone 's largest economy .
the zew research institute 's economic expectations index , based on a poll of 306 analysts and institutional investors , fell by 17.3 points to -6.9 points this month , according to a zew press release .
it is the first time since january that the index has fallen into negative territory .
the drop is even larger than the -5.0 analysts expected .
the index was at 10.4 points in july .
the recent decrease is a clear indication that experts expect the economy to lose its buoyancy .
a second index that measures institutional investors ' assessment of the actual business climate , also dropped more than expected .
it fell eight points to 80.2 points .
analysts had predicted it would fall to 84 points . in its continuing effort to ease subprime-related fears , the european central bank pumped 275 billion euros -lrb- $ 370.6 billion -rrb- - about 46 billion euros more than anticipated on monday - into money markets on tuesday .
the money was part of the frankfurt-based bank 's routine weekly financing . germany does n't face crisis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german market has reacted to bad news from abroad wolfgang franz , head of the mannheim-based zew , said despite the confidence drop , there 's no cause for alarm in germany .
" the crisis is first and foremost the unites states ' problem , " he told reporters .
" the possible impact on the german economy should , as far as we can tell , be limited . "
germany 's export-driven economy , however , could suffer if us consumers rein in their spending habits as a result of the crisis in their loan markets , franz said .
in recent months , the market for german exports had weakened in part due to the rising value of the euro against the dollar .
this happened long before the subprime market in the us collapsed this month and threw world markets into turmoil . analysts cautioned against overreaction to the zew data .
" the results published today do n't suggest an imminent recession , " brian mandt , an economist at postbank , told the afp news agency .
" they do however show that the risks to growth have increased . " ecb unlikely to raise rates bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ecb is expected to keep rates stable andreas rees of hvb / unicredit agreed .
" this is more a matter of psychology than fundamental facts , " he told afp .
" a meltdown for the german economy is not on the cards . "
the new data has raised hopes among businesses that the european central bank wo n't its benchmark rate from a six-year high next month .
" if i could give advice to the ecb , it would be to keep rates stable , " the zew 's franz said , according to bloomberg news .
" i think they should wait until this financial market turbulence passes . "
several large banks changed previous forecasts that the ecb would further increase rates this year , instead predicting that the rate will remain at 4 percent . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de extremism -pipe- 21.08.2007 opinion : germany must protect its foreigners großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eight indians were attacked by a violent mob in a village in the state of saxony .
germany needs to ask itself whether it really is doing enough to fight right-wing extremism , says dw 's daniel scheschkewitz . anyone who has lived outside of germany for some time knows how alert people are to reports about racism and xenophobia in germany , especially when they involve physical violence .
and even more so when they occur in the part of germany considered a right-wing extremist stronghold , such as the region south of leipzig .
the brutal attack on eight indians in the small town of mügeln is all the more disturbing in view of the fact that anti-racist organizations have repeatedly pointed out how dangerous parts of eastern germany are for foreigners .
and in this case , there were n't even any indications that violent skinheads would go to the local fair .
luckily the eight indians got away with their lives .
but the trauma will remain - as will scars from the wounds inflicted on them by the mob that the police could only control by putting themselves in danger .
the investigation will have to determine the extent to which the violence was organized and whether it did indeed stem from neo-nazis .
but the shameful fact remains that the people of mügeln did not protect the foreigners .
the mayor 's statement that the guilty parties were n't locals ca n't change that .
clearly , things that our society simply can not tolerate remain possible even now , more than 10 years after the brutal attacks on asylum seekers in the eastern germany towns of hoyerswerda and rostock .
thus , it was good that georg milbradt , the premier of saxony , where mügeln is located , did n't hesitate for a moment to go there and find out for himself what had happened and to express his disgust .
but that 's not enough .
germany 's political authorities have to ask themselves whether enough is being done when it comes to education and prevention - in schools , in the social welfare system , but also in prosecuting cases and preventing crime .
and there must be more to it than preserving germany 's reputation abroad .
the soccer world cup showed last year that we are indeed a hospitable country that welcomes people of all skin colors and religious beliefs .
but germany must learn for its own sake to accept foreigners , and that must also happen in places where there are few jobs for germans .
another deplorable incident last weekend showed how far away from that state we in former west germany are : a german national soccer team player said he was called a " black pig " by an opposing team 's german goalkeeper .
that , too , is a scandal !
whether as the child of black african immigrants in the bundesliga or as an indian businessman in saxony , unfortunately people who are willing to become integrated in german society far too often run into barriers .
those who expect immigrants to be willing to integrate must also be prepared to protect them - from physical violence and verbal abuse .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de taxes -pipe- 21.08.2007 eastern europeans eyeing flat tax großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tax time is much different in eastern europe bulgaria and the czech republic have proposed doing away with exemptions , deductions and loopholes in favor of a flat tax .
economists say the flat tax trend wo n't likely spread from eastern to western europe . when bulgaria 's institute for market economics -lrb- ime -rrb- began touting a flat tax system for the country in the 1990s , it was seen as a crazy free market idea that would never become reality .
but a lot has changed in the past decade .
bulgaria 's neighbors have launched a tax revolution , with a total of nine eastern european and former communist countries shunning progressive tax systems in favor of a simple , one-rate-fits-all model of taxation .
in bulgaria , flat taxes are no longer the exclusive domain of free market dreamers .
fresh from introducing a flat 10 percent tax on corporate profits , bulgaria 's socialist-led coalition government now wants to do the same for personal income . besides switching to a flat tax , the bulgarian government also wants to cut social insurance contributions by 3 percent and increase pensions by 10 percent .
details of the tax proposal are being debated within the governing coalition . fuel for economic transition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flat tax has been criticized as unfair to low wage earners svetla kostadinova , who heads the ime , a free market think tank based in sofia , said she 's confident that starting in 2008 bulgaria will have a flat tax in some form .
kostadinova said she thinks the flat tax will further fuel bulgaria 's economy and cut down on the informal economy , which is often used to avoid taxes .
" we think that the flat tax idea is a good approach for small transitional economies that want to reach european levels of income faster than the usual way , " kostadinova said .
" small countries more easily take such decisions . "
with its 10 percent rate , bulgaria sits at the low end of the flat tax spectrum while lithuania 's 33 percent is at the top end .
estonia , latvia , russia , ukraine , slovakia , georgia and romania have also switched to flat tax systems in recent years .
it 's too soon to say how much of an economic boost eastern europe has gotten by switching to a flat tax , said dutch economist wouter den haan .
furthermore , flat tax schemes are only one part of the economic growth of eastern europe .
many have joined the european union and are realigning their economic policies to switch over to the euro .
czech government looks to shrink deficit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : different approaches in different eu countries the czech republic is launching major economic reforms to try and get its deficit under control .
part of its reform package includes a flat tax .
the ruling center-right coalition said if its tax reform package falls apart , it will seek an early election .
coalition leaders agreed to adopt a 15 percent personal income tax last week .
the rate would drop further to 12.5 percent in 2009 .
the income tax currently maxes out at 32 percent .
the government also wants to decrease the corporate tax rate to 21 percent in 2008 and down to 19 percent by 2010 .
a vote on the reform package is expected in the next week .
tax break or tax increase ?
but eastern europe is n't an economic miracle .
many countries face hefty current-account deficits and high inflation rates .
in bulgaria , there 's also been widespread concern in recent weeks that the flat taxes will hurt poor people and families .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bulgaria wants to add tax haven to its list of assets the average wage in bulgaria is 350 leva a month -lrb- 179 euros , $ 241 -rrb- .
people who make less than this amount , as well as freelancers , will pay more under the new tax system , the bulgarian media has reported .
there 's a common misconception that all forms of flat tax place undue burdens on the poor , said den haan , a professor at the university of amsterdam .
in many cases , only incomes above a certain threshold are taxed , which can make the system quite progressive , he added . while progressive income tax systems in western europe are aimed at taxing the wealthy at higher rates than the poor , it often does n't work out that way .
" our current tax system is n't as progressive as people think , " den haan said .
" that 's because of all the tax deductions . "
western europe remains skeptical bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will taxes ever be this easy ?
western europeans looking to get rid of a complicated system of tax deductions and exclusions , however , are unlikely to see a flat tax any time soon , economists said .
friedrich merz , a german financial expert with the center-right christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , declared a few years back that taxes should be simple enough to fit on back side of a beer coaster .
even so , it remains likely that europe 's pension systems will keeps its largest economies form adopting a flat tax .
most countries in western europe have long-standing social security systems which are funded by the redistribution that comes from progressive tax systems that get higher revenues from the rich , said linda yueh , a visiting professor at the london business school . " to some people , including some views from western europe , a flat tax is a free market mechanism because there 's no redistributive aim , " yueh said .
taxpayers also like the idea of exemptions and the feeling of getting money back from the government , den haan said , adding that people can see how specific exemptions benefit them and do n't want to lose those benefits . trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

economists say the flat tax trend wo n't likely spread from eastern to western europe . when bulgaria 's institute for market economics -lrb- ime -rrb- began touting a flat tax system for the country in the 1990s , it was seen as a crazy free market idea that would never become reality .
but a lot has changed in the past decade .
bulgaria 's neighbors have launched a tax revolution , with a total of nine eastern european and former communist countries shunning progressive tax systems in favor of a simple , one-rate-fits-all model of taxation .
in bulgaria , flat taxes are no longer the exclusive domain of free market dreamers .
fresh from introducing a flat 10 percent tax on corporate profits , bulgaria 's socialist-led coalition government now wants to do the same for personal income . besides switching to a flat tax , the bulgarian government also wants to cut social insurance contributions by 3 percent and increase pensions by 10 percent .
details of the tax proposal are being debated within the governing coalition . fuel for economic transition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flat tax has been criticized as unfair to low wage earners svetla kostadinova , who heads the ime , a free market think tank based in sofia , said she 's confident that starting in 2008 bulgaria will have a flat tax in some form .
kostadinova said she thinks the flat tax will further fuel bulgaria 's economy and cut down on the informal economy , which is often used to avoid taxes .
" we think that the flat tax idea is a good approach for small transitional economies that want to reach european levels of income faster than the usual way , " kostadinova said .
" small countries more easily take such decisions . "
with its 10 percent rate , bulgaria sits at the low end of the flat tax spectrum while lithuania 's 33 percent is at the top end .
estonia , latvia , russia , ukraine , slovakia , georgia and romania have also switched to flat tax systems in recent years .
it 's too soon to say how much of an economic boost eastern europe has gotten by switching to a flat tax , said dutch economist wouter den haan .
furthermore , flat tax schemes are only one part of the economic growth of eastern europe .
many have joined the european union and are realigning their economic policies to switch over to the euro .
czech government looks to shrink deficit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : different approaches in different eu countries the czech republic is launching major economic reforms to try and get its deficit under control .
part of its reform package includes a flat tax .
the ruling center-right coalition said if its tax reform package falls apart , it will seek an early election .
coalition leaders agreed to adopt a 15 percent personal income tax last week .
the rate would drop further to 12.5 percent in 2009 .
the income tax currently maxes out at 32 percent .
the government also wants to decrease the corporate tax rate to 21 percent in 2008 and down to 19 percent by 2010 .
a vote on the reform package is expected in the next week .
tax break or tax increase ?
but eastern europe is n't an economic miracle .
many countries face hefty current-account deficits and high inflation rates .
in bulgaria , there 's also been widespread concern in recent weeks that the flat taxes will hurt poor people and families .

people who make less than this amount , as well as freelancers , will pay more under the new tax system , the bulgarian media has reported .
there 's a common misconception that all forms of flat tax place undue burdens on the poor , said den haan , a professor at the university of amsterdam .
in many cases , only incomes above a certain threshold are taxed , which can make the system quite progressive , he added . while progressive income tax systems in western europe are aimed at taxing the wealthy at higher rates than the poor , it often does n't work out that way .
" our current tax system is n't as progressive as people think , " den haan said .
" that 's because of all the tax deductions . "
western europe remains skeptical bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will taxes ever be this easy ?
western europeans looking to get rid of a complicated system of tax deductions and exclusions , however , are unlikely to see a flat tax any time soon , economists said .
friedrich merz , a german financial expert with the center-right christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , declared a few years back that taxes should be simple enough to fit on back side of a beer coaster .
even so , it remains likely that europe 's pension systems will keeps its largest economies form adopting a flat tax .
most countries in western europe have long-standing social security systems which are funded by the redistribution that comes from progressive tax systems that get higher revenues from the rich , said linda yueh , a visiting professor at the london business school . " to some people , including some views from western europe , a flat tax is a free market mechanism because there 's no redistributive aim , " yueh said .

it 's the first time germany has permitted the use of marijuana for medicinal purposes . germany ' süddeutsche zeitung reported on tuesday that the german federal institute for drugs and medical devices for the first time approved the application of a 51-year-old woman suffering from multiple sclerosis to legally buy cannabis from a pharmacy to ease her symptoms . the approval is linked to strict restrictions , but starting at the end of august , the woman , claudia h , is allowed to buy a " standardized extract " from the cannabis plant from the pharmacy for a year .
a doctor has to monitor the therapy .
in addition , both the patient and the pharmacy have to store the drug extracts in a safe so to prevent theft . cannabis shown to ease pain according to the munich-based paper , several scientific studies show that cannabis can ease pain and spasms often associated with multiple sclerosis , a debilitating nerve ailment .

but since the substance is n't approved as a medicine in germany , the medicine 's costs are n't covered by health insurance .
in contrast , the price of the direct cannabis medicine is expected to be much cheaper . cannabis remains illegal in 2005 , a court ruling threw into question the complete ban on cannabis for medicinal purposes .
the german federal administrative court ruled that the health of individual patients also lay in " the public interest . "
that means that the bonn-based federal institute for drugs and medical devices now has to consider each application for use of cannabis for medicinal purposes on a case-by-case basis . despite tuesday 's landmark decision to allow cannabis for treatment , the drug remains illegal in future .
patients who acquire it on their own risk prosecution .

germany needs to ask itself whether it really is doing enough to fight right-wing extremism , says dw 's daniel scheschkewitz . anyone who has lived outside of germany for some time knows how alert people are to reports about racism and xenophobia in germany , especially when they involve physical violence .
and even more so when they occur in the part of germany considered a right-wing extremist stronghold , such as the region south of leipzig .
the brutal attack on eight indians in the small town of mügeln is all the more disturbing in view of the fact that anti-racist organizations have repeatedly pointed out how dangerous parts of eastern germany are for foreigners .
and in this case , there were n't even any indications that violent skinheads would go to the local fair .
luckily the eight indians got away with their lives .
but the trauma will remain - as will scars from the wounds inflicted on them by the mob that the police could only control by putting themselves in danger .
the investigation will have to determine the extent to which the violence was organized and whether it did indeed stem from neo-nazis .
but the shameful fact remains that the people of mügeln did not protect the foreigners .
the mayor 's statement that the guilty parties were n't locals ca n't change that .
clearly , things that our society simply can not tolerate remain possible even now , more than 10 years after the brutal attacks on asylum seekers in the eastern germany towns of hoyerswerda and rostock .
thus , it was good that georg milbradt , the premier of saxony , where mügeln is located , did n't hesitate for a moment to go there and find out for himself what had happened and to express his disgust .
but that 's not enough .
germany 's political authorities have to ask themselves whether enough is being done when it comes to education and prevention - in schools , in the social welfare system , but also in prosecuting cases and preventing crime .
and there must be more to it than preserving germany 's reputation abroad .
the soccer world cup showed last year that we are indeed a hospitable country that welcomes people of all skin colors and religious beliefs .
but germany must learn for its own sake to accept foreigners , and that must also happen in places where there are few jobs for germans .
another deplorable incident last weekend showed how far away from that state we in former west germany are : a german national soccer team player said he was called a " black pig " by an opposing team 's german goalkeeper .
that , too , is a scandal !
whether as the child of black african immigrants in the bundesliga or as an indian businessman in saxony , unfortunately people who are willing to become integrated in german society far too often run into barriers .
those who expect immigrants to be willing to integrate must also be prepared to protect them - from physical violence and verbal abuse .

an important index that measures business confidence dropped below zero tuesday on fears related to a lack of liquidity in financial markets . german businesses are afraid that the crisis in the united states housing industry will put the brakes on the euro-zone 's largest economy .
the zew research institute 's economic expectations index , based on a poll of 306 analysts and institutional investors , fell by 17.3 points to -6.9 points this month , according to a zew press release .
it is the first time since january that the index has fallen into negative territory .
the drop is even larger than the -5.0 analysts expected .
the index was at 10.4 points in july .
the recent decrease is a clear indication that experts expect the economy to lose its buoyancy .
a second index that measures institutional investors ' assessment of the actual business climate , also dropped more than expected .
it fell eight points to 80.2 points .
analysts had predicted it would fall to 84 points . in its continuing effort to ease subprime-related fears , the european central bank pumped 275 billion euros -lrb- $ 370.6 billion -rrb- - about 46 billion euros more than anticipated on monday - into money markets on tuesday .
the money was part of the frankfurt-based bank 's routine weekly financing . germany does n't face crisis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german market has reacted to bad news from abroad wolfgang franz , head of the mannheim-based zew , said despite the confidence drop , there 's no cause for alarm in germany .
" the crisis is first and foremost the unites states ' problem , " he told reporters .
" the possible impact on the german economy should , as far as we can tell , be limited . "
germany 's export-driven economy , however , could suffer if us consumers rein in their spending habits as a result of the crisis in their loan markets , franz said .
in recent months , the market for german exports had weakened in part due to the rising value of the euro against the dollar .
this happened long before the subprime market in the us collapsed this month and threw world markets into turmoil . analysts cautioned against overreaction to the zew data .
" the results published today do n't suggest an imminent recession , " brian mandt , an economist at postbank , told the afp news agency .
" they do however show that the risks to growth have increased . " ecb unlikely to raise rates bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ecb is expected to keep rates stable andreas rees of hvb / unicredit agreed .
" this is more a matter of psychology than fundamental facts , " he told afp .
" a meltdown for the german economy is not on the cards . "
the new data has raised hopes among businesses that the european central bank wo n't its benchmark rate from a six-year high next month .
" if i could give advice to the ecb , it would be to keep rates stable , " the zew 's franz said , according to bloomberg news .
" i think they should wait until this financial market turbulence passes . "
several large banks changed previous forecasts that the ecb would further increase rates this year , instead predicting that the rate will remain at 4 percent . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

an important index that measures business confidence dropped below zero tuesday on fears related to a lack of liquidity in financial markets . german businesses are afraid that the crisis in the united states housing industry will put the brakes on the euro-zone 's largest economy .
the zew research institute 's economic expectations index , based on a poll of 306 analysts and institutional investors , fell by 17.3 points to -6.9 points this month , according to a zew press release .
it is the first time since january that the index has fallen into negative territory .
the drop is even larger than the -5.0 analysts expected .
the index was at 10.4 points in july .
the recent decrease is a clear indication that experts expect the economy to lose its buoyancy .
a second index that measures institutional investors ' assessment of the actual business climate , also dropped more than expected .
it fell eight points to 80.2 points .
analysts had predicted it would fall to 84 points . in its continuing effort to ease subprime-related fears , the european central bank pumped 275 billion euros -lrb- $ 370.6 billion -rrb- - about 46 billion euros more than anticipated on monday - into money markets on tuesday .
the money was part of the frankfurt-based bank 's routine weekly financing . germany does n't face crisis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german market has reacted to bad news from abroad wolfgang franz , head of the mannheim-based zew , said despite the confidence drop , there 's no cause for alarm in germany .
" the crisis is first and foremost the unites states ' problem , " he told reporters .
" the possible impact on the german economy should , as far as we can tell , be limited . "
germany 's export-driven economy , however , could suffer if us consumers rein in their spending habits as a result of the crisis in their loan markets , franz said .
in recent months , the market for german exports had weakened in part due to the rising value of the euro against the dollar .
this happened long before the subprime market in the us collapsed this month and threw world markets into turmoil . analysts cautioned against overreaction to the zew data .
" the results published today do n't suggest an imminent recession , " brian mandt , an economist at postbank , told the afp news agency .
" they do however show that the risks to growth have increased . " ecb unlikely to raise rates bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ecb is expected to keep rates stable andreas rees of hvb / unicredit agreed .
" this is more a matter of psychology than fundamental facts , " he told afp .
" a meltdown for the german economy is not on the cards . "
the new data has raised hopes among businesses that the european central bank wo n't its benchmark rate from a six-year high next month .
" if i could give advice to the ecb , it would be to keep rates stable , " the zew 's franz said , according to bloomberg news .
" i think they should wait until this financial market turbulence passes . "

quoting data from the country 's federal statistics agency , the organization said that the figures accounted for more than one in 10 of positions nationwide .
during the same period , 1,451 professorships had been lost at universities .
" improvement in the quality of our higher education system and study conditions is n't possible without a noticeable change in the proportion of 60 students per lecturer , which can not compete internationally , " dhv president bernhard kempen , a professor of law at the university of cologne , said in a press statement .
kempen called for germany 's federal and state governments to reinstate the 1,451 positions that had been eliminated . " with ever fewer professors , the system can not improve , " he said .
the dhv 's figures showed that the cuts were most extreme in the humanities , particularly in classical philology and education , which both lost around 35 percent of lecturers over the decade .
fewer teachers , more students bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the average student-teacher ratio at german universities is 60 to 1 both catholic and protestant theology had lost academic staff , by 18.9 and 20.7 percent respectively .
the number of professorial positions in engineering -lrb- 356 spots or -13.3 percent -rrb- ; mathematics and natural science -lrb- 264 or -4.3 percent -rrb- and medicine -lrb- 86 or -2.7 percent -rrb- had also fallen .
law , economics , social sciences and art history departments were the only ones to benefit from the creation of new positions .
the former three fields saw gains of 5.6 percent , while the increase in university lectureships in art history was 9.4 percent .
during the same time , the number of students had increased by 0.5 percent , said the dhv , which represents over 22,000 members .
in an academic ranking of the world 's universities released by jiao tong university in shanghai last week , germany 's two best universities , munich 's ludwig maximilians university and its technical university , only came in 53rd and 56th .
international comparisons carried out in recent years have consistently shown that germany 's educational system - from primary to secondary schooling - lags behind those of other industrialized nations . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the brutal attack on eight indians in the small town of mügeln is all the more disturbing in view of the fact that anti-racist organizations have repeatedly pointed out how dangerous parts of eastern germany are for foreigners .
and in this case , there were n't even any indications that violent skinheads would go to the local fair .
luckily the eight indians got away with their lives .
but the trauma will remain - as will scars from the wounds inflicted on them by the mob that the police could only control by putting themselves in danger .
the investigation will have to determine the extent to which the violence was organized and whether it did indeed stem from neo-nazis .
but the shameful fact remains that the people of mügeln did not protect the foreigners .
the mayor 's statement that the guilty parties were n't locals ca n't change that .
clearly , things that our society simply can not tolerate remain possible even now , more than 10 years after the brutal attacks on asylum seekers in the eastern germany towns of hoyerswerda and rostock .
thus , it was good that georg milbradt , the premier of saxony , where mügeln is located , did n't hesitate for a moment to go there and find out for himself what had happened and to express his disgust .
but that 's not enough .
germany 's political authorities have to ask themselves whether enough is being done when it comes to education and prevention - in schools , in the social welfare system , but also in prosecuting cases and preventing crime .
and there must be more to it than preserving germany 's reputation abroad .
the soccer world cup showed last year that we are indeed a hospitable country that welcomes people of all skin colors and religious beliefs .
but germany must learn for its own sake to accept foreigners , and that must also happen in places where there are few jobs for germans .
another deplorable incident last weekend showed how far away from that state we in former west germany are : a german national soccer team player said he was called a " black pig " by an opposing team 's german goalkeeper .
that , too , is a scandal !
whether as the child of black african immigrants in the bundesliga or as an indian businessman in saxony , unfortunately people who are willing to become integrated in german society far too often run into barriers .
those who expect immigrants to be willing to integrate must also be prepared to protect them - from physical violence and verbal abuse .

quoting data from the country 's federal statistics agency , the organization said that the figures accounted for more than one in 10 of positions nationwide .
during the same period , 1,451 professorships had been lost at universities .
" improvement in the quality of our higher education system and study conditions is n't possible without a noticeable change in the proportion of 60 students per lecturer , which can not compete internationally , " dhv president bernhard kempen , a professor of law at the university of cologne , said in a press statement .
kempen called for germany 's federal and state governments to reinstate the 1,451 positions that had been eliminated . " with ever fewer professors , the system can not improve , " he said .
the dhv 's figures showed that the cuts were most extreme in the humanities , particularly in classical philology and education , which both lost around 35 percent of lecturers over the decade .
fewer teachers , more students bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the average student-teacher ratio at german universities is 60 to 1 both catholic and protestant theology had lost academic staff , by 18.9 and 20.7 percent respectively .

law , economics , social sciences and art history departments were the only ones to benefit from the creation of new positions .
the former three fields saw gains of 5.6 percent , while the increase in university lectureships in art history was 9.4 percent .
during the same time , the number of students had increased by 0.5 percent , said the dhv , which represents over 22,000 members .
in an academic ranking of the world 's universities released by jiao tong university in shanghai last week , germany 's two best universities , munich 's ludwig maximilians university and its technical university , only came in 53rd and 56th .

economists say the flat tax trend wo n't likely spread from eastern to western europe . when bulgaria 's institute for market economics -lrb- ime -rrb- began touting a flat tax system for the country in the 1990s , it was seen as a crazy free market idea that would never become reality .
but a lot has changed in the past decade .
bulgaria 's neighbors have launched a tax revolution , with a total of nine eastern european and former communist countries shunning progressive tax systems in favor of a simple , one-rate-fits-all model of taxation .
in bulgaria , flat taxes are no longer the exclusive domain of free market dreamers .
fresh from introducing a flat 10 percent tax on corporate profits , bulgaria 's socialist-led coalition government now wants to do the same for personal income . besides switching to a flat tax , the bulgarian government also wants to cut social insurance contributions by 3 percent and increase pensions by 10 percent .
details of the tax proposal are being debated within the governing coalition . fuel for economic transition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flat tax has been criticized as unfair to low wage earners svetla kostadinova , who heads the ime , a free market think tank based in sofia , said she 's confident that starting in 2008 bulgaria will have a flat tax in some form .
kostadinova said she thinks the flat tax will further fuel bulgaria 's economy and cut down on the informal economy , which is often used to avoid taxes .
" we think that the flat tax idea is a good approach for small transitional economies that want to reach european levels of income faster than the usual way , " kostadinova said .
" small countries more easily take such decisions . "
with its 10 percent rate , bulgaria sits at the low end of the flat tax spectrum while lithuania 's 33 percent is at the top end .
estonia , latvia , russia , ukraine , slovakia , georgia and romania have also switched to flat tax systems in recent years .
it 's too soon to say how much of an economic boost eastern europe has gotten by switching to a flat tax , said dutch economist wouter den haan .
furthermore , flat tax schemes are only one part of the economic growth of eastern europe .
many have joined the european union and are realigning their economic policies to switch over to the euro .
czech government looks to shrink deficit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : different approaches in different eu countries the czech republic is launching major economic reforms to try and get its deficit under control .
part of its reform package includes a flat tax .
the ruling center-right coalition said if its tax reform package falls apart , it will seek an early election .
coalition leaders agreed to adopt a 15 percent personal income tax last week .
the rate would drop further to 12.5 percent in 2009 .
the income tax currently maxes out at 32 percent .
the government also wants to decrease the corporate tax rate to 21 percent in 2008 and down to 19 percent by 2010 .
a vote on the reform package is expected in the next week .
tax break or tax increase ?
but eastern europe is n't an economic miracle .
many countries face hefty current-account deficits and high inflation rates .
in bulgaria , there 's also been widespread concern in recent weeks that the flat taxes will hurt poor people and families .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bulgaria wants to add tax haven to its list of assets the average wage in bulgaria is 350 leva a month -lrb- 179 euros , $ 241 -rrb- .
people who make less than this amount , as well as freelancers , will pay more under the new tax system , the bulgarian media has reported .
there 's a common misconception that all forms of flat tax place undue burdens on the poor , said den haan , a professor at the university of amsterdam .
in many cases , only incomes above a certain threshold are taxed , which can make the system quite progressive , he added . while progressive income tax systems in western europe are aimed at taxing the wealthy at higher rates than the poor , it often does n't work out that way .
" our current tax system is n't as progressive as people think , " den haan said .
" that 's because of all the tax deductions . "
western europe remains skeptical bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will taxes ever be this easy ?
western europeans looking to get rid of a complicated system of tax deductions and exclusions , however , are unlikely to see a flat tax any time soon , economists said .
friedrich merz , a german financial expert with the center-right christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , declared a few years back that taxes should be simple enough to fit on back side of a beer coaster .
even so , it remains likely that europe 's pension systems will keeps its largest economies form adopting a flat tax .
most countries in western europe have long-standing social security systems which are funded by the redistribution that comes from progressive tax systems that get higher revenues from the rich , said linda yueh , a visiting professor at the london business school . " to some people , including some views from western europe , a flat tax is a free market mechanism because there 's no redistributive aim , " yueh said .

it 's the first time germany has permitted the use of marijuana for medicinal purposes . germany ' süddeutsche zeitung reported on tuesday that the german federal institute for drugs and medical devices for the first time approved the application of a 51-year-old woman suffering from multiple sclerosis to legally buy cannabis from a pharmacy to ease her symptoms . the approval is linked to strict restrictions , but starting at the end of august , the woman , claudia h , is allowed to buy a " standardized extract " from the cannabis plant from the pharmacy for a year .
a doctor has to monitor the therapy .
in addition , both the patient and the pharmacy have to store the drug extracts in a safe so to prevent theft . cannabis shown to ease pain according to the munich-based paper , several scientific studies show that cannabis can ease pain and spasms often associated with multiple sclerosis , a debilitating nerve ailment .
it 's also known to prevent weight loss among cancer and aids patients . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : studies have show that extracts from the cannabis plant have medicinal properties so far , cannabis has been illegal in germany - only possession of small amounts of the drug are allowed - and its use for medicinal purposes limited to scientific studies and aims that " are in the public interest .

but since the substance is n't approved as a medicine in germany , the medicine 's costs are n't covered by health insurance .
in contrast , the price of the direct cannabis medicine is expected to be much cheaper . cannabis remains illegal in 2005 , a court ruling threw into question the complete ban on cannabis for medicinal purposes .
the german federal administrative court ruled that the health of individual patients also lay in " the public interest . "
that means that the bonn-based federal institute for drugs and medical devices now has to consider each application for use of cannabis for medicinal purposes on a case-by-case basis . despite tuesday 's landmark decision to allow cannabis for treatment , the drug remains illegal in future .

an important index that measures business confidence dropped below zero tuesday on fears related to a lack of liquidity in financial markets . german businesses are afraid that the crisis in the united states housing industry will put the brakes on the euro-zone 's largest economy .
the zew research institute 's economic expectations index , based on a poll of 306 analysts and institutional investors , fell by 17.3 points to -6.9 points this month , according to a zew press release .
it is the first time since january that the index has fallen into negative territory .
the drop is even larger than the -5.0 analysts expected .
the index was at 10.4 points in july .
the recent decrease is a clear indication that experts expect the economy to lose its buoyancy .
a second index that measures institutional investors ' assessment of the actual business climate , also dropped more than expected .
it fell eight points to 80.2 points .
analysts had predicted it would fall to 84 points . in its continuing effort to ease subprime-related fears , the european central bank pumped 275 billion euros -lrb- $ 370.6 billion -rrb- - about 46 billion euros more than anticipated on monday - into money markets on tuesday .

" the possible impact on the german economy should , as far as we can tell , be limited . "
germany 's export-driven economy , however , could suffer if us consumers rein in their spending habits as a result of the crisis in their loan markets , franz said .
in recent months , the market for german exports had weakened in part due to the rising value of the euro against the dollar .
this happened long before the subprime market in the us collapsed this month and threw world markets into turmoil . analysts cautioned against overreaction to the zew data .

the new data has raised hopes among businesses that the european central bank wo n't its benchmark rate from a six-year high next month .
" if i could give advice to the ecb , it would be to keep rates stable , " the zew 's franz said , according to bloomberg news .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 21.08.2007 us housing crisis causes plunge in german business confidence großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : problems in the us housing industry are being felt in germany the us subprime crisis continues to affect the german economy .
an important index that measures business confidence dropped below zero tuesday on fears related to a lack of liquidity in financial markets . german businesses are afraid that the crisis in the united states housing industry will put the brakes on the euro-zone 's largest economy .
the zew research institute 's economic expectations index , based on a poll of 306 analysts and institutional investors , fell by 17.3 points to -6.9 points this month , according to a zew press release .
it is the first time since january that the index has fallen into negative territory .
the drop is even larger than the -5.0 analysts expected .
the index was at 10.4 points in july .
the recent decrease is a clear indication that experts expect the economy to lose its buoyancy .
a second index that measures institutional investors ' assessment of the actual business climate , also dropped more than expected .
it fell eight points to 80.2 points .
analysts had predicted it would fall to 84 points . in its continuing effort to ease subprime-related fears , the european central bank pumped 275 billion euros -lrb- $ 370.6 billion -rrb- - about 46 billion euros more than anticipated on monday - into money markets on tuesday .
the money was part of the frankfurt-based bank 's routine weekly financing . germany does n't face crisis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german market has reacted to bad news from abroad wolfgang franz , head of the mannheim-based zew , said despite the confidence drop , there 's no cause for alarm in germany .
" the crisis is first and foremost the unites states ' problem , " he told reporters .
" the possible impact on the german economy should , as far as we can tell , be limited . "
germany 's export-driven economy , however , could suffer if us consumers rein in their spending habits as a result of the crisis in their loan markets , franz said .
in recent months , the market for german exports had weakened in part due to the rising value of the euro against the dollar .
this happened long before the subprime market in the us collapsed this month and threw world markets into turmoil . analysts cautioned against overreaction to the zew data .
" the results published today do n't suggest an imminent recession , " brian mandt , an economist at postbank , told the afp news agency .
" they do however show that the risks to growth have increased . " ecb unlikely to raise rates bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ecb is expected to keep rates stable andreas rees of hvb / unicredit agreed .
" this is more a matter of psychology than fundamental facts , " he told afp .
" a meltdown for the german economy is not on the cards . "
the new data has raised hopes among businesses that the european central bank wo n't its benchmark rate from a six-year high next month .
" if i could give advice to the ecb , it would be to keep rates stable , " the zew 's franz said , according to bloomberg news .

an important index that measures business confidence dropped below zero tuesday on fears related to a lack of liquidity in financial markets . german businesses are afraid that the crisis in the united states housing industry will put the brakes on the euro-zone 's largest economy .
the zew research institute 's economic expectations index , based on a poll of 306 analysts and institutional investors , fell by 17.3 points to -6.9 points this month , according to a zew press release .
it is the first time since january that the index has fallen into negative territory .
the drop is even larger than the -5.0 analysts expected .
the index was at 10.4 points in july .
the recent decrease is a clear indication that experts expect the economy to lose its buoyancy .
a second index that measures institutional investors ' assessment of the actual business climate , also dropped more than expected .
it fell eight points to 80.2 points .
analysts had predicted it would fall to 84 points . in its continuing effort to ease subprime-related fears , the european central bank pumped 275 billion euros -lrb- $ 370.6 billion -rrb- - about 46 billion euros more than anticipated on monday - into money markets on tuesday .
the money was part of the frankfurt-based bank 's routine weekly financing . germany does n't face crisis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german market has reacted to bad news from abroad wolfgang franz , head of the mannheim-based zew , said despite the confidence drop , there 's no cause for alarm in germany .
" the crisis is first and foremost the unites states ' problem , " he told reporters .
" the possible impact on the german economy should , as far as we can tell , be limited . "
germany 's export-driven economy , however , could suffer if us consumers rein in their spending habits as a result of the crisis in their loan markets , franz said .
in recent months , the market for german exports had weakened in part due to the rising value of the euro against the dollar .
this happened long before the subprime market in the us collapsed this month and threw world markets into turmoil . analysts cautioned against overreaction to the zew data .
" the results published today do n't suggest an imminent recession , " brian mandt , an economist at postbank , told the afp news agency .
" they do however show that the risks to growth have increased . " ecb unlikely to raise rates bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ecb is expected to keep rates stable andreas rees of hvb / unicredit agreed .
" this is more a matter of psychology than fundamental facts , " he told afp .
" a meltdown for the german economy is not on the cards . "
the new data has raised hopes among businesses that the european central bank wo n't its benchmark rate from a six-year high next month .
" if i could give advice to the ecb , it would be to keep rates stable , " the zew 's franz said , according to bloomberg news .
" i think they should wait until this financial market turbulence passes . "
several large banks changed previous forecasts that the ecb would further increase rates this year , instead predicting that the rate will remain at 4 percent . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

quoting data from the country 's federal statistics agency , the organization said that the figures accounted for more than one in 10 of positions nationwide .
during the same period , 1,451 professorships had been lost at universities .
" improvement in the quality of our higher education system and study conditions is n't possible without a noticeable change in the proportion of 60 students per lecturer , which can not compete internationally , " dhv president bernhard kempen , a professor of law at the university of cologne , said in a press statement .
kempen called for germany 's federal and state governments to reinstate the 1,451 positions that had been eliminated . " with ever fewer professors , the system can not improve , " he said .
the dhv 's figures showed that the cuts were most extreme in the humanities , particularly in classical philology and education , which both lost around 35 percent of lecturers over the decade .
fewer teachers , more students bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the average student-teacher ratio at german universities is 60 to 1 both catholic and protestant theology had lost academic staff , by 18.9 and 20.7 percent respectively .

law , economics , social sciences and art history departments were the only ones to benefit from the creation of new positions .
the former three fields saw gains of 5.6 percent , while the increase in university lectureships in art history was 9.4 percent .
during the same time , the number of students had increased by 0.5 percent , said the dhv , which represents over 22,000 members .
in an academic ranking of the world 's universities released by jiao tong university in shanghai last week , germany 's two best universities , munich 's ludwig maximilians university and its technical university , only came in 53rd and 56th .
international comparisons carried out in recent years have consistently shown that germany 's educational system - from primary to secondary schooling - lags behind those of other industrialized nations . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

economists say the flat tax trend wo n't likely spread from eastern to western europe . when bulgaria 's institute for market economics -lrb- ime -rrb- began touting a flat tax system for the country in the 1990s , it was seen as a crazy free market idea that would never become reality .

bulgaria 's neighbors have launched a tax revolution , with a total of nine eastern european and former communist countries shunning progressive tax systems in favor of a simple , one-rate-fits-all model of taxation .
in bulgaria , flat taxes are no longer the exclusive domain of free market dreamers .
fresh from introducing a flat 10 percent tax on corporate profits , bulgaria 's socialist-led coalition government now wants to do the same for personal income . besides switching to a flat tax , the bulgarian government also wants to cut social insurance contributions by 3 percent and increase pensions by 10 percent .
details of the tax proposal are being debated within the governing coalition . fuel for economic transition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flat tax has been criticized as unfair to low wage earners svetla kostadinova , who heads the ime , a free market think tank based in sofia , said she 's confident that starting in 2008 bulgaria will have a flat tax in some form .
kostadinova said she thinks the flat tax will further fuel bulgaria 's economy and cut down on the informal economy , which is often used to avoid taxes .
" we think that the flat tax idea is a good approach for small transitional economies that want to reach european levels of income faster than the usual way , " kostadinova said .
" small countries more easily take such decisions . "

germany needs to ask itself whether it really is doing enough to fight right-wing extremism , says dw 's daniel scheschkewitz . anyone who has lived outside of germany for some time knows how alert people are to reports about racism and xenophobia in germany , especially when they involve physical violence .
and even more so when they occur in the part of germany considered a right-wing extremist stronghold , such as the region south of leipzig .
the brutal attack on eight indians in the small town of mügeln is all the more disturbing in view of the fact that anti-racist organizations have repeatedly pointed out how dangerous parts of eastern germany are for foreigners .
and in this case , there were n't even any indications that violent skinheads would go to the local fair .
luckily the eight indians got away with their lives .
but the trauma will remain - as will scars from the wounds inflicted on them by the mob that the police could only control by putting themselves in danger .
the investigation will have to determine the extent to which the violence was organized and whether it did indeed stem from neo-nazis .
but the shameful fact remains that the people of mügeln did not protect the foreigners .
the mayor 's statement that the guilty parties were n't locals ca n't change that .
clearly , things that our society simply can not tolerate remain possible even now , more than 10 years after the brutal attacks on asylum seekers in the eastern germany towns of hoyerswerda and rostock .
thus , it was good that georg milbradt , the premier of saxony , where mügeln is located , did n't hesitate for a moment to go there and find out for himself what had happened and to express his disgust .
but that 's not enough .
germany 's political authorities have to ask themselves whether enough is being done when it comes to education and prevention - in schools , in the social welfare system , but also in prosecuting cases and preventing crime .
and there must be more to it than preserving germany 's reputation abroad .
the soccer world cup showed last year that we are indeed a hospitable country that welcomes people of all skin colors and religious beliefs .
but germany must learn for its own sake to accept foreigners , and that must also happen in places where there are few jobs for germans .
another deplorable incident last weekend showed how far away from that state we in former west germany are : a german national soccer team player said he was called a " black pig " by an opposing team 's german goalkeeper .
that , too , is a scandal !
whether as the child of black african immigrants in the bundesliga or as an indian businessman in saxony , unfortunately people who are willing to become integrated in german society far too often run into barriers .
those who expect immigrants to be willing to integrate must also be prepared to protect them - from physical violence and verbal abuse .

economists say the flat tax trend wo n't likely spread from eastern to western europe . when bulgaria 's institute for market economics -lrb- ime -rrb- began touting a flat tax system for the country in the 1990s , it was seen as a crazy free market idea that would never become reality .
but a lot has changed in the past decade .
bulgaria 's neighbors have launched a tax revolution , with a total of nine eastern european and former communist countries shunning progressive tax systems in favor of a simple , one-rate-fits-all model of taxation .
in bulgaria , flat taxes are no longer the exclusive domain of free market dreamers .
fresh from introducing a flat 10 percent tax on corporate profits , bulgaria 's socialist-led coalition government now wants to do the same for personal income . besides switching to a flat tax , the bulgarian government also wants to cut social insurance contributions by 3 percent and increase pensions by 10 percent .
details of the tax proposal are being debated within the governing coalition . fuel for economic transition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flat tax has been criticized as unfair to low wage earners svetla kostadinova , who heads the ime , a free market think tank based in sofia , said she 's confident that starting in 2008 bulgaria will have a flat tax in some form .
kostadinova said she thinks the flat tax will further fuel bulgaria 's economy and cut down on the informal economy , which is often used to avoid taxes .
" we think that the flat tax idea is a good approach for small transitional economies that want to reach european levels of income faster than the usual way , " kostadinova said .
" small countries more easily take such decisions . "
with its 10 percent rate , bulgaria sits at the low end of the flat tax spectrum while lithuania 's 33 percent is at the top end .
estonia , latvia , russia , ukraine , slovakia , georgia and romania have also switched to flat tax systems in recent years .
it 's too soon to say how much of an economic boost eastern europe has gotten by switching to a flat tax , said dutch economist wouter den haan .
furthermore , flat tax schemes are only one part of the economic growth of eastern europe .
many have joined the european union and are realigning their economic policies to switch over to the euro .
czech government looks to shrink deficit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : different approaches in different eu countries the czech republic is launching major economic reforms to try and get its deficit under control .
part of its reform package includes a flat tax .
the ruling center-right coalition said if its tax reform package falls apart , it will seek an early election .
coalition leaders agreed to adopt a 15 percent personal income tax last week .
the rate would drop further to 12.5 percent in 2009 .
the income tax currently maxes out at 32 percent .
the government also wants to decrease the corporate tax rate to 21 percent in 2008 and down to 19 percent by 2010 .
a vote on the reform package is expected in the next week .
tax break or tax increase ?
but eastern europe is n't an economic miracle .
many countries face hefty current-account deficits and high inflation rates .
in bulgaria , there 's also been widespread concern in recent weeks that the flat taxes will hurt poor people and families .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bulgaria wants to add tax haven to its list of assets the average wage in bulgaria is 350 leva a month -lrb- 179 euros , $ 241 -rrb- .
people who make less than this amount , as well as freelancers , will pay more under the new tax system , the bulgarian media has reported .
there 's a common misconception that all forms of flat tax place undue burdens on the poor , said den haan , a professor at the university of amsterdam .
in many cases , only incomes above a certain threshold are taxed , which can make the system quite progressive , he added . while progressive income tax systems in western europe are aimed at taxing the wealthy at higher rates than the poor , it often does n't work out that way .
" our current tax system is n't as progressive as people think , " den haan said .
" that 's because of all the tax deductions . "
western europe remains skeptical bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will taxes ever be this easy ?
western europeans looking to get rid of a complicated system of tax deductions and exclusions , however , are unlikely to see a flat tax any time soon , economists said .
friedrich merz , a german financial expert with the center-right christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , declared a few years back that taxes should be simple enough to fit on back side of a beer coaster .
even so , it remains likely that europe 's pension systems will keeps its largest economies form adopting a flat tax .
most countries in western europe have long-standing social security systems which are funded by the redistribution that comes from progressive tax systems that get higher revenues from the rich , said linda yueh , a visiting professor at the london business school . " to some people , including some views from western europe , a flat tax is a free market mechanism because there 's no redistributive aim , " yueh said .
taxpayers also like the idea of exemptions and the feeling of getting money back from the government , den haan said , adding that people can see how specific exemptions benefit them and do n't want to lose those benefits . trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

fresh from introducing a flat 10 percent tax on corporate profits , bulgaria 's socialist-led coalition government now wants to do the same for personal income . besides switching to a flat tax , the bulgarian government also wants to cut social insurance contributions by 3 percent and increase pensions by 10 percent .

kostadinova said she thinks the flat tax will further fuel bulgaria 's economy and cut down on the informal economy , which is often used to avoid taxes .
" we think that the flat tax idea is a good approach for small transitional economies that want to reach european levels of income faster than the usual way , " kostadinova said .

germany needs to ask itself whether it really is doing enough to fight right-wing extremism , says dw 's daniel scheschkewitz . anyone who has lived outside of germany for some time knows how alert people are to reports about racism and xenophobia in germany , especially when they involve physical violence .
and even more so when they occur in the part of germany considered a right-wing extremist stronghold , such as the region south of leipzig .
the brutal attack on eight indians in the small town of mügeln is all the more disturbing in view of the fact that anti-racist organizations have repeatedly pointed out how dangerous parts of eastern germany are for foreigners .
and in this case , there were n't even any indications that violent skinheads would go to the local fair .
luckily the eight indians got away with their lives .
but the trauma will remain - as will scars from the wounds inflicted on them by the mob that the police could only control by putting themselves in danger .
the investigation will have to determine the extent to which the violence was organized and whether it did indeed stem from neo-nazis .
but the shameful fact remains that the people of mügeln did not protect the foreigners .
the mayor 's statement that the guilty parties were n't locals ca n't change that .
clearly , things that our society simply can not tolerate remain possible even now , more than 10 years after the brutal attacks on asylum seekers in the eastern germany towns of hoyerswerda and rostock .
thus , it was good that georg milbradt , the premier of saxony , where mügeln is located , did n't hesitate for a moment to go there and find out for himself what had happened and to express his disgust .
but that 's not enough .
germany 's political authorities have to ask themselves whether enough is being done when it comes to education and prevention - in schools , in the social welfare system , but also in prosecuting cases and preventing crime .
and there must be more to it than preserving germany 's reputation abroad .
the soccer world cup showed last year that we are indeed a hospitable country that welcomes people of all skin colors and religious beliefs .
but germany must learn for its own sake to accept foreigners , and that must also happen in places where there are few jobs for germans .
another deplorable incident last weekend showed how far away from that state we in former west germany are : a german national soccer team player said he was called a " black pig " by an opposing team 's german goalkeeper .
that , too , is a scandal !
whether as the child of black african immigrants in the bundesliga or as an indian businessman in saxony , unfortunately people who are willing to become integrated in german society far too often run into barriers .
those who expect immigrants to be willing to integrate must also be prepared to protect them - from physical violence and verbal abuse .

western europeans looking to get rid of a complicated system of tax deductions and exclusions , however , are unlikely to see a flat tax any time soon , economists said .

even so , it remains likely that europe 's pension systems will keeps its largest economies form adopting a flat tax .
most countries in western europe have long-standing social security systems which are funded by the redistribution that comes from progressive tax systems that get higher revenues from the rich , said linda yueh , a visiting professor at the london business school . " to some people , including some views from western europe , a flat tax is a free market mechanism because there 's no redistributive aim , " yueh said .
taxpayers also like the idea of exemptions and the feeling of getting money back from the government , den haan said , adding that people can see how specific exemptions benefit them and do n't want to lose those benefits . trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it 's the first time germany has permitted the use of marijuana for medicinal purposes . germany ' süddeutsche zeitung reported on tuesday that the german federal institute for drugs and medical devices for the first time approved the application of a 51-year-old woman suffering from multiple sclerosis to legally buy cannabis from a pharmacy to ease her symptoms . the approval is linked to strict restrictions , but starting at the end of august , the woman , claudia h , is allowed to buy a " standardized extract " from the cannabis plant from the pharmacy for a year .
a doctor has to monitor the therapy .
in addition , both the patient and the pharmacy have to store the drug extracts in a safe so to prevent theft . cannabis shown to ease pain according to the munich-based paper , several scientific studies show that cannabis can ease pain and spasms often associated with multiple sclerosis , a debilitating nerve ailment .
it 's also known to prevent weight loss among cancer and aids patients . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : studies have show that extracts from the cannabis plant have medicinal properties so far , cannabis has been illegal in germany - only possession of small amounts of the drug are allowed - and its use for medicinal purposes limited to scientific studies and aims that " are in the public interest . " doctors so far can only prescribe the synthetically-produced dronabinol , which is an active ingredient in cannabis .
but since the substance is n't approved as a medicine in germany , the medicine 's costs are n't covered by health insurance .
in contrast , the price of the direct cannabis medicine is expected to be much cheaper . cannabis remains illegal in 2005 , a court ruling threw into question the complete ban on cannabis for medicinal purposes .
the german federal administrative court ruled that the health of individual patients also lay in " the public interest . "
that means that the bonn-based federal institute for drugs and medical devices now has to consider each application for use of cannabis for medicinal purposes on a case-by-case basis . despite tuesday 's landmark decision to allow cannabis for treatment , the drug remains illegal in future .
patients who acquire it on their own risk prosecution .

an important index that measures business confidence dropped below zero tuesday on fears related to a lack of liquidity in financial markets . german businesses are afraid that the crisis in the united states housing industry will put the brakes on the euro-zone 's largest economy .
the zew research institute 's economic expectations index , based on a poll of 306 analysts and institutional investors , fell by 17.3 points to -6.9 points this month , according to a zew press release .
it is the first time since january that the index has fallen into negative territory .
the drop is even larger than the -5.0 analysts expected .
the index was at 10.4 points in july .
the recent decrease is a clear indication that experts expect the economy to lose its buoyancy .
a second index that measures institutional investors ' assessment of the actual business climate , also dropped more than expected .
it fell eight points to 80.2 points .
analysts had predicted it would fall to 84 points . in its continuing effort to ease subprime-related fears , the european central bank pumped 275 billion euros -lrb- $ 370.6 billion -rrb- - about 46 billion euros more than anticipated on monday - into money markets on tuesday .
the money was part of the frankfurt-based bank 's routine weekly financing . germany does n't face crisis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german market has reacted to bad news from abroad wolfgang franz , head of the mannheim-based zew , said despite the confidence drop , there 's no cause for alarm in germany .
" the crisis is first and foremost the unites states ' problem , " he told reporters .
" the possible impact on the german economy should , as far as we can tell , be limited . "
germany 's export-driven economy , however , could suffer if us consumers rein in their spending habits as a result of the crisis in their loan markets , franz said .
in recent months , the market for german exports had weakened in part due to the rising value of the euro against the dollar .
this happened long before the subprime market in the us collapsed this month and threw world markets into turmoil . analysts cautioned against overreaction to the zew data .
" the results published today do n't suggest an imminent recession , " brian mandt , an economist at postbank , told the afp news agency .
" they do however show that the risks to growth have increased . " ecb unlikely to raise rates bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ecb is expected to keep rates stable andreas rees of hvb / unicredit agreed .
" this is more a matter of psychology than fundamental facts , " he told afp .
" a meltdown for the german economy is not on the cards . "
the new data has raised hopes among businesses that the european central bank wo n't its benchmark rate from a six-year high next month .
" if i could give advice to the ecb , it would be to keep rates stable , " the zew 's franz said , according to bloomberg news .
" i think they should wait until this financial market turbulence passes . "
several large banks changed previous forecasts that the ecb would further increase rates this year , instead predicting that the rate will remain at 4 percent . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de extremism -pipe- 21.08.2007 opinion : germany must protect its foreigners großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eight indians were attacked by a violent mob in a village in the state of saxony .
germany needs to ask itself whether it really is doing enough to fight right-wing extremism , says dw 's daniel scheschkewitz . anyone who has lived outside of germany for some time knows how alert people are to reports about racism and xenophobia in germany , especially when they involve physical violence .
and even more so when they occur in the part of germany considered a right-wing extremist stronghold , such as the region south of leipzig .
the brutal attack on eight indians in the small town of mügeln is all the more disturbing in view of the fact that anti-racist organizations have repeatedly pointed out how dangerous parts of eastern germany are for foreigners .
and in this case , there were n't even any indications that violent skinheads would go to the local fair .
luckily the eight indians got away with their lives .
but the trauma will remain - as will scars from the wounds inflicted on them by the mob that the police could only control by putting themselves in danger .
the investigation will have to determine the extent to which the violence was organized and whether it did indeed stem from neo-nazis .
but the shameful fact remains that the people of mügeln did not protect the foreigners .
the mayor 's statement that the guilty parties were n't locals ca n't change that .
clearly , things that our society simply can not tolerate remain possible even now , more than 10 years after the brutal attacks on asylum seekers in the eastern germany towns of hoyerswerda and rostock .
thus , it was good that georg milbradt , the premier of saxony , where mügeln is located , did n't hesitate for a moment to go there and find out for himself what had happened and to express his disgust .
but that 's not enough .
germany 's political authorities have to ask themselves whether enough is being done when it comes to education and prevention - in schools , in the social welfare system , but also in prosecuting cases and preventing crime .
and there must be more to it than preserving germany 's reputation abroad .
the soccer world cup showed last year that we are indeed a hospitable country that welcomes people of all skin colors and religious beliefs .
but germany must learn for its own sake to accept foreigners , and that must also happen in places where there are few jobs for germans .
another deplorable incident last weekend showed how far away from that state we in former west germany are : a german national soccer team player said he was called a " black pig " by an opposing team 's german goalkeeper .
that , too , is a scandal !
whether as the child of black african immigrants in the bundesliga or as an indian businessman in saxony , unfortunately people who are willing to become integrated in german society far too often run into barriers .
those who expect immigrants to be willing to integrate must also be prepared to protect them - from physical violence and verbal abuse .

the german federal administrative court ruled that the health of individual patients also lay in " the public interest . "
that means that the bonn-based federal institute for drugs and medical devices now has to consider each application for use of cannabis for medicinal purposes on a case-by-case basis . despite tuesday 's landmark decision to allow cannabis for treatment , the drug remains illegal in future .

economists say the flat tax trend wo n't likely spread from eastern to western europe . when bulgaria 's institute for market economics -lrb- ime -rrb- began touting a flat tax system for the country in the 1990s , it was seen as a crazy free market idea that would never become reality .
but a lot has changed in the past decade .
bulgaria 's neighbors have launched a tax revolution , with a total of nine eastern european and former communist countries shunning progressive tax systems in favor of a simple , one-rate-fits-all model of taxation .
in bulgaria , flat taxes are no longer the exclusive domain of free market dreamers .
fresh from introducing a flat 10 percent tax on corporate profits , bulgaria 's socialist-led coalition government now wants to do the same for personal income . besides switching to a flat tax , the bulgarian government also wants to cut social insurance contributions by 3 percent and increase pensions by 10 percent .
details of the tax proposal are being debated within the governing coalition . fuel for economic transition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flat tax has been criticized as unfair to low wage earners svetla kostadinova , who heads the ime , a free market think tank based in sofia , said she 's confident that starting in 2008 bulgaria will have a flat tax in some form .
kostadinova said she thinks the flat tax will further fuel bulgaria 's economy and cut down on the informal economy , which is often used to avoid taxes .
" we think that the flat tax idea is a good approach for small transitional economies that want to reach european levels of income faster than the usual way , " kostadinova said .
" small countries more easily take such decisions . "
with its 10 percent rate , bulgaria sits at the low end of the flat tax spectrum while lithuania 's 33 percent is at the top end .
estonia , latvia , russia , ukraine , slovakia , georgia and romania have also switched to flat tax systems in recent years .
it 's too soon to say how much of an economic boost eastern europe has gotten by switching to a flat tax , said dutch economist wouter den haan .
furthermore , flat tax schemes are only one part of the economic growth of eastern europe .
many have joined the european union and are realigning their economic policies to switch over to the euro .
czech government looks to shrink deficit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : different approaches in different eu countries the czech republic is launching major economic reforms to try and get its deficit under control .
part of its reform package includes a flat tax .
the ruling center-right coalition said if its tax reform package falls apart , it will seek an early election .
coalition leaders agreed to adopt a 15 percent personal income tax last week .
the rate would drop further to 12.5 percent in 2009 .
the income tax currently maxes out at 32 percent .
the government also wants to decrease the corporate tax rate to 21 percent in 2008 and down to 19 percent by 2010 .
a vote on the reform package is expected in the next week .
tax break or tax increase ?

there 's a common misconception that all forms of flat tax place undue burdens on the poor , said den haan , a professor at the university of amsterdam .
in many cases , only incomes above a certain threshold are taxed , which can make the system quite progressive , he added . while progressive income tax systems in western europe are aimed at taxing the wealthy at higher rates than the poor , it often does n't work out that way .
" our current tax system is n't as progressive as people think , " den haan said .
" that 's because of all the tax deductions . "
western europe remains skeptical bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will taxes ever be this easy ?

germany needs to ask itself whether it really is doing enough to fight right-wing extremism , says dw 's daniel scheschkewitz . anyone who has lived outside of germany for some time knows how alert people are to reports about racism and xenophobia in germany , especially when they involve physical violence .
and even more so when they occur in the part of germany considered a right-wing extremist stronghold , such as the region south of leipzig .
the brutal attack on eight indians in the small town of mügeln is all the more disturbing in view of the fact that anti-racist organizations have repeatedly pointed out how dangerous parts of eastern germany are for foreigners .
and in this case , there were n't even any indications that violent skinheads would go to the local fair .
luckily the eight indians got away with their lives .
but the trauma will remain - as will scars from the wounds inflicted on them by the mob that the police could only control by putting themselves in danger .
the investigation will have to determine the extent to which the violence was organized and whether it did indeed stem from neo-nazis .
but the shameful fact remains that the people of mügeln did not protect the foreigners .
the mayor 's statement that the guilty parties were n't locals ca n't change that .
clearly , things that our society simply can not tolerate remain possible even now , more than 10 years after the brutal attacks on asylum seekers in the eastern germany towns of hoyerswerda and rostock .
thus , it was good that georg milbradt , the premier of saxony , where mügeln is located , did n't hesitate for a moment to go there and find out for himself what had happened and to express his disgust .
but that 's not enough .
germany 's political authorities have to ask themselves whether enough is being done when it comes to education and prevention - in schools , in the social welfare system , but also in prosecuting cases and preventing crime .
and there must be more to it than preserving germany 's reputation abroad .
the soccer world cup showed last year that we are indeed a hospitable country that welcomes people of all skin colors and religious beliefs .
but germany must learn for its own sake to accept foreigners , and that must also happen in places where there are few jobs for germans .
another deplorable incident last weekend showed how far away from that state we in former west germany are : a german national soccer team player said he was called a " black pig " by an opposing team 's german goalkeeper .
that , too , is a scandal !
whether as the child of black african immigrants in the bundesliga or as an indian businessman in saxony , unfortunately people who are willing to become integrated in german society far too often run into barriers .
those who expect immigrants to be willing to integrate must also be prepared to protect them - from physical violence and verbal abuse .

quoting data from the country 's federal statistics agency , the organization said that the figures accounted for more than one in 10 of positions nationwide .
during the same period , 1,451 professorships had been lost at universities .
" improvement in the quality of our higher education system and study conditions is n't possible without a noticeable change in the proportion of 60 students per lecturer , which can not compete internationally , " dhv president bernhard kempen , a professor of law at the university of cologne , said in a press statement .
kempen called for germany 's federal and state governments to reinstate the 1,451 positions that had been eliminated . " with ever fewer professors , the system can not improve , " he said .
the dhv 's figures showed that the cuts were most extreme in the humanities , particularly in classical philology and education , which both lost around 35 percent of lecturers over the decade .
fewer teachers , more students bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the average student-teacher ratio at german universities is 60 to 1 both catholic and protestant theology had lost academic staff , by 18.9 and 20.7 percent respectively .

law , economics , social sciences and art history departments were the only ones to benefit from the creation of new positions .
the former three fields saw gains of 5.6 percent , while the increase in university lectureships in art history was 9.4 percent .
during the same time , the number of students had increased by 0.5 percent , said the dhv , which represents over 22,000 members .
in an academic ranking of the world 's universities released by jiao tong university in shanghai last week , germany 's two best universities , munich 's ludwig maximilians university and its technical university , only came in 53rd and 56th .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de taxes -pipe- 21.08.2007 eastern europeans eyeing flat tax großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tax time is much different in eastern europe bulgaria and the czech republic have proposed doing away with exemptions , deductions and loopholes in favor of a flat tax .
economists say the flat tax trend wo n't likely spread from eastern to western europe . when bulgaria 's institute for market economics -lrb- ime -rrb- began touting a flat tax system for the country in the 1990s , it was seen as a crazy free market idea that would never become reality .
but a lot has changed in the past decade .
bulgaria 's neighbors have launched a tax revolution , with a total of nine eastern european and former communist countries shunning progressive tax systems in favor of a simple , one-rate-fits-all model of taxation .
in bulgaria , flat taxes are no longer the exclusive domain of free market dreamers .
fresh from introducing a flat 10 percent tax on corporate profits , bulgaria 's socialist-led coalition government now wants to do the same for personal income . besides switching to a flat tax , the bulgarian government also wants to cut social insurance contributions by 3 percent and increase pensions by 10 percent .
details of the tax proposal are being debated within the governing coalition . fuel for economic transition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flat tax has been criticized as unfair to low wage earners svetla kostadinova , who heads the ime , a free market think tank based in sofia , said she 's confident that starting in 2008 bulgaria will have a flat tax in some form .
kostadinova said she thinks the flat tax will further fuel bulgaria 's economy and cut down on the informal economy , which is often used to avoid taxes .
" we think that the flat tax idea is a good approach for small transitional economies that want to reach european levels of income faster than the usual way , " kostadinova said .
" small countries more easily take such decisions . "
with its 10 percent rate , bulgaria sits at the low end of the flat tax spectrum while lithuania 's 33 percent is at the top end .
estonia , latvia , russia , ukraine , slovakia , georgia and romania have also switched to flat tax systems in recent years .
it 's too soon to say how much of an economic boost eastern europe has gotten by switching to a flat tax , said dutch economist wouter den haan .
furthermore , flat tax schemes are only one part of the economic growth of eastern europe .
many have joined the european union and are realigning their economic policies to switch over to the euro .
czech government looks to shrink deficit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : different approaches in different eu countries the czech republic is launching major economic reforms to try and get its deficit under control .
part of its reform package includes a flat tax .
the ruling center-right coalition said if its tax reform package falls apart , it will seek an early election .
coalition leaders agreed to adopt a 15 percent personal income tax last week .
the rate would drop further to 12.5 percent in 2009 .
the income tax currently maxes out at 32 percent .
the government also wants to decrease the corporate tax rate to 21 percent in 2008 and down to 19 percent by 2010 .
a vote on the reform package is expected in the next week .
tax break or tax increase ?
but eastern europe is n't an economic miracle .
many countries face hefty current-account deficits and high inflation rates .
in bulgaria , there 's also been widespread concern in recent weeks that the flat taxes will hurt poor people and families .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bulgaria wants to add tax haven to its list of assets the average wage in bulgaria is 350 leva a month -lrb- 179 euros , $ 241 -rrb- .
people who make less than this amount , as well as freelancers , will pay more under the new tax system , the bulgarian media has reported .
there 's a common misconception that all forms of flat tax place undue burdens on the poor , said den haan , a professor at the university of amsterdam .
in many cases , only incomes above a certain threshold are taxed , which can make the system quite progressive , he added . while progressive income tax systems in western europe are aimed at taxing the wealthy at higher rates than the poor , it often does n't work out that way .
" our current tax system is n't as progressive as people think , " den haan said .
" that 's because of all the tax deductions . "
western europe remains skeptical bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will taxes ever be this easy ?
western europeans looking to get rid of a complicated system of tax deductions and exclusions , however , are unlikely to see a flat tax any time soon , economists said .
friedrich merz , a german financial expert with the center-right christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , declared a few years back that taxes should be simple enough to fit on back side of a beer coaster .
even so , it remains likely that europe 's pension systems will keeps its largest economies form adopting a flat tax .
most countries in western europe have long-standing social security systems which are funded by the redistribution that comes from progressive tax systems that get higher revenues from the rich , said linda yueh , a visiting professor at the london business school . " to some people , including some views from western europe , a flat tax is a free market mechanism because there 's no redistributive aim , " yueh said .
taxpayers also like the idea of exemptions and the feeling of getting money back from the government , den haan said , adding that people can see how specific exemptions benefit them and do n't want to lose those benefits . trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

an important index that measures business confidence dropped below zero tuesday on fears related to a lack of liquidity in financial markets . german businesses are afraid that the crisis in the united states housing industry will put the brakes on the euro-zone 's largest economy .
the zew research institute 's economic expectations index , based on a poll of 306 analysts and institutional investors , fell by 17.3 points to -6.9 points this month , according to a zew press release .
it is the first time since january that the index has fallen into negative territory .
the drop is even larger than the -5.0 analysts expected .
the index was at 10.4 points in july .
the recent decrease is a clear indication that experts expect the economy to lose its buoyancy .
a second index that measures institutional investors ' assessment of the actual business climate , also dropped more than expected .
it fell eight points to 80.2 points .
analysts had predicted it would fall to 84 points . in its continuing effort to ease subprime-related fears , the european central bank pumped 275 billion euros -lrb- $ 370.6 billion -rrb- - about 46 billion euros more than anticipated on monday - into money markets on tuesday .

" the possible impact on the german economy should , as far as we can tell , be limited . "
germany 's export-driven economy , however , could suffer if us consumers rein in their spending habits as a result of the crisis in their loan markets , franz said .
in recent months , the market for german exports had weakened in part due to the rising value of the euro against the dollar .
this happened long before the subprime market in the us collapsed this month and threw world markets into turmoil . analysts cautioned against overreaction to the zew data .

the new data has raised hopes among businesses that the european central bank wo n't its benchmark rate from a six-year high next month .
" if i could give advice to the ecb , it would be to keep rates stable , " the zew 's franz said , according to bloomberg news .

an important index that measures business confidence dropped below zero tuesday on fears related to a lack of liquidity in financial markets . german businesses are afraid that the crisis in the united states housing industry will put the brakes on the euro-zone 's largest economy .
the zew research institute 's economic expectations index , based on a poll of 306 analysts and institutional investors , fell by 17.3 points to -6.9 points this month , according to a zew press release .
it is the first time since january that the index has fallen into negative territory .
the drop is even larger than the -5.0 analysts expected .
the index was at 10.4 points in july .
the recent decrease is a clear indication that experts expect the economy to lose its buoyancy .
a second index that measures institutional investors ' assessment of the actual business climate , also dropped more than expected .
it fell eight points to 80.2 points .
analysts had predicted it would fall to 84 points . in its continuing effort to ease subprime-related fears , the european central bank pumped 275 billion euros -lrb- $ 370.6 billion -rrb- - about 46 billion euros more than anticipated on monday - into money markets on tuesday .
the money was part of the frankfurt-based bank 's routine weekly financing . germany does n't face crisis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german market has reacted to bad news from abroad wolfgang franz , head of the mannheim-based zew , said despite the confidence drop , there 's no cause for alarm in germany .
" the crisis is first and foremost the unites states ' problem , " he told reporters .
" the possible impact on the german economy should , as far as we can tell , be limited . "
germany 's export-driven economy , however , could suffer if us consumers rein in their spending habits as a result of the crisis in their loan markets , franz said .
in recent months , the market for german exports had weakened in part due to the rising value of the euro against the dollar .
this happened long before the subprime market in the us collapsed this month and threw world markets into turmoil . analysts cautioned against overreaction to the zew data .
" the results published today do n't suggest an imminent recession , " brian mandt , an economist at postbank , told the afp news agency .

" a meltdown for the german economy is not on the cards . "
the new data has raised hopes among businesses that the european central bank wo n't its benchmark rate from a six-year high next month .

germany needs to ask itself whether it really is doing enough to fight right-wing extremism , says dw 's daniel scheschkewitz . anyone who has lived outside of germany for some time knows how alert people are to reports about racism and xenophobia in germany , especially when they involve physical violence .
and even more so when they occur in the part of germany considered a right-wing extremist stronghold , such as the region south of leipzig .
the brutal attack on eight indians in the small town of mügeln is all the more disturbing in view of the fact that anti-racist organizations have repeatedly pointed out how dangerous parts of eastern germany are for foreigners .
and in this case , there were n't even any indications that violent skinheads would go to the local fair .
luckily the eight indians got away with their lives .
but the trauma will remain - as will scars from the wounds inflicted on them by the mob that the police could only control by putting themselves in danger .
the investigation will have to determine the extent to which the violence was organized and whether it did indeed stem from neo-nazis .
but the shameful fact remains that the people of mügeln did not protect the foreigners .
the mayor 's statement that the guilty parties were n't locals ca n't change that .
clearly , things that our society simply can not tolerate remain possible even now , more than 10 years after the brutal attacks on asylum seekers in the eastern germany towns of hoyerswerda and rostock .
thus , it was good that georg milbradt , the premier of saxony , where mügeln is located , did n't hesitate for a moment to go there and find out for himself what had happened and to express his disgust .
but that 's not enough .
germany 's political authorities have to ask themselves whether enough is being done when it comes to education and prevention - in schools , in the social welfare system , but also in prosecuting cases and preventing crime .
and there must be more to it than preserving germany 's reputation abroad .
the soccer world cup showed last year that we are indeed a hospitable country that welcomes people of all skin colors and religious beliefs .
but germany must learn for its own sake to accept foreigners , and that must also happen in places where there are few jobs for germans .
another deplorable incident last weekend showed how far away from that state we in former west germany are : a german national soccer team player said he was called a " black pig " by an opposing team 's german goalkeeper .
that , too , is a scandal !
whether as the child of black african immigrants in the bundesliga or as an indian businessman in saxony , unfortunately people who are willing to become integrated in german society far too often run into barriers .
those who expect immigrants to be willing to integrate must also be prepared to protect them - from physical violence and verbal abuse .

economists say the flat tax trend wo n't likely spread from eastern to western europe . when bulgaria 's institute for market economics -lrb- ime -rrb- began touting a flat tax system for the country in the 1990s , it was seen as a crazy free market idea that would never become reality .
but a lot has changed in the past decade .
bulgaria 's neighbors have launched a tax revolution , with a total of nine eastern european and former communist countries shunning progressive tax systems in favor of a simple , one-rate-fits-all model of taxation .
in bulgaria , flat taxes are no longer the exclusive domain of free market dreamers .
fresh from introducing a flat 10 percent tax on corporate profits , bulgaria 's socialist-led coalition government now wants to do the same for personal income . besides switching to a flat tax , the bulgarian government also wants to cut social insurance contributions by 3 percent and increase pensions by 10 percent .
details of the tax proposal are being debated within the governing coalition . fuel for economic transition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flat tax has been criticized as unfair to low wage earners svetla kostadinova , who heads the ime , a free market think tank based in sofia , said she 's confident that starting in 2008 bulgaria will have a flat tax in some form .
kostadinova said she thinks the flat tax will further fuel bulgaria 's economy and cut down on the informal economy , which is often used to avoid taxes .
" we think that the flat tax idea is a good approach for small transitional economies that want to reach european levels of income faster than the usual way , " kostadinova said .
" small countries more easily take such decisions . "
with its 10 percent rate , bulgaria sits at the low end of the flat tax spectrum while lithuania 's 33 percent is at the top end .
estonia , latvia , russia , ukraine , slovakia , georgia and romania have also switched to flat tax systems in recent years .
it 's too soon to say how much of an economic boost eastern europe has gotten by switching to a flat tax , said dutch economist wouter den haan .
furthermore , flat tax schemes are only one part of the economic growth of eastern europe .
many have joined the european union and are realigning their economic policies to switch over to the euro .
czech government looks to shrink deficit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : different approaches in different eu countries the czech republic is launching major economic reforms to try and get its deficit under control .
part of its reform package includes a flat tax .
the ruling center-right coalition said if its tax reform package falls apart , it will seek an early election .
coalition leaders agreed to adopt a 15 percent personal income tax last week .
the rate would drop further to 12.5 percent in 2009 .
the income tax currently maxes out at 32 percent .
the government also wants to decrease the corporate tax rate to 21 percent in 2008 and down to 19 percent by 2010 .
a vote on the reform package is expected in the next week .
tax break or tax increase ?
but eastern europe is n't an economic miracle .
many countries face hefty current-account deficits and high inflation rates .
in bulgaria , there 's also been widespread concern in recent weeks that the flat taxes will hurt poor people and families .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bulgaria wants to add tax haven to its list of assets the average wage in bulgaria is 350 leva a month -lrb- 179 euros , $ 241 -rrb- .
people who make less than this amount , as well as freelancers , will pay more under the new tax system , the bulgarian media has reported .
there 's a common misconception that all forms of flat tax place undue burdens on the poor , said den haan , a professor at the university of amsterdam .
in many cases , only incomes above a certain threshold are taxed , which can make the system quite progressive , he added . while progressive income tax systems in western europe are aimed at taxing the wealthy at higher rates than the poor , it often does n't work out that way .
" our current tax system is n't as progressive as people think , " den haan said .
" that 's because of all the tax deductions . "
western europe remains skeptical bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will taxes ever be this easy ?
western europeans looking to get rid of a complicated system of tax deductions and exclusions , however , are unlikely to see a flat tax any time soon , economists said .
friedrich merz , a german financial expert with the center-right christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , declared a few years back that taxes should be simple enough to fit on back side of a beer coaster .
even so , it remains likely that europe 's pension systems will keeps its largest economies form adopting a flat tax .
most countries in western europe have long-standing social security systems which are funded by the redistribution that comes from progressive tax systems that get higher revenues from the rich , said linda yueh , a visiting professor at the london business school . " to some people , including some views from western europe , a flat tax is a free market mechanism because there 's no redistributive aim , " yueh said .
taxpayers also like the idea of exemptions and the feeling of getting money back from the government , den haan said , adding that people can see how specific exemptions benefit them and do n't want to lose those benefits . trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

an important index that measures business confidence dropped below zero tuesday on fears related to a lack of liquidity in financial markets . german businesses are afraid that the crisis in the united states housing industry will put the brakes on the euro-zone 's largest economy .
the zew research institute 's economic expectations index , based on a poll of 306 analysts and institutional investors , fell by 17.3 points to -6.9 points this month , according to a zew press release .
it is the first time since january that the index has fallen into negative territory .
the drop is even larger than the -5.0 analysts expected .
the index was at 10.4 points in july .
the recent decrease is a clear indication that experts expect the economy to lose its buoyancy .
a second index that measures institutional investors ' assessment of the actual business climate , also dropped more than expected .
it fell eight points to 80.2 points .
analysts had predicted it would fall to 84 points . in its continuing effort to ease subprime-related fears , the european central bank pumped 275 billion euros -lrb- $ 370.6 billion -rrb- - about 46 billion euros more than anticipated on monday - into money markets on tuesday .
the money was part of the frankfurt-based bank 's routine weekly financing . germany does n't face crisis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german market has reacted to bad news from abroad wolfgang franz , head of the mannheim-based zew , said despite the confidence drop , there 's no cause for alarm in germany .

" the possible impact on the german economy should , as far as we can tell , be limited . "
germany 's export-driven economy , however , could suffer if us consumers rein in their spending habits as a result of the crisis in their loan markets , franz said .
in recent months , the market for german exports had weakened in part due to the rising value of the euro against the dollar .
this happened long before the subprime market in the us collapsed this month and threw world markets into turmoil . analysts cautioned against overreaction to the zew data .
" the results published today do n't suggest an imminent recession , " brian mandt , an economist at postbank , told the afp news agency .
" they do however show that the risks to growth have increased . " ecb unlikely to raise rates bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ecb is expected to keep rates stable andreas rees of hvb / unicredit agreed .

" a meltdown for the german economy is not on the cards . "
the new data has raised hopes among businesses that the european central bank wo n't its benchmark rate from a six-year high next month .
" if i could give advice to the ecb , it would be to keep rates stable , " the zew 's franz said , according to bloomberg news .
" i think they should wait until this financial market turbulence passes . "

it 's the first time germany has permitted the use of marijuana for medicinal purposes . germany ' süddeutsche zeitung reported on tuesday that the german federal institute for drugs and medical devices for the first time approved the application of a 51-year-old woman suffering from multiple sclerosis to legally buy cannabis from a pharmacy to ease her symptoms . the approval is linked to strict restrictions , but starting at the end of august , the woman , claudia h , is allowed to buy a " standardized extract " from the cannabis plant from the pharmacy for a year .
a doctor has to monitor the therapy .
in addition , both the patient and the pharmacy have to store the drug extracts in a safe so to prevent theft . cannabis shown to ease pain according to the munich-based paper , several scientific studies show that cannabis can ease pain and spasms often associated with multiple sclerosis , a debilitating nerve ailment .
it 's also known to prevent weight loss among cancer and aids patients . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : studies have show that extracts from the cannabis plant have medicinal properties so far , cannabis has been illegal in germany - only possession of small amounts of the drug are allowed - and its use for medicinal purposes limited to scientific studies and aims that " are in the public interest . " doctors so far can only prescribe the synthetically-produced dronabinol , which is an active ingredient in cannabis .
but since the substance is n't approved as a medicine in germany , the medicine 's costs are n't covered by health insurance .
in contrast , the price of the direct cannabis medicine is expected to be much cheaper . cannabis remains illegal in 2005 , a court ruling threw into question the complete ban on cannabis for medicinal purposes .
the german federal administrative court ruled that the health of individual patients also lay in " the public interest . "
that means that the bonn-based federal institute for drugs and medical devices now has to consider each application for use of cannabis for medicinal purposes on a case-by-case basis . despite tuesday 's landmark decision to allow cannabis for treatment , the drug remains illegal in future .
patients who acquire it on their own risk prosecution .

an important index that measures business confidence dropped below zero tuesday on fears related to a lack of liquidity in financial markets . german businesses are afraid that the crisis in the united states housing industry will put the brakes on the euro-zone 's largest economy .
the zew research institute 's economic expectations index , based on a poll of 306 analysts and institutional investors , fell by 17.3 points to -6.9 points this month , according to a zew press release .
it is the first time since january that the index has fallen into negative territory .
the drop is even larger than the -5.0 analysts expected .
the index was at 10.4 points in july .
the recent decrease is a clear indication that experts expect the economy to lose its buoyancy .
a second index that measures institutional investors ' assessment of the actual business climate , also dropped more than expected .
it fell eight points to 80.2 points .
analysts had predicted it would fall to 84 points . in its continuing effort to ease subprime-related fears , the european central bank pumped 275 billion euros -lrb- $ 370.6 billion -rrb- - about 46 billion euros more than anticipated on monday - into money markets on tuesday .
the money was part of the frankfurt-based bank 's routine weekly financing . germany does n't face crisis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german market has reacted to bad news from abroad wolfgang franz , head of the mannheim-based zew , said despite the confidence drop , there 's no cause for alarm in germany .
" the crisis is first and foremost the unites states ' problem , " he told reporters .
" the possible impact on the german economy should , as far as we can tell , be limited . "
germany 's export-driven economy , however , could suffer if us consumers rein in their spending habits as a result of the crisis in their loan markets , franz said .
in recent months , the market for german exports had weakened in part due to the rising value of the euro against the dollar .
this happened long before the subprime market in the us collapsed this month and threw world markets into turmoil . analysts cautioned against overreaction to the zew data .
" the results published today do n't suggest an imminent recession , " brian mandt , an economist at postbank , told the afp news agency .
" they do however show that the risks to growth have increased . " ecb unlikely to raise rates bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ecb is expected to keep rates stable andreas rees of hvb / unicredit agreed .
" this is more a matter of psychology than fundamental facts , " he told afp .
" a meltdown for the german economy is not on the cards . "
the new data has raised hopes among businesses that the european central bank wo n't its benchmark rate from a six-year high next month .
" if i could give advice to the ecb , it would be to keep rates stable , " the zew 's franz said , according to bloomberg news .
" i think they should wait until this financial market turbulence passes . "
several large banks changed previous forecasts that the ecb would further increase rates this year , instead predicting that the rate will remain at 4 percent . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de extremism -pipe- 21.08.2007 opinion : germany must protect its foreigners großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eight indians were attacked by a violent mob in a village in the state of saxony .
germany needs to ask itself whether it really is doing enough to fight right-wing extremism , says dw 's daniel scheschkewitz . anyone who has lived outside of germany for some time knows how alert people are to reports about racism and xenophobia in germany , especially when they involve physical violence .
and even more so when they occur in the part of germany considered a right-wing extremist stronghold , such as the region south of leipzig .
the brutal attack on eight indians in the small town of mügeln is all the more disturbing in view of the fact that anti-racist organizations have repeatedly pointed out how dangerous parts of eastern germany are for foreigners .
and in this case , there were n't even any indications that violent skinheads would go to the local fair .
luckily the eight indians got away with their lives .
but the trauma will remain - as will scars from the wounds inflicted on them by the mob that the police could only control by putting themselves in danger .
the investigation will have to determine the extent to which the violence was organized and whether it did indeed stem from neo-nazis .
but the shameful fact remains that the people of mügeln did not protect the foreigners .
the mayor 's statement that the guilty parties were n't locals ca n't change that .
clearly , things that our society simply can not tolerate remain possible even now , more than 10 years after the brutal attacks on asylum seekers in the eastern germany towns of hoyerswerda and rostock .
thus , it was good that georg milbradt , the premier of saxony , where mügeln is located , did n't hesitate for a moment to go there and find out for himself what had happened and to express his disgust .
but that 's not enough .
germany 's political authorities have to ask themselves whether enough is being done when it comes to education and prevention - in schools , in the social welfare system , but also in prosecuting cases and preventing crime .
and there must be more to it than preserving germany 's reputation abroad .
the soccer world cup showed last year that we are indeed a hospitable country that welcomes people of all skin colors and religious beliefs .
but germany must learn for its own sake to accept foreigners , and that must also happen in places where there are few jobs for germans .
another deplorable incident last weekend showed how far away from that state we in former west germany are : a german national soccer team player said he was called a " black pig " by an opposing team 's german goalkeeper .
that , too , is a scandal !
whether as the child of black african immigrants in the bundesliga or as an indian businessman in saxony , unfortunately people who are willing to become integrated in german society far too often run into barriers .
those who expect immigrants to be willing to integrate must also be prepared to protect them - from physical violence and verbal abuse .

quoting data from the country 's federal statistics agency , the organization said that the figures accounted for more than one in 10 of positions nationwide .
during the same period , 1,451 professorships had been lost at universities .
" improvement in the quality of our higher education system and study conditions is n't possible without a noticeable change in the proportion of 60 students per lecturer , which can not compete internationally , " dhv president bernhard kempen , a professor of law at the university of cologne , said in a press statement .
kempen called for germany 's federal and state governments to reinstate the 1,451 positions that had been eliminated . " with ever fewer professors , the system can not improve , " he said .
the dhv 's figures showed that the cuts were most extreme in the humanities , particularly in classical philology and education , which both lost around 35 percent of lecturers over the decade .
fewer teachers , more students bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the average student-teacher ratio at german universities is 60 to 1 both catholic and protestant theology had lost academic staff , by 18.9 and 20.7 percent respectively .

law , economics , social sciences and art history departments were the only ones to benefit from the creation of new positions .
the former three fields saw gains of 5.6 percent , while the increase in university lectureships in art history was 9.4 percent .
during the same time , the number of students had increased by 0.5 percent , said the dhv , which represents over 22,000 members .
in an academic ranking of the world 's universities released by jiao tong university in shanghai last week , germany 's two best universities , munich 's ludwig maximilians university and its technical university , only came in 53rd and 56th .

his lawyers argued that deporting him to italy , where he was born , would breach his human rights .
chindamo , who was jailed for life in 1996 with a minimum 12-year term , could be released early next year if the parole board decides it is safe to do so .
' heinous crime ' mr mcnulty said he did not think flaws with the human rights act had resulted in the decision of the asylum and immigration tribunal .
he said : " i do n't think it 's actually the act that 's at fault here .
" it 's like a whole range of these things it 's the interpretation of the act .
" and we 're very clear that with rights come responsibilities and i would think that given the serious and heinous nature of this crime , the individual has forfeited any right to domicile in the uk .
" and i think most people would agree with that , and that 's why we 'll be asking the tribunal to look again . "
mr lawrence 's widow said she was " unutterably depressed " by the ruling however , the human rights lawyer david enright said under the current rules , it was impossible for people to be deported from one eu country to another .
he also dismissed the government 's protests as " posturing " , saying it had accepted the 2006 european commission regulation into british law .
" -lrb- this -rrb- said that any eu national who had lived in the uk , even in prison , for more than 10 years , could only be removed from britain on imperative grounds of national security - which clearly would not include mr chindamo or anyone like him , " he added .
chindamo was told the news at the weekend and was said to be " pleased " because his " family and life were in the uk " .
in a statement he said he hoped the decision would not " cause grief " to philip lawrence 's widow frances or to the rest of his family and went on to express his deepest sympathy .
but frances lawrence has said she was " devastated " and " demoralised " by the ruling , saying the human right act had " failed to encompass the rights of my family " .
chindamo came to the uk when he was six .
his father is italian , his mother is from the philippines and he has an italian passport .
he was 15-years-old when he stabbed mr lawrence as the teacher defended a pupil outside st george 's roman catholic comprehensive school .
chindamo 's lawyers said the home office wanted him returned to italy when he was freed from prison . "
i feel as if i ca n't fight any more - i feel i ca n't survive this " frances lawrence but they successfully argued the move would have been illegal as chindamo was from a european union country and had already lived in the uk for 10 years by 1995 .
chindamo 's lawyer nigel leskin said his client was now a reformed character who was unlikely to offend again .
" he was involved in a gang when he was young .
he was a kid trying to act up big .
he was out of control and he thought he knew everything .
he now realises how wrong he was . "
' clumsy incompetence ' it was the second time the government had tried to remove chindamo - an attempt in 2001 was blocked because it began too soon after he had been sentenced .
a year after her husband 's death mrs lawrence set up the philip lawrence awards to honour young people 's efforts in tackling social issues .
she added : " i am deeply concerned for everything i have worked for , including the setting up of the philip lawrence awards .
" i feel as if i ca n't fight any more - i feel i ca n't survive this . "
shadow home secretary david davis added : " it is a stark demonstration of the clumsy incompetence of this government 's human rights legislation that we are unable to send a proven killer back to his own country , especially when that country is in the eu . "

" it 's like a whole range of these things it 's the interpretation of the act .
" and we 're very clear that with rights come responsibilities and i would think that given the serious and heinous nature of this crime , the individual has forfeited any right to domicile in the uk .
" and i think most people would agree with that , and that 's why we 'll be asking the tribunal to look again . "
mr lawrence 's widow said she was " unutterably depressed " by the ruling philip lawrence was killed in 1995 as he helped a pupil however , the human rights lawyer david enright said under the current rules , it was impossible for people to be deported from one eu country to another .

" -lrb- this -rrb- said that any eu national who had lived in the uk , even in prison , for more than 10 years , could only be removed from britain on imperative grounds of national security - which clearly would not include mr chindamo or anyone like him , " he added .
chindamo was told the news at the weekend and was said to be " pleased " because his " family and life were in the uk " .
in a statement he said he hoped the decision would not " cause grief " to philip lawrence 's widow frances or to the rest of his family and went on to express his deepest sympathy .
but frances lawrence has said she was " devastated " and " demoralised " by the ruling , saying the human right act had " failed to encompass the rights of my family " .
chindamo came to the uk when he was six .
his father is italian , his mother is from the philippines and he has an italian passport .
he was 15-years-old when he stabbed mr lawrence as the teacher defended a pupil outside st george 's roman catholic comprehensive school .
chindamo 's lawyers said the home office wanted him returned to italy when he was freed from prison .
i feel as if i ca n't fight any more - i feel i ca n't survive this frances lawrence but they successfully argued the move would have been illegal as chindamo was from a european union country and had already lived in the uk for 10 years by 1995 .
chindamo 's lawyer nigel leskin said his client was now a reformed character who was unlikely to offend again .

' clumsy incompetence ' it was the second time the government had tried to remove chindamo - an attempt in 2001 was blocked because it began too soon after he had been sentenced .

mr lawrence 's widow said she was " unutterably depressed " by the ruling philip lawrence was killed in 1995 as he helped a pupil however , the human rights lawyer david enright said under the current rules , it was impossible for people to be deported from one eu country to another .
he also dismissed the government 's protests as " posturing " , saying it had accepted the 2006 european commission regulation into british law .
" -lrb- this -rrb- said that any eu national who had lived in the uk , even in prison , for more than 10 years , could only be removed from britain on imperative grounds of national security - which clearly would not include mr chindamo or anyone like him , " he added .
chindamo was told the news at the weekend and was said to be " pleased " because his " family and life were in the uk " .
in a statement he said he hoped the decision would not " cause grief " to philip lawrence 's widow frances or to the rest of his family and went on to express his deepest sympathy .
but frances lawrence has said she was " devastated " and " demoralised " by the ruling , saying the human right act had " failed to encompass the rights of my family " .
chindamo came to the uk when he was six .
his father is italian , his mother is from the philippines and he has an italian passport .
he was 15-years-old when he stabbed mr lawrence as the teacher defended a pupil outside st george 's roman catholic comprehensive school .
chindamo 's lawyers said the home office wanted him returned to italy when he was freed from prison .
i feel as if i ca n't fight any more - i feel i ca n't survive this frances lawrence but they successfully argued the move would have been illegal as chindamo was from a european union country and had already lived in the uk for 10 years by 1995 .
chindamo 's lawyer nigel leskin said his client was now a reformed character who was unlikely to offend again .
" he was involved in a gang when he was young .
he was a kid trying to act up big .
he was out of control and he thought he knew everything .
he now realises how wrong he was . "
' clumsy incompetence ' it was the second time the government had tried to remove chindamo - an attempt in 2001 was blocked because it began too soon after he had been sentenced .
a year after her husband 's death mrs lawrence set up the philip lawrence awards to honour young people 's efforts in tackling social issues .
she added : " i am deeply concerned for everything i have worked for , including the setting up of the philip lawrence awards .
" i feel as if i ca n't fight any more - i feel i ca n't survive this . "
shadow home secretary david davis added : " it is a stark demonstration of the clumsy incompetence of this government 's human rights legislation that we are unable to send a proven killer back to his own country , especially when that country is in the eu . "

bbc news -pipe- technology -pipe- troubled times for home networks bbc news / technology graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- tuesday , 21 august 2007 , 06:41 gmt 07:41 uk troubled times for home networks by mark ward technology correspondent , bbc news website there are many technologies that only prove how useful they are when you actually try them .
take for instance , broadband .
the high price may have initially put people off but for those that tried it , and for the millions who have signed up since , the value of that faster , always-on link is apparent every day .
and then there are the technologies that prove how useless they are when you actually try them .
take for instance , home networking .
increasing numbers of us have amassed large collections of digital images , music , movies and tv shows .
the ability to do more with it , to share it around and show it off , has an obvious appeal .
but , said van baker , a research vice-president at analysts gartner who studies the home networking market , the available technology is not living up to its potential .
" the state of home networking is pretty dismal for the average consumer , " mr baker told the bbc news website .
the problem , he said , was the sheer complexity of getting all those different devices to work together and swap data via a home network .
while connecting computers with ethernet cables is straightforward , try to do anything clever and obstacles start to appear .
for instance , streaming video across a low-speed wireless network quickly hits bandwidth problems .
upgrade to the current highest speed wi-fi and you will be using kit that is not yet standardised .
" mention wpa or encryption or ssid or dhcp and you have lost the vast majority of consumers already , " he said .
" most of them are not going to deal with that level of complexity and knowledge . "
the technical know-how required to set up a network and run music or video across cables or wi-fi , was , he said , " the elephant in the room that no-one wants to talk about . "
network notwork gartner tracks public opinion about many different consumer technologies on a graph called the " hype cycle " .
this describes the journey of these hi-tech toys from the moment they become possible , thanks to a technological breakthrough , through the peak of inflated expectations to the plateau of productivity where they prove their usefulness .
currently , said mr baker , some home network technologies were sitting on the portion of the graph known as the trough of disillusionment because people had found out all the things they could not do with their home network .
many were being tripped up by digital rights management technology that limits their ability to share digital media around or simpler incompatabilities in file types that stop them being used on another system .
one technology that perhaps might help home users who are concerned about the technical know-how needed to set up a network is powerline , which runs data across the cable network you already have in your home but which carries electricity .
powerline network adaptors are modified plugs that sport an ethernet socket that lets you send data from your devices around the home .
louise barrett , a spokeswoman for solwise which distributes powerline hardware in the uk , said they were proving popular with those who own an xbox and a pc and want to move their music and other media between the two .
setting them up , she said , was straightforward and did not require fiddling with id numbers and other settings that wi-fi networks sometimes demand .
" they are great if you have a 16th century cottage in the back of beyond where the walls do not let the wireless signal through , " said ms barrett .
she added that data travelling across electricity cables can be slowed down by what else you have plugged in .
but , she said , users would not notice much difference on the faster networks -lrb- up to 200 megabits per second -rrb- that powerline supports .
wi-fi world one home networking technology that has come through the trough of disillusionment to the slope of enlightenment is wi-fi .
selina lo , chief executive of ruckus wireless , said wi-fi 's popularity proved how straight-forward it was to use .
" we 've gone way beyond the tech adopters , " she said .
that wide usage would not have come about without it being straightforward to use , she added .
" there are signs that wi-fi is becoming a utility , " she said .
" people want to login and have it behave the same every time .
they just want it to work . "
increasingly , said ms lo , ruckus was talking to network firms and service providers about using wi-fi in homes because people have got used to the freedom it gives them to move their computer around the home .
more and more people were also getting used to using wi-fi when they were out and about , said ms lo .
" wi-fi will become a ubiquitous technology , " she concluded .
just how popular it has become can be shown by the sheer number of firms that make and sell home wi-fi hardware .
companies such as netgear , linksys , belkin , 3com and d-link all sell these types of kit .
mr baker from gartner was not so sure .
in europe , he said , powerline technology might make more sense in homes not least because cable tv firms were already investigating using it to provide multi-room tv .
for the moment though , he said , many consumers would probably continue to struggle with home networks .
" what we need is a home networking technology that extends the home electronics value proposition in which we go to the store , look at the products , decide what we want , bring it home , plug it in and it works . "
" we are quite a way aways from getting that to happen , " he said .

"
that is how the unknown region of the north pole was marked on ancient danish maps .
much still remains to be mapped and denmark is engaged in that work now , with a new polar expedition .
cutting through ice as thick as five metres -lrb- 16.5ft -rrb- , 45 scientists are on a mission to explore what is really beneath the frozen sea .
the aim is to gather data showing whether there is a basis for a possible future danish claim to parts of the arctic .
if evidence is found to prove that the north pole is geologically linked to greenland - part of denmark for more than 600 years - then the kingdom could stake a claim to the pole itself .
according to the latest estimates from the us geological survey , the north pole region holds about a quarter of the world 's oil reserves .
as global warming continues to melt polar ice , access to the oil reserves should get easier .
the prospect of " black gold " in greenland has led a growing number of greenlanders to call for independence from denmark .
a danish government commission is set to publish recommendations on the future status of greenland next month .
and the north pole is not the only source of potential riches in the region .
according to the us geological survey , the north of greenland could hold the richest untapped oil and gas reserves .
' shared property ' the danish prime minister , anders fogh rasmussen , has said he is following the polar expedition with great interest .
but he added that at this stage denmark is not preparing to claim the north pole .
russian researchers planted a russian flag on the north pole seabed on 2 august .
" it 's not a good thing that various nations are making claims to the north pole , " mr rasmussen said .
" now , i am not an expert , but i tend to think that the north pole is shared property for the whole world . "
however , science minister helge sander has said denmark has joined the race because danish scientists believe the north pole does belong to their country .
that has led the opposition to call for the government to make its intentions clear .
" while the prime minister says the north pole is shared property , the science minister has hinted that the north pole - or parts thereof - is danish property .
we need the government to make a clear stand , " said rasmus prehn , social democratic shadow spokesman on science .
russia claims the north pole is part of russia .
mr sander called the russian expedition a " provocation " .
canada has also shown a keen interest in the arctic .
the canadian prime minister , stephen harper , went on a three-day trip to the region earlier this month and said canada would build two military facilities there .
race for data " it 's the first time we see this type of diplomatic wrangling and border twists between western nations as a result of climate change , " bart mongoven , a scientist with the american think-tank stratfor , told the danish newspaper politiken .
greenland 's population is just 57,000 profile : greenland " we could see some serious conflicts of interest , and they wo n't all have peaceful solutions , " he said .
canada , denmark and russia are among many countries that have ratified the un 's convention on the law of the sea , which allows a state sole exploitation rights over all natural resources within a 200-nautical mile -lrb- 370km -rrb- zone extending from its coastline .
beyond that , a state can claim the right to exploit a further 150 nautical miles of seabed if it can prove that its continental shelf extends that far .
long-term ambitions unlike the states now racing to the north pole , norway has already gathered and submitted evidence to make its claims .
but norwegian scientists appear to think that , while part of the region is norwegian territory , the pole itself is not norwegian .
there is still a long way to go before denmark - or any other nation - can stake an official claim to the north pole .
" we are not guaranteed any success .
no one has sailed this area before .
the real challenge is the ice , " said christian marcussen , a leading scientist responsible for the expedition .
he warns against raising expectations too high because of the harsh weather and water conditions .
" it 's unrealistic to think that we can drill for potential oil in our lifetime .
the problem is the drifting ice which is very difficult to handle .
however , there might be certain bacteria or other unique resources underground that could be valuable in future , " said mr marcussen .
flemming christiansen , another scientist at denmark 's geus -lrb- geological survey of denmark and greenland -rrb- , says denmark is not only interested in the north pole 's potential oil , gas and bacteria .
the region is already an attractive sea route .
a successful claim to the north pole would also allow a state the power to regulate traffic and set environmental standards .
by 2014 the un will be looking at the scientific evidence gathered by the various national expeditions .
if a scientific battle breaks out , it is ultimately the un 's international court of justice in the hague that may decide to which country the north pole belongs - if any .

that is how the unknown region of the north pole was marked on ancient danish maps .
much still remains to be mapped and denmark is engaged in that work now , with a new polar expedition .
cutting through ice as thick as five metres -lrb- 16.5ft -rrb- , 45 scientists are on a mission to explore what is really beneath the frozen sea .
the aim is to gather data showing whether there is a basis for a possible future danish claim to parts of the arctic .
if evidence is found to prove that the north pole is geologically linked to greenland - part of denmark for more than 600 years - then the kingdom could stake a claim to the pole itself .
according to the latest estimates from the us geological survey , the north pole region holds about a quarter of the world 's oil reserves .
as global warming continues to melt polar ice , access to the oil reserves should get easier .
the prospect of " black gold " in greenland has led a growing number of greenlanders to call for independence from denmark .
a danish government commission is set to publish recommendations on the future status of greenland next month .

according to the us geological survey , the north of greenland could hold the richest untapped oil and gas reserves .
' shared property ' the danish prime minister , anders fogh rasmussen , has said he is following the polar expedition with great interest .
but he added that at this stage denmark is not preparing to claim the north pole .
russia has staked an early claim - but the un wants more data russian researchers planted a russian flag on the north pole seabed on 2 august .
" it 's not a good thing that various nations are making claims to the north pole , " mr rasmussen said .
" now , i am not an expert , but i tend to think that the north pole is shared property for the whole world . "
however , science minister helge sander has said denmark has joined the race because danish scientists believe the north pole does belong to their country .
that has led the opposition to call for the government to make its intentions clear .
" while the prime minister says the north pole is shared property , the science minister has hinted that the north pole - or parts thereof - is danish property .
we need the government to make a clear stand , " said rasmus prehn , social democratic shadow spokesman on science .
russia claims the north pole is part of russia .
mr sander called the russian expedition a " provocation " .
canada has also shown a keen interest in the arctic .
the canadian prime minister , stephen harper , went on a three-day trip to the region earlier this month and said canada would build two military facilities there .
race for data " it 's the first time we see this type of diplomatic wrangling and border twists between western nations as a result of climate change , " bart mongoven , a scientist with the american think-tank stratfor , told the danish newspaper politiken .

canada , denmark and russia are among many countries that have ratified the un 's convention on the law of the sea , which allows a state sole exploitation rights over all natural resources within a 200-nautical mile -lrb- 370km -rrb- zone extending from its coastline .
beyond that , a state can claim the right to exploit a further 150 nautical miles of seabed if it can prove that its continental shelf extends that far .

but norwegian scientists appear to think that , while part of the region is norwegian territory , the pole itself is not norwegian .
there is still a long way to go before denmark - or any other nation - can stake an official claim to the north pole .
" we are not guaranteed any success .

the real challenge is the ice , " said christian marcussen , a leading scientist responsible for the expedition .
he warns against raising expectations too high because of the harsh weather and water conditions .
" it 's unrealistic to think that we can drill for potential oil in our lifetime .
the problem is the drifting ice which is very difficult to handle .
however , there might be certain bacteria or other unique resources underground that could be valuable in future , " said mr marcussen .
flemming christiansen , another scientist at denmark 's geus -lrb- geological survey of denmark and greenland -rrb- , says denmark is not only interested in the north pole 's potential oil , gas and bacteria .

"
that is how the unknown region of the north pole was marked on ancient danish maps .
much still remains to be mapped and denmark is engaged in that work now , with a new polar expedition .
cutting through ice as thick as five metres -lrb- 16.5ft -rrb- , 45 scientists are on a mission to explore what is really beneath the frozen sea .
the aim is to gather data showing whether there is a basis for a possible future danish claim to parts of the arctic .
if evidence is found to prove that the north pole is geologically linked to greenland - part of denmark for more than 600 years - then the kingdom could stake a claim to the pole itself .
according to the latest estimates from the us geological survey , the north pole region holds about a quarter of the world 's oil reserves .
as global warming continues to melt polar ice , access to the oil reserves should get easier .
the prospect of " black gold " in greenland has led a growing number of greenlanders to call for independence from denmark .
a danish government commission is set to publish recommendations on the future status of greenland next month .
see a detailed map of the region and the north pole is not the only source of potential riches in the region .
according to the us geological survey , the north of greenland could hold the richest untapped oil and gas reserves .
' shared property ' the danish prime minister , anders fogh rasmussen , has said he is following the polar expedition with great interest .
but he added that at this stage denmark is not preparing to claim the north pole .
russia has staked an early claim - but the un wants more data russian researchers planted a russian flag on the north pole seabed on 2 august .
" it 's not a good thing that various nations are making claims to the north pole , " mr rasmussen said .
" now , i am not an expert , but i tend to think that the north pole is shared property for the whole world . "
however , science minister helge sander has said denmark has joined the race because danish scientists believe the north pole does belong to their country .
that has led the opposition to call for the government to make its intentions clear .
" while the prime minister says the north pole is shared property , the science minister has hinted that the north pole - or parts thereof - is danish property .
we need the government to make a clear stand , " said rasmus prehn , social democratic shadow spokesman on science .
russia claims the north pole is part of russia .
mr sander called the russian expedition a " provocation " .
canada has also shown a keen interest in the arctic .
the canadian prime minister , stephen harper , went on a three-day trip to the region earlier this month and said canada would build two military facilities there .
race for data " it 's the first time we see this type of diplomatic wrangling and border twists between western nations as a result of climate change , " bart mongoven , a scientist with the american think-tank stratfor , told the danish newspaper politiken .
greenland 's population is just 57,000 profile : greenland " we could see some serious conflicts of interest , and they wo n't all have peaceful solutions , " he said .
canada , denmark and russia are among many countries that have ratified the un 's convention on the law of the sea , which allows a state sole exploitation rights over all natural resources within a 200-nautical mile -lrb- 370km -rrb- zone extending from its coastline .
beyond that , a state can claim the right to exploit a further 150 nautical miles of seabed if it can prove that its continental shelf extends that far .
long-term ambitions unlike the states now racing to the north pole , norway has already gathered and submitted evidence to make its claims .
but norwegian scientists appear to think that , while part of the region is norwegian territory , the pole itself is not norwegian .
there is still a long way to go before denmark - or any other nation - can stake an official claim to the north pole .
" we are not guaranteed any success .
no one has sailed this area before .
the real challenge is the ice , " said christian marcussen , a leading scientist responsible for the expedition .
he warns against raising expectations too high because of the harsh weather and water conditions .
" it 's unrealistic to think that we can drill for potential oil in our lifetime .
the problem is the drifting ice which is very difficult to handle .
however , there might be certain bacteria or other unique resources underground that could be valuable in future , " said mr marcussen .
flemming christiansen , another scientist at denmark 's geus -lrb- geological survey of denmark and greenland -rrb- , says denmark is not only interested in the north pole 's potential oil , gas and bacteria .
the region is already an attractive sea route .
a successful claim to the north pole would also allow a state the power to regulate traffic and set environmental standards .
by 2014 the un will be looking at the scientific evidence gathered by the various national expeditions .
if a scientific battle breaks out , it is ultimately the un 's international court of justice in the hague that may decide to which country the north pole belongs - if any .
russia 's arctic claim 1 -rrb- north pole : russia leaves its flag on the seabed , 4,000m -lrb- 13,100ft -rrb- beneath the surface , as part of its claims for oil and gas reserves 2 -rrb- lomonosov ridge : russia argues that this underwater feature is an extension of its continental territory and is looking for evidence 3 -rrb- 200-nautical mile -lrb- 370km -rrb- line : shows how far countries ' agreed economic area extends beyond their coastline .

take for instance , broadband .
the high price may have initially put people off but for those that tried it , and for the millions who have signed up since , the value of that faster , always-on link is apparent every day .
and then there are the technologies that prove how useless they are when you actually try them .
take for instance , home networking .
increasing numbers of us have amassed large collections of digital images , music , movies and tv shows .
the ability to do more with it , to share it around and show it off , has an obvious appeal .
but , said van baker , a research vice-president at analysts gartner who studies the home networking market , the available technology is not living up to its potential .
" the state of home networking is pretty dismal for the average consumer , " mr baker told the bbc news website .
the problem , he said , was the sheer complexity of getting all those different devices to work together and swap data via a home network .
while connecting computers with ethernet cables is straightforward , try to do anything clever and obstacles start to appear .
for instance , streaming video across a low-speed wireless network quickly hits bandwidth problems .
upgrade to the current highest speed wi-fi and you will be using kit that is not yet standardised .
" mention wpa or encryption or ssid or dhcp and you have lost the vast majority of consumers already , " he said .
" most of them are not going to deal with that level of complexity and knowledge . "
the technical know-how required to set up a network and run music or video across cables or wi-fi , was , he said , " the elephant in the room that no-one wants to talk about . "
network notwork gartner tracks public opinion about many different consumer technologies on a graph called the " hype cycle " .
this describes the journey of these hi-tech toys from the moment they become possible , thanks to a technological breakthrough , through the peak of inflated expectations to the plateau of productivity where they prove their usefulness .
currently , said mr baker , some home network technologies were sitting on the portion of the graph known as the trough of disillusionment because people had found out all the things they could not do with their home network .
many were being tripped up by digital rights management technology that limits their ability to share digital media around or simpler incompatabilities in file types that stop them being used on another system .
powerline sends data via the same wires that electricity uses one technology that perhaps might help home users who are concerned about the technical know-how needed to set up a network is powerline , which runs data across the cable network you already have in your home but which carries electricity .
powerline network adaptors are modified plugs that sport an ethernet socket that lets you send data from your devices around the home .
louise barrett , a spokeswoman for solwise which distributes powerline hardware in the uk , said they were proving popular with those who own an xbox and a pc and want to move their music and other media between the two .
setting them up , she said , was straightforward and did not require fiddling with id numbers and other settings that wi-fi networks sometimes demand .
" they are great if you have a 16th century cottage in the back of beyond where the walls do not let the wireless signal through , " said ms barrett .
she added that data travelling across electricity cables can be slowed down by what else you have plugged in .
but , she said , users would not notice much difference on the faster networks -lrb- up to 200 megabits per second -rrb- that powerline supports .
wi-fi world one home networking technology that has come through the trough of disillusionment to the slope of enlightenment is wi-fi .
selina lo , chief executive of ruckus wireless , said wi-fi 's popularity proved how straight-forward it was to use .
" we 've gone way beyond the tech adopters , " she said .
many people have got used to using wi-fi on the move that wide usage would not have come about without it being straightforward to use , she added .
" there are signs that wi-fi is becoming a utility , " she said .
" people want to login and have it behave the same every time .
they just want it to work . "
increasingly , said ms lo , ruckus was talking to network firms and service providers about using wi-fi in homes because people have got used to the freedom it gives them to move their computer around the home .
more and more people were also getting used to using wi-fi when they were out and about , said ms lo .
" wi-fi will become a ubiquitous technology , " she concluded .
just how popular it has become can be shown by the sheer number of firms that make and sell home wi-fi hardware .
companies such as netgear , linksys , belkin , 3com and d-link all sell these types of kit .
mr baker from gartner was not so sure .
in europe , he said , powerline technology might make more sense in homes not least because cable tv firms were already investigating using it to provide multi-room tv .
for the moment though , he said , many consumers would probably continue to struggle with home networks .
" what we need is a home networking technology that extends the home electronics value proposition in which we go to the store , look at the products , decide what we want , bring it home , plug it in and it works . "
" we are quite a way aways from getting that to happen , " he said .

take for instance , broadband .
the high price may have initially put people off but for those that tried it , and for the millions who have signed up since , the value of that faster , always-on link is apparent every day .
and then there are the technologies that prove how useless they are when you actually try them .
take for instance , home networking .
increasing numbers of us have amassed large collections of digital images , music , movies and tv shows .
the ability to do more with it , to share it around and show it off , has an obvious appeal .
but , said van baker , a research vice-president at analysts gartner who studies the home networking market , the available technology is not living up to its potential .
" the state of home networking is pretty dismal for the average consumer , " mr baker told the bbc news website .
the problem , he said , was the sheer complexity of getting all those different devices to work together and swap data via a home network .
while connecting computers with ethernet cables is straightforward , try to do anything clever and obstacles start to appear .
for instance , streaming video across a low-speed wireless network quickly hits bandwidth problems .
upgrade to the current highest speed wi-fi and you will be using kit that is not yet standardised .
" mention wpa or encryption or ssid or dhcp and you have lost the vast majority of consumers already , " he said .
" most of them are not going to deal with that level of complexity and knowledge . "
the technical know-how required to set up a network and run music or video across cables or wi-fi , was , he said , " the elephant in the room that no-one wants to talk about . "
network notwork gartner tracks public opinion about many different consumer technologies on a graph called the " hype cycle " .
this describes the journey of these hi-tech toys from the moment they become possible , thanks to a technological breakthrough , through the peak of inflated expectations to the plateau of productivity where they prove their usefulness .
currently , said mr baker , some home network technologies were sitting on the portion of the graph known as the trough of disillusionment because people had found out all the things they could not do with their home network .
many were being tripped up by digital rights management technology that limits their ability to share digital media around or simpler incompatabilities in file types that stop them being used on another system .
powerline sends data via the same wires that electricity uses one technology that perhaps might help home users who are concerned about the technical know-how needed to set up a network is powerline , which runs data across the cable network you already have in your home but which carries electricity .
powerline network adaptors are modified plugs that sport an ethernet socket that lets you send data from your devices around the home .
louise barrett , a spokeswoman for solwise which distributes powerline hardware in the uk , said they were proving popular with those who own an xbox and a pc and want to move their music and other media between the two .
setting them up , she said , was straightforward and did not require fiddling with id numbers and other settings that wi-fi networks sometimes demand .
" they are great if you have a 16th century cottage in the back of beyond where the walls do not let the wireless signal through , " said ms barrett .
she added that data travelling across electricity cables can be slowed down by what else you have plugged in .
but , she said , users would not notice much difference on the faster networks -lrb- up to 200 megabits per second -rrb- that powerline supports .
wi-fi world one home networking technology that has come through the trough of disillusionment to the slope of enlightenment is wi-fi .
selina lo , chief executive of ruckus wireless , said wi-fi 's popularity proved how straight-forward it was to use .
" we 've gone way beyond the tech adopters , " she said .
many people have got used to using wi-fi on the move that wide usage would not have come about without it being straightforward to use , she added .
" there are signs that wi-fi is becoming a utility , " she said .
" people want to login and have it behave the same every time .
they just want it to work . "
increasingly , said ms lo , ruckus was talking to network firms and service providers about using wi-fi in homes because people have got used to the freedom it gives them to move their computer around the home .
more and more people were also getting used to using wi-fi when they were out and about , said ms lo .
" wi-fi will become a ubiquitous technology , " she concluded .
just how popular it has become can be shown by the sheer number of firms that make and sell home wi-fi hardware .
companies such as netgear , linksys , belkin , 3com and d-link all sell these types of kit .
mr baker from gartner was not so sure .
in europe , he said , powerline technology might make more sense in homes not least because cable tv firms were already investigating using it to provide multi-room tv .
for the moment though , he said , many consumers would probably continue to struggle with home networks .
" what we need is a home networking technology that extends the home electronics value proposition in which we go to the store , look at the products , decide what we want , bring it home , plug it in and it works . "
" we are quite a way aways from getting that to happen , " he said .

powerline sends data via the same wires that electricity uses one technology that perhaps might help home users who are concerned about the technical know-how needed to set up a network is powerline , which runs data across the cable network you already have in your home but which carries electricity .
powerline network adaptors are modified plugs that sport an ethernet socket that lets you send data from your devices around the home .
louise barrett , a spokeswoman for solwise which distributes powerline hardware in the uk , said they were proving popular with those who own an xbox and a pc and want to move their music and other media between the two .
setting them up , she said , was straightforward and did not require fiddling with id numbers and other settings that wi-fi networks sometimes demand .
" they are great if you have a 16th century cottage in the back of beyond where the walls do not let the wireless signal through , " said ms barrett .
she added that data travelling across electricity cables can be slowed down by what else you have plugged in .
but , she said , users would not notice much difference on the faster networks -lrb- up to 200 megabits per second -rrb- that powerline supports .
wi-fi world one home networking technology that has come through the trough of disillusionment to the slope of enlightenment is wi-fi .
selina lo , chief executive of ruckus wireless , said wi-fi 's popularity proved how straight-forward it was to use .
" we 've gone way beyond the tech adopters , " she said .
many people have got used to using wi-fi on the move that wide usage would not have come about without it being straightforward to use , she added .
" there are signs that wi-fi is becoming a utility , " she said .
" people want to login and have it behave the same every time .
they just want it to work . "
increasingly , said ms lo , ruckus was talking to network firms and service providers about using wi-fi in homes because people have got used to the freedom it gives them to move their computer around the home .
more and more people were also getting used to using wi-fi when they were out and about , said ms lo .
" wi-fi will become a ubiquitous technology , " she concluded .
just how popular it has become can be shown by the sheer number of firms that make and sell home wi-fi hardware .
companies such as netgear , linksys , belkin , 3com and d-link all sell these types of kit .
mr baker from gartner was not so sure .
in europe , he said , powerline technology might make more sense in homes not least because cable tv firms were already investigating using it to provide multi-room tv .
for the moment though , he said , many consumers would probably continue to struggle with home networks .
" what we need is a home networking technology that extends the home electronics value proposition in which we go to the store , look at the products , decide what we want , bring it home , plug it in and it works . "
" we are quite a way aways from getting that to happen , " he said .

the high price may have initially put people off but for those that tried it , and for the millions who have signed up since , the value of that faster , always-on link is apparent every day .

the ability to do more with it , to share it around and show it off , has an obvious appeal .
but , said van baker , a research vice-president at analysts gartner who studies the home networking market , the available technology is not living up to its potential .
" the state of home networking is pretty dismal for the average consumer , " mr baker told the bbc news website .
the problem , he said , was the sheer complexity of getting all those different devices to work together and swap data via a home network .
while connecting computers with ethernet cables is straightforward , try to do anything clever and obstacles start to appear .
for instance , streaming video across a low-speed wireless network quickly hits bandwidth problems .
upgrade to the current highest speed wi-fi and you will be using kit that is not yet standardised .
" mention wpa or encryption or ssid or dhcp and you have lost the vast majority of consumers already , " he said .
" most of them are not going to deal with that level of complexity and knowledge . "

pre-tax profits for the six months to 30 june rose 9.8 % to £ 281.1m as it racked up sales worth £ 1.51bn.
looking ahead , forward sales for the second half stand at £ 1.35bn - about 85 % of its full-year target .
persimmon added that despite recent interest rate rises it still expected the housing market to remain strong .
the company added that despite the traditional summer lull , it believed the market would remain robust " as long as current assumptions on interest rates remain intact , and employment data continues to be supportive " .
" this , coupled with general confidence in the housing market , should deliver the normal seasonal upturn in activity throughout the autumn selling period , " it added .
despite planning problems which have affected the industry as a whole , the firm said all of its divisions had experienced underlying price growth - albeit with some regional and local differences .
it also welcomed government plans to boost the country 's housing stock , adding it had continued to increase its landbank providing a " strong platform " for the business .
persimmon controlled 82,145 housing plots in the first six months of the year - up from 80,085 in december - as well as holding 22,000 acres of strategic land .

he said young black men needed their fathers as role models , otherwise their development suffered .
black girls from similar backgrounds had different attitudes and succeeded more than black boys , he said .
he was responding to us civil rights activist jesse jackson who said inner city violence was an economic problem .
" gang violence is rooted in the economics of desperation , " said rev jackson , adding that some people were " profiting " from providing guns to deprived areas . "
it 's the absence of fathers who are actively involved in parenting " justice secretary jack straw he called for more investment in pre-natal care and education , rather than building more jails .
but mr straw , speaking on bbc radio 4 's today programme , said the problem was not due to economics .
" one of the striking things is the difference between the attitude and the success in life of black girls from exactly the same backgrounds compared to black boys . "
black girls perform around the average at key stage 4 , aged 16 , compared to the overall population , he said .
' lads need dads ' " black boys go backwards when they get to secondary school .
" it 's a cultural problem .
it 's the absence of fathers who are actively involved in parenting .
" and as we know - lads need dads .
of course they need their mums as well , but there is a particular point in teenagers ' development , of young men , where fathers are very important and they are more likely to be absent in the case of the afro-caribbean , " mr straw said .
mr straw said the government had put in place schemes to deter people from getting into gang violence , but admitted " there is a very great deal more to do " .
" but this can not just be a matter for the government .
" it has to be a matter for these communities because the problem for these communities is that not only are they - the black lads - much more likely to end up in prison , but they are also much more likely to be the victims of crime than the white or non-black sections of the community . "
army career he praised a project by the chairman of the commission on equality and human rights , trevor phillips , to encourage black senior military officers to mentor young black men and persuade them not to become involved in gangs and crime .
he said : " the army is a very good career for many black and asian people , and i do n't think its an accident that my very close friend colin powell , the former us secretary of state and head of services there , managed to make his way in society through his experiences in the us army . "
rev jackson is visiting the uk to launch equanomics uk , a programme focussing on wage inequality , poverty , trade policy , and the impact of credit and debt on ethnic communities .
he said the uk 's black and ethnic communities should be encouraged to play a bigger role in politics .
" the people of colour are under-represented at every level of government . "

he said young black men needed their fathers as role models , otherwise their development suffered .
black girls from similar backgrounds had different attitudes and succeeded more than black boys , he said .
he was responding to us civil rights activist jesse jackson who said inner city violence was an economic problem .
" gang violence is rooted in the economics of desperation , " said rev jackson , adding that some people were " profiting " from providing guns to deprived areas .
it 's the absence of fathers who are actively involved in parenting justice secretary jack straw he called for more investment in pre-natal care and education , rather than building more jails .
but mr straw , speaking on bbc radio 4 's today programme , said the problem was not due to economics .
" one of the striking things is the difference between the attitude and the success in life of black girls from exactly the same backgrounds compared to black boys . "
black girls perform around the average at key stage 4 , aged 16 , compared to the overall population , he said .
' lads need dads ' " black boys go backwards when they get to secondary school .
" it 's a cultural problem .
it 's the absence of fathers who are actively involved in parenting .
" and as we know - lads need dads .
of course they need their mums as well , but there is a particular point in teenagers ' development , of young men , where fathers are very important and they are more likely to be absent in the case of the afro-caribbean , " mr straw said .
mr straw said the government had put in place schemes to deter people from getting into gang violence , but admitted " there is a very great deal more to do " .
" but this can not just be a matter for the government .
" it has to be a matter for these communities because the problem for these communities is that not only are they - the black lads - much more likely to end up in prison , but they are also much more likely to be the victims of crime than the white or non-black sections of the community . "
army career he praised a project by the chairman of the commission on equality and human rights , trevor phillips , to encourage black senior military officers to mentor young black men and persuade them not to become involved in gangs and crime .
he said : " the army is a very good career for many black and asian people , and i do n't think its an accident that my very close friend colin powell , the former us secretary of state and head of services there , managed to make his way in society through his experiences in the us army . "
rev jackson is visiting the uk to launch equanomics uk , a programme focussing on wage inequality , poverty , trade policy , and the impact of credit and debt on ethnic communities .
he said the uk 's black and ethnic communities should be encouraged to play a bigger role in politics .
" the people of colour are under-represented at every level of government . "
