afghan police reported on july 22 that they had found the bullet-riddled body of one of the men , which was flown back to germany last week .
the autopsy conducted at cologne 's institute for forensic medicine confirmed thursday that the man was shot and killed after suffering from circulatory problems during captivity .
" his kidnappers killed him brutally and ended his life in a criminal way , " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier told afp news agency during a tour of west africa .
" this is deeply shocking .
this crime must not go unpunished . "

these kids are more likely to suffer from weight problems than their peers from better situated families . an extensive study on child nutrition has revealed that germany 's long-term unemployed can not offer their families a well-balanced diet . " it 's hardly possible for these welfare recipients to feed their children healthy food , " said mathilde kersting from the research institute for child nutrition -lrb- fke -rrb- in dortmund . children in families getting long-term unemployment welfare , known as hartz iv , are n't going hungry .
but they are not eating the right types of food , kersting said . the study showed that the welfare payments had a daily allowance for food and beverages for children of 2.57 euros -lrb- $ 3.50 -rrb- and for teenagers over 14 years 3.42 euros . but , kersting said , even if families shopped at discount supermarkets , an average of 4.68 euros per day was necessary to still the appetite of a growing teenager with a balanced diet .

but simply more money was not the answer . " it 's also important to convince these groups of the use of a well-balanced diet , " kersting said .
" we have to develop simple measures which can be implemented so that our nutritional information can reach these families better than it does up to now . " fke researchers compiled the prices of over 80 kinds of food which are necessary for a healthy diet .
they then calculated the costs for an optimized mixed diet - a concept developed by fke which aims to ensure healthy nutrition for children and teenagers at comparatively low costs . germany needs to improve its childcare system in a separate study , the konrad adenauer foundation found that children from less-educated families were less likely to attend a nursery school . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : early childhood daycare is not adequate in germany , a study shows the problems children from all levels of society faced were the same , though .

germany was 15 to 20 years behind its european neighbors in this aspect and had a lot of catching up to do , wehrmann said . " they can not even diagnose developmental disorders among small children , " wehrmann said at the presentation of the study in berlin on wednesday . german family minister ursula von der leyen has pushed through new childcare policies to significantly increase the number of daycare spots for young children in the next five years .

these kids are more likely to suffer from weight problems than their peers from better situated families . an extensive study on child nutrition has revealed that germany 's long-term unemployed can not offer their families a well-balanced diet . " it 's hardly possible for these welfare recipients to feed their children healthy food , " said mathilde kersting from the research institute for child nutrition -lrb- fke -rrb- in dortmund . children in families getting long-term unemployment welfare , known as hartz iv , are n't going hungry .
but they are not eating the right types of food , kersting said . the study showed that the welfare payments had a daily allowance for food and beverages for children of 2.57 euros -lrb- $ 3.50 -rrb- and for teenagers over 14 years 3.42 euros . but , kersting said , even if families shopped at discount supermarkets , an average of 4.68 euros per day was necessary to still the appetite of a growing teenager with a balanced diet .
for four- to six year-olds , the allowance would just cover their needs if the groceries were bought at a discounter , she said . health problems are the outcome according to kersting , weight problems were the result .
in germany today , some 6 percent of all children and teenagers are overweight .
in low-income families , it was more than double this figure , she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : healthy food like this is often just too expensive kersting said this could lead to serious chronic illnesses , such as diabetes or arteriosclerosis , a thickening of the arterial walls . " so in an economic sense , it 's worthwhile for everyone to invest in a healthy diet , " kersting said . increased awareness is also necessary the fke said it recommended that benefit payments be reviewed .
but simply more money was not the answer . " it 's also important to convince these groups of the use of a well-balanced diet , " kersting said .
" we have to develop simple measures which can be implemented so that our nutritional information can reach these families better than it does up to now . " fke researchers compiled the prices of over 80 kinds of food which are necessary for a healthy diet .
they then calculated the costs for an optimized mixed diet - a concept developed by fke which aims to ensure healthy nutrition for children and teenagers at comparatively low costs . germany needs to improve its childcare system in a separate study , the konrad adenauer foundation found that children from less-educated families were less likely to attend a nursery school . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : early childhood daycare is not adequate in germany , a study shows the problems children from all levels of society faced were the same , though .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de labor market -pipe- 02.08.2007 germany debates easing labor limits for eastern europeans großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany needs more technical personnel - but where should it come from ?
a shortage of skilled labor could hit germany in the next few years , and workers from new eu member states could fill this gap .
yet politicians , unions and industry disagree on relaxing labor market restrictions . the latest unemployment figures for germany , released this week , showed over 3.7 million jobless in july .
yet companies have been saying for months that they can not find enough qualified personnel , for example in the engineering sector and other technical professions . the shortage of skilled labor is expected to continue in the coming years , leading the german labor ministry to suggest easing restrictions on workers from the new eu member states as a way of filling the gap . volker kauder , head of the parliamentary group of the christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- , is not in favor of the change , though .
he said this week that the labor pool had to be better exhausted domestically first .
it should be given priority over an inflow of labor from abroad . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kauder said more needs to be done to favor german workers " this would send the wrong signal , " kauder told the mass circulation daily bild .
" you ca n't on the one hand complain about wage dumping and , at the same time , on a grand scale bring workers to germany from romania and bulgaria , who are willing to work for low wages . " the free movement of labor is one of the fundamental rights guaranteed to eu citizens .
a german wanting to work in france does not face any major bureaucratic hurdles .
but this is not the case for workers from the new eu member states . the accession treaty allowed for transitional measures to protect national labor markets , and germany is one of the few eu nations which forces citizens from the new member states to apply for work permits .
it justifies the restrictions by pointing to its problems with unemployment and the fact that germany 's geographic proximity to the bloc 's new members means it could face more incoming workers than other countries . unions oppose easing restrictions at present , germany 's labor market constraints are in effect until 2009 .
kauder has said they should continue for a further two years , to 2011 .
no further extension is possible after that time , according to eu regulations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a large number of germans are still lining up at the employment office to find a job kauder has received support from the german labor unions , which do n't traditionally side with the conservative cdu .
axel brower-rabinowitsch , spokesman for the confederation of german trade unions dgb , said opening the labor market would not help alleviate unemployment . " our major concern is that the labor market is not in order right now , " brower-rabinowitsch said .
the unemployment figures showed that there were currently " a considerable number " of people who could be employed following further qualification or training . " this situation does not justify germany getting specialized personnel from abroad , " brower-rabinowitsch said , adding that over 200,000 young people have been waiting for apprenticeship training positions for over a year . " we can not take away the industry 's responsibility to train workers , " he said .
" it is their duty to do so . "
brower-rabinowitsch said every time there was economic improvement in germany , the private sector complained of a lack of skilled personnel . " but they neglected to train people in time , " he said . the cdu 's coalition partner , the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , agreed that the private sector had to first do its utmost to accommodate germany 's unemployed . " only when the industry can prove that it is giving long-term unemployed a fair chance with the help of labor market policies can it hope for understanding from political powers , " said ludwig stiegler , deputy head of the spd parliamentary group . immigration is economically necessary german industry has welcomed the idea of opening the labor market earlier than planned to eastern europeans .
analyst holger schäfer from the institute for business research -lrb- iw -rrb- in cologne said a strategy to further train german workers was necessary , but not the sole solution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : skilled personnel from abroad can boost the german economy " we do n't need qualification instead of immigration , " schäfer said .
" we need both . " according to schäfer , immigration was beneficial to the economy .
the majority of immigrant workers wanted to work and generated income .
this resulted in secondary effects for the overall economy . " of course , there are losers , namely those competing for these jobs , " he said .
" but the rest of society wins . " so why is there such opposition to easing restrictions ? " i think the fear of being steamrolled , and possibly a bit of xenophobia , leads to the rejection by german society , " schäfer said .

a shortage of skilled labor could hit germany in the next few years , and workers from new eu member states could fill this gap .
yet politicians , unions and industry disagree on relaxing labor market restrictions . the latest unemployment figures for germany , released this week , showed over 3.7 million jobless in july .
yet companies have been saying for months that they can not find enough qualified personnel , for example in the engineering sector and other technical professions . the shortage of skilled labor is expected to continue in the coming years , leading the german labor ministry to suggest easing restrictions on workers from the new eu member states as a way of filling the gap . volker kauder , head of the parliamentary group of the christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- , is not in favor of the change , though .
he said this week that the labor pool had to be better exhausted domestically first .
it should be given priority over an inflow of labor from abroad . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kauder said more needs to be done to favor german workers " this would send the wrong signal , " kauder told the mass circulation daily bild .
" you ca n't on the one hand complain about wage dumping and , at the same time , on a grand scale bring workers to germany from romania and bulgaria , who are willing to work for low wages . " the free movement of labor is one of the fundamental rights guaranteed to eu citizens .
a german wanting to work in france does not face any major bureaucratic hurdles .
but this is not the case for workers from the new eu member states . the accession treaty allowed for transitional measures to protect national labor markets , and germany is one of the few eu nations which forces citizens from the new member states to apply for work permits .
it justifies the restrictions by pointing to its problems with unemployment and the fact that germany 's geographic proximity to the bloc 's new members means it could face more incoming workers than other countries . unions oppose easing restrictions at present , germany 's labor market constraints are in effect until 2009 .
kauder has said they should continue for a further two years , to 2011 .
no further extension is possible after that time , according to eu regulations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a large number of germans are still lining up at the employment office to find a job kauder has received support from the german labor unions , which do n't traditionally side with the conservative cdu .
axel brower-rabinowitsch , spokesman for the confederation of german trade unions dgb , said opening the labor market would not help alleviate unemployment . " our major concern is that the labor market is not in order right now , " brower-rabinowitsch said .
the unemployment figures showed that there were currently " a considerable number " of people who could be employed following further qualification or training . " this situation does not justify germany getting specialized personnel from abroad , " brower-rabinowitsch said , adding that over 200,000 young people have been waiting for apprenticeship training positions for over a year . " we can not take away the industry 's responsibility to train workers , " he said .
" it is their duty to do so . "
brower-rabinowitsch said every time there was economic improvement in germany , the private sector complained of a lack of skilled personnel . " but they neglected to train people in time , " he said . the cdu 's coalition partner , the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , agreed that the private sector had to first do its utmost to accommodate germany 's unemployed . " only when the industry can prove that it is giving long-term unemployed a fair chance with the help of labor market policies can it hope for understanding from political powers , " said ludwig stiegler , deputy head of the spd parliamentary group . immigration is economically necessary german industry has welcomed the idea of opening the labor market earlier than planned to eastern europeans .
analyst holger schäfer from the institute for business research -lrb- iw -rrb- in cologne said a strategy to further train german workers was necessary , but not the sole solution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : skilled personnel from abroad can boost the german economy " we do n't need qualification instead of immigration , " schäfer said .
" we need both . " according to schäfer , immigration was beneficial to the economy .
the majority of immigrant workers wanted to work and generated income .
this resulted in secondary effects for the overall economy . " of course , there are losers , namely those competing for these jobs , " he said .
" but the rest of society wins . " so why is there such opposition to easing restrictions ? " i think the fear of being steamrolled , and possibly a bit of xenophobia , leads to the rejection by german society , " schäfer said .
yet these fears are unfounded .

a shortage of skilled labor could hit germany in the next few years , and workers from new eu member states could fill this gap .
yet politicians , unions and industry disagree on relaxing labor market restrictions . the latest unemployment figures for germany , released this week , showed over 3.7 million jobless in july .
yet companies have been saying for months that they can not find enough qualified personnel , for example in the engineering sector and other technical professions . the shortage of skilled labor is expected to continue in the coming years , leading the german labor ministry to suggest easing restrictions on workers from the new eu member states as a way of filling the gap . volker kauder , head of the parliamentary group of the christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- , is not in favor of the change , though .
he said this week that the labor pool had to be better exhausted domestically first .
it should be given priority over an inflow of labor from abroad . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kauder said more needs to be done to favor german workers " this would send the wrong signal , " kauder told the mass circulation daily bild .
" you ca n't on the one hand complain about wage dumping and , at the same time , on a grand scale bring workers to germany from romania and bulgaria , who are willing to work for low wages . " the free movement of labor is one of the fundamental rights guaranteed to eu citizens .
a german wanting to work in france does not face any major bureaucratic hurdles .
but this is not the case for workers from the new eu member states . the accession treaty allowed for transitional measures to protect national labor markets , and germany is one of the few eu nations which forces citizens from the new member states to apply for work permits .
it justifies the restrictions by pointing to its problems with unemployment and the fact that germany 's geographic proximity to the bloc 's new members means it could face more incoming workers than other countries . unions oppose easing restrictions at present , germany 's labor market constraints are in effect until 2009 .
kauder has said they should continue for a further two years , to 2011 .
no further extension is possible after that time , according to eu regulations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a large number of germans are still lining up at the employment office to find a job kauder has received support from the german labor unions , which do n't traditionally side with the conservative cdu .
axel brower-rabinowitsch , spokesman for the confederation of german trade unions dgb , said opening the labor market would not help alleviate unemployment . " our major concern is that the labor market is not in order right now , " brower-rabinowitsch said .
the unemployment figures showed that there were currently " a considerable number " of people who could be employed following further qualification or training . " this situation does not justify germany getting specialized personnel from abroad , " brower-rabinowitsch said , adding that over 200,000 young people have been waiting for apprenticeship training positions for over a year . " we can not take away the industry 's responsibility to train workers , " he said .
" it is their duty to do so . "
brower-rabinowitsch said every time there was economic improvement in germany , the private sector complained of a lack of skilled personnel . " but they neglected to train people in time , " he said . the cdu 's coalition partner , the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , agreed that the private sector had to first do its utmost to accommodate germany 's unemployed . " only when the industry can prove that it is giving long-term unemployed a fair chance with the help of labor market policies can it hope for understanding from political powers , " said ludwig stiegler , deputy head of the spd parliamentary group . immigration is economically necessary german industry has welcomed the idea of opening the labor market earlier than planned to eastern europeans .
analyst holger schäfer from the institute for business research -lrb- iw -rrb- in cologne said a strategy to further train german workers was necessary , but not the sole solution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : skilled personnel from abroad can boost the german economy " we do n't need qualification instead of immigration , " schäfer said .
" we need both . " according to schäfer , immigration was beneficial to the economy .
the majority of immigrant workers wanted to work and generated income .
this resulted in secondary effects for the overall economy . " of course , there are losers , namely those competing for these jobs , " he said .
" but the rest of society wins . " so why is there such opposition to easing restrictions ? " i think the fear of being steamrolled , and possibly a bit of xenophobia , leads to the rejection by german society , " schäfer said .
yet these fears are unfounded .
studies showed that some 200,000 workers per year would come to germany in the first stages .
over a 20-year period , the figure would total two to four million people , he said . " we really have to take leave of this notion that people are going to be lining up to get in , " he said . the think-tank iw is an association whose members include leading employer and economic federations .
it serves the interests of the private sector . benefit of minimum wage disputed there are also fears on the part of the unions that immigrant labor from eastern europe would lead to wage dumping on the german labor market or put pressure on existing wage agreements .
for this reason brower-rabinowitsch said the government needed to introduce a minimum wage before lifting restrictions on foreign workers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : skilled construction workers are becoming hard to find in poland however , schäfer said that wage dumping did not occur when the german labor market opened to southern european workers in the 1980s and that a minimum wage would not help the economy . " a minimum wage would prevent foreign workers from coming to germany , " schäfer said .
" then , there ca n't be any economic benefits from immigration . " poland worried about lack of skilled labor germany is getting support for its concerns from its eastern neighbor .
since eu expansion , polish workers in particular have left their home country to find work in britain and ireland , which have no labor restrictions for new eu states .
a recent study by the warsaw-based market research company arc ryneki i opinia showed that mostly well-educated poles are leaving - and are n't coming back . " this is a threat to polish employers , " jeremi mordasewicz , a labor market expert from the polish employers ' association lewiatan , told the paper financial times deutschland . many companies , especially in the construction sector , were desperately seeking qualified personnel in poland , he said . german government deputy spokesman thomas steg said a decision would most likely be made at the beginning of 2009 if the labor market restrictions would be extended to 2011 . the issue will be discussed at the next cabinet meeting in late august , after the summer break . sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

yet companies have been saying for months that they can not find enough qualified personnel , for example in the engineering sector and other technical professions . the shortage of skilled labor is expected to continue in the coming years , leading the german labor ministry to suggest easing restrictions on workers from the new eu member states as a way of filling the gap . volker kauder , head of the parliamentary group of the christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- , is not in favor of the change , though .
he said this week that the labor pool had to be better exhausted domestically first .
it should be given priority over an inflow of labor from abroad . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kauder said more needs to be done to favor german workers " this would send the wrong signal , " kauder told the mass circulation daily bild .
" you ca n't on the one hand complain about wage dumping and , at the same time , on a grand scale bring workers to germany from romania and bulgaria , who are willing to work for low wages . " the free movement of labor is one of the fundamental rights guaranteed to eu citizens .
a german wanting to work in france does not face any major bureaucratic hurdles .
but this is not the case for workers from the new eu member states . the accession treaty allowed for transitional measures to protect national labor markets , and germany is one of the few eu nations which forces citizens from the new member states to apply for work permits .
it justifies the restrictions by pointing to its problems with unemployment and the fact that germany 's geographic proximity to the bloc 's new members means it could face more incoming workers than other countries . unions oppose easing restrictions at present , germany 's labor market constraints are in effect until 2009 .
kauder has said they should continue for a further two years , to 2011 .
no further extension is possible after that time , according to eu regulations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a large number of germans are still lining up at the employment office to find a job kauder has received support from the german labor unions , which do n't traditionally side with the conservative cdu .
axel brower-rabinowitsch , spokesman for the confederation of german trade unions dgb , said opening the labor market would not help alleviate unemployment . " our major concern is that the labor market is not in order right now , " brower-rabinowitsch said .
the unemployment figures showed that there were currently " a considerable number " of people who could be employed following further qualification or training . " this situation does not justify germany getting specialized personnel from abroad , " brower-rabinowitsch said , adding that over 200,000 young people have been waiting for apprenticeship training positions for over a year . " we can not take away the industry 's responsibility to train workers , " he said .
" it is their duty to do so . "
brower-rabinowitsch said every time there was economic improvement in germany , the private sector complained of a lack of skilled personnel . " but they neglected to train people in time , " he said . the cdu 's coalition partner , the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , agreed that the private sector had to first do its utmost to accommodate germany 's unemployed . " only when the industry can prove that it is giving long-term unemployed a fair chance with the help of labor market policies can it hope for understanding from political powers , " said ludwig stiegler , deputy head of the spd parliamentary group . immigration is economically necessary german industry has welcomed the idea of opening the labor market earlier than planned to eastern europeans .
analyst holger schäfer from the institute for business research -lrb- iw -rrb- in cologne said a strategy to further train german workers was necessary , but not the sole solution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : skilled personnel from abroad can boost the german economy " we do n't need qualification instead of immigration , " schäfer said .
" we need both . " according to schäfer , immigration was beneficial to the economy .
the majority of immigrant workers wanted to work and generated income .
this resulted in secondary effects for the overall economy . " of course , there are losers , namely those competing for these jobs , " he said .
" but the rest of society wins . " so why is there such opposition to easing restrictions ? " i think the fear of being steamrolled , and possibly a bit of xenophobia , leads to the rejection by german society , " schäfer said .
yet these fears are unfounded .
studies showed that some 200,000 workers per year would come to germany in the first stages .
over a 20-year period , the figure would total two to four million people , he said . " we really have to take leave of this notion that people are going to be lining up to get in , " he said . the think-tank iw is an association whose members include leading employer and economic federations .
it serves the interests of the private sector . benefit of minimum wage disputed there are also fears on the part of the unions that immigrant labor from eastern europe would lead to wage dumping on the german labor market or put pressure on existing wage agreements .
for this reason brower-rabinowitsch said the government needed to introduce a minimum wage before lifting restrictions on foreign workers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : skilled construction workers are becoming hard to find in poland however , schäfer said that wage dumping did not occur when the german labor market opened to southern european workers in the 1980s and that a minimum wage would not help the economy . " a minimum wage would prevent foreign workers from coming to germany , " schäfer said .
" then , there ca n't be any economic benefits from immigration . " poland worried about lack of skilled labor germany is getting support for its concerns from its eastern neighbor .
since eu expansion , polish workers in particular have left their home country to find work in britain and ireland , which have no labor restrictions for new eu states .
a recent study by the warsaw-based market research company arc ryneki i opinia showed that mostly well-educated poles are leaving - and are n't coming back . " this is a threat to polish employers , " jeremi mordasewicz , a labor market expert from the polish employers ' association lewiatan , told the paper financial times deutschland . many companies , especially in the construction sector , were desperately seeking qualified personnel in poland , he said . german government deputy spokesman thomas steg said a decision would most likely be made at the beginning of 2009 if the labor market restrictions would be extended to 2011 . the issue will be discussed at the next cabinet meeting in late august , after the summer break . sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

analyst holger schäfer from the institute for business research -lrb- iw -rrb- in cologne said a strategy to further train german workers was necessary , but not the sole solution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : skilled personnel from abroad can boost the german economy " we do n't need qualification instead of immigration , " schäfer said .
" we need both . " according to schäfer , immigration was beneficial to the economy .
the majority of immigrant workers wanted to work and generated income .
this resulted in secondary effects for the overall economy . " of course , there are losers , namely those competing for these jobs , " he said .
" but the rest of society wins . " so why is there such opposition to easing restrictions ? " i think the fear of being steamrolled , and possibly a bit of xenophobia , leads to the rejection by german society , " schäfer said .
yet these fears are unfounded .
studies showed that some 200,000 workers per year would come to germany in the first stages .
over a 20-year period , the figure would total two to four million people , he said . " we really have to take leave of this notion that people are going to be lining up to get in , " he said . the think-tank iw is an association whose members include leading employer and economic federations .
it serves the interests of the private sector . benefit of minimum wage disputed there are also fears on the part of the unions that immigrant labor from eastern europe would lead to wage dumping on the german labor market or put pressure on existing wage agreements .
for this reason brower-rabinowitsch said the government needed to introduce a minimum wage before lifting restrictions on foreign workers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : skilled construction workers are becoming hard to find in poland however , schäfer said that wage dumping did not occur when the german labor market opened to southern european workers in the 1980s and that a minimum wage would not help the economy . " a minimum wage would prevent foreign workers from coming to germany , " schäfer said .
" then , there ca n't be any economic benefits from immigration . " poland worried about lack of skilled labor germany is getting support for its concerns from its eastern neighbor .
since eu expansion , polish workers in particular have left their home country to find work in britain and ireland , which have no labor restrictions for new eu states .
a recent study by the warsaw-based market research company arc ryneki i opinia showed that mostly well-educated poles are leaving - and are n't coming back . " this is a threat to polish employers , " jeremi mordasewicz , a labor market expert from the polish employers ' association lewiatan , told the paper financial times deutschland . many companies , especially in the construction sector , were desperately seeking qualified personnel in poland , he said . german government deputy spokesman thomas steg said a decision would most likely be made at the beginning of 2009 if the labor market restrictions would be extended to 2011 . the issue will be discussed at the next cabinet meeting in late august , after the summer break . sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

born in hungary in 1971 , author terezia mora moved to berlin in 1990 , where she studied theater and screenwriting . have you read a good english translation of a book written in german ?

these kids are more likely to suffer from weight problems than their peers from better situated families . an extensive study on child nutrition has revealed that germany 's long-term unemployed can not offer their families a well-balanced diet . " it 's hardly possible for these welfare recipients to feed their children healthy food , " said mathilde kersting from the research institute for child nutrition -lrb- fke -rrb- in dortmund . children in families getting long-term unemployment welfare , known as hartz iv , are n't going hungry .
but they are not eating the right types of food , kersting said . the study showed that the welfare payments had a daily allowance for food and beverages for children of 2.57 euros -lrb- $ 3.50 -rrb- and for teenagers over 14 years 3.42 euros . but , kersting said , even if families shopped at discount supermarkets , an average of 4.68 euros per day was necessary to still the appetite of a growing teenager with a balanced diet .
for four- to six year-olds , the allowance would just cover their needs if the groceries were bought at a discounter , she said . health problems are the outcome according to kersting , weight problems were the result .
in germany today , some 6 percent of all children and teenagers are overweight .
in low-income families , it was more than double this figure , she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : healthy food like this is often just too expensive kersting said this could lead to serious chronic illnesses , such as diabetes or arteriosclerosis , a thickening of the arterial walls . " so in an economic sense , it 's worthwhile for everyone to invest in a healthy diet , " kersting said . increased awareness is also necessary the fke said it recommended that benefit payments be reviewed .
but simply more money was not the answer . " it 's also important to convince these groups of the use of a well-balanced diet , " kersting said .
" we have to develop simple measures which can be implemented so that our nutritional information can reach these families better than it does up to now . " fke researchers compiled the prices of over 80 kinds of food which are necessary for a healthy diet .
they then calculated the costs for an optimized mixed diet - a concept developed by fke which aims to ensure healthy nutrition for children and teenagers at comparatively low costs . germany needs to improve its childcare system in a separate study , the konrad adenauer foundation found that children from less-educated families were less likely to attend a nursery school . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : early childhood daycare is not adequate in germany , a study shows the problems children from all levels of society faced were the same , though .
the country needed to do much more to ensure adequate care for small children , the study on early childhood education and care in germany revealed . co-author ilse wehrmann said daycare workers and nursery teachers needed to be better trained to adequately care for children under the age of three .
germany was 15 to 20 years behind its european neighbors in this aspect and had a lot of catching up to do , wehrmann said . " they can not even diagnose developmental disorders among small children , " wehrmann said at the presentation of the study in berlin on wednesday . german family minister ursula von der leyen has pushed through new childcare policies to significantly increase the number of daycare spots for young children in the next five years .
the efforts are a bid to make it easier for mothers to work and to reverse the declining birthrate . child groups in daycare facilities were also frequently too large , the foundation said . article based on news reports -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de labor market -pipe- 02.08.2007 germany debates easing labor limits for eastern europeans großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany needs more technical personnel - but where should it come from ?
a shortage of skilled labor could hit germany in the next few years , and workers from new eu member states could fill this gap .
yet politicians , unions and industry disagree on relaxing labor market restrictions . the latest unemployment figures for germany , released this week , showed over 3.7 million jobless in july .
yet companies have been saying for months that they can not find enough qualified personnel , for example in the engineering sector and other technical professions . the shortage of skilled labor is expected to continue in the coming years , leading the german labor ministry to suggest easing restrictions on workers from the new eu member states as a way of filling the gap . volker kauder , head of the parliamentary group of the christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- , is not in favor of the change , though .
he said this week that the labor pool had to be better exhausted domestically first .
it should be given priority over an inflow of labor from abroad . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kauder said more needs to be done to favor german workers " this would send the wrong signal , " kauder told the mass circulation daily bild .
" you ca n't on the one hand complain about wage dumping and , at the same time , on a grand scale bring workers to germany from romania and bulgaria , who are willing to work for low wages . " the free movement of labor is one of the fundamental rights guaranteed to eu citizens .
a german wanting to work in france does not face any major bureaucratic hurdles .
but this is not the case for workers from the new eu member states . the accession treaty allowed for transitional measures to protect national labor markets , and germany is one of the few eu nations which forces citizens from the new member states to apply for work permits .
it justifies the restrictions by pointing to its problems with unemployment and the fact that germany 's geographic proximity to the bloc 's new members means it could face more incoming workers than other countries . unions oppose easing restrictions at present , germany 's labor market constraints are in effect until 2009 .
kauder has said they should continue for a further two years , to 2011 .
no further extension is possible after that time , according to eu regulations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a large number of germans are still lining up at the employment office to find a job kauder has received support from the german labor unions , which do n't traditionally side with the conservative cdu .
axel brower-rabinowitsch , spokesman for the confederation of german trade unions dgb , said opening the labor market would not help alleviate unemployment . " our major concern is that the labor market is not in order right now , " brower-rabinowitsch said .
the unemployment figures showed that there were currently " a considerable number " of people who could be employed following further qualification or training . " this situation does not justify germany getting specialized personnel from abroad , " brower-rabinowitsch said , adding that over 200,000 young people have been waiting for apprenticeship training positions for over a year . " we can not take away the industry 's responsibility to train workers , " he said .
" it is their duty to do so . "
brower-rabinowitsch said every time there was economic improvement in germany , the private sector complained of a lack of skilled personnel . " but they neglected to train people in time , " he said . the cdu 's coalition partner , the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , agreed that the private sector had to first do its utmost to accommodate germany 's unemployed . " only when the industry can prove that it is giving long-term unemployed a fair chance with the help of labor market policies can it hope for understanding from political powers , " said ludwig stiegler , deputy head of the spd parliamentary group . immigration is economically necessary german industry has welcomed the idea of opening the labor market earlier than planned to eastern europeans .
analyst holger schäfer from the institute for business research -lrb- iw -rrb- in cologne said a strategy to further train german workers was necessary , but not the sole solution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : skilled personnel from abroad can boost the german economy " we do n't need qualification instead of immigration , " schäfer said .
" we need both . " according to schäfer , immigration was beneficial to the economy .
the majority of immigrant workers wanted to work and generated income .
this resulted in secondary effects for the overall economy . " of course , there are losers , namely those competing for these jobs , " he said .
" but the rest of society wins . " so why is there such opposition to easing restrictions ? " i think the fear of being steamrolled , and possibly a bit of xenophobia , leads to the rejection by german society , " schäfer said .
yet these fears are unfounded .
studies showed that some 200,000 workers per year would come to germany in the first stages .
over a 20-year period , the figure would total two to four million people , he said . " we really have to take leave of this notion that people are going to be lining up to get in , " he said . the think-tank iw is an association whose members include leading employer and economic federations .
it serves the interests of the private sector . benefit of minimum wage disputed there are also fears on the part of the unions that immigrant labor from eastern europe would lead to wage dumping on the german labor market or put pressure on existing wage agreements .
for this reason brower-rabinowitsch said the government needed to introduce a minimum wage before lifting restrictions on foreign workers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : skilled construction workers are becoming hard to find in poland however , schäfer said that wage dumping did not occur when the german labor market opened to southern european workers in the 1980s and that a minimum wage would not help the economy . " a minimum wage would prevent foreign workers from coming to germany , " schäfer said .
" then , there ca n't be any economic benefits from immigration . " poland worried about lack of skilled labor germany is getting support for its concerns from its eastern neighbor .
since eu expansion , polish workers in particular have left their home country to find work in britain and ireland , which have no labor restrictions for new eu states .
a recent study by the warsaw-based market research company arc ryneki i opinia showed that mostly well-educated poles are leaving - and are n't coming back . " this is a threat to polish employers , " jeremi mordasewicz , a labor market expert from the polish employers ' association lewiatan , told the paper financial times deutschland . many companies , especially in the construction sector , were desperately seeking qualified personnel in poland , he said . german government deputy spokesman thomas steg said a decision would most likely be made at the beginning of 2009 if the labor market restrictions would be extended to 2011 . the issue will be discussed at the next cabinet meeting in late august , after the summer break . sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

these kids are more likely to suffer from weight problems than their peers from better situated families . an extensive study on child nutrition has revealed that germany 's long-term unemployed can not offer their families a well-balanced diet . " it 's hardly possible for these welfare recipients to feed their children healthy food , " said mathilde kersting from the research institute for child nutrition -lrb- fke -rrb- in dortmund . children in families getting long-term unemployment welfare , known as hartz iv , are n't going hungry .
but they are not eating the right types of food , kersting said . the study showed that the welfare payments had a daily allowance for food and beverages for children of 2.57 euros -lrb- $ 3.50 -rrb- and for teenagers over 14 years 3.42 euros . but , kersting said , even if families shopped at discount supermarkets , an average of 4.68 euros per day was necessary to still the appetite of a growing teenager with a balanced diet .
for four- to six year-olds , the allowance would just cover their needs if the groceries were bought at a discounter , she said . health problems are the outcome according to kersting , weight problems were the result .

" we have to develop simple measures which can be implemented so that our nutritional information can reach these families better than it does up to now . " fke researchers compiled the prices of over 80 kinds of food which are necessary for a healthy diet .

germany was 15 to 20 years behind its european neighbors in this aspect and had a lot of catching up to do , wehrmann said .

these kids are more likely to suffer from weight problems than their peers from better situated families . an extensive study on child nutrition has revealed that germany 's long-term unemployed can not offer their families a well-balanced diet . " it 's hardly possible for these welfare recipients to feed their children healthy food , " said mathilde kersting from the research institute for child nutrition -lrb- fke -rrb- in dortmund . children in families getting long-term unemployment welfare , known as hartz iv , are n't going hungry .
but they are not eating the right types of food , kersting said . the study showed that the welfare payments had a daily allowance for food and beverages for children of 2.57 euros -lrb- $ 3.50 -rrb- and for teenagers over 14 years 3.42 euros . but , kersting said , even if families shopped at discount supermarkets , an average of 4.68 euros per day was necessary to still the appetite of a growing teenager with a balanced diet .
for four- to six year-olds , the allowance would just cover their needs if the groceries were bought at a discounter , she said . health problems are the outcome according to kersting , weight problems were the result .
in germany today , some 6 percent of all children and teenagers are overweight .
in low-income families , it was more than double this figure , she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : healthy food like this is often just too expensive kersting said this could lead to serious chronic illnesses , such as diabetes or arteriosclerosis , a thickening of the arterial walls . " so in an economic sense , it 's worthwhile for everyone to invest in a healthy diet , " kersting said . increased awareness is also necessary the fke said it recommended that benefit payments be reviewed .
but simply more money was not the answer . " it 's also important to convince these groups of the use of a well-balanced diet , " kersting said .
" we have to develop simple measures which can be implemented so that our nutritional information can reach these families better than it does up to now . " fke researchers compiled the prices of over 80 kinds of food which are necessary for a healthy diet .
they then calculated the costs for an optimized mixed diet - a concept developed by fke which aims to ensure healthy nutrition for children and teenagers at comparatively low costs . germany needs to improve its childcare system in a separate study , the konrad adenauer foundation found that children from less-educated families were less likely to attend a nursery school . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : early childhood daycare is not adequate in germany , a study shows the problems children from all levels of society faced were the same , though .
the country needed to do much more to ensure adequate care for small children , the study on early childhood education and care in germany revealed . co-author ilse wehrmann said daycare workers and nursery teachers needed to be better trained to adequately care for children under the age of three .
germany was 15 to 20 years behind its european neighbors in this aspect and had a lot of catching up to do , wehrmann said .

a shortage of skilled labor could hit germany in the next few years , and workers from new eu member states could fill this gap .
yet politicians , unions and industry disagree on relaxing labor market restrictions . the latest unemployment figures for germany , released this week , showed over 3.7 million jobless in july .
yet companies have been saying for months that they can not find enough qualified personnel , for example in the engineering sector and other technical professions . the shortage of skilled labor is expected to continue in the coming years , leading the german labor ministry to suggest easing restrictions on workers from the new eu member states as a way of filling the gap . volker kauder , head of the parliamentary group of the christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- , is not in favor of the change , though .
he said this week that the labor pool had to be better exhausted domestically first .
it should be given priority over an inflow of labor from abroad . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kauder said more needs to be done to favor german workers " this would send the wrong signal , " kauder told the mass circulation daily bild .
" you ca n't on the one hand complain about wage dumping and , at the same time , on a grand scale bring workers to germany from romania and bulgaria , who are willing to work for low wages . " the free movement of labor is one of the fundamental rights guaranteed to eu citizens .
a german wanting to work in france does not face any major bureaucratic hurdles .
but this is not the case for workers from the new eu member states . the accession treaty allowed for transitional measures to protect national labor markets , and germany is one of the few eu nations which forces citizens from the new member states to apply for work permits .
it justifies the restrictions by pointing to its problems with unemployment and the fact that germany 's geographic proximity to the bloc 's new members means it could face more incoming workers than other countries . unions oppose easing restrictions at present , germany 's labor market constraints are in effect until 2009 .
kauder has said they should continue for a further two years , to 2011 .
no further extension is possible after that time , according to eu regulations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a large number of germans are still lining up at the employment office to find a job kauder has received support from the german labor unions , which do n't traditionally side with the conservative cdu .
axel brower-rabinowitsch , spokesman for the confederation of german trade unions dgb , said opening the labor market would not help alleviate unemployment . " our major concern is that the labor market is not in order right now , " brower-rabinowitsch said .
the unemployment figures showed that there were currently " a considerable number " of people who could be employed following further qualification or training . " this situation does not justify germany getting specialized personnel from abroad , " brower-rabinowitsch said , adding that over 200,000 young people have been waiting for apprenticeship training positions for over a year . " we can not take away the industry 's responsibility to train workers , " he said .
" it is their duty to do so . "
brower-rabinowitsch said every time there was economic improvement in germany , the private sector complained of a lack of skilled personnel . " but they neglected to train people in time , " he said . the cdu 's coalition partner , the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , agreed that the private sector had to first do its utmost to accommodate germany 's unemployed . " only when the industry can prove that it is giving long-term unemployed a fair chance with the help of labor market policies can it hope for understanding from political powers , " said ludwig stiegler , deputy head of the spd parliamentary group . immigration is economically necessary german industry has welcomed the idea of opening the labor market earlier than planned to eastern europeans .
analyst holger schäfer from the institute for business research -lrb- iw -rrb- in cologne said a strategy to further train german workers was necessary , but not the sole solution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : skilled personnel from abroad can boost the german economy " we do n't need qualification instead of immigration , " schäfer said .
" we need both . " according to schäfer , immigration was beneficial to the economy .
the majority of immigrant workers wanted to work and generated income .
this resulted in secondary effects for the overall economy . " of course , there are losers , namely those competing for these jobs , " he said .
" but the rest of society wins . " so why is there such opposition to easing restrictions ? " i think the fear of being steamrolled , and possibly a bit of xenophobia , leads to the rejection by german society , " schäfer said .
yet these fears are unfounded .
studies showed that some 200,000 workers per year would come to germany in the first stages .
over a 20-year period , the figure would total two to four million people , he said . " we really have to take leave of this notion that people are going to be lining up to get in , " he said . the think-tank iw is an association whose members include leading employer and economic federations .
it serves the interests of the private sector . benefit of minimum wage disputed there are also fears on the part of the unions that immigrant labor from eastern europe would lead to wage dumping on the german labor market or put pressure on existing wage agreements .
for this reason brower-rabinowitsch said the government needed to introduce a minimum wage before lifting restrictions on foreign workers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : skilled construction workers are becoming hard to find in poland however , schäfer said that wage dumping did not occur when the german labor market opened to southern european workers in the 1980s and that a minimum wage would not help the economy . " a minimum wage would prevent foreign workers from coming to germany , " schäfer said .
" then , there ca n't be any economic benefits from immigration . " poland worried about lack of skilled labor germany is getting support for its concerns from its eastern neighbor .
since eu expansion , polish workers in particular have left their home country to find work in britain and ireland , which have no labor restrictions for new eu states .
a recent study by the warsaw-based market research company arc ryneki i opinia showed that mostly well-educated poles are leaving - and are n't coming back . " this is a threat to polish employers , " jeremi mordasewicz , a labor market expert from the polish employers ' association lewiatan , told the paper financial times deutschland . many companies , especially in the construction sector , were desperately seeking qualified personnel in poland , he said . german government deputy spokesman thomas steg said a decision would most likely be made at the beginning of 2009 if the labor market restrictions would be extended to 2011 . the issue will be discussed at the next cabinet meeting in late august , after the summer break . sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

these kids are more likely to suffer from weight problems than their peers from better situated families . an extensive study on child nutrition has revealed that germany 's long-term unemployed can not offer their families a well-balanced diet . " it 's hardly possible for these welfare recipients to feed their children healthy food , " said mathilde kersting from the research institute for child nutrition -lrb- fke -rrb- in dortmund . children in families getting long-term unemployment welfare , known as hartz iv , are n't going hungry .

" we have to develop simple measures which can be implemented so that our nutritional information can reach these families better than it does up to now . " fke researchers compiled the prices of over 80 kinds of food which are necessary for a healthy diet .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de labor market -pipe- 02.08.2007 germany debates easing labor limits for eastern europeans großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany needs more technical personnel - but where should it come from ?
a shortage of skilled labor could hit germany in the next few years , and workers from new eu member states could fill this gap .
yet politicians , unions and industry disagree on relaxing labor market restrictions . the latest unemployment figures for germany , released this week , showed over 3.7 million jobless in july .
yet companies have been saying for months that they can not find enough qualified personnel , for example in the engineering sector and other technical professions . the shortage of skilled labor is expected to continue in the coming years , leading the german labor ministry to suggest easing restrictions on workers from the new eu member states as a way of filling the gap . volker kauder , head of the parliamentary group of the christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- , is not in favor of the change , though .
he said this week that the labor pool had to be better exhausted domestically first .
it should be given priority over an inflow of labor from abroad . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kauder said more needs to be done to favor german workers " this would send the wrong signal , " kauder told the mass circulation daily bild .
" you ca n't on the one hand complain about wage dumping and , at the same time , on a grand scale bring workers to germany from romania and bulgaria , who are willing to work for low wages . " the free movement of labor is one of the fundamental rights guaranteed to eu citizens .
a german wanting to work in france does not face any major bureaucratic hurdles .
but this is not the case for workers from the new eu member states . the accession treaty allowed for transitional measures to protect national labor markets , and germany is one of the few eu nations which forces citizens from the new member states to apply for work permits .
it justifies the restrictions by pointing to its problems with unemployment and the fact that germany 's geographic proximity to the bloc 's new members means it could face more incoming workers than other countries . unions oppose easing restrictions at present , germany 's labor market constraints are in effect until 2009 .
kauder has said they should continue for a further two years , to 2011 .
no further extension is possible after that time , according to eu regulations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a large number of germans are still lining up at the employment office to find a job kauder has received support from the german labor unions , which do n't traditionally side with the conservative cdu .
axel brower-rabinowitsch , spokesman for the confederation of german trade unions dgb , said opening the labor market would not help alleviate unemployment . " our major concern is that the labor market is not in order right now , " brower-rabinowitsch said .
the unemployment figures showed that there were currently " a considerable number " of people who could be employed following further qualification or training . " this situation does not justify germany getting specialized personnel from abroad , " brower-rabinowitsch said , adding that over 200,000 young people have been waiting for apprenticeship training positions for over a year . " we can not take away the industry 's responsibility to train workers , " he said .
" it is their duty to do so . "
brower-rabinowitsch said every time there was economic improvement in germany , the private sector complained of a lack of skilled personnel . " but they neglected to train people in time , " he said . the cdu 's coalition partner , the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , agreed that the private sector had to first do its utmost to accommodate germany 's unemployed . " only when the industry can prove that it is giving long-term unemployed a fair chance with the help of labor market policies can it hope for understanding from political powers , " said ludwig stiegler , deputy head of the spd parliamentary group . immigration is economically necessary german industry has welcomed the idea of opening the labor market earlier than planned to eastern europeans .
analyst holger schäfer from the institute for business research -lrb- iw -rrb- in cologne said a strategy to further train german workers was necessary , but not the sole solution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : skilled personnel from abroad can boost the german economy " we do n't need qualification instead of immigration , " schäfer said .
" we need both . " according to schäfer , immigration was beneficial to the economy .
the majority of immigrant workers wanted to work and generated income .
this resulted in secondary effects for the overall economy . " of course , there are losers , namely those competing for these jobs , " he said .
" but the rest of society wins . " so why is there such opposition to easing restrictions ? " i think the fear of being steamrolled , and possibly a bit of xenophobia , leads to the rejection by german society , " schäfer said .
yet these fears are unfounded .
studies showed that some 200,000 workers per year would come to germany in the first stages .
over a 20-year period , the figure would total two to four million people , he said . " we really have to take leave of this notion that people are going to be lining up to get in , " he said . the think-tank iw is an association whose members include leading employer and economic federations .
it serves the interests of the private sector . benefit of minimum wage disputed there are also fears on the part of the unions that immigrant labor from eastern europe would lead to wage dumping on the german labor market or put pressure on existing wage agreements .
for this reason brower-rabinowitsch said the government needed to introduce a minimum wage before lifting restrictions on foreign workers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : skilled construction workers are becoming hard to find in poland however , schäfer said that wage dumping did not occur when the german labor market opened to southern european workers in the 1980s and that a minimum wage would not help the economy .

a shortage of skilled labor could hit germany in the next few years , and workers from new eu member states could fill this gap .
yet politicians , unions and industry disagree on relaxing labor market restrictions . the latest unemployment figures for germany , released this week , showed over 3.7 million jobless in july .
yet companies have been saying for months that they can not find enough qualified personnel , for example in the engineering sector and other technical professions . the shortage of skilled labor is expected to continue in the coming years , leading the german labor ministry to suggest easing restrictions on workers from the new eu member states as a way of filling the gap . volker kauder , head of the parliamentary group of the christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- , is not in favor of the change , though .
he said this week that the labor pool had to be better exhausted domestically first .
it should be given priority over an inflow of labor from abroad . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kauder said more needs to be done to favor german workers " this would send the wrong signal , " kauder told the mass circulation daily bild .
" you ca n't on the one hand complain about wage dumping and , at the same time , on a grand scale bring workers to germany from romania and bulgaria , who are willing to work for low wages . " the free movement of labor is one of the fundamental rights guaranteed to eu citizens .
a german wanting to work in france does not face any major bureaucratic hurdles .
but this is not the case for workers from the new eu member states . the accession treaty allowed for transitional measures to protect national labor markets , and germany is one of the few eu nations which forces citizens from the new member states to apply for work permits .
it justifies the restrictions by pointing to its problems with unemployment and the fact that germany 's geographic proximity to the bloc 's new members means it could face more incoming workers than other countries . unions oppose easing restrictions at present , germany 's labor market constraints are in effect until 2009 .
kauder has said they should continue for a further two years , to 2011 .
no further extension is possible after that time , according to eu regulations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a large number of germans are still lining up at the employment office to find a job kauder has received support from the german labor unions , which do n't traditionally side with the conservative cdu .
axel brower-rabinowitsch , spokesman for the confederation of german trade unions dgb , said opening the labor market would not help alleviate unemployment . " our major concern is that the labor market is not in order right now , " brower-rabinowitsch said .
the unemployment figures showed that there were currently " a considerable number " of people who could be employed following further qualification or training . " this situation does not justify germany getting specialized personnel from abroad , " brower-rabinowitsch said , adding that over 200,000 young people have been waiting for apprenticeship training positions for over a year . " we can not take away the industry 's responsibility to train workers , " he said .
" it is their duty to do so . "
brower-rabinowitsch said every time there was economic improvement in germany , the private sector complained of a lack of skilled personnel . " but they neglected to train people in time , " he said . the cdu 's coalition partner , the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , agreed that the private sector had to first do its utmost to accommodate germany 's unemployed . " only when the industry can prove that it is giving long-term unemployed a fair chance with the help of labor market policies can it hope for understanding from political powers , " said ludwig stiegler , deputy head of the spd parliamentary group . immigration is economically necessary german industry has welcomed the idea of opening the labor market earlier than planned to eastern europeans .
analyst holger schäfer from the institute for business research -lrb- iw -rrb- in cologne said a strategy to further train german workers was necessary , but not the sole solution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : skilled personnel from abroad can boost the german economy " we do n't need qualification instead of immigration , " schäfer said .
" we need both . " according to schäfer , immigration was beneficial to the economy .
the majority of immigrant workers wanted to work and generated income .
this resulted in secondary effects for the overall economy . " of course , there are losers , namely those competing for these jobs , " he said .
" but the rest of society wins . " so why is there such opposition to easing restrictions ? " i think the fear of being steamrolled , and possibly a bit of xenophobia , leads to the rejection by german society , " schäfer said .
yet these fears are unfounded .
studies showed that some 200,000 workers per year would come to germany in the first stages .
over a 20-year period , the figure would total two to four million people , he said . " we really have to take leave of this notion that people are going to be lining up to get in , " he said . the think-tank iw is an association whose members include leading employer and economic federations .
it serves the interests of the private sector . benefit of minimum wage disputed there are also fears on the part of the unions that immigrant labor from eastern europe would lead to wage dumping on the german labor market or put pressure on existing wage agreements .
for this reason brower-rabinowitsch said the government needed to introduce a minimum wage before lifting restrictions on foreign workers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : skilled construction workers are becoming hard to find in poland however , schäfer said that wage dumping did not occur when the german labor market opened to southern european workers in the 1980s and that a minimum wage would not help the economy . " a minimum wage would prevent foreign workers from coming to germany , " schäfer said .
" then , there ca n't be any economic benefits from immigration . " poland worried about lack of skilled labor germany is getting support for its concerns from its eastern neighbor .

these kids are more likely to suffer from weight problems than their peers from better situated families . an extensive study on child nutrition has revealed that germany 's long-term unemployed can not offer their families a well-balanced diet . " it 's hardly possible for these welfare recipients to feed their children healthy food , " said mathilde kersting from the research institute for child nutrition -lrb- fke -rrb- in dortmund . children in families getting long-term unemployment welfare , known as hartz iv , are n't going hungry .
but they are not eating the right types of food , kersting said . the study showed that the welfare payments had a daily allowance for food and beverages for children of 2.57 euros -lrb- $ 3.50 -rrb- and for teenagers over 14 years 3.42 euros . but , kersting said , even if families shopped at discount supermarkets , an average of 4.68 euros per day was necessary to still the appetite of a growing teenager with a balanced diet .
for four- to six year-olds , the allowance would just cover their needs if the groceries were bought at a discounter , she said . health problems are the outcome according to kersting , weight problems were the result .
in germany today , some 6 percent of all children and teenagers are overweight .
in low-income families , it was more than double this figure , she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : healthy food like this is often just too expensive kersting said this could lead to serious chronic illnesses , such as diabetes or arteriosclerosis , a thickening of the arterial walls . " so in an economic sense , it 's worthwhile for everyone to invest in a healthy diet , " kersting said . increased awareness is also necessary the fke said it recommended that benefit payments be reviewed .
but simply more money was not the answer . " it 's also important to convince these groups of the use of a well-balanced diet , " kersting said .
" we have to develop simple measures which can be implemented so that our nutritional information can reach these families better than it does up to now . " fke researchers compiled the prices of over 80 kinds of food which are necessary for a healthy diet .
they then calculated the costs for an optimized mixed diet - a concept developed by fke which aims to ensure healthy nutrition for children and teenagers at comparatively low costs . germany needs to improve its childcare system in a separate study , the konrad adenauer foundation found that children from less-educated families were less likely to attend a nursery school . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : early childhood daycare is not adequate in germany , a study shows the problems children from all levels of society faced were the same , though .
the country needed to do much more to ensure adequate care for small children , the study on early childhood education and care in germany revealed . co-author ilse wehrmann said daycare workers and nursery teachers needed to be better trained to adequately care for children under the age of three .
germany was 15 to 20 years behind its european neighbors in this aspect and had a lot of catching up to do , wehrmann said . " they can not even diagnose developmental disorders among small children , " wehrmann said at the presentation of the study in berlin on wednesday . german family minister ursula von der leyen has pushed through new childcare policies to significantly increase the number of daycare spots for young children in the next five years .
the efforts are a bid to make it easier for mothers to work and to reverse the declining birthrate . child groups in daycare facilities were also frequently too large , the foundation said . article based on news reports -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de labor market -pipe- 02.08.2007 germany debates easing labor limits for eastern europeans großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany needs more technical personnel - but where should it come from ?
a shortage of skilled labor could hit germany in the next few years , and workers from new eu member states could fill this gap .
yet politicians , unions and industry disagree on relaxing labor market restrictions . the latest unemployment figures for germany , released this week , showed over 3.7 million jobless in july .
yet companies have been saying for months that they can not find enough qualified personnel , for example in the engineering sector and other technical professions . the shortage of skilled labor is expected to continue in the coming years , leading the german labor ministry to suggest easing restrictions on workers from the new eu member states as a way of filling the gap . volker kauder , head of the parliamentary group of the christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- , is not in favor of the change , though .
he said this week that the labor pool had to be better exhausted domestically first .
it should be given priority over an inflow of labor from abroad . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kauder said more needs to be done to favor german workers " this would send the wrong signal , " kauder told the mass circulation daily bild .
" you ca n't on the one hand complain about wage dumping and , at the same time , on a grand scale bring workers to germany from romania and bulgaria , who are willing to work for low wages . " the free movement of labor is one of the fundamental rights guaranteed to eu citizens .
a german wanting to work in france does not face any major bureaucratic hurdles .
but this is not the case for workers from the new eu member states . the accession treaty allowed for transitional measures to protect national labor markets , and germany is one of the few eu nations which forces citizens from the new member states to apply for work permits .
it justifies the restrictions by pointing to its problems with unemployment and the fact that germany 's geographic proximity to the bloc 's new members means it could face more incoming workers than other countries . unions oppose easing restrictions at present , germany 's labor market constraints are in effect until 2009 .
kauder has said they should continue for a further two years , to 2011 .
no further extension is possible after that time , according to eu regulations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a large number of germans are still lining up at the employment office to find a job kauder has received support from the german labor unions , which do n't traditionally side with the conservative cdu .
axel brower-rabinowitsch , spokesman for the confederation of german trade unions dgb , said opening the labor market would not help alleviate unemployment . " our major concern is that the labor market is not in order right now , " brower-rabinowitsch said .
the unemployment figures showed that there were currently " a considerable number " of people who could be employed following further qualification or training . " this situation does not justify germany getting specialized personnel from abroad , " brower-rabinowitsch said , adding that over 200,000 young people have been waiting for apprenticeship training positions for over a year . " we can not take away the industry 's responsibility to train workers , " he said .
" it is their duty to do so . "
brower-rabinowitsch said every time there was economic improvement in germany , the private sector complained of a lack of skilled personnel . " but they neglected to train people in time , " he said . the cdu 's coalition partner , the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , agreed that the private sector had to first do its utmost to accommodate germany 's unemployed . " only when the industry can prove that it is giving long-term unemployed a fair chance with the help of labor market policies can it hope for understanding from political powers , " said ludwig stiegler , deputy head of the spd parliamentary group . immigration is economically necessary german industry has welcomed the idea of opening the labor market earlier than planned to eastern europeans .
analyst holger schäfer from the institute for business research -lrb- iw -rrb- in cologne said a strategy to further train german workers was necessary , but not the sole solution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : skilled personnel from abroad can boost the german economy " we do n't need qualification instead of immigration , " schäfer said .
" we need both . " according to schäfer , immigration was beneficial to the economy .
the majority of immigrant workers wanted to work and generated income .
this resulted in secondary effects for the overall economy . " of course , there are losers , namely those competing for these jobs , " he said .
" but the rest of society wins . " so why is there such opposition to easing restrictions ? " i think the fear of being steamrolled , and possibly a bit of xenophobia , leads to the rejection by german society , " schäfer said .
yet these fears are unfounded .
studies showed that some 200,000 workers per year would come to germany in the first stages .
over a 20-year period , the figure would total two to four million people , he said . " we really have to take leave of this notion that people are going to be lining up to get in , " he said . the think-tank iw is an association whose members include leading employer and economic federations .
it serves the interests of the private sector . benefit of minimum wage disputed there are also fears on the part of the unions that immigrant labor from eastern europe would lead to wage dumping on the german labor market or put pressure on existing wage agreements .
for this reason brower-rabinowitsch said the government needed to introduce a minimum wage before lifting restrictions on foreign workers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : skilled construction workers are becoming hard to find in poland however , schäfer said that wage dumping did not occur when the german labor market opened to southern european workers in the 1980s and that a minimum wage would not help the economy . " a minimum wage would prevent foreign workers from coming to germany , " schäfer said .
" then , there ca n't be any economic benefits from immigration . " poland worried about lack of skilled labor germany is getting support for its concerns from its eastern neighbor .
since eu expansion , polish workers in particular have left their home country to find work in britain and ireland , which have no labor restrictions for new eu states .
a recent study by the warsaw-based market research company arc ryneki i opinia showed that mostly well-educated poles are leaving - and are n't coming back . " this is a threat to polish employers , " jeremi mordasewicz , a labor market expert from the polish employers ' association lewiatan , told the paper financial times deutschland . many companies , especially in the construction sector , were desperately seeking qualified personnel in poland , he said . german government deputy spokesman thomas steg said a decision would most likely be made at the beginning of 2009 if the labor market restrictions would be extended to 2011 . the issue will be discussed at the next cabinet meeting in late august , after the summer break . sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a shortage of skilled labor could hit germany in the next few years , and workers from new eu member states could fill this gap .
yet politicians , unions and industry disagree on relaxing labor market restrictions . the latest unemployment figures for germany , released this week , showed over 3.7 million jobless in july .
yet companies have been saying for months that they can not find enough qualified personnel , for example in the engineering sector and other technical professions . the shortage of skilled labor is expected to continue in the coming years , leading the german labor ministry to suggest easing restrictions on workers from the new eu member states as a way of filling the gap . volker kauder , head of the parliamentary group of the christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- , is not in favor of the change , though .
he said this week that the labor pool had to be better exhausted domestically first .
it should be given priority over an inflow of labor from abroad . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kauder said more needs to be done to favor german workers " this would send the wrong signal , " kauder told the mass circulation daily bild .
" you ca n't on the one hand complain about wage dumping and , at the same time , on a grand scale bring workers to germany from romania and bulgaria , who are willing to work for low wages . " the free movement of labor is one of the fundamental rights guaranteed to eu citizens .
a german wanting to work in france does not face any major bureaucratic hurdles .
but this is not the case for workers from the new eu member states . the accession treaty allowed for transitional measures to protect national labor markets , and germany is one of the few eu nations which forces citizens from the new member states to apply for work permits .
it justifies the restrictions by pointing to its problems with unemployment and the fact that germany 's geographic proximity to the bloc 's new members means it could face more incoming workers than other countries . unions oppose easing restrictions at present , germany 's labor market constraints are in effect until 2009 .
kauder has said they should continue for a further two years , to 2011 .
no further extension is possible after that time , according to eu regulations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a large number of germans are still lining up at the employment office to find a job kauder has received support from the german labor unions , which do n't traditionally side with the conservative cdu .
axel brower-rabinowitsch , spokesman for the confederation of german trade unions dgb , said opening the labor market would not help alleviate unemployment . " our major concern is that the labor market is not in order right now , " brower-rabinowitsch said .
the unemployment figures showed that there were currently " a considerable number " of people who could be employed following further qualification or training . " this situation does not justify germany getting specialized personnel from abroad , " brower-rabinowitsch said , adding that over 200,000 young people have been waiting for apprenticeship training positions for over a year . " we can not take away the industry 's responsibility to train workers , " he said .
" it is their duty to do so . "
brower-rabinowitsch said every time there was economic improvement in germany , the private sector complained of a lack of skilled personnel . " but they neglected to train people in time , " he said . the cdu 's coalition partner , the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , agreed that the private sector had to first do its utmost to accommodate germany 's unemployed . " only when the industry can prove that it is giving long-term unemployed a fair chance with the help of labor market policies can it hope for understanding from political powers , " said ludwig stiegler , deputy head of the spd parliamentary group . immigration is economically necessary german industry has welcomed the idea of opening the labor market earlier than planned to eastern europeans .
analyst holger schäfer from the institute for business research -lrb- iw -rrb- in cologne said a strategy to further train german workers was necessary , but not the sole solution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : skilled personnel from abroad can boost the german economy " we do n't need qualification instead of immigration , " schäfer said .
" we need both . " according to schäfer , immigration was beneficial to the economy .
the majority of immigrant workers wanted to work and generated income .
this resulted in secondary effects for the overall economy . " of course , there are losers , namely those competing for these jobs , " he said .
" but the rest of society wins . " so why is there such opposition to easing restrictions ? " i think the fear of being steamrolled , and possibly a bit of xenophobia , leads to the rejection by german society , " schäfer said .
yet these fears are unfounded .
studies showed that some 200,000 workers per year would come to germany in the first stages .
over a 20-year period , the figure would total two to four million people , he said . " we really have to take leave of this notion that people are going to be lining up to get in , " he said . the think-tank iw is an association whose members include leading employer and economic federations .
it serves the interests of the private sector . benefit of minimum wage disputed there are also fears on the part of the unions that immigrant labor from eastern europe would lead to wage dumping on the german labor market or put pressure on existing wage agreements .
for this reason brower-rabinowitsch said the government needed to introduce a minimum wage before lifting restrictions on foreign workers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : skilled construction workers are becoming hard to find in poland however , schäfer said that wage dumping did not occur when the german labor market opened to southern european workers in the 1980s and that a minimum wage would not help the economy . " a minimum wage would prevent foreign workers from coming to germany , " schäfer said .
" then , there ca n't be any economic benefits from immigration . " poland worried about lack of skilled labor germany is getting support for its concerns from its eastern neighbor .
since eu expansion , polish workers in particular have left their home country to find work in britain and ireland , which have no labor restrictions for new eu states .
a recent study by the warsaw-based market research company arc ryneki i opinia showed that mostly well-educated poles are leaving - and are n't coming back . " this is a threat to polish employers , " jeremi mordasewicz , a labor market expert from the polish employers ' association lewiatan , told the paper financial times deutschland . many companies , especially in the construction sector , were desperately seeking qualified personnel in poland , he said . german government deputy spokesman thomas steg said a decision would most likely be made at the beginning of 2009 if the labor market restrictions would be extended to 2011 . the issue will be discussed at the next cabinet meeting in late august , after the summer break . sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

these kids are more likely to suffer from weight problems than their peers from better situated families . an extensive study on child nutrition has revealed that germany 's long-term unemployed can not offer their families a well-balanced diet . " it 's hardly possible for these welfare recipients to feed their children healthy food , " said mathilde kersting from the research institute for child nutrition -lrb- fke -rrb- in dortmund . children in families getting long-term unemployment welfare , known as hartz iv , are n't going hungry .
but they are not eating the right types of food , kersting said . the study showed that the welfare payments had a daily allowance for food and beverages for children of 2.57 euros -lrb- $ 3.50 -rrb- and for teenagers over 14 years 3.42 euros . but , kersting said , even if families shopped at discount supermarkets , an average of 4.68 euros per day was necessary to still the appetite of a growing teenager with a balanced diet .

but simply more money was not the answer . " it 's also important to convince these groups of the use of a well-balanced diet , " kersting said .
" we have to develop simple measures which can be implemented so that our nutritional information can reach these families better than it does up to now . " fke researchers compiled the prices of over 80 kinds of food which are necessary for a healthy diet .
they then calculated the costs for an optimized mixed diet - a concept developed by fke which aims to ensure healthy nutrition for children and teenagers at comparatively low costs . germany needs to improve its childcare system in a separate study , the konrad adenauer foundation found that children from less-educated families were less likely to attend a nursery school . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : early childhood daycare is not adequate in germany , a study shows the problems children from all levels of society faced were the same , though .

grass , who grew up in what is now the polish city of gdansk , has been a prominent leftist and pacifist for many years .

2007 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : terezia mora " day in day out , " terezia mora 's debut novel , tells the story of abel nema , a linguistically talented balkan refugee .
abel encounters a collection of quirky characters , including a group of bohemian jazz musicians , a gang of young gypsies , and frequenters of the local sex bar - yet even his gift for languages ca n't fill his inner hollowness .
born in hungary in 1971 , author terezia mora moved to berlin in 1990 , where she studied theater and screenwriting . have you read a good english translation of a book written in german ?

afghan police reported on july 22 that they had found the bullet-riddled body of one of the men , which was flown back to germany last week .
the autopsy conducted at cologne 's institute for forensic medicine confirmed thursday that the man was shot and killed after suffering from circulatory problems during captivity .
" his kidnappers killed him brutally and ended his life in a criminal way , " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier told afp news agency during a tour of west africa .
" this is deeply shocking .
this crime must not go unpunished . "
foreign ministry spokesman martin jäger said the autopsy showed that the engineer had collapsed before the lethal shots were fired .
a total of six bullet wounds were found in the body .
it had previously been unclear if the man was executed or died as a result of the strain of the situation he was in .

al jazeera television broadcast a video on tuesday showing the man against a rocky background in a hilly area .
there was no sound on the video , but the channel said the hostage , rudolf b. , had urged the german and us governments to " withdraw their troops from afghanistan " and to help him return to his family .
the german foreign ministry said the video was a deliberate attempt to intimidate .
german chancellor angela merkel has said berlin will not give in to the kidnappers ' demands .
a poll taken by german public broadcaster ard showed thursday that 64 percent of germans wanted to see the bundeswehr troops pulled out of afghanistan , an increase of 10 percent compared to last month .

" hostage-taking is a flagrant breach of international law , " said amnesty international secretary-general irene khan .
" there are no exceptions to this rule and no justifications for breaking it .
" hostage-taking and the killing of hostages are war crimes and their perpetrators must be brought to justice , " khan added .

these kids are more likely to suffer from weight problems than their peers from better situated families . an extensive study on child nutrition has revealed that germany 's long-term unemployed can not offer their families a well-balanced diet . " it 's hardly possible for these welfare recipients to feed their children healthy food , " said mathilde kersting from the research institute for child nutrition -lrb- fke -rrb- in dortmund . children in families getting long-term unemployment welfare , known as hartz iv , are n't going hungry .
but they are not eating the right types of food , kersting said . the study showed that the welfare payments had a daily allowance for food and beverages for children of 2.57 euros -lrb- $ 3.50 -rrb- and for teenagers over 14 years 3.42 euros . but , kersting said , even if families shopped at discount supermarkets , an average of 4.68 euros per day was necessary to still the appetite of a growing teenager with a balanced diet .
for four- to six year-olds , the allowance would just cover their needs if the groceries were bought at a discounter , she said . health problems are the outcome according to kersting , weight problems were the result .
in germany today , some 6 percent of all children and teenagers are overweight .
in low-income families , it was more than double this figure , she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : healthy food like this is often just too expensive kersting said this could lead to serious chronic illnesses , such as diabetes or arteriosclerosis , a thickening of the arterial walls . " so in an economic sense , it 's worthwhile for everyone to invest in a healthy diet , " kersting said . increased awareness is also necessary the fke said it recommended that benefit payments be reviewed .
but simply more money was not the answer . " it 's also important to convince these groups of the use of a well-balanced diet , " kersting said .
" we have to develop simple measures which can be implemented so that our nutritional information can reach these families better than it does up to now . " fke researchers compiled the prices of over 80 kinds of food which are necessary for a healthy diet .
they then calculated the costs for an optimized mixed diet - a concept developed by fke which aims to ensure healthy nutrition for children and teenagers at comparatively low costs . germany needs to improve its childcare system in a separate study , the konrad adenauer foundation found that children from less-educated families were less likely to attend a nursery school . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : early childhood daycare is not adequate in germany , a study shows the problems children from all levels of society faced were the same , though .
the country needed to do much more to ensure adequate care for small children , the study on early childhood education and care in germany revealed . co-author ilse wehrmann said daycare workers and nursery teachers needed to be better trained to adequately care for children under the age of three .
germany was 15 to 20 years behind its european neighbors in this aspect and had a lot of catching up to do , wehrmann said . " they can not even diagnose developmental disorders among small children , " wehrmann said at the presentation of the study in berlin on wednesday . german family minister ursula von der leyen has pushed through new childcare policies to significantly increase the number of daycare spots for young children in the next five years .
the efforts are a bid to make it easier for mothers to work and to reverse the declining birthrate . child groups in daycare facilities were also frequently too large , the foundation said . article based on news reports -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a shortage of skilled labor could hit germany in the next few years , and workers from new eu member states could fill this gap .
yet politicians , unions and industry disagree on relaxing labor market restrictions . the latest unemployment figures for germany , released this week , showed over 3.7 million jobless in july .
yet companies have been saying for months that they can not find enough qualified personnel , for example in the engineering sector and other technical professions . the shortage of skilled labor is expected to continue in the coming years , leading the german labor ministry to suggest easing restrictions on workers from the new eu member states as a way of filling the gap . volker kauder , head of the parliamentary group of the christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- , is not in favor of the change , though .
he said this week that the labor pool had to be better exhausted domestically first .
it should be given priority over an inflow of labor from abroad . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kauder said more needs to be done to favor german workers " this would send the wrong signal , " kauder told the mass circulation daily bild .
" you ca n't on the one hand complain about wage dumping and , at the same time , on a grand scale bring workers to germany from romania and bulgaria , who are willing to work for low wages . " the free movement of labor is one of the fundamental rights guaranteed to eu citizens .
a german wanting to work in france does not face any major bureaucratic hurdles .
but this is not the case for workers from the new eu member states . the accession treaty allowed for transitional measures to protect national labor markets , and germany is one of the few eu nations which forces citizens from the new member states to apply for work permits .
it justifies the restrictions by pointing to its problems with unemployment and the fact that germany 's geographic proximity to the bloc 's new members means it could face more incoming workers than other countries . unions oppose easing restrictions at present , germany 's labor market constraints are in effect until 2009 .
kauder has said they should continue for a further two years , to 2011 .
no further extension is possible after that time , according to eu regulations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a large number of germans are still lining up at the employment office to find a job kauder has received support from the german labor unions , which do n't traditionally side with the conservative cdu .
axel brower-rabinowitsch , spokesman for the confederation of german trade unions dgb , said opening the labor market would not help alleviate unemployment . " our major concern is that the labor market is not in order right now , " brower-rabinowitsch said .
the unemployment figures showed that there were currently " a considerable number " of people who could be employed following further qualification or training . " this situation does not justify germany getting specialized personnel from abroad , " brower-rabinowitsch said , adding that over 200,000 young people have been waiting for apprenticeship training positions for over a year . " we can not take away the industry 's responsibility to train workers , " he said .
" it is their duty to do so . "
brower-rabinowitsch said every time there was economic improvement in germany , the private sector complained of a lack of skilled personnel . " but they neglected to train people in time , " he said . the cdu 's coalition partner , the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , agreed that the private sector had to first do its utmost to accommodate germany 's unemployed . " only when the industry can prove that it is giving long-term unemployed a fair chance with the help of labor market policies can it hope for understanding from political powers , " said ludwig stiegler , deputy head of the spd parliamentary group . immigration is economically necessary german industry has welcomed the idea of opening the labor market earlier than planned to eastern europeans .
analyst holger schäfer from the institute for business research -lrb- iw -rrb- in cologne said a strategy to further train german workers was necessary , but not the sole solution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : skilled personnel from abroad can boost the german economy " we do n't need qualification instead of immigration , " schäfer said .
" we need both . " according to schäfer , immigration was beneficial to the economy .
the majority of immigrant workers wanted to work and generated income .
this resulted in secondary effects for the overall economy . " of course , there are losers , namely those competing for these jobs , " he said .
" but the rest of society wins . " so why is there such opposition to easing restrictions ? " i think the fear of being steamrolled , and possibly a bit of xenophobia , leads to the rejection by german society , " schäfer said .
yet these fears are unfounded .
studies showed that some 200,000 workers per year would come to germany in the first stages .
over a 20-year period , the figure would total two to four million people , he said . " we really have to take leave of this notion that people are going to be lining up to get in , " he said . the think-tank iw is an association whose members include leading employer and economic federations .
it serves the interests of the private sector . benefit of minimum wage disputed there are also fears on the part of the unions that immigrant labor from eastern europe would lead to wage dumping on the german labor market or put pressure on existing wage agreements .
for this reason brower-rabinowitsch said the government needed to introduce a minimum wage before lifting restrictions on foreign workers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : skilled construction workers are becoming hard to find in poland however , schäfer said that wage dumping did not occur when the german labor market opened to southern european workers in the 1980s and that a minimum wage would not help the economy . " a minimum wage would prevent foreign workers from coming to germany , " schäfer said .
" then , there ca n't be any economic benefits from immigration . " poland worried about lack of skilled labor germany is getting support for its concerns from its eastern neighbor .
since eu expansion , polish workers in particular have left their home country to find work in britain and ireland , which have no labor restrictions for new eu states .
a recent study by the warsaw-based market research company arc ryneki i opinia showed that mostly well-educated poles are leaving - and are n't coming back . " this is a threat to polish employers , " jeremi mordasewicz , a labor market expert from the polish employers ' association lewiatan , told the paper financial times deutschland . many companies , especially in the construction sector , were desperately seeking qualified personnel in poland , he said . german government deputy spokesman thomas steg said a decision would most likely be made at the beginning of 2009 if the labor market restrictions would be extended to 2011 . the issue will be discussed at the next cabinet meeting in late august , after the summer break . sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it justifies the restrictions by pointing to its problems with unemployment and the fact that germany 's geographic proximity to the bloc 's new members means it could face more incoming workers than other countries . unions oppose easing restrictions at present , germany 's labor market constraints are in effect until 2009 .
kauder has said they should continue for a further two years , to 2011 .
no further extension is possible after that time , according to eu regulations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a large number of germans are still lining up at the employment office to find a job kauder has received support from the german labor unions , which do n't traditionally side with the conservative cdu .
axel brower-rabinowitsch , spokesman for the confederation of german trade unions dgb , said opening the labor market would not help alleviate unemployment . " our major concern is that the labor market is not in order right now , " brower-rabinowitsch said .
the unemployment figures showed that there were currently " a considerable number " of people who could be employed following further qualification or training . " this situation does not justify germany getting specialized personnel from abroad , " brower-rabinowitsch said , adding that over 200,000 young people have been waiting for apprenticeship training positions for over a year . " we can not take away the industry 's responsibility to train workers , " he said .
" it is their duty to do so . "
brower-rabinowitsch said every time there was economic improvement in germany , the private sector complained of a lack of skilled personnel . " but they neglected to train people in time , " he said . the cdu 's coalition partner , the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , agreed that the private sector had to first do its utmost to accommodate germany 's unemployed . " only when the industry can prove that it is giving long-term unemployed a fair chance with the help of labor market policies can it hope for understanding from political powers , " said ludwig stiegler , deputy head of the spd parliamentary group . immigration is economically necessary german industry has welcomed the idea of opening the labor market earlier than planned to eastern europeans .
analyst holger schäfer from the institute for business research -lrb- iw -rrb- in cologne said a strategy to further train german workers was necessary , but not the sole solution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : skilled personnel from abroad can boost the german economy " we do n't need qualification instead of immigration , " schäfer said .
" we need both . " according to schäfer , immigration was beneficial to the economy .
the majority of immigrant workers wanted to work and generated income .
this resulted in secondary effects for the overall economy . " of course , there are losers , namely those competing for these jobs , " he said .
" but the rest of society wins . " so why is there such opposition to easing restrictions ? " i think the fear of being steamrolled , and possibly a bit of xenophobia , leads to the rejection by german society , " schäfer said .
yet these fears are unfounded .
studies showed that some 200,000 workers per year would come to germany in the first stages .
over a 20-year period , the figure would total two to four million people , he said . " we really have to take leave of this notion that people are going to be lining up to get in , " he said . the think-tank iw is an association whose members include leading employer and economic federations .
it serves the interests of the private sector . benefit of minimum wage disputed there are also fears on the part of the unions that immigrant labor from eastern europe would lead to wage dumping on the german labor market or put pressure on existing wage agreements .
for this reason brower-rabinowitsch said the government needed to introduce a minimum wage before lifting restrictions on foreign workers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : skilled construction workers are becoming hard to find in poland however , schäfer said that wage dumping did not occur when the german labor market opened to southern european workers in the 1980s and that a minimum wage would not help the economy . " a minimum wage would prevent foreign workers from coming to germany , " schäfer said .
" then , there ca n't be any economic benefits from immigration . " poland worried about lack of skilled labor germany is getting support for its concerns from its eastern neighbor .
since eu expansion , polish workers in particular have left their home country to find work in britain and ireland , which have no labor restrictions for new eu states .
a recent study by the warsaw-based market research company arc ryneki i opinia showed that mostly well-educated poles are leaving - and are n't coming back . " this is a threat to polish employers , " jeremi mordasewicz , a labor market expert from the polish employers ' association lewiatan , told the paper financial times deutschland . many companies , especially in the construction sector , were desperately seeking qualified personnel in poland , he said . german government deputy spokesman thomas steg said a decision would most likely be made at the beginning of 2009 if the labor market restrictions would be extended to 2011 . the issue will be discussed at the next cabinet meeting in late august , after the summer break . sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a shortage of skilled labor could hit germany in the next few years , and workers from new eu member states could fill this gap .
yet politicians , unions and industry disagree on relaxing labor market restrictions . the latest unemployment figures for germany , released this week , showed over 3.7 million jobless in july .
yet companies have been saying for months that they can not find enough qualified personnel , for example in the engineering sector and other technical professions . the shortage of skilled labor is expected to continue in the coming years , leading the german labor ministry to suggest easing restrictions on workers from the new eu member states as a way of filling the gap . volker kauder , head of the parliamentary group of the christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- , is not in favor of the change , though .
he said this week that the labor pool had to be better exhausted domestically first .
it should be given priority over an inflow of labor from abroad . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kauder said more needs to be done to favor german workers " this would send the wrong signal , " kauder told the mass circulation daily bild .
" you ca n't on the one hand complain about wage dumping and , at the same time , on a grand scale bring workers to germany from romania and bulgaria , who are willing to work for low wages . " the free movement of labor is one of the fundamental rights guaranteed to eu citizens .
a german wanting to work in france does not face any major bureaucratic hurdles .

a shortage of skilled labor could hit germany in the next few years , and workers from new eu member states could fill this gap .
yet politicians , unions and industry disagree on relaxing labor market restrictions . the latest unemployment figures for germany , released this week , showed over 3.7 million jobless in july .
yet companies have been saying for months that they can not find enough qualified personnel , for example in the engineering sector and other technical professions . the shortage of skilled labor is expected to continue in the coming years , leading the german labor ministry to suggest easing restrictions on workers from the new eu member states as a way of filling the gap . volker kauder , head of the parliamentary group of the christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- , is not in favor of the change , though .
he said this week that the labor pool had to be better exhausted domestically first .
it should be given priority over an inflow of labor from abroad . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kauder said more needs to be done to favor german workers " this would send the wrong signal , " kauder told the mass circulation daily bild .
" you ca n't on the one hand complain about wage dumping and , at the same time , on a grand scale bring workers to germany from romania and bulgaria , who are willing to work for low wages . " the free movement of labor is one of the fundamental rights guaranteed to eu citizens .
a german wanting to work in france does not face any major bureaucratic hurdles .
but this is not the case for workers from the new eu member states . the accession treaty allowed for transitional measures to protect national labor markets , and germany is one of the few eu nations which forces citizens from the new member states to apply for work permits .
it justifies the restrictions by pointing to its problems with unemployment and the fact that germany 's geographic proximity to the bloc 's new members means it could face more incoming workers than other countries . unions oppose easing restrictions at present , germany 's labor market constraints are in effect until 2009 .
kauder has said they should continue for a further two years , to 2011 .
no further extension is possible after that time , according to eu regulations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a large number of germans are still lining up at the employment office to find a job kauder has received support from the german labor unions , which do n't traditionally side with the conservative cdu .
axel brower-rabinowitsch , spokesman for the confederation of german trade unions dgb , said opening the labor market would not help alleviate unemployment . " our major concern is that the labor market is not in order right now , " brower-rabinowitsch said .
the unemployment figures showed that there were currently " a considerable number " of people who could be employed following further qualification or training . " this situation does not justify germany getting specialized personnel from abroad , " brower-rabinowitsch said , adding that over 200,000 young people have been waiting for apprenticeship training positions for over a year . " we can not take away the industry 's responsibility to train workers , " he said .
" it is their duty to do so . "
brower-rabinowitsch said every time there was economic improvement in germany , the private sector complained of a lack of skilled personnel . " but they neglected to train people in time , " he said . the cdu 's coalition partner , the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , agreed that the private sector had to first do its utmost to accommodate germany 's unemployed . " only when the industry can prove that it is giving long-term unemployed a fair chance with the help of labor market policies can it hope for understanding from political powers , " said ludwig stiegler , deputy head of the spd parliamentary group . immigration is economically necessary german industry has welcomed the idea of opening the labor market earlier than planned to eastern europeans .
analyst holger schäfer from the institute for business research -lrb- iw -rrb- in cologne said a strategy to further train german workers was necessary , but not the sole solution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : skilled personnel from abroad can boost the german economy " we do n't need qualification instead of immigration , " schäfer said .
" we need both . " according to schäfer , immigration was beneficial to the economy .
the majority of immigrant workers wanted to work and generated income .
this resulted in secondary effects for the overall economy . " of course , there are losers , namely those competing for these jobs , " he said .
" but the rest of society wins . " so why is there such opposition to easing restrictions ? " i think the fear of being steamrolled , and possibly a bit of xenophobia , leads to the rejection by german society , " schäfer said .
yet these fears are unfounded .
studies showed that some 200,000 workers per year would come to germany in the first stages .
over a 20-year period , the figure would total two to four million people , he said . " we really have to take leave of this notion that people are going to be lining up to get in , " he said . the think-tank iw is an association whose members include leading employer and economic federations .
it serves the interests of the private sector . benefit of minimum wage disputed there are also fears on the part of the unions that immigrant labor from eastern europe would lead to wage dumping on the german labor market or put pressure on existing wage agreements .
for this reason brower-rabinowitsch said the government needed to introduce a minimum wage before lifting restrictions on foreign workers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : skilled construction workers are becoming hard to find in poland however , schäfer said that wage dumping did not occur when the german labor market opened to southern european workers in the 1980s and that a minimum wage would not help the economy . " a minimum wage would prevent foreign workers from coming to germany , " schäfer said .
" then , there ca n't be any economic benefits from immigration . " poland worried about lack of skilled labor germany is getting support for its concerns from its eastern neighbor .
since eu expansion , polish workers in particular have left their home country to find work in britain and ireland , which have no labor restrictions for new eu states .
a recent study by the warsaw-based market research company arc ryneki i opinia showed that mostly well-educated poles are leaving - and are n't coming back . " this is a threat to polish employers , " jeremi mordasewicz , a labor market expert from the polish employers ' association lewiatan , told the paper financial times deutschland . many companies , especially in the construction sector , were desperately seeking qualified personnel in poland , he said . german government deputy spokesman thomas steg said a decision would most likely be made at the beginning of 2009 if the labor market restrictions would be extended to 2011 . the issue will be discussed at the next cabinet meeting in late august , after the summer break . sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

these kids are more likely to suffer from weight problems than their peers from better situated families . an extensive study on child nutrition has revealed that germany 's long-term unemployed can not offer their families a well-balanced diet . " it 's hardly possible for these welfare recipients to feed their children healthy food , " said mathilde kersting from the research institute for child nutrition -lrb- fke -rrb- in dortmund . children in families getting long-term unemployment welfare , known as hartz iv , are n't going hungry .
but they are not eating the right types of food , kersting said . the study showed that the welfare payments had a daily allowance for food and beverages for children of 2.57 euros -lrb- $ 3.50 -rrb- and for teenagers over 14 years 3.42 euros . but , kersting said , even if families shopped at discount supermarkets , an average of 4.68 euros per day was necessary to still the appetite of a growing teenager with a balanced diet .
for four- to six year-olds , the allowance would just cover their needs if the groceries were bought at a discounter , she said . health problems are the outcome according to kersting , weight problems were the result .
in germany today , some 6 percent of all children and teenagers are overweight .
in low-income families , it was more than double this figure , she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : healthy food like this is often just too expensive kersting said this could lead to serious chronic illnesses , such as diabetes or arteriosclerosis , a thickening of the arterial walls . " so in an economic sense , it 's worthwhile for everyone to invest in a healthy diet , " kersting said . increased awareness is also necessary the fke said it recommended that benefit payments be reviewed .
but simply more money was not the answer . " it 's also important to convince these groups of the use of a well-balanced diet , " kersting said .
" we have to develop simple measures which can be implemented so that our nutritional information can reach these families better than it does up to now . " fke researchers compiled the prices of over 80 kinds of food which are necessary for a healthy diet .
they then calculated the costs for an optimized mixed diet - a concept developed by fke which aims to ensure healthy nutrition for children and teenagers at comparatively low costs . germany needs to improve its childcare system in a separate study , the konrad adenauer foundation found that children from less-educated families were less likely to attend a nursery school . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : early childhood daycare is not adequate in germany , a study shows the problems children from all levels of society faced were the same , though .

these kids are more likely to suffer from weight problems than their peers from better situated families . an extensive study on child nutrition has revealed that germany 's long-term unemployed can not offer their families a well-balanced diet . " it 's hardly possible for these welfare recipients to feed their children healthy food , " said mathilde kersting from the research institute for child nutrition -lrb- fke -rrb- in dortmund . children in families getting long-term unemployment welfare , known as hartz iv , are n't going hungry .
but they are not eating the right types of food , kersting said . the study showed that the welfare payments had a daily allowance for food and beverages for children of 2.57 euros -lrb- $ 3.50 -rrb- and for teenagers over 14 years 3.42 euros . but , kersting said , even if families shopped at discount supermarkets , an average of 4.68 euros per day was necessary to still the appetite of a growing teenager with a balanced diet .
for four- to six year-olds , the allowance would just cover their needs if the groceries were bought at a discounter , she said . health problems are the outcome according to kersting , weight problems were the result .
in germany today , some 6 percent of all children and teenagers are overweight .
in low-income families , it was more than double this figure , she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : healthy food like this is often just too expensive kersting said this could lead to serious chronic illnesses , such as diabetes or arteriosclerosis , a thickening of the arterial walls . " so in an economic sense , it 's worthwhile for everyone to invest in a healthy diet , " kersting said . increased awareness is also necessary the fke said it recommended that benefit payments be reviewed .
but simply more money was not the answer . " it 's also important to convince these groups of the use of a well-balanced diet , " kersting said .
" we have to develop simple measures which can be implemented so that our nutritional information can reach these families better than it does up to now . " fke researchers compiled the prices of over 80 kinds of food which are necessary for a healthy diet .
they then calculated the costs for an optimized mixed diet - a concept developed by fke which aims to ensure healthy nutrition for children and teenagers at comparatively low costs . germany needs to improve its childcare system in a separate study , the konrad adenauer foundation found that children from less-educated families were less likely to attend a nursery school . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : early childhood daycare is not adequate in germany , a study shows the problems children from all levels of society faced were the same , though .

but they are not eating the right types of food , kersting said . the study showed that the welfare payments had a daily allowance for food and beverages for children of 2.57 euros -lrb- $ 3.50 -rrb- and for teenagers over 14 years 3.42 euros . but , kersting said , even if families shopped at discount supermarkets , an average of 4.68 euros per day was necessary to still the appetite of a growing teenager with a balanced diet .
for four- to six year-olds , the allowance would just cover their needs if the groceries were bought at a discounter , she said . health problems are the outcome according to kersting , weight problems were the result .
in germany today , some 6 percent of all children and teenagers are overweight .
in low-income families , it was more than double this figure , she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : healthy food like this is often just too expensive kersting said this could lead to serious chronic illnesses , such as diabetes or arteriosclerosis , a thickening of the arterial walls . " so in an economic sense , it 's worthwhile for everyone to invest in a healthy diet , " kersting said . increased awareness is also necessary the fke said it recommended that benefit payments be reviewed .
but simply more money was not the answer . " it 's also important to convince these groups of the use of a well-balanced diet , " kersting said .
" we have to develop simple measures which can be implemented so that our nutritional information can reach these families better than it does up to now . " fke researchers compiled the prices of over 80 kinds of food which are necessary for a healthy diet .
they then calculated the costs for an optimized mixed diet - a concept developed by fke which aims to ensure healthy nutrition for children and teenagers at comparatively low costs . germany needs to improve its childcare system in a separate study , the konrad adenauer foundation found that children from less-educated families were less likely to attend a nursery school . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : early childhood daycare is not adequate in germany , a study shows the problems children from all levels of society faced were the same , though .
the country needed to do much more to ensure adequate care for small children , the study on early childhood education and care in germany revealed . co-author ilse wehrmann said daycare workers and nursery teachers needed to be better trained to adequately care for children under the age of three .
germany was 15 to 20 years behind its european neighbors in this aspect and had a lot of catching up to do , wehrmann said . " they can not even diagnose developmental disorders among small children , " wehrmann said at the presentation of the study in berlin on wednesday . german family minister ursula von der leyen has pushed through new childcare policies to significantly increase the number of daycare spots for young children in the next five years .
the efforts are a bid to make it easier for mothers to work and to reverse the declining birthrate . child groups in daycare facilities were also frequently too large , the foundation said . article based on news reports -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de labor market -pipe- 02.08.2007 germany debates easing labor limits for eastern europeans großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany needs more technical personnel - but where should it come from ?
a shortage of skilled labor could hit germany in the next few years , and workers from new eu member states could fill this gap .
yet politicians , unions and industry disagree on relaxing labor market restrictions . the latest unemployment figures for germany , released this week , showed over 3.7 million jobless in july .
yet companies have been saying for months that they can not find enough qualified personnel , for example in the engineering sector and other technical professions . the shortage of skilled labor is expected to continue in the coming years , leading the german labor ministry to suggest easing restrictions on workers from the new eu member states as a way of filling the gap . volker kauder , head of the parliamentary group of the christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- , is not in favor of the change , though .
he said this week that the labor pool had to be better exhausted domestically first .
it should be given priority over an inflow of labor from abroad . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kauder said more needs to be done to favor german workers " this would send the wrong signal , " kauder told the mass circulation daily bild .
" you ca n't on the one hand complain about wage dumping and , at the same time , on a grand scale bring workers to germany from romania and bulgaria , who are willing to work for low wages . " the free movement of labor is one of the fundamental rights guaranteed to eu citizens .
a german wanting to work in france does not face any major bureaucratic hurdles .
but this is not the case for workers from the new eu member states . the accession treaty allowed for transitional measures to protect national labor markets , and germany is one of the few eu nations which forces citizens from the new member states to apply for work permits .
it justifies the restrictions by pointing to its problems with unemployment and the fact that germany 's geographic proximity to the bloc 's new members means it could face more incoming workers than other countries . unions oppose easing restrictions at present , germany 's labor market constraints are in effect until 2009 .
kauder has said they should continue for a further two years , to 2011 .
no further extension is possible after that time , according to eu regulations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a large number of germans are still lining up at the employment office to find a job kauder has received support from the german labor unions , which do n't traditionally side with the conservative cdu .
axel brower-rabinowitsch , spokesman for the confederation of german trade unions dgb , said opening the labor market would not help alleviate unemployment . " our major concern is that the labor market is not in order right now , " brower-rabinowitsch said .
the unemployment figures showed that there were currently " a considerable number " of people who could be employed following further qualification or training . " this situation does not justify germany getting specialized personnel from abroad , " brower-rabinowitsch said , adding that over 200,000 young people have been waiting for apprenticeship training positions for over a year . " we can not take away the industry 's responsibility to train workers , " he said .
" it is their duty to do so . "
brower-rabinowitsch said every time there was economic improvement in germany , the private sector complained of a lack of skilled personnel . " but they neglected to train people in time , " he said . the cdu 's coalition partner , the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , agreed that the private sector had to first do its utmost to accommodate germany 's unemployed . " only when the industry can prove that it is giving long-term unemployed a fair chance with the help of labor market policies can it hope for understanding from political powers , " said ludwig stiegler , deputy head of the spd parliamentary group . immigration is economically necessary german industry has welcomed the idea of opening the labor market earlier than planned to eastern europeans .
analyst holger schäfer from the institute for business research -lrb- iw -rrb- in cologne said a strategy to further train german workers was necessary , but not the sole solution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : skilled personnel from abroad can boost the german economy " we do n't need qualification instead of immigration , " schäfer said .
" we need both . " according to schäfer , immigration was beneficial to the economy .
the majority of immigrant workers wanted to work and generated income .
this resulted in secondary effects for the overall economy . " of course , there are losers , namely those competing for these jobs , " he said .
" but the rest of society wins . " so why is there such opposition to easing restrictions ? " i think the fear of being steamrolled , and possibly a bit of xenophobia , leads to the rejection by german society , " schäfer said .
yet these fears are unfounded .
studies showed that some 200,000 workers per year would come to germany in the first stages .
over a 20-year period , the figure would total two to four million people , he said . " we really have to take leave of this notion that people are going to be lining up to get in , " he said . the think-tank iw is an association whose members include leading employer and economic federations .
it serves the interests of the private sector . benefit of minimum wage disputed there are also fears on the part of the unions that immigrant labor from eastern europe would lead to wage dumping on the german labor market or put pressure on existing wage agreements .
for this reason brower-rabinowitsch said the government needed to introduce a minimum wage before lifting restrictions on foreign workers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : skilled construction workers are becoming hard to find in poland however , schäfer said that wage dumping did not occur when the german labor market opened to southern european workers in the 1980s and that a minimum wage would not help the economy . " a minimum wage would prevent foreign workers from coming to germany , " schäfer said .
" then , there ca n't be any economic benefits from immigration . " poland worried about lack of skilled labor germany is getting support for its concerns from its eastern neighbor .
since eu expansion , polish workers in particular have left their home country to find work in britain and ireland , which have no labor restrictions for new eu states .
a recent study by the warsaw-based market research company arc ryneki i opinia showed that mostly well-educated poles are leaving - and are n't coming back . " this is a threat to polish employers , " jeremi mordasewicz , a labor market expert from the polish employers ' association lewiatan , told the paper financial times deutschland . many companies , especially in the construction sector , were desperately seeking qualified personnel in poland , he said . german government deputy spokesman thomas steg said a decision would most likely be made at the beginning of 2009 if the labor market restrictions would be extended to 2011 . the issue will be discussed at the next cabinet meeting in late august , after the summer break . sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a shortage of skilled labor could hit germany in the next few years , and workers from new eu member states could fill this gap .
yet politicians , unions and industry disagree on relaxing labor market restrictions . the latest unemployment figures for germany , released this week , showed over 3.7 million jobless in july .
yet companies have been saying for months that they can not find enough qualified personnel , for example in the engineering sector and other technical professions . the shortage of skilled labor is expected to continue in the coming years , leading the german labor ministry to suggest easing restrictions on workers from the new eu member states as a way of filling the gap . volker kauder , head of the parliamentary group of the christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- , is not in favor of the change , though .
he said this week that the labor pool had to be better exhausted domestically first .
it should be given priority over an inflow of labor from abroad . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kauder said more needs to be done to favor german workers " this would send the wrong signal , " kauder told the mass circulation daily bild .
" you ca n't on the one hand complain about wage dumping and , at the same time , on a grand scale bring workers to germany from romania and bulgaria , who are willing to work for low wages . " the free movement of labor is one of the fundamental rights guaranteed to eu citizens .
a german wanting to work in france does not face any major bureaucratic hurdles .
but this is not the case for workers from the new eu member states . the accession treaty allowed for transitional measures to protect national labor markets , and germany is one of the few eu nations which forces citizens from the new member states to apply for work permits .
it justifies the restrictions by pointing to its problems with unemployment and the fact that germany 's geographic proximity to the bloc 's new members means it could face more incoming workers than other countries . unions oppose easing restrictions at present , germany 's labor market constraints are in effect until 2009 .
kauder has said they should continue for a further two years , to 2011 .
no further extension is possible after that time , according to eu regulations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a large number of germans are still lining up at the employment office to find a job kauder has received support from the german labor unions , which do n't traditionally side with the conservative cdu .
axel brower-rabinowitsch , spokesman for the confederation of german trade unions dgb , said opening the labor market would not help alleviate unemployment . " our major concern is that the labor market is not in order right now , " brower-rabinowitsch said .
the unemployment figures showed that there were currently " a considerable number " of people who could be employed following further qualification or training . " this situation does not justify germany getting specialized personnel from abroad , " brower-rabinowitsch said , adding that over 200,000 young people have been waiting for apprenticeship training positions for over a year . " we can not take away the industry 's responsibility to train workers , " he said .
" it is their duty to do so . "
brower-rabinowitsch said every time there was economic improvement in germany , the private sector complained of a lack of skilled personnel . " but they neglected to train people in time , " he said . the cdu 's coalition partner , the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , agreed that the private sector had to first do its utmost to accommodate germany 's unemployed . " only when the industry can prove that it is giving long-term unemployed a fair chance with the help of labor market policies can it hope for understanding from political powers , " said ludwig stiegler , deputy head of the spd parliamentary group . immigration is economically necessary german industry has welcomed the idea of opening the labor market earlier than planned to eastern europeans .
analyst holger schäfer from the institute for business research -lrb- iw -rrb- in cologne said a strategy to further train german workers was necessary , but not the sole solution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : skilled personnel from abroad can boost the german economy " we do n't need qualification instead of immigration , " schäfer said .
" we need both . " according to schäfer , immigration was beneficial to the economy .
the majority of immigrant workers wanted to work and generated income .
this resulted in secondary effects for the overall economy . " of course , there are losers , namely those competing for these jobs , " he said .
" but the rest of society wins . " so why is there such opposition to easing restrictions ? " i think the fear of being steamrolled , and possibly a bit of xenophobia , leads to the rejection by german society , " schäfer said .
yet these fears are unfounded .
studies showed that some 200,000 workers per year would come to germany in the first stages .
over a 20-year period , the figure would total two to four million people , he said . " we really have to take leave of this notion that people are going to be lining up to get in , " he said . the think-tank iw is an association whose members include leading employer and economic federations .
it serves the interests of the private sector . benefit of minimum wage disputed there are also fears on the part of the unions that immigrant labor from eastern europe would lead to wage dumping on the german labor market or put pressure on existing wage agreements .
for this reason brower-rabinowitsch said the government needed to introduce a minimum wage before lifting restrictions on foreign workers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : skilled construction workers are becoming hard to find in poland however , schäfer said that wage dumping did not occur when the german labor market opened to southern european workers in the 1980s and that a minimum wage would not help the economy . " a minimum wage would prevent foreign workers from coming to germany , " schäfer said .
" then , there ca n't be any economic benefits from immigration . " poland worried about lack of skilled labor germany is getting support for its concerns from its eastern neighbor .
since eu expansion , polish workers in particular have left their home country to find work in britain and ireland , which have no labor restrictions for new eu states .
a recent study by the warsaw-based market research company arc ryneki i opinia showed that mostly well-educated poles are leaving - and are n't coming back . " this is a threat to polish employers , " jeremi mordasewicz , a labor market expert from the polish employers ' association lewiatan , told the paper financial times deutschland . many companies , especially in the construction sector , were desperately seeking qualified personnel in poland , he said . german government deputy spokesman thomas steg said a decision would most likely be made at the beginning of 2009 if the labor market restrictions would be extended to 2011 . the issue will be discussed at the next cabinet meeting in late august , after the summer break . sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

afghan police reported on july 22 that they had found the bullet-riddled body of one of the men , which was flown back to germany last week .
the autopsy conducted at cologne 's institute for forensic medicine confirmed thursday that the man was shot and killed after suffering from circulatory problems during captivity .
" his kidnappers killed him brutally and ended his life in a criminal way , " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier told afp news agency during a tour of west africa .
" this is deeply shocking .
this crime must not go unpunished . "
foreign ministry spokesman martin jäger said the autopsy showed that the engineer had collapsed before the lethal shots were fired .
a total of six bullet wounds were found in the body .
it had previously been unclear if the man was executed or died as a result of the strain of the situation he was in .
berlin focuses efforts on german hostage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has some 3,000 troops deployed to afghanistan efforts are continuing to free the remaining german in captivity , jäger added .
" now all our efforts must go towards facilitating the release of the remaining german hostage , " steinmeier said .
al jazeera television broadcast a video on tuesday showing the man against a rocky background in a hilly area .
there was no sound on the video , but the channel said the hostage , rudolf b. , had urged the german and us governments to " withdraw their troops from afghanistan " and to help him return to his family .
the german foreign ministry said the video was a deliberate attempt to intimidate .

afghan police reported on july 22 that they had found the bullet-riddled body of one of the men , which was flown back to germany last week .
the autopsy conducted at cologne 's institute for forensic medicine confirmed thursday that the man was shot and killed after suffering from circulatory problems during captivity .
" his kidnappers killed him brutally and ended his life in a criminal way , " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier told afp news agency during a tour of west africa .
" this is deeply shocking .
this crime must not go unpunished . "
foreign ministry spokesman martin jäger said the autopsy showed that the engineer had collapsed before the lethal shots were fired .
a total of six bullet wounds were found in the body .
it had previously been unclear if the man was executed or died as a result of the strain of the situation he was in .

" now all our efforts must go towards facilitating the release of the remaining german hostage , " steinmeier said .
al jazeera television broadcast a video on tuesday showing the man against a rocky background in a hilly area .
there was no sound on the video , but the channel said the hostage , rudolf b. , had urged the german and us governments to " withdraw their troops from afghanistan " and to help him return to his family .
the german foreign ministry said the video was a deliberate attempt to intimidate .
german chancellor angela merkel has said berlin will not give in to the kidnappers ' demands .
a poll taken by german public broadcaster ard showed thursday that 64 percent of germans wanted to see the bundeswehr troops pulled out of afghanistan , an increase of 10 percent compared to last month .

" there are no exceptions to this rule and no justifications for breaking it .
" hostage-taking and the killing of hostages are war crimes and their perpetrators must be brought to justice , " khan added .

a shortage of skilled labor could hit germany in the next few years , and workers from new eu member states could fill this gap .
yet politicians , unions and industry disagree on relaxing labor market restrictions . the latest unemployment figures for germany , released this week , showed over 3.7 million jobless in july .
yet companies have been saying for months that they can not find enough qualified personnel , for example in the engineering sector and other technical professions . the shortage of skilled labor is expected to continue in the coming years , leading the german labor ministry to suggest easing restrictions on workers from the new eu member states as a way of filling the gap . volker kauder , head of the parliamentary group of the christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- , is not in favor of the change , though .
he said this week that the labor pool had to be better exhausted domestically first .
it should be given priority over an inflow of labor from abroad . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kauder said more needs to be done to favor german workers " this would send the wrong signal , " kauder told the mass circulation daily bild .
" you ca n't on the one hand complain about wage dumping and , at the same time , on a grand scale bring workers to germany from romania and bulgaria , who are willing to work for low wages . " the free movement of labor is one of the fundamental rights guaranteed to eu citizens .
a german wanting to work in france does not face any major bureaucratic hurdles .
but this is not the case for workers from the new eu member states . the accession treaty allowed for transitional measures to protect national labor markets , and germany is one of the few eu nations which forces citizens from the new member states to apply for work permits .
it justifies the restrictions by pointing to its problems with unemployment and the fact that germany 's geographic proximity to the bloc 's new members means it could face more incoming workers than other countries . unions oppose easing restrictions at present , germany 's labor market constraints are in effect until 2009 .
kauder has said they should continue for a further two years , to 2011 .
no further extension is possible after that time , according to eu regulations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a large number of germans are still lining up at the employment office to find a job kauder has received support from the german labor unions , which do n't traditionally side with the conservative cdu .
axel brower-rabinowitsch , spokesman for the confederation of german trade unions dgb , said opening the labor market would not help alleviate unemployment . " our major concern is that the labor market is not in order right now , " brower-rabinowitsch said .
the unemployment figures showed that there were currently " a considerable number " of people who could be employed following further qualification or training . " this situation does not justify germany getting specialized personnel from abroad , " brower-rabinowitsch said , adding that over 200,000 young people have been waiting for apprenticeship training positions for over a year . " we can not take away the industry 's responsibility to train workers , " he said .
" it is their duty to do so . "
brower-rabinowitsch said every time there was economic improvement in germany , the private sector complained of a lack of skilled personnel . " but they neglected to train people in time , " he said . the cdu 's coalition partner , the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , agreed that the private sector had to first do its utmost to accommodate germany 's unemployed . " only when the industry can prove that it is giving long-term unemployed a fair chance with the help of labor market policies can it hope for understanding from political powers , " said ludwig stiegler , deputy head of the spd parliamentary group . immigration is economically necessary german industry has welcomed the idea of opening the labor market earlier than planned to eastern europeans .
analyst holger schäfer from the institute for business research -lrb- iw -rrb- in cologne said a strategy to further train german workers was necessary , but not the sole solution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : skilled personnel from abroad can boost the german economy " we do n't need qualification instead of immigration , " schäfer said .
" we need both . " according to schäfer , immigration was beneficial to the economy .
the majority of immigrant workers wanted to work and generated income .
this resulted in secondary effects for the overall economy . " of course , there are losers , namely those competing for these jobs , " he said .
" but the rest of society wins . " so why is there such opposition to easing restrictions ? " i think the fear of being steamrolled , and possibly a bit of xenophobia , leads to the rejection by german society , " schäfer said .
yet these fears are unfounded .
studies showed that some 200,000 workers per year would come to germany in the first stages .
over a 20-year period , the figure would total two to four million people , he said . " we really have to take leave of this notion that people are going to be lining up to get in , " he said . the think-tank iw is an association whose members include leading employer and economic federations .
it serves the interests of the private sector . benefit of minimum wage disputed there are also fears on the part of the unions that immigrant labor from eastern europe would lead to wage dumping on the german labor market or put pressure on existing wage agreements .
for this reason brower-rabinowitsch said the government needed to introduce a minimum wage before lifting restrictions on foreign workers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : skilled construction workers are becoming hard to find in poland however , schäfer said that wage dumping did not occur when the german labor market opened to southern european workers in the 1980s and that a minimum wage would not help the economy . " a minimum wage would prevent foreign workers from coming to germany , " schäfer said .
" then , there ca n't be any economic benefits from immigration . " poland worried about lack of skilled labor germany is getting support for its concerns from its eastern neighbor .
since eu expansion , polish workers in particular have left their home country to find work in britain and ireland , which have no labor restrictions for new eu states .
a recent study by the warsaw-based market research company arc ryneki i opinia showed that mostly well-educated poles are leaving - and are n't coming back . " this is a threat to polish employers , " jeremi mordasewicz , a labor market expert from the polish employers ' association lewiatan , told the paper financial times deutschland . many companies , especially in the construction sector , were desperately seeking qualified personnel in poland , he said . german government deputy spokesman thomas steg said a decision would most likely be made at the beginning of 2009 if the labor market restrictions would be extended to 2011 . the issue will be discussed at the next cabinet meeting in late august , after the summer break . sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this resulted in secondary effects for the overall economy . " of course , there are losers , namely those competing for these jobs , " he said .
" but the rest of society wins . " so why is there such opposition to easing restrictions ? " i think the fear of being steamrolled , and possibly a bit of xenophobia , leads to the rejection by german society , " schäfer said .
yet these fears are unfounded .
studies showed that some 200,000 workers per year would come to germany in the first stages .
over a 20-year period , the figure would total two to four million people , he said . " we really have to take leave of this notion that people are going to be lining up to get in , " he said . the think-tank iw is an association whose members include leading employer and economic federations .
it serves the interests of the private sector . benefit of minimum wage disputed there are also fears on the part of the unions that immigrant labor from eastern europe would lead to wage dumping on the german labor market or put pressure on existing wage agreements .
for this reason brower-rabinowitsch said the government needed to introduce a minimum wage before lifting restrictions on foreign workers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : skilled construction workers are becoming hard to find in poland however , schäfer said that wage dumping did not occur when the german labor market opened to southern european workers in the 1980s and that a minimum wage would not help the economy . " a minimum wage would prevent foreign workers from coming to germany , " schäfer said .
" then , there ca n't be any economic benefits from immigration . " poland worried about lack of skilled labor germany is getting support for its concerns from its eastern neighbor .
since eu expansion , polish workers in particular have left their home country to find work in britain and ireland , which have no labor restrictions for new eu states .
a recent study by the warsaw-based market research company arc ryneki i opinia showed that mostly well-educated poles are leaving - and are n't coming back . " this is a threat to polish employers , " jeremi mordasewicz , a labor market expert from the polish employers ' association lewiatan , told the paper financial times deutschland . many companies , especially in the construction sector , were desperately seeking qualified personnel in poland , he said . german government deputy spokesman thomas steg said a decision would most likely be made at the beginning of 2009 if the labor market restrictions would be extended to 2011 . the issue will be discussed at the next cabinet meeting in late august , after the summer break . sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

these kids are more likely to suffer from weight problems than their peers from better situated families . an extensive study on child nutrition has revealed that germany 's long-term unemployed can not offer their families a well-balanced diet . " it 's hardly possible for these welfare recipients to feed their children healthy food , " said mathilde kersting from the research institute for child nutrition -lrb- fke -rrb- in dortmund . children in families getting long-term unemployment welfare , known as hartz iv , are n't going hungry .
but they are not eating the right types of food , kersting said . the study showed that the welfare payments had a daily allowance for food and beverages for children of 2.57 euros -lrb- $ 3.50 -rrb- and for teenagers over 14 years 3.42 euros . but , kersting said , even if families shopped at discount supermarkets , an average of 4.68 euros per day was necessary to still the appetite of a growing teenager with a balanced diet .

but simply more money was not the answer . " it 's also important to convince these groups of the use of a well-balanced diet , " kersting said .
" we have to develop simple measures which can be implemented so that our nutritional information can reach these families better than it does up to now . " fke researchers compiled the prices of over 80 kinds of food which are necessary for a healthy diet .
they then calculated the costs for an optimized mixed diet - a concept developed by fke which aims to ensure healthy nutrition for children and teenagers at comparatively low costs . germany needs to improve its childcare system in a separate study , the konrad adenauer foundation found that children from less-educated families were less likely to attend a nursery school . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : early childhood daycare is not adequate in germany , a study shows the problems children from all levels of society faced were the same , though .
the country needed to do much more to ensure adequate care for small children , the study on early childhood education and care in germany revealed . co-author ilse wehrmann said daycare workers and nursery teachers needed to be better trained to adequately care for children under the age of three .
germany was 15 to 20 years behind its european neighbors in this aspect and had a lot of catching up to do , wehrmann said . " they can not even diagnose developmental disorders among small children , " wehrmann said at the presentation of the study in berlin on wednesday . german family minister ursula von der leyen has pushed through new childcare policies to significantly increase the number of daycare spots for young children in the next five years .

grass , who grew up in what is now the polish city of gdansk , has been a prominent leftist and pacifist for many years .

his nazi past has shadowed his work , though many supporters claim his anti-semitism was opportunistic - a theory that raphael gross refutes in his book , now available in english for the first time .

2007 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : terezia mora " day in day out , " terezia mora 's debut novel , tells the story of abel nema , a linguistically talented balkan refugee .

" so in an economic sense , it 's worthwhile for everyone to invest in a healthy diet , " kersting said . increased awareness is also necessary the fke said it recommended that benefit payments be reviewed .
but simply more money was not the answer . " it 's also important to convince these groups of the use of a well-balanced diet , " kersting said .
" we have to develop simple measures which can be implemented so that our nutritional information can reach these families better than it does up to now . " fke researchers compiled the prices of over 80 kinds of food which are necessary for a healthy diet .
they then calculated the costs for an optimized mixed diet - a concept developed by fke which aims to ensure healthy nutrition for children and teenagers at comparatively low costs . germany needs to improve its childcare system in a separate study , the konrad adenauer foundation found that children from less-educated families were less likely to attend a nursery school . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : early childhood daycare is not adequate in germany , a study shows the problems children from all levels of society faced were the same , though .

the efforts are a bid to make it easier for mothers to work and to reverse the declining birthrate . child groups in daycare facilities were also frequently too large , the foundation said . article based on news reports -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they said holidaymakers did not come to wales to " sit on the beach " , so tourism was not entirely " weather dependent " .
many visitors had booked their breaks in advance and were not put off coming to wales , despite flooding in some parts of the country .
however , some businesses and seaside resorts may have been hit , they warned .
wales saw its second wettest july on record , with some parts of powys and the vale of glamorgan among areas hit by flooding . "
nine out of ten people who visit wales come from within the united kingdom , so they know what to expect from the weather " welsh assembly government spokesperson but according to julian burrell , the chairman of the wales tourism alliance , the downpours did not deter the majority of visitors .
he said : " tourism in wales has changed quite a lot over the years , we 're no longer quite as weather-dependent as we used to be .
" people are n't coming here just to sit on the beach , they 're going mountain biking and activities such as that . "
tourists who had booked before the bad weather had still come to wales and managed to enjoy themselves , he said .
" the coastal towns may have found it more difficult , " he said .
" on the other hand , even in those circumstances , if people ca n't go to the beach they 'll go somewhere else .
" the undercover attractions have probably done very well . "
and mr burrell added that those businesses which had been affected would " bounce back pretty quickly " .
he said : " the tourism industry has always been very resilient here in wales . "
gary davies , the regional strategy director of the south west wales tourism partnership , reported a " mixed picture " .
he said : " the bad spell of weather has hit certainly some of the seaside resorts and some of the activities that you simply could n't partake in .
" having said that , the operators of the businesses who actually have advanced bookings and take deposits have not recorded any huge cancellations .
" some of the biggest self-service holiday cottages agencies are telling us that business has been exceptionally good .
but he added : " i certainly do n't want to suggest that the weather has n't put off a lot of day visitors and people who would go to the seaside if it 's a nice day . "
mr davies said although some attractions had had fewer visitors , those that came spent more money .
' changeable weather ' the spending by those who visited shops , attractions and ate out was in some areas " booming " .
he added : " in the towy valley and llandeilo in the last couple of weeks it 's been difficult to get a table unless you book a week in advance .
" day visitors and seaside resorts will pick up .
let 's hope we have a spell of sustained good weather . "
a welsh assembly government spokesperson said : " nine out of 10 people who visit wales come from within the united kingdom , so they know what to expect from the weather .
" our visitors are well aware of the changeable weather and choose to holiday here for our superb heritage and history , iconic attractions and stunning countryside , landscape and coastlines , which we would n't have without our climate . "

wales saw its second wettest july on record , with some parts of powys and the vale of glamorgan among areas hit by flooding .
nine out of ten people who visit wales come from within the united kingdom , so they know what to expect from the weather welsh assembly government spokesperson but according to julian burrell , the chairman of the wales tourism alliance , the downpours did not deter the majority of visitors .
he said : " tourism in wales has changed quite a lot over the years , we 're no longer quite as weather-dependent as we used to be .
" people are n't coming here just to sit on the beach , they 're going mountain biking and activities such as that . "
tourists who had booked before the bad weather had still come to wales and managed to enjoy themselves , he said .
" the coastal towns may have found it more difficult , " he said .
the sun shone in time for aberaeron 's 200th birthday celebration " on the other hand , even in those circumstances , if people ca n't go to the beach they 'll go somewhere else .
" the undercover attractions have probably done very well . "
and mr burrell added that those businesses which had been affected would " bounce back pretty quickly " .
he said : " the tourism industry has always been very resilient here in wales . "
gary davies , the regional strategy director of the south west wales tourism partnership , reported a " mixed picture " .
he said : " the bad spell of weather has hit certainly some of the seaside resorts and some of the activities that you simply could n't partake in .
" having said that , the operators of the businesses who actually have advanced bookings and take deposits have not recorded any huge cancellations .
" some of the biggest self-service holiday cottages agencies are telling us that business has been exceptionally good .
but he added : " i certainly do n't want to suggest that the weather has n't put off a lot of day visitors and people who would go to the seaside if it 's a nice day . "
mr davies said although some attractions had had fewer visitors , those that came spent more money .
' changeable weather ' the spending by those who visited shops , attractions and ate out was in some areas " booming " .
he added : " in the towy valley and llandeilo in the last couple of weeks it 's been difficult to get a table unless you book a week in advance .
" day visitors and seaside resorts will pick up .
let 's hope we have a spell of sustained good weather . "
a welsh assembly government spokesperson said : " nine out of 10 people who visit wales come from within the united kingdom , so they know what to expect from the weather .
" our visitors are well aware of the changeable weather and choose to holiday here for our superb heritage and history , iconic attractions and stunning countryside , landscape and coastlines , which we would n't have without our climate . "

draft guidance from the national institute for health and clinical excellence -lrb- nice -rrb- says orencia is not a cost-effective option for the nhs .

we simply can not accept that individuals should be denied the chance of at least regaining some quality of life " ailsa bosworth national rheumatoid arthritis society rheumatoid arthritis is a painful and often crippling disease which occurs when the immune system attacks the joints , causing swelling and damage of cartilage and bone .
the national rheumatoid arthritis society estimates that around 40,000 people in the uk have severe rheumatoid arthritis .
of these around 30 % fail to respond to the standard treatment - drugs called anti-tnfs .
the drugs makers , bristol-myers squibb , estimate the number of people who could benefit to be lower - but at more than 3,500 , still significant .
unpalatable choices ailsa bosworth , chief executive of nras , said it would be wrong to deny this group the option of taking orencia -lrb- technical name : abatacept -rrb- .
she said they would be faced with taking treatments which had already failed them , palliative care , or taking large doses of steroids which can have side effects such as osteoporosis when used in the long term .
she said patients who failed to respond to orencia could stop taking it quickly , keeping cost to a minimum .
" we simply can not accept that individuals should be denied the chance of at least regaining some quality of life and condemning them to a life of pain and disability , which could be equally as expensive to the nhs . "
a nice spokeswoman said an independent advisory committee had decided the drug was not a cost effective option after carrying out a detailed assessment .
the draft nice guidance is now open to consultation .
final guidance is not expected until the end of the year .
an austrian study published in the lancet in june found orencia - and two other similar drugs called mabthera , tocilizumab - slowed progression of the rheumatoid arthritis and reduced symptoms .
the drugs work by targeting the immune system , but have side effects , including an increased vulnerability to infections .

it said much has been learnt from recent pilots , but added that " there is little merit " in holding more .
thirteen pilots were held during may 's local elections in england .
election minister michael wills said pilots were important for developing services that were " efficient , effective , empowering and responsive " .
the commission examined electronic voting , voting in advance of polling day , electronic counting and signing for ballot papers at the polling station .
the purpose of pilots is to learn lessons for the future and we will do so michael wills election modernisation minister the security of the voting process " needed to be strengthened " through a system of individual registration , it said .
concerns were raised about low public confidence in the security of internet and phone voting , accessibility , and technical difficulties .
the commission called on the government to publish a strategy for modernising the electoral process - including changes to improve security .
' piecemeal piloting ' it recommended that there should be improvements to testing and implementation of electronic voting and electronic counting .
further pilots for voting in advance of polling day were not necessary .
commission chief executive peter wardle said : " we have learnt a good deal from pilots over the past few years .
" but we do not see any merit in continuing with small-scale , piecemeal piloting where similar innovations are explored each year without sufficient planning and implementation time , and in the absence of any clear direction , or likelihood of new insights . "
he welcomed recent government proposals on constitutional reform , with the hope that they would include modernising elections .
among may 's pilots , there were technical difficulties with electronic counting in breckland , stratford-on avon and warwick which prompted it to be abandoned in favour of traditional manual counting .
we believe this technology is not appropriate for public elections , and now is the time for a public debate open rights group the commission said the problems were mainly a result of limited testing and insufficient planning prior to the election - and recommended a minimum of six months for implementation .
mr wills said the ministry of justice would study the electoral commission 's report .
" these evaluations point to instances where e-counting and e-voting have worked well , and where electors choose to vote remotely by internet or telephone they often had favourable responses to these innovations , " he said .
" the purpose of pilots is to learn lessons for the future and we will do so . "
despite the commission saying security needed to be " strengthened " , mr will said : " we are pleased that the evaluations point to a high level of system security and user confidence in e-voting systems tested and that the security and integrity of the polls was not compromised .
" we have also made considerable improvements to security of elections more widely . "
a group that campaigns against the introduction of electronic voting said it welcomed the commission 's call to stop further pilots but was disappointed it did not go further .
the open rights group -lrb- org -rrb- said : " the government does not seem to be learning the lessons of previous pilots .

commission chief executive peter wardle said : " we have learnt a good deal from pilots over the past few years .
" but we do not see any merit in continuing with small-scale , piecemeal piloting where similar innovations are explored each year without sufficient planning and implementation time , and in the absence of any clear direction , or likelihood of new insights . "
he welcomed recent government proposals on constitutional reform , with the hope that they would include modernising elections .
among may 's pilots , there were technical difficulties with electronic counting in breckland , stratford-on avon and warwick which prompted it to be abandoned in favour of traditional manual counting .
we believe this technology is not appropriate for public elections , and now is the time for a public debate open rights group the commission said the problems were mainly a result of limited testing and insufficient planning prior to the election - and recommended a minimum of six months for implementation .
mr wills said the ministry of justice would study the electoral commission 's report .
" these evaluations point to instances where e-counting and e-voting have worked well , and where electors choose to vote remotely by internet or telephone they often had favourable responses to these innovations , " he said .
" the purpose of pilots is to learn lessons for the future and we will do so . "
despite the commission saying security needed to be " strengthened " , mr will said : " we are pleased that the evaluations point to a high level of system security and user confidence in e-voting systems tested and that the security and integrity of the polls was not compromised .
" we have also made considerable improvements to security of elections more widely . "

but the roof is on the building and the authority said it was hopeful the work could be back on schedule within weeks .
the former cafe at the summit of the highest peak in england and wales was once described by prince charles as " wales ' highest slum " .
the hafod eryri visitor 's centre is being built at a cost of £ 8.35m.
the café sited 3,500 ft -lrb- 1,067m -rrb- above sea level and weather conditions there can often be more extreme than at lower altitudes .
the snowdonia national park authority said the bad weather earlier this summer had made the building work difficult at times , and it has praised the work of the construction staff as " heroic " .
it said strong winds during july had slowed down efforts to put on the roof , to the extent that by the end of the month the construction schedule was around two weeks behind .

the rapid influx of chinese migrant workers and their dramatic impact on the labour market have caught italy off guard - particularly in the northern industrial heartland .
culture clash prato , italy 's main textile manufacturing city , is at the heart of a culture clash which is transforming the way the textile industry operates .
chinese migrants have been pouring into prato to work in the city 's thousands of factories , warehouses and sweatshops that supply the cloth and yarns to the italian fashion industry . "
many of the chinese here are ' clandestini ' - illegal " francesco nannucci , the head of investigations , prato police today prato has the largest chinese community in the country - about 25,000 people , nearly 15 % of the city 's population .
and the authorities are worried .
" many of the chinese here are ' clandestini ' - illegal .
we have big difficulties catching them .
and since they arrived , crime in the city has risen , " says francesco nannucci , the head of investigations at the prato police .
the police patrol prato 's chinatown every day - an area full of chinese shops , services and restaurants .
nearly all of them have sprung up in the last few years .
on one raid , ten undocumented chinese workers were discovered in a side-street sweatshop , machine-sewing clothes .
there was a child present , beds , a bathroom and a kitchen .
they slept , cooked , worked and brought up their children in this small warehouse .
global transformation up to a third of italy 's chinese immigrants could be illegal .
but it 's not only that fact preoccupying the authorities : it is how they work .
they are transforming the way the textile industry in italy operates and bringing globalisation to a reluctant italian market .
in the industrial zones on the edges of prato , thousands of chinese are employed in the city 's factories and warehouses - many of them now owned by chinese bosses .
most of them come from one city in china , wenzhou , in the province of zhejiang , just south of shanghai - also a textile manufacturing region .
they come to italy in one of two ways : by being smuggled here by criminal gangs or by arriving as tourists and overstaying their visas . "
many italians blame them -lrb- the chinese -rrb- for their economic problems " marco romagnoli , mayor of prato prato - along with rome , naples and milan - are the target cities .
it 's where the work is and where there are established chinese networks to absorb newcomers .
" my whole family is here : my uncle , aunt , mother , father and sister , " 18-year-old cheng explains , standing amongst racks of thousands of t-shirts , skirts , trousers and dresses .
" we work very hard , " he boasts .
" sometimes day and night ! "
pronto moda in the workshop at the back of the warehouse cheng and his family toil away to produce these clothes in as short a time as possible , as cheaply as possible .
they can undercut the prices - and the wages - of their italian counterparts .
they may be paid as little as 2 euros an hour -lrb- £ 1.50 -rrb- , and 20 dresses might be produced for only 150 euros wholesale .
the clothes are bought by sellers from all over italy and the rest of europe .
prato has become a main distribution centre for what is called " pronto moda " or " fast fashion " .
this is a chinese invention : ' made in italy ' goods produced under chinese conditions .
prato has also become a centre for the import of cheap clothing from china itself .
hard times over the last decade italy has suffered some hard economic knocks . "
i fear that what happened in milan could happen here in prato " carlo longo , chairman , prato confederation of industrialists in prato one-tenth of its traditional companies have folded and one in ten workers have lost their jobs .
the mayor of prato , marco romagnoli , is worried .
" the chinese are such a strong , close-knit community and our two cultures are very different .
many italians blame them for economic problems .
and as the chinese get richer they are buying up large chunks of our textile sector - using their ties with china to become even more powerful . "
business leaders blame italy 's high labour costs , the strong euro and weak dollar , for a dramatic drop in exports and productivity .
but they also blame the chinese migrants flooding into italy 's factories .
" everybody underestimated the impact of this .
socially it 's a disaster .
the chinese do n't mix with us or speak the language .
it 's been a shock , " says carlo longo , an italian yarn entrepreneur and chairman of the confederation of industrialists in prato .
" we have to allocate a lot of resources for the chinese in the city .
and many of them work ' black ' - they do n't pay taxes or contribute to the costs of the city .
my colleagues resent having to stick to the rules when the chinese do n't . "
" what happens in prato , " he adds , " is a yardstick for all italy .
i fear that what happened in milan could happen here in prato . "
growing tensions in april this year violent clashes took place in milan 's chinatown between the chinese clothing merchants there and the italian residents and police .
this is the first time there 'd been clashes like this in italy and they set the country on edge .
daniele cologna , a milanese academic and expert on the chinese in italy , explains why tensions are growing .
" the chinese are now much more visible in italy .
they are opening up more of their own businesses .
they want to be successful and earn well .
and they are benefiting from china 's new global status .
" the italians feel threatened by them . "
positive signs but there are some positive signs of how cultural harmony can be created out of a culture clash .
the textile company " giupel " is famous in prato for its chinese boss - 42 year old xu qui lin , who likes to be called " signor giulini " .
he emigrated to italy in 1990 , started off as a waiter in florence , became a textile worker in prato , then bought his own company in prato in 2000 .
he 's respected for paying his taxes and sticking to the rules - something he tries to encourage the other chinese in prato to do .
" i developed a model which other businesses are now copying : i employ both italians and chinese and they work together . "
" i also employ 300 chinese in my factory back in china .
that way i keep costs down .
and i concentrate on quality , " he says proudly .
this summer italy 's economy also showed some positive signs .
its fashion and textile entrepreneurs were rewarded with their first good news in years : sales are up 3 % over the year , and orders are up by 31 % ..
the industry has had a tough lesson to learn .
to succeed it must embrace china , restructure , innovate , downsize and outsource - but also stick to italian quality and craftsmanship .
" made in italy " but sometimes " made in italy by chinese " .

the rapid influx of chinese migrant workers and their dramatic impact on the labour market have caught italy off guard - particularly in the northern industrial heartland .
culture clash prato , italy 's main textile manufacturing city , is at the heart of a culture clash which is transforming the way the textile industry operates .
chinese migrants have been pouring into prato to work in the city 's thousands of factories , warehouses and sweatshops that supply the cloth and yarns to the italian fashion industry .
many of the chinese here are ' clandestini ' - illegal francesco nannucci , the head of investigations , prato police today prato has the largest chinese community in the country - about 25,000 people , nearly 15 % of the city 's population .
and the authorities are worried .
" many of the chinese here are ' clandestini ' - illegal .
we have big difficulties catching them .
and since they arrived , crime in the city has risen , " says francesco nannucci , the head of investigations at the prato police .
milan 's chinatown holds examples of the merging cultures the police patrol prato 's chinatown every day - an area full of chinese shops , services and restaurants .
nearly all of them have sprung up in the last few years .
on one raid , ten undocumented chinese workers were discovered in a side-street sweatshop , machine-sewing clothes .
there was a child present , beds , a bathroom and a kitchen .
they slept , cooked , worked and brought up their children in this small warehouse .
global transformation up to a third of italy 's chinese immigrants could be illegal .
a chinese factory worker in the giupel textile factory but it 's not only that fact preoccupying the authorities : it is how they work .
they are transforming the way the textile industry in italy operates and bringing globalisation to a reluctant italian market .
in the industrial zones on the edges of prato , thousands of chinese are employed in the city 's factories and warehouses - many of them now owned by chinese bosses .
most of them come from one city in china , wenzhou , in the province of zhejiang , just south of shanghai - also a textile manufacturing region .
they come to italy in one of two ways : by being smuggled here by criminal gangs or by arriving as tourists and overstaying their visas .
many italians blame them -lrb- the chinese -rrb- for their economic problems marco romagnoli , mayor of prato prato - along with rome , naples and milan - are the target cities .
it 's where the work is and where there are established chinese networks to absorb newcomers .
" my whole family is here : my uncle , aunt , mother , father and sister , " 18-year-old cheng explains , standing amongst racks of thousands of t-shirts , skirts , trousers and dresses .
" we work very hard , " he boasts .
" sometimes day and night ! "
pronto moda in the workshop at the back of the warehouse cheng and his family toil away to produce these clothes in as short a time as possible , as cheaply as possible .
they can undercut the prices - and the wages - of their italian counterparts .
they may be paid as little as 2 euros an hour -lrb- £ 1.50 -rrb- , and 20 dresses might be produced for only 150 euros wholesale .
the clothes are bought by sellers from all over italy and the rest of europe .
prato has become a main distribution centre for what is called " pronto moda " or " fast fashion " .
this is a chinese invention : ' made in italy ' goods produced under chinese conditions .
prato has also become a centre for the import of cheap clothing from china itself .
hard times over the last decade italy has suffered some hard economic knocks .
i fear that what happened in milan could happen here in prato carlo longo , chairman , prato confederation of industrialists in prato one-tenth of its traditional companies have folded and one in ten workers have lost their jobs .
the mayor of prato , marco romagnoli , is worried .
" the chinese are such a strong , close-knit community and our two cultures are very different .
many italians blame them for economic problems .
and as the chinese get richer they are buying up large chunks of our textile sector - using their ties with china to become even more powerful . "
business leaders blame italy 's high labour costs , the strong euro and weak dollar , for a dramatic drop in exports and productivity .
but they also blame the chinese migrants flooding into italy 's factories .
" everybody underestimated the impact of this .
socially it 's a disaster .
the chinese do n't mix with us or speak the language .
it 's been a shock , " says carlo longo , an italian yarn entrepreneur and chairman of the confederation of industrialists in prato .
" we have to allocate a lot of resources for the chinese in the city .
and many of them work ' black ' - they do n't pay taxes or contribute to the costs of the city .
my colleagues resent having to stick to the rules when the chinese do n't . "
" what happens in prato , " he adds , " is a yardstick for all italy .
i fear that what happened in milan could happen here in prato . "
growing tensions in april this year violent clashes took place in milan 's chinatown between the chinese clothing merchants there and the italian residents and police .
designer clothing shops adorns the galleria milan this is the first time there 'd been clashes like this in italy and they set the country on edge .
daniele cologna , a milanese academic and expert on the chinese in italy , explains why tensions are growing .
" the chinese are now much more visible in italy .
they are opening up more of their own businesses .
they want to be successful and earn well .
and they are benefiting from china 's new global status .
" the italians feel threatened by them . "
positive signs but there are some positive signs of how cultural harmony can be created out of a culture clash .
the textile company " giupel " is famous in prato for its chinese boss - 42 year old xu qui lin , who likes to be called " signor giulini " .
he emigrated to italy in 1990 , started off as a waiter in florence , became a textile worker in prato , then bought his own company in prato in 2000 .
he 's respected for paying his taxes and sticking to the rules - something he tries to encourage the other chinese in prato to do .
" i developed a model which other businesses are now copying : i employ both italians and chinese and they work together . "
" i also employ 300 chinese in my factory back in china .
that way i keep costs down .
and i concentrate on quality , " he says proudly .
this summer italy 's economy also showed some positive signs .
its fashion and textile entrepreneurs were rewarded with their first good news in years : sales are up 3 % over the year , and orders are up by 31 % ..
the industry has had a tough lesson to learn .
to succeed it must embrace china , restructure , innovate , downsize and outsource - but also stick to italian quality and craftsmanship .
" made in italy " but sometimes " made in italy by chinese " .

locals in the village of silverstone , northants , have expressed their concern at the scale of the plans to upgrade the track and surrounding land .
members of the british racing drivers ' club who own the track , have backed the scheme , which could help secure the future of the british grand prix .
residents said the proposals would impact on the village 's infrastructure .
david crowther , silverstone parish councillor , told bbc news : " we 're obviously worried about the impact that it will have on silverstone village .
" it 's a small village of about 800 dwellings , just under 2000 people .
" we would be very worried about the impact it would have on the infrastructure of the village , which we feel has probably grown to about as large as it actually can manage . "

analysis by nick assinder political correspondent , bbc news website a few weeks ago when anyone asked whether gordon brown would hold a snap election in the autumn the answer was invariably " why would he " .
gordon brown would need to boost labour 's election funds ask the same question today and the answer may very well be " why would n't he " .
indeed , according to the mirror 's reports of a leaked memo from new labour 's chief strategist , lord gould , it is something mr brown is considering .
the memo , written before mr brown became prime minister , reveals much of the style and approach mr brown has brought to the job was mapped out long beforehand and he appears to have pretty much stuck to the plan .
the key section , which has added to early-election fever , states : " we have to have a strategy of audacious advance .
the best way of achieving this is to hold an early election after a short period of intense and compelling activity .
a kind of ' shock and awe strategy ' blasting through the opposition and blasting us to the mid-40 per-cents . "
it comes form the same man who wrote the memo saying tony blair should leave downing street with the crowds begging for more and it seems to accurately predict precisely what is now happening .
the tories are distracting themselves with a bout of internal sniping and blood-letting as david cameron 's opinion poll ratings slide .
autumn poll risks meanwhile the " new " prime minister is enjoying a predicted bounce in the polls and is offering what appears to be a popular , more serious and less glitzy approach to leadership and just that period of " intense and compelling activity " .
if britain went to the polls today , a fourth labour victory with around double the current majority is what the current opinion surveys suggest as the likely outcome .
so , after a good summer holiday during which , knowing mr brown , he will never stop calculating and planning , could he return in september and , shortly afterwards , spring a general election ?
it may look enticing , but there are some real risks in going for an autumn poll .
there are historical examples of prime ministers either going early or waiting , and suffering as a result - labour 's clem atlee in 1951 -lrb- early -rrb- and jim callaghan in 1979 -lrb- late -rrb- and the tories ' ted heath in 1974 -lrb- early -rrb- .
but they probably do n't offer any real insights - other than how unpredictable this game is - as conditions are always entirely different .
begging bowls so mr brown will be calculating from scratch .
and one of the first obstacles is the relatively mundane yet vital issue of cash .
labour is currently some £ 26 million in the red and , thanks to the cash-for-honours affair , donors have been reluctant to cough up .
that black cloud may be passing , and party officials are already out and about with their begging bowls .
one way or another , should gordon go for it , the money would be there .
and if the campaign was genuinely limited to three weeks , with fewer hugely expensive stunts and more soap box campaigning , that may be a welcome change from a party committed to getting back in touch with the voters .
similarly , there are problems getting the local and national party machines , currently stripped back to the bone , in fighting shape .
that too is not an insurmountable problem but could give mr brown 's party advisers reason to urge a delay until next spring - still seen as the most likely time for an early election .
the autumn would all be a bit of a scramble .
david cameron had his own ' bounce ' when he became tory leader but then , putting the case for the autumn , there is the simple fact that the bounce may just stop .
this sort of political honeymoon is pretty fragile and can be based almost entirely on simply having a new face on the tv every night - david cameron experienced an almost identical bounce after his election in 2005 .
mr brown could take advantage of the bounce while being able to claim it was only right and proper that the british people should have their say on their new prime minister .
and , let 's face it , even if he " bounced " to victory that would not lessen the five-year mandate he would have .
either way , what mr brown almost certainly will not want to do is wait until the last moment , by which time all room for manoeuvre is closed off .
four year tradition the actual deadline for the next election is summer 2010 , although recent tradition from both parties suggest the " normal " time for an election would be may 2009 .
but even that may be leaving it a bit late for mr brown , who might well expect to have lost a bit of bounce by then .
if he is a worrier , mr brown might fear not just the tories but that " events " may have overwhelmed the government .
it would also mean that unlike most pms he would have spent the first two years in office preparing for an election rather than transforming the country in his desired direction .
so spring next year looks on the face of it to be the best option - but clearly there are arguments for and against all the different dates and the pm knows the virtues of keeping your opponents guessing .

mr brown could take advantage of the bounce while being able to claim it was only right and proper that the british people should have their say on their new prime minister .
and , let 's face it , even if he " bounced " to victory that would not lessen the five-year mandate he would have .
either way , what mr brown almost certainly will not want to do is wait until the last moment , by which time all room for manoeuvre is closed off .
four year tradition the actual deadline for the next election is summer 2010 , although recent tradition from both parties suggest the " normal " time for an election would be may 2009 .
but even that may be leaving it a bit late for mr brown , who might well expect to have lost a bit of bounce by then .
if he is a worrier , mr brown might fear not just the tories but that " events " may have overwhelmed the government .
it would also mean that unlike most pms he would have spent the first two years in office preparing for an election rather than transforming the country in his desired direction .
so spring next year looks on the face of it to be the best option - but clearly there are arguments for and against all the different dates and the pm knows the virtues of keeping your opponents guessing .
